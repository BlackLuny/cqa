This was a conventional term of endearment in medieval romantic poetry, and as early as the 13th century it is also regularly found as a female personal name. <br>  <br>  2) English: metonymic occupational name for a miller or flour merchant, or perhaps a nickname for a pasty-faced person, from Middle English flo(u)r ‘flour’. This is in origin the same word as in 1, with the transferred sense ‘flower, pick of the meal’. Although the two words are now felt to be accidental homophones, they were not distinguished in spelling before the 18th century. <br>  <br>  3) English: occupational name for an arrowsmith, from an agent derivative of Middle English flo ‘arrow’ (Old English fla). <br>  <br>  4) Welsh: Anglicized form of the Welsh personal name Llywarch, of unexplained origin. <br>  <br>  5) Translation of French Lafleur. <br>  <br>  Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-508137-4<br>  <br>  <br>  I went on a surname search.

YjOjWU0Jaa	-In the first stanza, the beginning of the third line is a bit awkward.  The first words are "I think", and starting with that takes the focus away from the emotions, which I assume are what you want people to focus on while reading.  Saying "thinking that I have a chance" would work better (in my opinion) because it continues the disconnect from yourself as the acting force (e.g. the indirect approach save for "the wind blows" which seems like it should be the only direct actor to keep focus on it) that seems to dominate that first stanza.<br>  -Good idea with the s alliteration in the third stanza.  It creates the imagery of a leaking tire or balloon, and the next word happens to be "Depression."  Clever lead-in.<br>  -Fourth stanza has a grammatical error: and the the wind blows<br>  -Just to note, the focus on yourself as the acting force in the fifth stanza seems appropriate, because it sets the reader up really well for the emotional drop which happens in the sixth.  Additionally, the last line can work for this better (in my opinion) if you added imagery to the formation of the smile.  You can say it grew to add connotations of a natural reaction, or that it came to your face to add connotations that it had been saved for when you see him.  Either way, you can probably think up something better, so work on that line a little bit.<br>  -Speaking of the sixth stanza, I kinda think you should break it apart, or indent the hell out of "he kisses her,", because I feel like it is something that has a lot more significance to the story than you are giving it right now.  By putting it out by itself, it stops the reader from progressing like normal, which helps construct the importance of that moment to the story put forth.  It stops the reader's world just like it appears to stop the narrator's.<br>  -Clean up the commas in the seventh stanza.<br>  -In the seventh stanza, the third and fourth line put the breaks on the motion that is achieved with the first and second.  If you rewrote them to add tension to the actions, there would be much more energy focused on "him" in the very last line.  Since you are concluding by focusing all of your pain on him, I think the idea would be more effective if you kept the energy high.  It would be like talking about a volcano that is ready to erupt and destroy everything around it, and ending by showing him plugging it shut with his finger.  It would put more significance on the fact that he is the cause of all of the emotions that are tormenting the narrator.  As for suggestions, I would venture to replace "watch," which is a fairly passive verb, with something more engaging, like "gaze," or even more engaging than that, like "stare."  In the fourth line, you could change the tear's verb with something harsher than "drip."  For instance, if you really want to be daring, you can say "A tear slowly scrapes down my cheek." (note, I got rid of the "..." with that suggestion to add to the "plugged volcano" succinctness).  The bonus with that one is the dual meaning of the word "tear," which would help show that it is a symbol of sadness as well as a source of physical pain.  I think that would make for a great ending.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my two cents.  Good luck with your poetry, I get the sense that you'll be making many more poems in your time.|`|6smOAbzLaa	I only want to suggest to use the word "analyze" instead of "criticize."<br>  <br>  In my opinion "criticize" has a negative connotation. <br>  <br>  I would delete first line of first verse.  It is not necessary, you already spoke about the wind on the first lines.<br>  <br>  Then I would choose another word instead of soul.  In my opinion only Christians have souls.  I prefer calling my soul spirit like the Native Americans used to do. <br>  <br>  Also, I would try for the protagonist to find joy in something else besides someone who lets her down.  By doing so, the poem will have a stronger ending.|`|Ag5FNHa1aa	Its beautiful, almost brought me to tears honey.<br>  Keep writing!|`|25mfL9UXaa	I can totally relate. It is beautiful.

VMVW3E7Aaa	If you have a DSLR, then certain lenses are better for portraits, but there really isn't a difference in P&S cameras. <br>  So , now it comes down to the usual stuff:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|6pszwwl7aa	Can you narrow that down for us?

ZmdIlkpQaa	He was among the most popular, most prominent and most beloved of the young nation's public figures.  remember that he had been appointed as commanding general of the Continental Army almost unanimously, and had led well.  To those who say he wasn't an excellent general, I must disagree.  While he surely didn't win as many battles as he lost, his army was almost universally outclassed, outnumbered and underequiped, and the fact that he was able to offer resistance and then retreat to fight another day was exactly what was needed.  No amount of generalship would have won many of the battles he lost, but it took terrific patience and wisdom to maneuver and fight, and to hold together such a rag-tag and under-supplied army.<br>  <br>  Moreover, as a rich, prominent and unreservedly well respected man who had risked and sacrificed so much for his country, there was really nobody else who would have been elected.

Many Americans believe that the war was solely won because he was the general in charge but there were numerous other reasons why the Americans won the revolutionary war, (mainly the french alliance helped clinched and indeed saved our country.) he was considered at the time a great general but military historians would agree that he was NOT a great general.

The last line is excellent! So powerful, really great. And you could do without the caps on 'they' in 6'th row. In the first row, loose the 'Christians' - no one likes it when a poem is too transparent. My suggestion would be 'God-sons', but I'm over the line here, telling you what should stand there... The 3 and 4 are based on a good idea, but just a bit stretched. All in all, with just a few replacements, it could be quite strong (although I don't agree with what you're saying). But seriously, consider breaking the rhymes and meter somehow, experiment on it, if you're interested in writing poems, not only in making points, that is :)|`|tfsNIX4uaa	It's all good if you consider that anything that questions where we are(collectively) with our opinion and judgments, allows us to move forward and maybe evolve into what the world really needs.  We've had so much of the same things for so long that we tend to think in narrow terms and structured forms of thought.  When we think we live in a society that fosters freedom of speech, we have to at least consider what everyone has to say and be somewhat tolerant of all viewpoints. It's difficult to keep changing what you have to say just to suit what others think.  What you have to say is good in that it questions.

WZNaNvplaa	It depends on your viewpoint. To the French, Napoleon was rightly a great hero. While the French Revolution had taken an ugly turn with the reign of terror, there was no denying that the Revolution itself had overthrown a bloated, corrupt, and decadent rule that had no real concern for the majority of France's citizens. <br>     Yet the rest of Europe's countries were firmly determined to see a return of the French Kings. The idea that the common people could overthrown, and even kill, a king, threatened the established social order.(It's especially ironic that the British would be so resistant to the French rulers, given England's own Civil War and decapitation of Charles 1). So Republican France was threatened on several fronts by enemy nations out to overthrown the 'people's government", and to put a fat pig of a man on the throne.<br>     Napoleon represented France's best hope to resist these forces. A truly great military commander, he was also a good politician and a charismatic leader. Though he lost out in the Egyptian campaign, he still managed to fight off and even humiliate the various alliances formed against him and France.<br>     Where his ambition was disasterous was in first attempting to create a Bonauparte dynasty throughout Europe. Not only did he defeat his foes, but in many cases he tried, or did, put his own family members on the thrones of those defeated nations. This made it easier for his enemies to rally against him, as in a sense it betrayed the Republican ideals that had allowed him to come to power. And while he was able on several occasion to gain truces and even peace treaties with his enemies, both sides would end up breaking those agreements, pushing Europe into another round of war.<br>     No matter how great a general, Napoleon was one man. As long as France continued to face multiple enemies, he would find himself having to delegate certain jobs to his Marshalls. This would lead to the ultimately disasterous Spanish campaigns, among others. It would also require France to maintain a constant war footing, with an entire generation of young men growing up to be swallowed into Napoleon's military machine. <br>     And eventually, Napoleon would overestimate his own, and his army's capablities. He could have settled for establishing a fortified border with Russia, but he wanted the Russian Tzar to pay for not negotiating in good faith. So he launched the Russian campaign. He totally undererstimated the distances involved, the Russian resolve, and how bad the Russian winters would punish his ill prepared troops. It was this loss which would cripple his military capablilties enough to permit his enemies to push him from office.<br>     As for killing a lot of people, Napoleon himself was not known as a wanton murderer. He could and did execute enemies, but only by due process of law. Most he killed were on the field of battle.  Had Napoleon been acknowleged early on as the legitimate ruler of France, many of those men would not have been made to go to war and die.|`|AA11363680	Yes, he was disastrously ambitious. He was very successful, but he didn't know when to quit and call it a victory. He kept picking fights until he had too many enemies to deal with.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	to conquer. for glory for himself and france. to go down in the history books.

Jf6cke5naa	Absolutely not, I have trust issues with friends too and I'd hate to consider me a coward for feeling so. Trusting in a person is risky because you just never know if they are a true a friend or a pretender who uses you. Follow your heart, if your heart says no I can't trust someone just now then don't, that doesn't mean you don't like them, just means you're being very cautious. Which can be a good thing, you're protecting yourself from being emotionally hurt.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	being more cautious is only cowardice if the threat is so minimal that it is inconceivable to actually happen.<br>  such as refusing to drive a car because it might explode.<br>  <br>  now, having trust issues do not nessasarily reflect your shiort commings.<br>  they may refelct your ability to analyze a situation for what it is<br>  and acknowledge that people can be real pricks for no particular reason.<br>  <br>  having issues themselves is not cowardly, but only when it gets out of hand<br>  and you start thinking that the world is conspiring against you.|`|LUY72MMYaa	No, it makes you someone who has probably been hurt.  You're only a coward if you let your trust issues stop you from doing stuff to better yourself or your life.|`|xdInBhLRaa	No, being more cautious isn't cowardly.|`|aA0Mcivaaa	No you are not a coward.<br>  You have trust issues.<br>  <br>  but you say you can not connect with others and don't want to get emotionally hurt, yet is sadden you because you cant<br>  I know your pain.  I have delt with social anxiety for years|`|Wc3LKJWTaa	You should be able to trust your own friends, or they aren't true friends. I wouldn't say you suffer from cowardice, but maybe irrational fear. Sometimes you have to take your chances and place faith in your friends.|`|AA11635601	No, having trust issues means you are fearful of being hurt.  Sometimes that's pretty sensible.  A coward is someone who would therefore not ever venture out into that dangerous area where they could be hurt EVEN IF they knew that they had legitimate or compelling reason why they should.<br>  <br>  Everyone is afraid.  Cowards literally cower from the thing that frightens them, where brave people stand up and face it - even though they are just as scared as the coward.  Coward shouldn't be such a mean word, in my opinion - some things simply cower us - and some should!|`|8ekoa6szaa	No.  I have serious trust issues and I am not a coward.  My trust issues began with a man I was married to for 22 years who divorced me to marry his pregnant g/f.  That makes me a fool, but not a coward. If anything, HE was the coward.

HkXYGAOdaa	Auteur is French for author. Since the 1950s, when the term auteur was first used by the critics of French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma to praise certain film directors, the term auteur has acquired the meaning of directors whose personal vision on a movie is strongly felt. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jahsonic.com/Auteur.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jahsonic.com/Auteur.html</a><br>  <br>  and about him:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford</a>
y8bFwXZEaa	This link may give you a different perspective to use. The author does not agree with the idea of 'a priori."<br>  <a href="http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/apriori.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/ap...</a>|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	A priori knowledge is knowledge gained without needing to look to the world for verification (evidence). Rationalists think reason alone can bring us to knowledge just through internal coherence of argument, etc. The clear distinction between validity and soundness of argument easily shows such claims to be false.|`|CIkNuSZ8aa	I would write your paper to say that all rationalists do not make this claim.  I don't know any rationalists that do.  Even Descartes with his, "I think, therefore I am.", makes this claim only to establish a foundation upon which he believed that certain knowledge could obtained.  He is the prime candidate for rationalism, but he is also the father of modern philosophy and scientific method.  He established that doubt, not faith, was the way to make progress in the world of the senses.|`|cefaa45df7f1688222ca961e0c243ef4aa	Kant made a distinction between a priori (before) and a posteriori (after) knowledge expressing the idea that a priori knowledge does not require sensual experience to be understood. A posteriori knowledge, however, would be considered knowledge that does require sensual experience to be understood. <br>  <br>  I would clarify the idea of a priori knowledge as "intuitive" or "innate" knowledge since it means different things. A priori knowledge would be akin to knowing that a bachelor represents a single man. While intuited knowledge is guided more by the senses. <br>  <br>  To say that all knowledge is a priori knowledge is not accurate and I am not sure which philosopher you refer to when making this assertion. What can be said is that reason should be considered a priori if it is indeed valid. But not all knowledge is a priori knowledge. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped a little and good luck with your essay.|`|aA0Mcivaaa	The account of a priori knowledge is embedded within a general approach to knowledge (the psychologistic approach) according to which whether or not a state of true belief counts as a state of knowledge depends on the causal process that generated that state. If a state is produced by the right kind of causal process, so that it is a state of knowledge, then I say that the process is a warrant for the belief. My general understanding of warrants is a version of reliabilism (of which more later): warrants are processes belonging to types that regularly and reliably produce true belief. One condition that I don’t require of a warrant is that it involve reasons that the knower could cite in justification of the belief. This idea would prove important were we to consider if denying the apriority of logic and mathematics commits one to skepticism.<br>  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~psk16/apkr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbia.edu/~psk16/apkr.htm</a>

If he even thought for a second that his security was in danger or someone posed a possible threat then I have no doubt that he would have had them killed and changed his plans. He was the fourth child, but the first of his parents children to survive passed the first year, so I would say he probably had frequent health problems. His schedule was probably set in such a way, and he had so much security, that he wasn't taking any risks whatsoever.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	he was and he is and he's standing right behind you!<br>  <br>  I didn't know that.

Most of the assassination plots against him were poorly planned and stood very little real chance of even getting to the stage of being implemented.  The one well-planned attempt, Operation Valkyrie,  nearly got him, but architecture (not some divine protection) intervened.  In several other cases, timing of the attempts was the problem.  The earliest attempts on his life led to a witch hunt mentality that prevented or exposed many of the possible attempts early.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Protagonist<br>  Scout Finch<br>  Scout tells the story, but that by itself isn’t enough to make her the protagonist.

Writing is such a challenging but rewarding hobby - I bet you'll write something awesome : ).  <br>  <br>  Here are some ideas to get started:<br>  <br>  * Think of some of your favorite books and specific reasons why you like them (if you can't think of at least ten from the top of your head, then get reading! : ).  For example, is it the characters, the setting, the author's writing???  Anyway, brainstorm and jot down a long list on a piece of paper.  This can really help to spark ideas!  If you're having trouble thinking of books, then give movies a try.<br>  <br>  * Think up some awesome characters to go in your story.  You can have the best plot in the world, but if your characters are boring and dry then you'll stop caring about them.  There are plenty of websites out there that have character developing sheets to fill out, but you can also just do it on your own as well.  Make a chart for each character (at least the important ones) and fill in their hieghts, likes, dislikes, family members, hair colors, talents, favorite foods, weaknesses, what annoys them, their fears (ECT)...  Just make sure you know A LOT about them and have fun designing them = ).<br>  <br>  * You'll probably want to make an outline of your plot.  It doesn't have to be fancy.  It could be something as simple as: <br>  <br>  A.  Sarah goes on trip with family to visit her grandmother's house<br>  B.  She finds an old note beneath the floor boards that gives the location of a secret door in the basement wall<br>  C.  She follows it and finds....<br>  D.  She escapes this danger by....<br>  <br>  Sorry, that doesn't sound like the kind of plot you would want to write about, but I hope it helps a little : ).  Maybe you could try something school related or that involves a broken relationship.  Either way, an outline will save you from getting off track in your story.   <br>  <br>  * Lastly, WRITE, WRITE, WRITE!!!  Just get out a pen or keyboard and get to it : ).  Not every part of writing is fun, so don't get frusterated with all the planning.  Remember that it gets way better and you'll feel so accomplished when you're done!  Half of the people who have the idea to write a book never actually finish it ~ so promise yourself you won't let yourself be one of those people.  Even if you just print it out and stick it up on your shelf, you've done what many people couldn't.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your writing!!!|`|n8XVgHmUaa	do something allot of people have in common that way more people will read it do a book about girl/boy who just arrived in a new skool and has a bad past or somfing or do something like twilight but not the same or you can do something of yuor own experience with life

7PMuY5ibaa	Hamilcar, the father of Hannibal started the war to decide who would be the major forcein the Meditreanean. The Romans got Sicily in a enourmous defeat but got their buts kicked in the battle of lipari island. The most intresting part is when the Carthaginians recruit a Spartan general, Xannthipus who heroiclly wins them the Battle of Tunis. The Romans win all the battles for sicily. They start a series of unsucessfull raids on the African coast and eventually draws their troops back to Italy. Rome ends up winning when they drive Hamilcar off a cliff. Carthage returns their prisoners of war without ransom and make a peace treaty with sicily.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	As a Sicilian, I resent that statement !   lol|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	In the first Punic War Rome won after 23 years of fighting and becomes the dominant Naval Power of the Mediterranean Sea.

WZNaNvplaa	Total war would lead to economic upheaval that lasted until the second world war. In total war, it wasn't just a matter of soldiers shooting it out. What before were civilian targets were accepted as legitimate military objectives. Thus, shipping of all sorts, factories producing any goods, even non military ones(like blankets, food, etc.), and any other target that might help the enemy were liable to be attacked. More, the governments of all the nations drafted millions into uniform, and companies that used to produce goods for civilian sales were converted to provide support to the soldiers. For the first time, women began to work outside the home in large numbers, and in too many cases became the primary wage earners when their husbands were killed. Rationing, arial bombings, and even propoganda driven fear of infiltrators and spies raised the stress levels for those who were not directly on the front lines. Troops were expected and forced to serve for long periods in front line positions, and without the understanding of the psychological damage of war, many vets suffering from "shell shock" were persecuted, even shot, for cowardice. <br>     The total war policies would result in an entire generation of European men who were scarred by that warfare, and whose ranks had suffered millions of casaulties. The British Empire was irrevocably weakened by the demands of the war. It's decline was steady but relentless. The US, involved in the war for a shorter time, actually gained econoically from the conflict.<br>     Another aspect of total war was that it allowed the spread of the "Spanish Flu" of 1918-19191. With hundreds of thousands of Americans carrying the flu to Europe, with so many people moving around, either as refugees, or as soldiers marching back and forth, the disease spread far more quickly than it might otherwise have.

The date chosen for the inspection was a national day in Bosnia.

However, because of the differences in railway gauge between Russia and Prussia it was difficult for the Russians to get supplies through to their men. The Germans, on the other hand, used their railway system to surround the Russian Second army at Tannenberg before it's commander could realise what was happening. The ensuing battle was a heavy defeat for the Russians with thousands of men killed and 125,000 taken prisoner.

You want to make sure you strictly follow the regimens prescribed my your Optometrist and you'll never have any problems with them, but kids younger than 13 seem to be a little too active on average to handle the care consistently, which can cause problems.  It depends on the kid, and if you really need vision correction, are responsible, and are very active in sports, for example, contact lenses may be a good decision for a person younger than 13.  Your eye care practitioner will provide the best advice if your parents are agreeable enough to check them out professionally with you.<br>  <br>  A handling tint is about as much of a tint as you want to get right off the bat.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	dont get blue ones, blue is the hardest colour to focus through<br>  <br>  what age i dont know<br>  <br>  try asking in another section maybe|`|AjPbtm7oaa	This is in photography because?

0LgpcOBDaa	A lens for a 35mm (or full frame sensor, MX camera like a D-700) has a circle or cone of light that is over 1.5" in diameter. Now, lets put some of this into a easier perspective..<br>  <br>  Say you have a 4x6 inch piece of paper and this paper = to a full frame 35mm lens coverage. Now, if you place a 3x5 piece of paper OVER the 4x6, this is the coverage you get with most D-SLR cameras or with a DX size lens. DX lenses have a smaller cone of light. <br>  <br>  With the DX chip being smaller your getting even more of the "sweet spot" of a full frame lens than even the full frame cameras may do because of all kinds of potential probs, like  edge drop off, curvature, distortion, edge to edge sharpness and what not. <br>  <br>  By getting the inside 2/3rd's of this full frame cone of light your assured of getting the best the lens can give. Now, if you use DX lenses, them designed for the smaller chips you back to the same idea of the full frame lens on full frames. There is the potential of non corner to corner sharpness, light drop off and different edge related distortions.<br>  <br>  You are not "wasting" glass as you call it by shoot full frame lenses on DX size cameras. I personally prefer my full frame older Nikkor lenses on my DX camera because I do get such good results and buying other new MX type lenses is fine with me for someday I know, 1 - I will have a MX (full frame) digital camera, and 2 - I still use my 35mm Nikon film bodies (altho not that often anymore) and any new lenses bought will work in them just fine. <br>  <br>  A prime lens is one with no zoom. It is of a set mm in focal length, and the # can be any of the #'s offered. When using your 28mm on your D40 you are actually getting the best part of the light that lens can give. However, if it were a 50mm .. a 105mm, or a 200mm, the results would be the same as far as getting the best part of the image them lenses can deliver.<br>  <br>  If you buy too many DX lenses and some day buy a MX body, your going to have to buy all new lenses again because the circle of light on a DX will NOT cover the frame on a MX, but it does work quite well the other way around.<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|FeUmyxqqaa	having trouble following you on this one<br>  <br>  a prime is a prime no mater what body you put it on what purpose do you have in mind?|`|oXPDFw4daa	Many (perhaps most) digital cameras have sensors that are smaller than a standard 35mm film frame.  <br>  <br>  But that does NOT mean that if you use a lens originally designed for a film camera' you are 'not making full use of the lens'.

The Paradoxes of Motion<br>  3.1 The Dichotomy<br>  The first asserts the non-existence of motion on the ground that that which is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal. (Aristotle Physics, 239b11)<br>  This paradox is known as the ‘dichotomy’ because it involves repeated division into two (like the second paradox of plurality). Like the other paradoxes of motion we have it from Aristotle, who sought to refute it.<br>  <br>  Suppose a very fast runner — such as mythical Atalanta — needs to run for the bus. Clearly before she reaches the bus stop she must run half-way, as Aristotle says. There's no problem there; supposing a constant motion it will take her 1/2 the time to run half-way there and 1/2 the time to run the rest of the way. Now she must also run half-way to the half-way point — i.e., a 1/4 of the total distance — before she reaches the half-way point, but again she is left with a finite number of finite lengths to run, and plenty of time to do it. And before she reaches 1/4 of the way she must reach 1/2 of 1/4 = 1/8 of the way; and before that a 1/16; and so on. There is no problem at any finite point in this series, but what if the halving is carried out infinitely many times? The resulting series contains no first distance to run, for any possible first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. However it does contain a final distance, namely 1/2 of the way; and a penultimate distance, 1/4 of the way; and a third to last distance, 1/8 of the way; and so on. Thus the series of distances that Atalanta is required to run is: …, then 1/16 of the way, then 1/8 of the way, then 1/4 of the way, and finally 1/2 of the way (of course we are not suggesting that she stops at the end of each segment and then starts running at the beginning of the next — we are thinking of her continuous run being composed of such parts). And now there is a problem, for this description of her run has her travelling an infinite number of finite distances, which, Zeno would have us conclude, must take an infinite time, which is to say it is never completed. And since the argument does not depend on the distance or who or what the mover is, it follows that no finite distance can ever be traveled, which is to say that all motion is impossible. (Note that the paradox could easily be generated in the other direction so that Atalanta must first run half way, then half the remaining way, then half of that and so on, so that she must run the following endless sequence of fractions of the total distance: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 ….)<br>  <br>  A couple of common responses are not adequate. One might — as Simplicius ((a) On Aristotle's Physics, 1012.22) tells us Diogenes the Cynic did by silently standing and walking — point out that it is a matter of the most common experience that things in fact do move, and that we know very well that Atalanta would have no trouble reaching her bus stop. But this would not impress Zeno, who as a paid up Parmenidean held that many things are not as they appear: it may appear that Diogenes is walking or that Atalanta is running, but appearances can be deceptive and surely we have a logical proof that they are in fact not moving at all. And if one doesn't accept that Zeno has given a proof that motion is illusory — as we hopefully do not — one then owes an account of what is wrong with his argument: he has given reasons why motion is impossible, and so an adequate response must show why those reasons are not sufficient. And it won't do simply to point out that there are some ways of cutting up Atalanta's run — into just two halves, say — in which there is no problem. For if you accept all of the steps in Zeno's argument then you must accept his conclusion (assuming that he has reasoned in a logically deductive way): it's not enough to show an unproblematic division, you must also show why the given division is unproblematic.<br>  <br>  Another response — given by Aristotle himself — is to point out that as we divide the distances run we should also divide the total time taken: there is 1/2 the time for the final 1/2, a 1/4 of the time for the previous 1/4, an 1/8 of the time for the 1/8 of the run and so on. Thus each fractional distance has just the right fraction of the finite total time for Atalanta to complete it, and thus the distance can be completed in a finite time. Aristotle felt that this reply should satisfy Zeno, however he also realized (Physics, 263a15) that this could not be the end of the matter (and surely Zeno would have made the same point if presented with Aristotle's response). For now we are saying that the time Atalanta takes to reach the bus stop is composed of an infinite number of finite pieces — …, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 (of the total time) — and isn't that an infinite time?<br>  <br>  Of course, one could again claim that some infinite sums in fact have finite totals, and in partic|`|DFwvcUnhaa	No. But it would seem like it.|`|AA11532374	"Infinitesimally small" is a pleonasm: "infinitesimal" already means "infinitely small".<br>  <br>  "Infinitely small" is a contradiction in terms, because "small" is a relative term, whereas "infinite" is an absolute term. You can say something is "very small", but then both "very" and "small" are relative. You can even say something's "incredibly small" (as you do), but then "incredible" is still relative: incredible to *whom*?---"Infinite" on the other hand is an absolute term, because something's either infinite or it is not (in which case it's finite): something cannot be "a little bit infinite" or "very infinite".<br>  <br>  Even if we grant you the concept of infinite smallness, though, there's still an infinitely big difference between "infinitely small" and "incredibly (but still finitely) small".

These are all matter of spirits. Scientifically they may have explanations but I don't think it will be so clear when compared to spiritual explanations. By birth no one is good or bad. But as soon as the baby arrived the possession of spirits takes place. This may be even considered as haunting. But this will be very slow in the beginning stage. <br>  <br>  Between creatures (including human beings) and God there are millions of invisible elements. There are divisions too. Human being is a combination of several spirits. These spirits join one by one at various situations. We are just robots in flesh created by scientist God. Each of us have memories like that of the computers'. The fed things (data= knowledge=several spirits or invisible elements) are in contact with the memories since childhood. If current (electricity) stopped the memory loses all data. This is with computer. The same thing occurs to all of us. Computers are functioning by electric power but human beings are functioning by natural power. We call this as soul. This soul is nothing but simply a power like electricity. If this is stopped our memories lose all data (all spirits or invisible elements). These spirits scatter and go to different places. No one lives in the form of spirit or anything after death. Therefore no human body is responsible for anything happening in this world.

ceBTTCPwaa	Pride and Prejudice, like most of Jane Austen's works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech. This has been defined as "the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke". By using narrative which adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, that of Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions and being surprised along with her when events prove these to be mistaken. "The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-pride..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-pride...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/pap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/pap/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/prideandprejud..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/prideandprejud...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shvoong.com/tags/Pride-and-Pr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shvoong.com/tags/Pride-and-Pr...</a>

It's not at all difficult to touch someone, nor would there be much resistance to a touch.  You could make it a certain type of touch that would require an embrace -- as in dancing to slow music if you want to use that system.  Give your idea a bit more thought to see if you can derive a more complex touch system.  Don't have it be a kiss, though, as that would tend to be less original, too vampire-like.

In parenthesis above I included the number used for each note. It is pretty logical. Therefore, there are 4 quarter notes in this type of measure. It, in this case, is equal to ONE beat. <br>  <br>  I am trying to explain this simply, so I am leaving out bits of information that will be important later.<br>  <br>  A dotted half note in this time signature would be 3 beats (3/4 of the measure). This is because, when you dot a note, it is equal to its normal length PLUS half of its normal length:<br>  <br>  normal length - 2 beats<br>  half length - 1 beat<br>  2+1=3|`|2xOF70S1aa	it's the same with all instruments. <br>  a quarter note is the same as one beat... <br>  and a half note is two beats...<br>  so, a dot in front of the note adds half the value of that note...<br>  therefore, and dotted half note is three beats, since half of a half note is one, which you add to the two you already have.|`|TdfXz8PMaa	it is the same for every instrument.<br>  Quater note= 1 beat<br>  half note= 2 beats<br>  dotted notes add half the value of the original note, so a dotted half is 3 beats.<br>  HOPE I HELPED AND GOOD LUCK!!

wxSO48E3aa	It's true that in our culture we're conditioned to believe that faithfulness, especially after marriage is best. Because if we have kids it gives them stability.<br>  <br>  But before marriage and before we settle down into a serious relationship, there's no real boundary to how many partners we can have.  Infact it's through experimenting with relationships that helps us discover who we're suited to and who is suited to us.  Some relationships are just lustful, others mean more than just sex.  But if at the end of the day, two people love each other and lust after other people, or love other people and they are both willing to have an open relationship, then that is right for them no matter what other people say.<br>  <br>  Basically that's it.  What ever is right for the people involved is right, whether that be open relationships or not.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	It's pair-bonding.  <br>  <br>  Love, long-term love, is like two trees growing close together.  Their roots intertwine. They may not like each other always, but what is to one tree's benefit is to the other's: they are bound together and must look out for each other because if one tree gets a disease, the other one will, too.<br>  <br>  A relationship is a boundary: a fence.  It's hard to fence three people in together because you say something to one person, the other doesn't hear it.  Distances are created, disagreements take place, factions start.  You can't have opposing factions when there are only two people.<br>  <br>  Because love is essentially, in the end, a means to survival, ie the pair have a survival relationship together, in order to raise their young, two people is about the max one can stick into the situation together to have free flow of ideas, good communication, good decisions and some form of forward movement.  Two people, even pulling against each other, can move forward.  Now chain three people up and send them all in their own directions: no-one gets anywhere.  <br>  <br>  Three people with three discrete aims in life is too many.  The dynamic is too big:  it's not 1 + 1 + 1,  it's more 1 x 2 x 3.  It's geometric not additive.  Too many variables, they invariably factionise and gang up and things just go badly all round.<br>  <br>  NB:  True love, when it hits, is for only one person.  You've never been in love or you would not have asked the question:  true love is a total pair-bonding experience, there IS no other person.  there IS no sex with third parties.  it's not a consideration.  True love is totally overwhelming.|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	To me, this is kind of like asking why some people can lift twenty pounds and others a hundred.  Or why some can do calculus in their head while others need a calculator for simple arithmetic.  People have different capacities.  I would think that goes almost without saying.<br>  <br>  So for many people, to love more than one person is a distraction.  They need to focus all their attention on a single spot or it's lost.  There is nothing wrong with this.  It is just how they are.<br>  <br>  Some people are capable of more.  They love many people.  They love their whole town.  Some can love everything.<br>  <br>  Different people have different capacities.  And it works best for everyone when they realize this; either to stay within those limits or to try and grow and expand beyond them.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	Evolution is in fact what brought about monogamy even though many years of previous evolution is against it.  It costs a lot in terms of energy and fitness to raise human children, so it is in the parent's best interest to attract a single mate for life.  If you attract more, everyone's interests must compete, and you all lose.  Evolution also determines that the more you cheat, the more likely you will pass down your genes, so it is kind of a cruel trick that evolution plays on you.  You are programmed to want your mate to want you exclusively and also you are programmed to cheat.<br>  <br>  Basically, from an evolutionary perspective, if you let your mate play around, you are the chump.  If you become more openminded, the chances of your children surviving and thriving go down.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	We can love any amount of people but 'in love' is different.<br>  When you are in love there is no way you could have a sexual relationship with anyone other than the person you are in love with. Any thoughts of 'sleeping' with another nauseates you.<br>  If some say they have found true love but still sleep around, they have actually not found their true love and are mistaken.<br>  There is infatuation that can trick us into believing it's love, there's also lust whereby someone else turns us on, but lust would not happen to someone truly 'in love'|`|Yh96NKzXaa	I think that people are misguided when it comes to love. All my mates claim to be in love with their bf's after a few weeks and then when that relationship breaks up they do the same with the next person.

NkVjGDJoaa	Well, I'm not sure if you were looking for a teen girl's opinion, but here it is. <br>  <br>  I am a big fan of the twilight saga. I even questioned myself a bit if this story was kind of wrong for certain people to read, but I only began wondering this when I figured out who was reading it. I found out that girls as young as ten and eleven were reading this series. When I found this out, I kind of put the breaks on and wondered why the heck their parents would let them read this. However, I only felt this way because of the sexual references in the text.<br>  <br>  I don't think that what Bella goes through after Edward leaves is a way to tell girls that they should do the same thing. I believe that when someone can view a situation from the audiences perspective, they would react differently if that situation were thrust upon them. <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, no, I do not believe that the depression Bella goes through is a bad influence on the young teen readers. If anything, I think Stephenie Meyer did a wonderful job of portraying how much Bella hurt after Edward left. This notion also lets the readers see exactly how much Bella loves Edward.  <br>  <br>  Thanks For Reading My Opinion!!<br>  <br>  p.s. even the sexual references aren't a big deal...until the fourth book.|`|r6vbAM1Eaa	Somewhat it is... but then, reading about those feelings can help give a person the ability to understand how people can feel and what lengths they will go to after a trajedy, which I think is a good life lesson.  <br>  What you really have to think about is... how far can you go with books to call them a 'bad influence'?  Think of famous books by shakespeare... people get very very depressed and do dangerous things... but they aren't ever regarded as a 'bad influence'.<br>  Not that I'm actually comparing "Twilight" to a Shakespeare novel, but still, It's a similar contrast.<br>  And, not that I think it really matters, but I'm not a ditzy twilight lover.  I think the series is.... O.K.<br>  -Annie B|`|PkA4hrKWaa	First of all, I think all girls go a little crazy after they are dumped. Especially if they are dumped by Edward-like beauties. Second, Bella is stupid, therefore, she deserved to be dumped and be depressed. (Not like it had anything to do with the question, but still,) And third, if girls think that that would happen in real life, then I don't think they should be reading Twilight.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Of course it is. It screams: if you ever feel sad don't care about none else, play the martyr and everything'll fix up for you, and boys are fundamental in your life, even if it's been a short relationship!!!|`|A6ylS5bJaa	No I do not believe New Moon is a bad influence on teenage girls. The story is written around a fictional world, impossible situations, the entire series is about a human's love for a vampire. Saying that New Moon is a bad influence is the same as saying Romeo and juliet is a bad influence. In reality, that bit of classic influence would be a much worse influence, for god's sake they KILL themselves. <br>  After Breaking Dawn, people have said all kinds of horrible things about Stephenie Meyer's writing. That it is anti-feminist, that it prompts teen girls to get married, that it makes young prenthood okay- it's all ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever.|`|pEDavW3caa	i think it is kind of a bad influence because it talks about her mourning over a guy. bella gets really depressed and her whole life gets affected right after edward left. girls who read it shouldn't feel that way. they shouldn't go jump off a cliff because they believe a voice is talking to them. overall yes it's a bad influence.|`|oHjA85gEaa	Well no. Simply because this IS a fiction novel! AND edward meant everything to her (hopefully ur bf doesnt mean ur OWN life should b put a risk, lol). <br>  <br>  ~~Alice ;~)|`|iXNcB0vSaa	It is.<br>  But you also have to understand the way Edward and Bella love each other.<br>  Its supernatural.<br>  So yeah.|`|gP9g9H1taa	Of course not. Thats not what stephanie meyer meant when she wrote the book. New moon is meant to be a book. nothing more.|`|YVxy0MJZaa	I actually never thought of it that way, but maybe. Actually, yeah you're right I guess.|`|ITZRv0XGaa	It is like a bad influence but i mean its a good book. So i would not recommend the twilight saga for girls who read books then follow it.<br>  Also the girls who are reading this have to be smart and not follow what the book says... like when bella feels like she was going to kill herself when she wasnt around edward, well then the girl who is reading it shouldnt feel like that when that incident could happem to her... so... READ ON, DONT FOLLOW ALONG!!|`|yAj6h0bjaa	no

You can also send a money order.<br>  <br>  And yes they DO develop 120 film!<br>  <br>  In fact, Dwayne's Photo is the LAST place left that processes Kodachrome film!

That's what I do.<br>  <br>  If you look at the order form, you will see near the bottom a price list for developing 120 film.

JEP4CmyUaa	Isabella "Bella" Swan moves from sunny Phoenix, Arizona to rainy Forks, Washington to live with her father, Charlie, while her mother, Renée, travels with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, a minor league baseball player. Bella attracts much attention at her new school and is quickly befriended by several students. Much to her dismay, several boys compete for shy Bella's attention.<br>  <br>  When Bella is seated next to Edward Cullen in class on her first day of school, Edward seems utterly repulsed by her. However, over the next few days Edward warms up to her, and their newfound relationship reaches a climax when Bella is nearly run over by a fellow classmate's van in the school parking lot. Seemingly defying the laws of reality, Edward saves her life when he instantaneously appears next to her and stops the van with his bare hands.<br>  <br>  Bella becomes hellbent on figuring out how Edward saved her life, and constantly pesters him with questions. After tricking a family friend, Jacob Black, into telling her local tribal legends, Bella concludes that Edward and his family are vampires who drink animal blood rather than human. Edward confesses that he initially avoided Bella because the scent of her blood was so desirable to him. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.<br>  <br>  Their relationship is thrown into chaos when another vampire coven sweeps into Forks. James, a tracker vampire who is intrigued by the Cullens' relationship with a human, wants to hunt Bella for sport. The Cullens attempt to distract the tracker by splitting up Bella and Edward, and Bella is sent to hide in a hotel in Phoenix. There, Bella receives a phone call from James, who claims he is holding her mother captive. When Bella surrenders herself, James attacks her, but Edward, along with the other Cullens, rescues Bella and kills James. Once they realize that James has bitten Bella's hand, Edward sucks the venom from her system before it can spread and transform her into a vampire, and she is then sent to a hospital.

d7936494ec9fd5130797ddf028c222bcaa	Yes, he was married to an older woman named Anne Hathaway. At this time Anne would have been 26 and William 18. A considerable age difference, with William Shakespeare still under the age of consent which was then 21.It is apparent that Anne Hathaway became pregnant prior to marriage which would have no doubt caused a scandal for both of the families. Not an auspicious start for a marriage or a perfect choice of a wife for the son of an ambitious family. William Shakespeare's father John, in particular, would not have been pleased at the detrimental effect that the gossip would have had on his own social standing in Stratford. A hasty affair would have been arranged.<br>  <br>   Shakespeare had three children- susanna, and twins Judith and Hamnet. Sadly, Hamnet caught the black death and died aged 11. <br>  <br>  He also wrote sonnets about uncontrollable lust for a married "dark lady".|`|gMdrQCnIaa	he married anne hathaway if thats any help.|`|6LdCn0YPaa	yes, he married a girl when he was 18 and she was like 26|`|StOJ3O9uaa	yes he was married. he was also rumored to be inlove with his son and or some other guy. he might have had a male lover

First of all, yes it's weird, but if it were in a book or something it MIGHT not be weird. You would have to put it the right way.<br>  And secondly.... do you mean did you write it grammatically correct or are they say it grammatically correct? Well, it doesn't matter because either way it's grammatically correct. So. Wow, this was pointless.

lTNcvqyHaa	When people get excited they wish to express it in some way, cheering, screaming, banging of feet, clapping hands.<br>  <br>  Primitive man probably grunted and thumped the ground, stamped or beat a stick. If you look at children they express their emotions physically. The same with older humans.<br>  <br>  Society has changed the rules and from the days of throwing vegetables at bad performers, throwing money and items to jesters and mistrals. From slamming pewter tankards of brewed alcoholic beverages onto wooden tables in pubs. To the polite clapping of one's hands together to show appreciation in a public display - is a traditional and customary, civilized and acceptably preferred way of saying - fantastic we really liked your performance.<br>  <br>  Clapping (applause) is instantaneous both from the audience and in acceptance by the performer. It is a very tangible way of showing one's entertainment to the performer.<br>  <br>  The roar of the crowd and the smell of grease paint - the only thing some performers live for.|`|yOK32PM9aa	It is not universal - it is culturally specific.  I would guess that it originated in the way babies and children wave their arms when excited, coupled with the demand to make a noise which does not impede the performance.|`|fzU2hP4yaa	The specific origins of hand clapping are lost to history.  The urge to make noise either in approval of, or objection to an event, person or performance is deeply ingrained in the human psyche.  In some cultures people will hoot and holler, in others they will slap their thighs.  In Western Culture it is hand clapping.|`|5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	It is not worldwide, even in the English speaking world. In Gt. Britain they do the "slow clap", about 1 clap every second, when someone does something they don't like.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It's traditional way of telling performers you liked their work.|`|GzBkproMaa	Interesting question!

kQYqDbc5aa	Yes I think that it would be good.  Just like when you dress up for a job interview, you want to dress up for the job you want.  You also want to use a monologue from the play you are auditioning for.  <br>  <br>  Make sure that the monologue you use is relevant to the play that you are auditioning for.  For instance, if you are auditioning for Cinderella, don't use a Humpty Dumpty monologue.  But if you are auditioning for The Wizard of Oz, use a monologue from Wicked|`|qXREoORzaa	Yes depending on what type of play you are audtioning for. Don't act out robin hood if you are auditioning for a fariy or vice versa.<br>  <br>  But yes, using a fairytale monologue would boost your chances as you can show the character really well, which will incline them to give you a part and hopefully the part you want :)

Nobody would ever wonder if they'd done anything wrong, could have done anything different.<br>  <br>  In short, it's the price we pay for consciousness, it is what really distinguishes us from the apes.<br>  <br>  Lie down and let it wash through you.  let it happen to you, it's a natural process and blocking it makes it come back later, stronger, worse.  catch it while it's little and it stays little.<br>  <br>  What you do have to guard against in these moments is negative thinking - or if you think negatively at the time, accept that it has to do with a negative state you're in, so don't believe what your mind tells you.  Your mind will tell you anything it thinks you want to hear....<br>  <br>  In short, an easy way to describe what happened to you is that your soul is growing, and the stretching of it hurts.

iNXqiDIYaa	The conflict between Georgian and Ossetians dates back till at least 1918.<br>  <br>  In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Georgia stayed Menshevik controlled, while the Bolsheviks took control of Russia. In June 1920, a Russian-sponsored Ossetian force attacked the Georgian Army and People' Guard. The Georgian responded vigorously and defeated the insurgents, with several Ossetian villages being burnt down and 20,000 Ossetians displaced in Soviet Russia.[1]Eight months later, the Red Army successfully invaded Georgia[2] and in 1922 the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast was created.<br>  <br>  much more information at the link below

eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	In 1941, in an effort to control inflation, the U.S. Treasury began marketing the new Series E bonds U.S. Savings Bonds as "defense bonds". The government used the hype of the war to market the bonds to the country as a way to raise money for the war, when in fact they were used to remove money from the economy to control inflation. The first one was sold to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 1, 1941, by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau. After the formal entry of the United States into the war in December of that year, these bonds became known as "war bonds". These bonds were simply the latest offering of the U.S. Savings Bonds program that had begun in 1935, which replaced U.S. Postal Savings Bonds, and continues to this day. However, the mood of the nation at that time allowed the U.S. government to market Series E bonds as "war bonds", "war loans", "victory bonds", and by other names meant to appeal to a sense of patriotism.<br>  And Yes it would be a great Idea in todays economy. With all the money the giving away to stimulate the economy.

He had three hours to live. His heart was about to explode out of his body, and a woman of God who had never laid eyes on us took my husband by the hand, and told him that God said, He was going to give him a brand new heart that night. That was October of 2002, and my husband is still going strong. If God wasn't real my husband would have died. That woman didn't know us, and had never laid eyes on us, but my husband said that when she laid her hands on him and prayed, he felt that go through his body and out his toes. I can tell you this, if you aren't sure about God, give Him a try, He's as real as real can be.|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	An OPTICAL illusion implies that one is seeing something that isn't really there... like those silly picture of nothing that you stare at for several minutes trying to see the tower. Missed perception would (probably) make more sense. Or "fairytale" is you are going for the imaginary argument.<br>  <br>  That being said, it can't be determined as true or false as it's someone's opinions on something. Opinions can be based on false FACTS, but that doesn't make them wrong, just misinformed. Conversely, an opinions based on true facts wouldn't be called "the truth" it would be 'well-informed'.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that your question is impossible to answer.

He is prayed to, which is just an abstract form of communication with the divine.<br>  <br>  Do you want a logical argument?  God exists outside of the physical universe... as creator of the universe.  He is the creator of existence, and most importantly he is the creator of all that exists. It would be illogical for him to have created himself.  Therefore, God is not an element in the set of all that exists.  He is not an element in the set of all the things that he created. Therefore, God doesnt "exist"... but only inasmuch as he predates all of creation, all of which does exist.<br>  <br>  That is not to say that he isnt actually "there".  But it does begin to explain why our attempts to logically reason about God fail... because he exists outside of the universe and its rules. As creator of the universe and its rules, he is not obligated to abide by them.  He is not subject to his own creation - logic being one of them.<br>  <br>  If existence is an implied quality strictly because it can be seen, heard, tasted, felt, smelled, measured... then I guess you have answered your own question.  Although, that is a rather restrictive requirement for existence which doesnt even work. It accidentally weeds out some existing things (eg, neutrinos)...  and accidentally includes some non-existing things (eg, desert mirages, wind)... includes things which exist strictly as abstractions (eg, color), while excluding other things which exist strictly as abstractions (quantum singularities).<br>  <br>  Not to mention you are arbitrarily presuming that historical events have not been accurately documented in scripture, which is an assumption... one which has the added virtue of qualifying God as one who has never been felt, heard, seen... thereby not meeting your criteria for existence... which you use as a basis to assume God doesnt exist and that history has been falsely documented.  You posit your conclusion as a prerequisite for forming your argument.  You see how false assumptions can support false conclusions, which go on to feed other false conclusions, which ultimately swing around to support your original false premises?  Common fallacy.<br>  <br>  You want to hear science about God which the atheists argue?  Atheists claim God has self-contradictory qualities... such as omnipotence and omniscience, etc.  And they use that to reject the assumption that God exists.  But since when cant things exist with self-contradictory qualities? Seriously?  Quantum physics, anyone?  Quantum particles can and do exist in contradiction all the time... both here and there, turning left and turning right, taking this path and taking that path, existing and non-existing... all at the same time. Voila.  Things DO exist in self contradiction.<br>  <br>  And the quantum world does influence the Newtonian world in its own way. Even atheists admit that... when they try to explain away free-will in an otherwise deterministic universe, they introduce quantum uncertainty.<br>  <br>  Then, atheists go on to complain why God doesnt manifest and tell us all of his existence.  Hello?!?! Self-contradictory qualities cannot manifest on the Newtonian level of existence... all atheistic scientists know that... else God would be violating his own laws of physics which he constructed this universe with. And God doesnt lie... he could, but he doesnt.  He restricts his essence to the quantum.<br>  <br>  And that does begin to explain how God can be omnipresent and omniscient, as he permeates the universe in what scientists call "quantum entanglement"... feel free to chalk "fate" and "luck" and "miracles" off to the random effects of quantum uncertainty.|`|ioLun57Caa	A little over 30 years ago I was alone and was attacked by my pet wolf, I fought him off until my lab could break her chain and come to the rescue.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|bVcjFYRLaa	Read the book because I have not read the book
Z9jtdw17aa	It helps, but there is no one hard, fast rule.<br>  <br>  I asked my husband once why he fell in love with me.  He said, "You loved me back."<br>  <br>  It can be a pretty delicate dance.  Most of us carry some sort of psychic wounds.  When young people are face with someone who doesn't seem to see the wounds, that alone sometimes heals the wounds.  <br>  <br>  However, I've also seen young people who believed in their hearts that they were so damaged or flawed that no one would ever love them.  They believed strongly that they were unlovable, so anyone who treated them well or as if they were lovable would get whole-hearted devotion in return.  Sometimes, though, after that first rush of falling in love, the object of that whole-hearted devotion might turn out to be abusive.  In some situations, I saw (mostly) young women who said, "Well!  That didn't work out!" and left the abuser.  Unfortunately, I also saw those who figured that they were not lovable in the first place, so the bad treatment was somehow deserved, and they continued to profess love for the abuser.  These were women who could benefit from the advice that to know real love, they first needed to love themselves.<br>  <br>  Before I was a teacher, I wondered why women stayed with abusers.  The hope that the abuser would change back to the person with whom she fell in love or the belief  that she somehow deserved the abuse were the two that I saw acted out most often.<br>  <br>  As Titou says, there are kinds of love besides romantic love that are acts of grace, and one gives that as a gift regardless of whether the love is returned or not.  I often worked and worked with kids who were struggling with my subject even though they didn't seem to care much or even actively disliked my efforts.  A teacher loves her classes whether they love her back or not.  That is a gift she gives.  But unlike Titou, I think it is easier to offer that unreturned love if you first love yourself.  If I didn't believe it was a valuable gift, I wouldn't have been able to sustain the effort through those difficult years every teacher faces once in a while.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Not true if talking about sexual lust or emotional desire.  In fact, that works best with a bit of inadequacy.<br>  <br>  More true in the case of impersonal love in the sense of concern about well-being and goodwill to people.  If you can feel this at all, then you will know that you deserve it as much as anybody.|`|AA11562077	Definitely not true.  A "sounds good" PC myth which ignores that love is a grace -- probably the greatest of them all -- and cannot be earned.<br>  <br>  To those that would counter that while love may be offered it takes self-love to recognize and accept it:  What do you say to a person that is suffering from a deadly disease and is helped by a Florence Nightingale?<br>  Think his love for her is counterfeit?|`|hUYaaXBvaa	yes to an extent<br>  <br>  if you are self hating your love is one sided, and it makes it harder as well for the person you love to deal with you,<br>   it can be a drain on them to reassure you that you are loved, hurting them and yourself<br>  you will just bring them down, and it may be harder when they have to convince you why they love you, and why you should love yourself<br>  <br>  so you can love another if you hate yourself, but that can make things one sided and hurt both involved|`|0XdkbEtFaa	well most of the time im sure its true because if you dont even have the heart to love yourself then how can you to love someone else but like everything in this world they'll be cases of it nothing is black or white the worlds full of colour :)|`|AA11635601	No it's bass-ackwards.  Someone else has to love you first before you can do anything.|`|GzBkproMaa	i personally do agree.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Yes, because love has a set of obligations that come with it, and if you do not uphold those obligations with regard to yourself, what hope have you of upholding your obligations towards others?  You wouldn't know where to start.<br>  <br>  Love isn't just some sappy feeling, it's an active verb, which acts upon an object (grammattically speaking, not calling the object of your love an object).  <br>  <br>  love is a huge responsibility.  A responsibility to tell the truth, to look after that person's interests as well as your own, to be fair to them, to be mindful of their needs and wants.  If you can't even be mindful of your own interests/needs/wants where do you look to even find theirs?  <br>  <br>  You have to learn to love yourself, to have a straight and honest and loving relationship with your own self, in order to protect the object of your love from your own ability to harm them.  <br>  <br>  Love creates vulnerability, but the object of love is also vulnerable and has responsibilities towards the person that loves them.  If you love me, I have to listen to what you say, hear you if you criticise/complain, take you as being on my side.  Thus, if you love me, you have to be on my side, be being straight with me, be trying to help me in life and not destroy me.<br>  <br>  Many people who quote 'love' as the reason for their violent actions towards the object of their 'love' are actually suffering from something else entirely: insecurity, need.  An unwholeness within themselves they expect their 'loved one' to be able to fix.  The loved one cannot:  the lover has to make sure he himself is whole and is operating sanely.  That's part of what I mean when I talk about the obligations of love.  It's not free. It comes at a price and without the willingness to introspect and clean up your own internal mess, you cannot pay that price.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	In this sense  it means to understand yourself first, to be kind and compassionate to yourself. To be tolerant of the things that you may question even about yourself. Respect yourself and the things you do and say. Trust yourself and you will trust others.

Perhaps using more imagery that relates to Obama's characteristics or maybe ellaborate more on what he needs to do in order to be "in your thought." just some suggestions. Keep writing! Only way to get better. Also, read poetry by your predeccessors! Pay homage to Shakespeare, Yeats, Frost, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, and my personal favorite: Paul Laurence Dunbar. Among many others. To be a good poet, You have to read good poetry. Like anything, it takes practice, persistence, and an unwavering will to get better.

YmtNel5haa	the greatest happiness principle is the standard at which utilitarians try to follow.  It suggests doing things that will result in the greatest happiness for the greatest amount of people.-------According to utilitarianism, UTILITY is the only intrinsic good.  Actions and precedents are judged right or wrong in proportion to their propensity to produce the most happiness or pleasure, for the greatest number.  Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) believed that utility could be measure quantitatively (in what he called a hedonistic calculus), and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) believed in a qualitative approach which essentially involved checking your perceived judgments with others for a second opinion, so to speak.  Later utilitarians, like Rashdall and Sidgwick, devised alternative ways of measuring utility.  <br>  <br>      Bentham believed that seeking happiness was an inherent part of human nature, and that happiness could be measured as a matter of quantity.  Each person is their own judge when it comes to happiness, but when it comes to the greatest happiness (or felicity, as he called it), a person can really only be so happy if others around them are happy, too.  He called this the greatest happiness (or felicity) principle.   The greatest happiness depended upon the circumstances, upon the community in which one finds themselves, and -- this is the reform impulse -- upon how they sought to maximize harmony, comfort, and happiness with their closest friends and neighbors.   <br>  --------------------------|`|IGAzs2UEaa	personally i think<br>  utilitarianism is bullshit.<br>  treats happiness as if it is tangible<br>  has serious flaws.

Thus began the original line up of Jal.<br>  <br>  Jal recorded the song Aadat at Mekal Hassan's Studio. The song became popular on different musical websites such as Pakmanzil.com in Pakistan. The song was also being on aired on major Radio channels of Pakistan like City FM 89, FM 100, Mast FM 103, FM 105 etc. The video for this song was released on Ary The Music and then it was played on almost all the channels.----------------<br>    Controversy<br>  After the release of the song "Aadat" by Jal, there were disputes within the band about Atif's brother being the band's manager. At this point Atif broke off from the band to do his own solo album. His solo album was released a few weeks before the release of the new Jal's (Goher Mumtaz, Farhan Saeed, Shazi) "Aadat". As both Jal's "Aadat", and Atif’s album, Jalpari, shared certain tracks (such as "Aadat", "Wo Lamhey", "Rangon Mein" and "Dil Harey"), an unofficial war over rights began between both the groups. Goher Mumtaz sued Atif Aslam for using the name "Jal" in his album title cunningly (Jal pari, meaning mermaid). As the copyright law in Pakistan is quite ambiguous (people can change the name of the content and use the content labelling it as their own property).<br>  <br>  The hype this feud gave to both Atif and the new Jal was extraordinary and split music fans with the fans of each side backing their respective favourite. On the other hand, a few years back a video on youtube was released with Atif Aslam giving a message to Goher Mumtaz to leave the differences behind and move on with his career and stop blaming each other fovoices.<br>    Solo career<br>  Atif released his first album Jal Pari on 18 July 2004 by Sound Master and IC records. Its promoters declared it to be the best selling album of the year within just 5 months of the release.[1].

At this point Atif broke off from the band to do his own solo album. His solo album was released a few weeks before the release of the new Jal's (Goher Mumtaz, Farhan Saeed, Shazi) "Aadat". As both Jal's "Aadat", and Atif’s album, Jalpari, shared certain tracks (such as "Aadat", "Wo Lamhey", "Rangon Mein" and "Dil Harey"), an unofficial war over rights began between both the groups. Goher Mumtaz sued Atif Aslam for using the name "Jal" in his album title cunningly (Jal pari, meaning mermaid). As the copyright law in Pakistan is quite ambiguous (people can change the name of the content and use the content labelling it as their own property).<br>  <br>  The hype this feud gave to both Atif and the new Jal was extraordinary and split music fans with the fans of each side backing their respective favourite. On the other hand, a few years back a video on youtube was released with Atif Aslam giving a message to Goher Mumtaz to leave the differences behind and move on with his career and stop blaming each other fovoices.<br>  <br>  [edit] Solo career<br>  <br>  Atif released his first album Jal Pari on 18 July 2004 by Sound Master and IC records. Its promoters declared it to be the best selling album of the year within just 5 months of the release.[1]. In the meantime Atif also cleared his Bachelors in Computer Science (Hons.) from University of Central Punjab. On 14 April 2007 Atif Aslam performed in Royal Albert Hall. His second album, Doorie was released on 22 December 2006.<br>  <br>  On 8 January 2008, Atif Aslam released his third album, Meri Kahani.<br>  <br>  On 17 July 2008 Atif Aslam was the second singer to perfo

Whip them as FAST as you can, but make sure not to overswing.

You can get where everything goes that way, as well as with the bar, stopping at each one. <br>  Also practice balancing in a perfect posse as well. :)<br>  <br>  also<br>  first of all, ask your teacher what your doing wrong, then work specifically on that.<br>  have you ever tried doing a la secondes?<br>  they're fouettes but you dont bring your leg back into passe.<br>  i think they're easier, and once you get them down you should have a better feel of fouettes.<br>  it also helps to take a HUGE preparation. this gives you the push you need.<br>  also, you may be coming into passe too quickly or too soon.<br>  these should help:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME1EShO98..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME1EShO98...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixtGKNP6..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixtGKNP6...</a><br>  keep practicing and remember to straighten your knees and point your toes! :D|`|E6tkzPsbaa	Hi!

Tendue or step (depending on how your dance curriculum is) with your right foot, then prep with your left foot foward.<br>  2. Make sure you have your balance by lifting your foot off the ground.<br>  3. Go to relev'e with your left foot and right in front.<br>  4. Bring your foot to passe.<br>  5.Start off with just a prep, then 1 turn (which is basically 2), then go on. <br>  Remember keep trying your best!

draNVjbkaa	To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.<br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W.

a6239b797aa6cae3f0fc772f579e2287aa	It's all about focus and persistence and no fear of failure.  Everyone is born with certain propensities (meaning tendencies) to be able to do (or excel) at certain things.  Mere talent is not sufficient.  There are very few people who are good at something (anything) who have never made any effort to improve their talent.<br>  <br>  Even geniuses, such as Mozart or Da Vinci or Einstein, worked very, very hard at their talent for all their lives, and each of them no doubt failed many times in the effort to become better at what they did.  One of my favorite quotes is by Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb.  He said:  "I didn't fail--I just found 10,000 ways that didn't work."  Sticking with something even when it's hard is important.<br>  <br>  You don't "enjoy anything?" Come on....If that's the case, then it's because you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope.

Each character is just two colors (a base, and a slightly darker hue for the pattern), with a consistant flat cell-shade (my guess is a gray value being multiplied - if I am making it sound complicated rest assured this is easily done in any paint program that supports layers and layer blending, such as Photoshop and Gimp). And then finally the end result is blended with the grainy paper-like pattern in the background to create that textured feel.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Some people like to use all sorts of esoteric descriptions to make bokeh sound like it's something different or new.  But "bokeh" is simply a new, fad term for a very old photographic technique called "selective focus."  Selective focus IS the technique of using a shallow depth of field to draw more attention to a subject in the foreground, while blurring out the background to make it look softer and less distracting.  This technique is often used in portraits. <br>  <br>  Selective focus is a photographic technique that has been around for as long as there were cameras with an adjustable aperture (way over 100 years). <br>  <br>  You would use a shallow depth of field and selective focus by using a wider aperture setting (smaller F-stop number).  I'm sure the hipsters will disagree with me...but the fact remains that you ARE using a shallow depth of field to create a picture like that, so it is in fact selective focus, regardless of whatever other fad terms someone may want to call it.<br>  <br>  I have to agree that if you took that picture, that is pretty good.  And yes, that would be an example of using SELECTIVE FOCUS.|`|AA10758468	Bokeh (from the Japanese word for fuzzy) refers to the quality of the out of focus area of an image. An image isn't bokeh or not. If the out of focus portion of the image is pleasing it has good bokeh.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Yes it is, and a nice example.<br>   Simple photo of a doll? Yes and no. <br>  To someone that doesn't understand all the in and outs of making a photo a 'photo' rather than a snapshot, they would just think 'oh, a doll picture, cute'.<br>  The preparation, the focal aspect, the composition and all the other points of making a nice pic, are so lost by so many people it's almost scary.<br>  If you did the photo !?!  Good job.|`|6pszwwl7aa	Again, what someone said, but it got overlooked by follow up responses, Bokeh does not mean out of focus, or shallow DOF. Bokeh has to do with does that out of focus area look smooth or not. In this case it does.

Tell her that you made it into a solo and you really love it.<br>  <br>  If she knows that you know about it, ask her if you can see their routine.  After they show it to you ask her other friends where they learned it.  When they say your "one" friend, ask her where she learned it.  Then tell everyone that you are the one who came up with the idea and you would really like your dance back.  Tell them you don't mind if they join you but you would really like to do it.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to do either of those than just tell her what you really feel about it.  She might tell you something too like you were being really bossy and that is why she wanted to do it with other people.

E6tkzPsbaa	Just try one extra head spot. Of course getting your triples or quads will take much longer than one try, so you will have to try multiple times before you get your turn perfected. Hold your balances in piroette position for the amount of time it takes you to do those number of turns. I know this saying gets old, but practice really does make perfect. Well, almost perfect anyway. My best of hopes and wishes goes to you! Good luck!|`|VQLJrTKCaa	same concept as a single or double just spot one more time and give yourself one more turn's worth of momentum. use your arms to turn you and keep your foot attached to your knee. if they are ballet pirouettes, make sure your passe is as turned out as possible. i've found that my best turns are when i'm relaxed.|`|fwAXKX42aa	we would do this across the floor excersice that really helped both right and left turns. if you are starting with a right turn when you prep make it reallly really low so your knee is almost touching the ground and really pull up when you turn then immediately step out into your left prep and again make you prep as low as you can. then jus keep repeating it across the floor. this helped me so you should try it :D<br>  and good luck!!! Drill seriously is sooo much fun!!|`|Ln6v8v5Faa	just make sure you are really holding in your center and spot really hard.<br>  check your prep each time to make sure you are doing everything correctly.

TAZ3Igrzaa	Nabucodonosor I (Nabuconodosor I, Nabudoconosor I, Nabukudirriusur I o Nabushadrezzar I) fue rey de Babilonia de la Segunda Dinastía de Isín en Babilonia. Reinó desde 1125 a. C. hasta 1103 a. C. aproximadamente.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Contexto Histórico  [editar]Babilonia, tras la caída de a Dinastía Casita (entre 1180 a. C. y 1155 a. C.), que se venía perpetuando en el poder hacía ya varios siglos, había caído bajo un efímero período de dominación Elamita, que por entonces estaba gobernado por de la Dinastía Shutrukid. Además, había constantes intervenciones asirias en Babilonia. En respuesta de esto, en Sumeria, surgió un movimiento rebelde, la Segunda Dinastía de Isín, que pretendía devolver la baja Mesopotamia a sus verdaderos habitantes. Así, su primer rey, Marduk-kabit-ahheshu (que reinó desde 1157 a. C./1156 a. C. hasta 1140 a. C./1139 a. C.), con sede de gobierno en la misma Isín, comenzó la reconquista de la Baja Mesopotamia, que estaba principalmente dominada por Elam. Se proclamó rey de la Babilonia, a pesar de que residía en Ishin (de la que también se proclamó Rey), por lo cual, no se sabe si Babilonia, durante su reinado, estuvo bajo dominio de Isín, que fue capital del reino, o el título de rey de Babilonia era honorífico. Con respecto al segundo rey de esta dinastía, Itti-Marduk-balatu, es distinto. Reinó desde 1139 a. C. hasta 1132 a. C., y su sede de gobierno, estuvo los primeros 4 a?os de reinado en Isín (desde 1139 a. C. hasta 1135 a. C.), y desde entonces, hasta el fin de su reinado (desde 1135 a. C. hasta 1132 a. C.), causado por su muerte, reinó con sede en Babilonia, no obstante, durante sus primeros cuatro a?os de reinado, se atribuyó los títulos de Rey de Ishín y Rey de Babilonia, que quizás, aún era honorifíco y no autentico, ya que tal vez, todavía no la había conquistado, pero que a partir del 1135 a. C., hizo efectivo seguramente, ya que allí transladó el centro del poder abandonando el título de Rey de Isín, y quedándose sólo con el de Rey de Babilonia. Esta situación y este estatus, mantendrían todos sus sucesores, por lo que la mayoríua de los reyes de la II Dinastía de Isín, reinaron desde Babilonia. Así, el cuarto Rey de esta dinastía, Nabucodonosor I, fue el tercero en reinar desde Babilonia y sin el título de Rey de Isín.<br>  <br>  <br>  busca toda la información en <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabucodonosor_I" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabucodonos...</a>

ceBTTCPwaa	The Maltese Falcon is a 1930 detective novel by Dashiell Hammett, originally serialized in the magazine "Black Mask". The story has been adapted several times for the cinema. The main character, Sam Spade, appears only in this novel and in three lesser known short stories, yet is widely cited as the crystallizing figure in the development of the hard-boiled private detective genre – Raymond Chandler's character Philip Marlowe, for instance, was strongly influenced by Hammett's Spade. Spade was a departure from Hammett's nameless and less than glamorous detective, The Continental Op. Sam Spade combined several features of previous detectives, most notably his cold detachment, keen eye for detail, and unflinching determination to achieve his own justice. He is the man who has seen the wretched, the corrupt, the tawdry side of life but still retains his "tarnished idealism".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Maltese_Falcon" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Maltese_Falc...</a> : Includes The Maltese Falcon summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/maltese2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/maltese2.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_(novel)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese...</a>

IQVmYd6Gaa	16 when i read them the first time, the second time and the third time :) <br>  I think that the story has honestly had no influence on me because its fantasy and i leave it that way. I know there will never be a 'true' Edward, or Jacob for that matter. But we can hope right? ^^   I think lifestyle wise though they have changed me for the better in one important way, they have introduced me to reading. I have never been able to concentrate on books, or focus enough to enjoy them until the Twilight Saga. I now proudly read most nights and any free time i have during the day. <br>  I think everyone can relate to Bella because as you read you see yourself as Bella, which is why different people get different things from the book. Although i know i could never be as strong as she is and as selfless i still feel we relate in many ways because i have seen the story as if i were Bella. <br>  As for relating to the story, do dreams count? ^^|`|YVxy0MJZaa	i was 13 when i 1st read them.<br>  they were a pretty good influence on me.<br>  i can relate to bella's relationship with her father, who is a lot like mine.|`|6zb5jlNkaa	12 <br>  its a good influence <br>  i cant|`|wD82XTTHaa	16<br>  good<br>  love|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	i got it for my birthday the year it came out, so, 16<br>  mostly bad<br>  i cant. she has no personality at all and she's half lifeless.|`|3hjRiUYpaa	13<br>  no influence<br>  I dont think anyone can relate to bella, she is mostly just a lifeless character that stands for all us desperatepeople who want to be loved the way Edward loves Bella.

5wg7tKc6aa	Don't stop writing... it's YOUR story, and even if the character is childish, some people that age are.  I'm 17, and I act like a 5 year old at times, and I always seem immature when I'm really just young-at-heart.  I get called a child because I watch only cartoons and read a lot of kid books, and never spend time watching reality shows, and what not... and if there was a character based on me, people wouldn't think I was realistic, just because I'm not the cliche teenager.<br>  <br>  Who cares, though.  Each person is different, and if people can't respect how unique YOUR character is, then they can go screw themselves, or write their own story.<br>  <br>  If you continue, I'll respect you.  If you don't, you'll just be another person writing to suit societies demands... shame.
XxtVwslraa	This is a pretty decent attempt at a story but it's just way to much like Harry Potter. I understand that it's a well written book and there are some things you can learn from it writing wise but you still want to be as original as possible. You're taking scenes from Harry Potter and trying to make them your own but it's just comming of a little ridiculous, like the man appearing from the trumpet. That's a little odd. You start of pretty well trying to create an atmosphere of suspense but fail to keep it up throughout the excerpt. You are also trying to write in this London type old english but that is comming off forced. It doesn't flow the way natural speech does. I would suggest watching British movies or listening to how they talk for a long period of time. You can also read books written in the dialect you're trying to write in. Eventually it'll be easier and  you'll be able to write it convincingly. It always happens to me after reading those type of books. I start unconciously immitating that books speech and this is what you want. Over all this is a pretty good attempt. It's just too heavily based on HP and you don't want  to come off as a knock off. I've read that if you're going to knnockoff or copy someone you have to do it better than them. That's the only way to get away with it and since I don't think you're up to J.K.R. status yet, you should just try being original.<br>  <br>  vvvvvAre you a young writer interested in learning about the publishing industry?

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50genealogy2008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|o3sYIdOzaa	I don't think there is any one site that I can say is the best, and it depends on what particular record you are looking for.  I prefer the free sites.  They often have user contributed records.  I probably use the census records the most.  You can access them on genweb project sites or Heritage Quest.  Family search.org has Social Security death records and some trees.  WPA grave search, Find a Grave, and Genweb projects have some cemetery inscriptions.  The Ellis Island site has immigration records.  Genweb Archives often have some good records.  Random Acts of Genealogical Kindness volunteers are great or you can hire a researcher.  The National Archives and state archives have many records.  You can also just search for a name and location and see what you come up with.  Alta vista is a good search engine to use for that.  You can also search by county, state, and the word genealogy and see what sites come up.  Some states have some excellent records online.  Good luck.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	I like Ancestry, if you are a non-hispanic white american whose ancestors have been here for a while. Blacks are doomed to dead end in 1870, if not sooner. The fact they have common names, many were nearly illiterate and the white enumerators / county clerks / etc. didn't take as much time with them as they did with the better-off whites makes them tough to trace.<br>  <br>  I've found a surprising amount of genealogical gold in the society pages in the newspaper archives, especially the wedding articles. Once you get past the bride's dress and the flowers, the Groom's cousin, is best man, the bride's maid of honor is her younger sister, the bride's aunt Dorothy helped with . . .<br>  <br>  I like the US Gen Web county level sites, the Roots Web Mailing list archives, GenForum and the Ancestry Query boards. Google Books has digitized a number of those old County "Pictorial and Biographical" Histories, which are 75% fluff but 25% gold.

NMXTzJKsaa	Sounds interesting!  Two suggestions:<br>  <br>  1 - Get a book about grammar and punctuation.

iNXqiDIYaa	dont know how he got involved but this article will help with its influence on him<br>  <br>  Aestheticism and philosophy<br>   <br>  While at Magdalen College, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He began wearing his hair long and openly scorning so-called "manly" sports, and began decorating his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other objets d'art.<br>  <br>  Legends persist that his behaviour cost him a dunking in the River Cherwell in addition to having his rooms (which still survive as student accommodation at his old college) trashed, but the cult spread among certain segments of society to such an extent that languishing attitudes, "too-too" costumes and aestheticism generally became a recognised pose. Publications such as the Springfield Republican commented on Wilde's behaviour during his visit to Boston in order to give lectures on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more of a bid for notoriety rather than a devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. Wilde's mode of dress also came under attack by critics such as Higginson, who wrote in his paper Unmanly Manhood, of his general concern that Wilde's effeminacy would influence the behaviour of men and women, arguing that his poetry "eclipses masculine ideals [..that..] under such influence men would become effeminate dandies". He also scrutinised the links between Oscar Wilde's writing, personal image and homosexuality, calling his work and lifestyle 'Immoral'.<br>  <br>   <br>  Wilde was deeply impressed by the English writers John Ruskin and Walter Pater, who argued for the central importance of art in life, an argument laced with a strongly philhellenic and homoerotic subtext[attribution needed]. Wilde later commented ironically on Pater's suppressed emotions: on being informed of the man's death, he replied, "Was he ever alive?" Reflecting on Pater's view of art, he wrote, in The Picture of Dorian Gray, "All art is quite useless". The statement was meant to be read literally, as it was in keeping with the doctrine of Art for art's sake, coined by the philosopher Victor Cousin, promoted by Theophile Gautier and brought into prominence by James McNeill Whistler. In 1879 Wilde started to teach Aesthetic values in London.<br>  <br>  The aesthetic movement, represented by the school of William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, had a permanent influence on English decorative art. As the leading aesthete in Britain, Wilde became one of the most prominent personalities of his day. Though he was sometimes ridiculed for them, his paradoxes and witty sayings were quoted on all sides.<br>  <br>  Aestheticism in general was caricatured in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta Patience (1881). While Patience was a success in New York it was not known how much the aesthetic movement had penetrated the rest of America. So Richard D'Oyly Carte invited Wilde for a lecture tour of North America. D'Oyly Carte felt this tour would "prime the pump" for the tour of Patience, making sure that the ticket-buying public was aware of one of the movement's charming personalities. This was duly arranged, Wilde arriving on 3 January 1882, aboard the SS Arizona. Wilde is reputed to have told a customs officer "I have nothing to declare except my genius", although there is no contemporary evidence for the remark.<br>  <br>  During his tour of the United States and Canada, Wilde was torn apart by no small number of critics—The Wasp, a San Francisco newspaper, published a cartoon ridiculing Wilde and Aestheticism—but he was also surprisingly well received in such rough-and-tumble settings as the mining town of Leadville, Colorado.[6] On his return to the United Kingdom, he worked as a reviewer for the Pall Mall Gazette in the years 1887-1889.

E6tkzPsbaa	Hi! I can totally relate to you! A couple years ago, I was dieing for pointe shoes. That's all I ever really thought about to tell you the truth. I kept working hard in class and attended every class and improved on everything the teacher told me to. I HIGHLY reccomend asking your teacher what you can do do get ready for pointe and when she thinks you will be ready. She will tell you what you need to work on and you will try your hards to suceed. When she sees you trying your very hardest she or he will see the passion that you have for ballet. Remember keep up the hard work, determination, and passion! Good luck!|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	i had the same queastion a year ago <br>  i realized that you cant rush into pointe or it will hurt you <br>  it really is your teachers desicion but it wont be rude to ask <br>  pointe is really rewarding and fun <br>  my teacher said i had great ankle support and an awesome lower body <br>  if you do your barre work and evrything else well <br>  im sure you will get on <br>  pointe is not to be rushed into <br>  hope this helped <br>  ??

Rather slim and androgynous figure with a face too pretty for a boy.

With Bella's new powers, Jane's own powers are useless...she becomes powerless, and that's something she can't stand.|`|A6ylS5bJaa	She hates Bella, firstly, because she'd sadistic and hates EVERYONE, and second because she's jealousbecause Bella is immune to the gift that has taken her so far. <br>  She kissed Aro on the lips simply as a sign of affection.. . in other countries kissing is used all the time as a greeting, very different from here in America.. . <br>  Didn't I already answer this?|`|cyn03lBJaa	she is part of the volturi family. she can inflict bad on people. she doesn't physical hurt people but she makes then think they are in horrible pain. she get in there head. thats why every on in the family are nice to her because she is powerful. except of bella. she cant hurt her cuz for bellas gift

c249231c77adf375806f00bfe2204ff3aa	I grew up in the Great Depression.  I've read recently that FDR made it worse, but WPA that put men to work saved a lot of homes/people.  Public Works built roads, bridges--infrastructure and got men off the bread line.  There is nothing that destroys souls of men than to not have a job to support his family!  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is what pulled us out of the Depression--and the all out arms production and build up of the Armed Services.|`|DFwvcUnhaa	I think the New Deal programs made the depression worse.<br>  There was a worldwide depression but only in the USA was there a Great Depression.<br>  I hope I'm wrong but I see it happening again.

7ZeT3Krkaa	Check with the newspapers in the area.  Most have copies of all papers archived somewhere.  Some keep them at the paper, some have them in local libraries.  Just ask the paper.  Since you have the exact date, it will be much easier to find the story you want.  Not all papers have them uploaded to any website, so you may have to do some legwork to see them.<br>  You could check with the police department, but they may no longer have those records.  It depends on how long they keep them.|`|mcpu4ZDtaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Yes you can.

cYgJQDQSaa	Sassoon was a Lieutenant in the 2nd battalion royal welch fusiliers in the first world war. He was contempary with Robert graves and Wilfed Owen (all three were officers and war poets in the Royal welch). He won the Military Medal for outstanding Bravery, which saved him from the concequences of writing a full page article critisising the war. The army couldn't court martial a man the'd just awarded medals for bravery to, for cowardice, so they sent him to craiglockhart military psychiatric hospital. Unlike owen, Sassoon and Graves survived the war.

This deals with the time he spent in a mental hospital.|`|1CBUU7QWaa	He was an English author and poet born in 1886 and wrote many poems, but many of them were about world war 1 (Which he fought in)  He also helped Wilfred Owen (another poet) I think :)<br>  <br>  He died in 1967 just before his 81st Birthday...<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I don't know a lot but I hope that helped a little!!|`|4FWrRRF2aa	Who he was and why is he famous are two different questions.<br>  <br>  He was a World War 1 soldier and poet. He was not killed in the war.<br>  <br>  The why is he famous is far more difficult. He was well known for most of his life. A brief period of fame between 1929 and 1939, due to his anti-war poetry. He actually loved fighting.<br>  <br>  He became famous during the 1960's, the anti Vietnam War, anti-war generation and the 50th anniversary of WW1 brought about a Fresh interest in his poetry.

Harry Potter obviously.<br>  & I reaaaaally recommend The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud. <br>  <br>  If you more into like humorous books about people your age, there is a great series by Lousie Rennison, the first book is called "Angus, Thongs and Full-frontal Snogging". Its hilarious I literally laugh out loud, and so far there are 9 books. Well worth a read.<br>  <br>  Other than that I'd say Crank, Glass, Burned. They are about a girls drug addiction, very good. <br>  <br>  And the Inkspell Trilogy.|`|A6ylS5bJaa	I'm fourteen, so this definetly works- and sorry but there will be a few books on their own in here- not just series. <br>  <br>  Firstly, The Vampire Academy series is one of my favorite books of all time. There are currently three out, the fourth will be released this summer, and the fifth sometime after that. They are about three different species of vampires, two of which fight against the third, wvil species. The Moroi are elemental, living vampires, the dhampirs are human-moroi mixtures they are gaurdians for the Moroi, and the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires. This series is amazing, with romance and drama. <br>  The Mortal Instruments series, by a woman whose surname is, I believe, Funke, is about a girl named Clary, who is thrown into the world of demons and demon hunters when she sees some of them killing a demon in a nightclub. There are City of Bones, and City of Ashes, out now, and City of Glass isn't out yet, I don't think<br>  A little off the wall would be the Charlie Bones series by Jenny Nimmo- more and more keep coming out like crazy, but it's about kids with special abilities, some talented in music, art, and drama, some with abilities like telekinesis, talking to animals, talking to people in photographs, etc.<br>  In another genre, are Nineteen Minutes and The Tenth Circle, both written by Jodie Piccoult. In Nineteen Minutes, there is a school shooting, and you work backwards from that event until you get the Whole story. The Tenth Circle was turned into a Lifetime Movie, it is about a freshman girl getting raped and her story. <br>  I would also suggest anything written by Sarah Dessen. Someone Like You is my favorite, it is about a girl who's best friend is pregnant. Just Listen is alot like the Tenth Circle- it was also made into a lifetime movie, called, "How To Deal." It is very good. There are lalso Keeping the Moon [about a girl who lives with a relative over the summer while her famous mother, who is one of those diet book women, travels], Dreamland [about a girl in an abusive relationship], That Summer, and Lock and Key. <br>  The Au Pairs, written by Melissa de la Cruz, are about three girls, Eliza, who was a young socialite before her fathers money scandal het the papers, Jacqui, a beauty from Brazil, who initially takes the Au Pair position to find her summer love from the year earlier, and Mara, a normal girl, who work for the Perry family during their high school summers. I believe there are four books, but I cannot remember what they all are called. They really are amazing though. <br>  Here are some whose authors I don't know. <br>  Rewind [where at the beginning, chapter 20 or so, a boy hits his prom date, and you literally read backwards to get the whole truth,], Kissing Snowflakes [where a girl is skiing with her father, brother, and new stepmother, and falls in love], Blood and Chocolate [about a werwolf girl that falls in love with a human], Silver Kiss [about a vampire who falls in love with a human girl; though a little different from Twilight], Thirteen Reasons Why, [where a girl kills herself, them sends around seven cassette tapes. Each side of each tape tells a story, and each story is starred in by one person who contributed to her suicide. After you get the tapes you must pass them on to whoevers tape follows your, and then live with the knowledge for the rest of your life. I fthe chain is broken the tapes will be made public, so they all have to listen.] <br>  Hope I helped. =]]|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Try Angus Thongs & full frontal snogging there are a whole series written in diary style they are hilarious  you will love them no matter what your age they are by Louise Rennison|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Vampire Diaries series,Twilight series
Tv6NEg8Uaa	Well in united states history i learned many things such as the first americans, i learned about wars, i learned about the civil rights movement, i also learned about the presidents, the great depression, ETC. united states history is about the most powerful nation in the world which was the united states. i've learned that back then african americans didn't get treated right then that should have. i thought it was very rude that they were made into slaves. i mean don't get me wrong but not all african americans were slaves. i'm glad abraham lincoln made the emancipation proclamation because it made slaves free but not in the southern or border states.|`|XILeum48aa	I like ?.ily.?'s answer.<br>  I also think that if Abraham Lincoln didn't make the Emancipation Proclamation, african americans would probably still be slaves. I thought it was vary harsh that African americans had to do stuff for other people without getting paid.. I mean now every one is created equal and i love that. I think i'm trying to say that it was wrong for slavery to be invented... that's just my point of view for this topic. well anyways i also learned about the civil rights movement which took place during the 1950s and 1960s. The civil rights movement was a time where african americans and other ministries struggled to win equal rights that were guaranteed in the Constitution and the bill of rights. The civil rights movement talked about segregation, and about boycotting the buss es. i'm glad that Rosa Parks sat in front of the bus. I know it was wrong back then, but at least she proved a point. Even though she was arrested, people stood behind her for the chose she made.  hope this helps...<br>  also, United States History is about the most powerful nation in the whole nation that was the United States. <br>  United States History made me realize that you could do anything if you really put your mind to it.. It tough me more then i would ever know. like you could stand up for your rights if you really believe in them...|`|WZNaNvplaa	I learned there was a lot more to learn than we had time to cover in class.  There is a lot more about our country, good and bad, that the teachers are not allowed to or don't have time to teach. What we did learn in class was simply a good starting point to decide on what I would look up and read about later. You cannot learn American history, or World history, or Black history, or any history in school (not including college, where you can spend a whole year learning about one bit of history) and really understand anything about that history.  At best you can learn a few names and facts that will keep you from looking like a total idiot in a conversation. But if you really want to know something about, say the Nazis, or General Grant, or Alexander the Great, or the Gutenberg printing press, you are going to have to get online or to the library and look it up. The good news is there is plenty out there, as long as you have the interest.|`|AA10303012	I learned alot of interesting facts about a wide variety of subjects.  But what I think was most important was to not just readily accept the things you are told, because sometimes history can be manipulated by those who might stand to benefit or profit.<br>  <br>  It also teaches us to question things that dont seem quite right.  Like the conquest of the American natives (Indians), or the fight against communism in Viet Nam, or that the Confederacy was fighting for their "States rights" in the Civil War.  There is often alot of untruth in what is told to us, it is therefore our obligation to question, to reveal what the truth actually was, so that we may cease the unjustices done in the future and preserve justice for all.
YVxy0MJZaa	well i think the dialogue between humans is mostly realistic. there's some parts where its a little hard to believe though. but with the vampires, it's supposed to be from another era and they talk a little differently.|`|3dfqWqYwaa	I thought "Twilight" was a horrible book. The only way it maintained suspense was through the seductive parts. It was not a good book in my opinion. Just something written in stephanie meyers spare time|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	no. most normal teenagers don't talk like that, no matter how mature they are. i think the movie got it a little better then the actual book. it was mostly just verbal diarrhea|`|7tiH0gREaa	It's terrible. The good thing is it matches the rest of the books.|`|zpGccg1caa	Heck no. No guy says, "My darling, my love, you are my life, I would cease to exist without your angelic being" or some cheesy crap line like that to a girl. How the heck is that romantic?

TAIlyvgyaa	It doesn't draw me in at all, sorry but it's not well written whatsoever.<br>  <br>  A plot outline shouldn't end with a question, the terms 'one fateful day', 'life left in the balance' they are so over used and cliched.<br>  <br>  Also, safety net, that's like a fall back position, it implies something extra to keep her safe if something went wrong, not that she had a safe life to begin with.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you read a lot more, a LOT more, and from very varied genres too, pay attention to how writers express ideas and, in your own words - draw you in.<br>  <br>  The idea itself has a small amount of promise, if you had a very clear idea of what happens to the girl - even if she never escapes you have to have the how and why of that very clear in your head and actually say so, or looks like part of an idea, not a whole one.<br>  <br>  Keep trying.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	To be honest, it isn't all that good.<br>  <br>  What you wrote there, I could spread over 2 pages, make it more detailed.<br>  Put what memories she was thinking about. ect.|`|GzuiHX9Xaa	Quite a gripping story, but the vocabulary used sort of pushed me away, try using a thesaurus to find more interesting and gripping words, other than that, it sounds interesting! :)|`|R80OH2xraa	i would read it after you edited it<br>  sounds interesting, keep on writing!|`|Syuk7XsVaa	honestly, no.|`|xw74UzjMaa	It's okay but the grammar is really bad. You need to proof read your work and make sure it makes sense in you're own eyes before posting it. You've got a huge lack of punctuation where it's needed, as well as not breaking them in sentences when needed to. It should be something like this:<br>   <br>  As a child did you have a safety net? How would you have felt if your safety was in danger?<br>  <br>  Well, that's what happened to Jane Doe, a 13 year old girl from a small town called Les. Jane came from a loving home where she always felt safe, but on one fateful day her life was changed forever.<br>  One afternoon while Jane walked home from school, she encountered a man who claimed to be homeless. When Jane reached into her school bag to give him change, he grabbed her by the hand and shoved her into his old car. <br>  <br>  While Jane lay in the boot of the car, her life flashed before her; she couldn't help but wonder if she was going to die or survive.<br>  <br>  The man took her into his home, and keeps her there for years. Her life was left in the balance.<br>  <br>  Will she ever get out? Will she gain back the safety net she once knew? Only time will tell. <br>  <br>  Its basically the same but I edited it in a few areas for you and added some stuff here. If you don't like it, that's okay keep it the way it was. Personally, I think you need to add more description in - it's a bit bland, and doesn't draw you in.<br>  <br>  Obviously this is your first story attempt so it is a good attempt. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck<br>  <br>  Rose x|`|sw249oNFaa	Your writing seems very unprofessional and there are a lot of grammar mistakes.

His father was violent to both him and his mother. Both parents died when he was young. In his fighting of WW1 he saw many men die, many friends. He was wounded in fighting numerous times. He then decided that he would do anything to "save Germany". After the war he became friends, and was impressed by, with people who where antisemites. After a stint in jail, he then went on a campaign to save Germany, or , in his opinion, riding the lands of anyone who he believed was ruining it. <br>   He was just a charismatic madman. He believed that Jews (they appear to be the group that you are most concerned about) were ruining his beloved land, and wanted to rid it of them, killing about 6 million Jews (including some of my family) alone. If a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound? Well, Hitler was just a tree that everyone heard. At the time there were many antisemites, he just had the ability of rallying many people to his wills. There were many people just as evil as he, they were just trees that no one heard. <br>  I've read numerous WW2 books. For years it was my obsession, but then I decided that I really should get some sleep. (The nightmares were quite eexcruciating) Because you know what? That cwould'vebeen me; I'm jewish and I look it.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Wish he were in Africa..............Don't you think we should clone him.

AA11053540	I would suggest that you do some basic research on the subject, starting with:<br>  “Mapping Human History: Discovering the Past Through Our Genes” by Steve Olson<br>  "Genealogy 101" by Barbara Renick and <br>  "Trace Your Roots with DNA: Using Genetic Tests to Explore Your Family Tree" by Megan Smolenyak Smolenyak and Ann Turner.<br>  <br>  After that, despite what other say, log into www.familytreedna.com and see what they have to say.  Their site provides basic DNA schooling.<br>  <br>  Also, please consider all those TV shows such as CSI, NCIS, et al.  Whilest those shows do not accurately portray how involved and time intensive DNA research/searches are, they are based upon scientific analysis of DNA.<br>  <br>  Your DNA will reveal if you have red, white, black, yellow, or brown-skinned ancestors.  It will reveal if any of them were Sephardic or Ashkenazi Jew; whether your ancestors were Eskimos or Innuits or Saami, etc., etc., etc.<br>  <br>  Finally, I might point out that the scientist who discovered that DNA was different for males vs. females, whites vs. blacks vs. browns vs. yellows vs. reds was a black man.  He is still considered the world's foremost authority on using DNA to see where you came from; your DNA will tell him if your ancestors came from Northern Italy or Southern Italy, whether their ancestors were Jews, blacks, or whatever.<br>  <br>  So, read up!|`|AA12343309	Y & Mitochondrial are totally useless for that sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  You want a company that uses Autosomal DNA. Don't go to Ancestry.Com's, The National Geographic or FamilyTreeDNA..  FamilyTree does do Autosomal testing but they will not give you an analysis. I had to send my results from FamilyTreeDNA to DNATribes to get the analysis.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DNAtribes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DNAtribes.com</a><br>  <br>  When you go into their website, if you go under "feedback" there is a way you can email them and ask questions.<br>  <br>  They will not tell you that you  are 1/2 of something, 1/4 of something else and 1/4 of another something else.  The same DNA crosses national, racial and ethnic boundaries.<br>  <br>  What they will do is match you with population groups throughout the world.  They will give you your top matches.   Then they will break it down starting with the top as Northwestern European, Eastern European, the Aegean, the Mediterranean, North Ameridian, etc.  They will not show it in matter of percentages and fractions but will start with the top matches and work down.<br>  <br>  You get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents.  However, when you get back to your grandparents it is not necessarly a 25-25-25-25<br>  breakdown.  You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and 50% from your maternal grandparents but it is not even steven between your grandmother and grandfather in either case and will vary in how it lands in you and your siblings.   <br>  <br>  One chromosome each which you get from your parents is made up of your Y & Mitochondrial DNA.  That is the DNA that determines your sex.<br>  <br>  The other 22 each is made up of your Autosomal DNA  and it is the DNA that pretty much determines your genetic pattern.<br>  <br>  I asked DNATribes if my sister with whom I share both parents had the same Autosomal test<br>  would her results be the same and they replied.<br>  <br>  "Two siblings will each obtain unique results. Family members do typically share some regional or ethnic genetic affiliations, but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings."<br>  <br>  Also I had found a link where it stated you don't get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents and I asked a question on the 'Biology board and<br>  I got this response:<br>  <br>  "Actually, you do inherit your autosomal DNA 50-50 from each parent. That site is wrong.<br>  <br>  "Your mother's egg contributes one set of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome (an X). Your father's sperm contributes the other set of 22 autosomes, and another sex chromosome (either an X or a Y).<br>  <br>  "Where the 50-50 part breaks down is when you pass on your DNA to your children. Each of your children will get half their DNA from you, but they won't necessarily get an equal mix of what you inherited from your parents. They could inherit a more from your mother, through you, and less from your father, or vice versa.<br>  <br>  "Another way to look at it: you inherited 50% of your autosomal DNA from each parent, but you didn't necessarily inherit exactly 25% from each grandparent. Your maternal grandparents contributed exactly 50% in total, but it could be biased in favor of either your maternal grandmother or your maternal grandfather. Same goes for your paternal grandparents.<br>  <br>  "When you take one of those DNA tests, which markers they find depend on which ones you inherited through your mother and father, and that will be different between you and your siblings (assuming no identical twins). If one of your grandparents is Dutch, and another is Polish, you might happen to inherit more markers that the test considers NW Eur., and your sister might happen to inherit more that are considered E Eur. In most cases, that will just be a random chance. Also, just because you have more markers that the test considers NW Eur, doesn't necessarily mean you really are "more" NW Eur. in any real sense."<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  PhD in molecular biology<br>  <br>  Here is another link which can be helfpul.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/060293.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/0...</a><br>  <br>  Now, I can see where results from 2 different companies will also vary if one does not have population samples the other has. I don't know of another company that does this type of Autosomal analysis.<br>  <br>  The reason why you do not want to use a company that will only give you an analysis of Y & Mitochondrial is that they represent a very teeny weeny part of your ancestry.  If you had both done they would right off the bat leave out your paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather.  If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, you descend from 510 individuals.   Y & Mitochondrial would leave out 494 of them.<br>  <br>  One company that only uses Y & Mitochondrial advertises they will help you "discover your deep ancestral roots."   It is true in those 2 lines only they will take you back to your nomadic ancestors going back thousands of years. But you come from a myriad of family lines.  <br>  <br>  One tried to spin me and tell me the only time a person would want to have the Autosomal tested for regiona/ethnic background is if your are biracial. That is a lot of malarky.|`|hlkAosk2aa	Yep, cause your genes contain all information about where you came from.<br>  <br>  Unless the lab assistant screwed up the test.

W0qNkROpaa	I'd be impressed at the Iliad and the Odyssey, but not really at the others.  I'd read a few of them by that age, and so had some of my friends.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	Not really. <br>  <br>  I'm not just saying that because I'm annoyed you're bragging (which let's admit, you are) but because I had a seriously browbeating father and read Charles Dickens, Jules Verne and other classics when I was about seven and a half. So from what I've experienced, reading them in 6th grade really isn't that much of an accomplishment. But of course to the average 6th grader who's just mastering Jacqueline Wilson, it's fairly impressive, I'll give you that.|`|wKSvnna2aa	Are you reading them to impress, or are you reading them because they interest you greatly? If the latter, then yes.|`|FAUPZeSxaa	It is impressive if you understand them.  Just so you know it sounds like you are bragging a bit.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	i read some of those in 6th grade too :). but yeah, that's pretty impressive|`|RvbPHhI8aa	Considering that I was in grade 2 when I read the Narnia series in one night and I was in grade 4 when I read the Lord of the Rings series... no. By the end of ele school, I had read most of the classics.<br>  <br>  Just out of curiosity (I am Canadian, so my test names might be a tad bit different..) did you ever do a C-CAT test to see if you were "gifted" in English?

This can be a huge asset to you later on in life. However, remember that some people don't pick up reading as easily as others. I also had a high reading comprehension level at a young age, mostly because my mother read to me constantly when I was young. I still dropped out of high school at 15. So, make sure you stick with it and remember that school is IMPORTANT. Everything you do now will set you up for either failure or success later in life.|`|vGid3WG1aa	Not really- I mean, you are young, and most people don't encounter those kinds of books until much older (for me, i was about 14/15). But just because you read them doesn't mean you understood them, and knew every word and their meanings. I could have read the Illiad at your age, but i doubt I would have truly comprehended the meaning. It's just words on a page.<br>  <br>  And if you did understand them, then good for you! But it does not impress me- the mere fact that you come on YA and boast about your reading skills to strangers is completely unimpressive. It sounds boastful, sorry.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound rude, i love reading, and you do also. Keep at it.<br>  What is your favorite Dickens book? Mine is the pickwick papers- it is funnier than most of his other work. Sometimes Dickens can drag a little, but this one made me laugh.<br>  <br>  xx|`|qg11igznaa	Eh, I would say that you're bragging a bit. Still, good for you. That is impressive, indeed. However, lots of kids read those books and don't comprehend them. Good job that you read classics, but I doubt that a 6th grader could fully understand all the undertones and themes these books have to offer. If you're just reading them for the sake of bragging, then you really miss the mark.

He tended to get "feelings", a sort of "sixth sense", about his quarry's whereabouts, which aided him in the hunt. Though it's never explicitly stated, perhaps this was the ability he brought over from his human life. He never lost his quarry, except in one case (Alice) where his prey was turned into a vampire before he could attack her because Alice's scent was very intoxicating to him like Bella's is to Edward. For revenge, James murdered Alice's creator, causing Alice to be alone. Unlike the Cullens, he drank human blood as his food source. His mate is Victoria, another sadistic almost feline-like vampire. Their coven soon joined by Laurent, another strong vampire. <br>  The character appeared different to its description, having long blond hair pulled back into a ponytail. <br>  <br>  He met his demise after tricking Bella into a trap at her old ballet studio in Phoenix, where he brutally attacked and almost killed her. He bit her right hand before he was destroyed by Emmett and Jasper, who ripped his body into pieces and burned the remains. <br>  <br>  It was later revealed that he once hunted a werewolf across Siberia, but apparently did not know what his prey was – it is unknown if he caught it.<br>  <br>  Victoria - It is unknown which vampire transformed Victoria. However, sometime after she became a vampire in 1914, Victoria became the mate of the tracker James and was a member of his small coven, along with Laurent. <br>  After coming across the Olympic Coven, Victoria assisted James, her lover and coven leader, in tracking their familiar Bella Swan. When he failed to kill the human, and he himself was killed, Victoria declared revenge on Edward Cullen, and as such, secretly began to plan to kill his mate; Bella Swan. <br>  Victoria later returned to Forks in the hopes of destroying Bella to get back at Edward for murdering James. However, she failed to attack Bella due to the vigilant protection of Jacob Black and the other Quileute shifters. Bella saw what she believed was fire on the water after she went cliff diving, but this was actually Victoria and her hair, she having been forced to retreat into the ocean by the Quileutes. <br>  After this, Victoria created an army of newborn vampires in nearby Seattle, where she killed over thirty people of all ages, races, and size to build her army. Eventually, while her army was fighting with the Cullens and werewolves, she and Riley, another vampire she created, came across Edward Cullen, Bella Swan, and Seth Clearwater (a werewolf). She then fought Edward while Riley battled Seth. Seth killed Riley, and Victoria tried to escape. However, Edward caught her and proceeded to kill her. Subseuently, Victoria and Riley's remains were burned and her newborn army defeated. <br>  Victoria was described as feline or cat-like with long, swirling red hair that was usually described as looking like wild fire. She was very pretty and had a high-pitched, girly voice that contrasted with her fierce appearance.<br>  Victoria, like all vampires, possessed inhuman beauty, speed, strength, endurance, and agility. Victoria's special ability was to know when a place was safe to escape to, which is how she managed to evade being captured by the Quileute werewolves in New Moon. How this ability carried over from her human life is unknown. <br>  <br>  Laurent - Laurent was an original member of James' coven. When James and Victoria chose to hunt Bella Swan, Laurent told the Cullens everything about them. <br>  After this, Laurent went to live with the Denali Coven; despite living with "vegetarian" vampires, Laurent cheated the diet as evidenced by his red irises. <br>  When Bella visited Edward's meadow, Laurent stumbled across her, having returned to Forks as a scout for the vengeful Victoria. He attempted to kill Bella (he was currently hunting when he found her) and he reasoned that being killed by him was a better fate than being found by Victoria. However, Laurent was killed by Jacob Black in his werewolf form and four other werewolves before he could strike. Strangely, he recognized the werewolves for what they truly were. This may have been because he accompanied James on a hunt for a werewolf across Siberia years beforehand. However Bella had no idea as to what these strange creatures were so she had also fled in terror after the wolves chased Laurent out of the clearing. <br>  Laurent is described as an olive skinned, dark haired vampire with a French accent. Bella Swan considered Laurent to be easily the most attractive out of himself, James and Victoria. He appeared to have little sense of loyalty as he betrayed James's plans, his long time coven leader, to the Cullens. In addition, he also betrayed the Denali Coven by disregarding their vegetarian diet. Laurent also turned on the Cullens by trying to kill Bella which is very disrespectful. <br>  He appeared quite different to his description in the books, being dark skinned and having dreadlocks. <br>  <br>  Garrett - Garr|`|bZwDVK7Laa	look at this pic:<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2744796949_dd1721eabb.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2744...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  From left: James,Laurent,Victoria
lPxVt2XYaa	The Discourses are, in many ways, an extension of the Prince.  They are a detailed description of the ways that a republic should be run.  There are three parts to them: how a republic should be managed, on war and the qualities of individual leadership.  In them Machiavelli draws on Livy, and on other sources and examples from ancient history to illustrate his points.<br>  They are a fairly easy read - it's been a while since I read them, but they are very readable, and, if you liked the Prince, then you will enjoy them.<br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.timoroso.com/philosophy/machiavelli/introduction#discourses" rel="nofollow">http://www.timoroso.com/philosophy/machi...</a><br>  <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/zoebrigley/entry/kristeva_on_the_1_2/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/zoebrigley/en...</a><br>  <br>  You're right - there is very little information on the web about them.
AA10981338	if you read the portion of Midnight Sun available on the author's website from Edward's point of view you can understand why he gets irritated.

And once I'm pretty sure that everyone's forgotten about it, I think I'll be able to get to the place where I'm alone with it again. Then I'll be able to sneak in and work on it again." This statement jokingly lead to the creation of a nickname for Midnight Sun, created at the Twilight Lexicon: Dark High Noon, in an attempt to still be able to talk about Midnight Sun, but not mention its name directly. <br>  <br>  In short, stop asking questions about it if you want her to continue, or refer to the book as Dark High Noon.<br>  <br>  And, for future reference, it's Stephenie, not Stephanie.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|79b2yM3saa	hey is the nurse 1 from romeo and juliet (we just read that)<br>  - dill arrives<br>  - ms. maudies house burns down<br>  - ms. dubose's past is unvieled (teaches courage)<br>  - tom's trial (dur!)<br>  - build snowman<br>  -scout yells at walter for the syrup incident<br>  - kids go to cal's church<br>  - family reunion and get guns<br>  - then atticus says 'don't shoot mockingbirds'<br>  -scout realizes everything from boo's perspective at end of book<br>  - bob ewell, tom, dies<br>  - loads more!!!<br>  sparknotes.com!

ZpXFulyCaa	Of all the members in this big family, pick one or two to serve as main characters.  Give them desires/goals, and write the story about the obstacles they face as they try to achieve those goals.  <br>  <br>  It's up to you if it has a happy or a sad ending.  You can mix the emotions up within the story, and it could still end either way--happy or sad.  Happy is nicer, because when you write enough sad endings, you could bum yourself out.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah.  Those obstacles could add the suspense you need.<br>  <br>  It's your story and writing it will be part of the journey.  You may find that you're surprised at the end yourself. <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your writing!|`|5wg7tKc6aa	To be honest, it's totally up to you.  Do you want it to end happy, or sad?  What events bring forth emotion to the point of nearly breaking up a family, or bonding a family, or both?  It depends on the religion/culture of this family, as far as events go.  Just, base it on your family, or a friend of yours family.<br>  <br>  Maybe the small family (mom, dad, kids), go on a road trip to another country for a huge family wedding, and find themself facing problems along the way, and even more when they get with the rest of their family.<br>  <br>  Maybe they can discover who they all are.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it, though.

kiD47XbTaa	A pun is the humorous use of a word or phrase so as to emphasize or suggest its different meanings or applications, or the use of words that are alike or nearly alike in sound but different in meaning; a play on words. For example, "The pigs were a squeal". <br>  <br>  Do you mean, is the title "The Taming of the Shrew" a pun?<br>  Well, actually "The Taming of the Shrew" is more like a metaphor because it is comparing Katharine to a shrew, a mouse-like mammal that is extremely mean-tempered. <br>  The title is mainly representing Petruchio's 'taming' of Katherine (the shrew). <br>  <br>  If you are unsure of what a pun means, here are some examples:<br>  * Decimals have a point.<br>  * My friend lives by a cliff he's always telling me to drop over.<br>  * The bargain store promised a free abacus with every purchase, but I wouldn't count on it.<br>  * Yesterday I rode my bike twice, I guess that makes me a recycler.<br>  * The untruthful deli clerk was full of baloney.<br>  * The railway constructions are on track.<br>  * When it pours, it reigns.<br>  <br>  I hope i've helped.|`|XwV1bar5aa	idk about the taming shrew thing but a pun is a play on words...like when you use two meanings of the same words to tie together a situation.(omigosh that was so cool. (saying after coming in from a snow ball fight) meaning that it was both cold and fun) ...and yeah they usually are that lame.<br>  <br>  and the taming the shrew thing is probably specific to your situation so think about it real hard.

I'll assume you mean new diseases they suffered from after the arrival of "Old World" settlers.<br>  <br>  One of the most devastating diseases that Europeans exposed Native American populations to was smallpox.  Others included tyhpus, cholera, influenza, measles, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, mumps, yellow fever, pertussis, and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis.  Undoubtedly there were viral or bacterial strains of related or similar diseases that the aboriginal poplulation had also not been exposed to and consequently suffered from as well, even the "common" cold.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	from white folks rt? smallpox, measles n mumps, i kno

d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I have to admit, I have ideas flowing so quickly I thus far cannot fathom not having an idea.  At any one time I have up to eighteen works in progress, then I have another 8 to ten documents that I'm just playing around with.  Challenges I was tinkering around with, concepts I wanted to try and other projects my hand was itching to get on.<br>  ---     As for my inspiration it usually comes from reading a book that isn't particularly well written or one that is exceptionally well done.  I read a book and decide that story sucks but then an idea will take root on how to improve it and make it my own.  If it is done well then I challenge myself to be creative as well as working on being better.  I play around with voice, style, setting, and maybe even create a character for myself where none belonged.  It isn't fan fiction only because ultimately my work grows outside of itself very quickly.  A character and notion start and the next thing I know I'm researching, writing, and talking to myself as if the characters are alive.<br>  <br>  ---  Also when life sucks I can write something and make it better, I can have the love affair I've always wanted, I can have seventeen kids, adopted children or none at all.  I can be trim like a model or built like a football player, I can be the fly on the wall or the super hero, I get to be a doctor, lawyer, police man, stay at home mom, porn star, drug dealer or a Succubus, an angel a demon etc...|`|BLMh0dG6aa	S.

95Hw7cHKaa	I'm also 16 and I've started writing my own novel. If you would like to write a story then you should just sit down with a pen and paper, (make sure you're relaxed though) and something will come to you. Start with brain storming first, what characters, places, plot etc. You need a good plan to follow through out the thing so you have to make one that you will carry out. Then start writing. Let the pen take you to another place. It's a good feeling knowing you can write your own material and other people love to read it. Word of advise though hun, do not write about vampires. They're way too over rated now. Good luck! x|`|MLlTCJhdaa	I think you should have a plan, or outline for your book first. i'm writing a novel too, and it's really helpful when you get all main things in your book in line. And if you don't really know how to start, that's fine, start out from a scene you're sure of and then you can go back to the beginning when you get more ideas. Good Luck!!!|`|8EMW3aLQaa	i dont write books as a rule... I started writing a journal about my life ...but the computer crashed and that was the end of that for a while... just start writing and see how it goes, if you like the way it is panning out go with it ..... I am sure most writers just start writing.... not everyone needs a plan... the english language is dynamic.. it changes like the weather.. all your plans can come unstuck....just start writing... a direction will unfold.. I hope that helps.|`|Bl9sJAydaa	You should have it mostly planned out first, either on paper or in your head.<br>  <br>  Then connect the dots.|`|C8u2jBu7aa	honestly, i am not a great writer, but what i find easy to do is start by writing a chapter or so of what you want it to be, an equivalent of a third or fourth chapter, after the character introductions. This can give you a better understanding of you character without giving them specific traits as of yet.|`|hat60KYXaa	I've never written a novel, but I am a writer and I can suggest planning out your characters and settings first, doing a rough outline, then a detailed outline before you start writing the 1st chapter.  Good luck!|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	There's no right or wrong way to write a novel, but the zillions of incomplete novels include a large majority which did not have a master plan. The author just started writing to see where it went, and it didn't go into a novel-length story. (That's a perfectly good method for a short story, IMO.)<br>  <br>  So I recommend a master plan with a beginning, a middle, and an end, each in some detail, before you begin. Brainstorm with others, or spend a lot of time thinking it through on your own. Coming up with an outline or synopsis is something that should take weeks, and if it comes faster it's probably too short, shallow, or in some way flawed.<br>  <br>  Then write a little every day, no matter what. Follow your plan, and if you get a great idea, rework the plan before you start writing again.|`|o8Yl1vdYaa	Writing is different for everyone because just like painting, it is an art. Many people will tell you to write an outline but that's just how they do it and can't see just flat out writing. I'm no different then that but in the opposite way. I can't write an outline or i get bored with going over the story so much. Usually i just have a basic idea of the plot and characters in my head and let the rest flow into the story. It's different for everyone and the only way to find out how you do it is to do exactly that; do it.<br>  Just start writing, and if it's not working out, go back and make an outline. You'll find what you need to do in no time at all.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|kEWknILEaa	If you are just starting out, don't put to much pressure on yourself.  The first thing I would do is try to come up with a story idea that you either like or that you think other people will be interested in reading.  If you want to be published, you want to keep in mind that there is a standard sort of three-act structure to most fiction:<br>  <br>  Act 1:  a problem emerges in the life of the main character(s)<br>  Act 2:  the main character works to overcome the problem, with less than complete success.  Generally, the protagonists efforts cause more problems, or else there is an opposition character who is frustrating the main character<br>  Act 3  The problem is resolved.<br>  <br>  The final resolution doesn't have to be a 'happy ending.'  It can end tragically, if that's the way you want to go.<br>  <br>  Once you have a basic three act structure in mind... <br>  <br>  (and you don't have to work out all the details.  You don't even have to know if your main character will end up with the guy she's in love with at the beginning of the story, if the story is about a girl trying to catch a particular guy...Just have an idea of how it might go, in really broad terms.  Does a better match for her appear halfway through the book, while she's holding her first guy's girlfriend hostage?  Might she end up with this second guy, instead?)<br>  <br>  ...start writing.  I wouldn't expect to write the whole story out.  Just start learning to write basic scenes.  Also, plan out what sort of personality your character will have.  Maybe you'll base the character on the personality of someone you know...so you'll know how your heroine will react when the police are at her front door and the guy's girlfriend is banging on the clothes dryer in the laundry room, demanding to be let out (since that's where she's keeping her.)<br>  <br>  Learn how to write good, interesting scenes with dialogue that doesn't sound artificial.  You learn how to do this by reading other writers' dialogue and by listening to the people you come into contact with and by letting other people read your work and tell you what they think.<br>  <br>  Getting feedback is really important if you want to learn to write publishable fiction.  You have to look for the right people.  Because a lot of people will tell you that everything you write is great, even if it isn't, just because they don't want to hurt your feelings.  And then other people will just tell you everything that's wrong with your writing, and then tell you that they hate it and it's no good, because they don't know how to point out the good things in someone's writing.<br>  <br>  I recommend getting hooked up with a writers group.  Going to meetings where you get to see or hear other writer's work can really inspire you and encourage you, keep you motivated.  Other writers can give you valuable feedback on your writing.  I've made tons of progress as a writer through my interactions with other writers in the three writers groups I've been involved with.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11151307	Brain-storming is a good start.<br>  <br>  But you can also experiment with your various ideas and start writing on the one which interests you the most.<br>  <br>  That's how I did it when I was 14.

kEWknILEaa	There is no set standard for chapter lengths.  Some people will write 70,000 word novel with 35 two-thousand-word chapters; while other people will write a 120,000 word novel with 6 twenty-thousand word chapters.  <br>  <br>  The author decides what will make the most sense to them.<br>  <br>  Generally, more literate language oriented novels will have longer chapters.  More action, plot-oriented novels will have shorter chapters.  That's just my take, though, from my reading.  I try to make my chapters around ten to twenty pages.  I don't like to write much shorter than an eight page chapter, but that's on a courier font, 12 pt., double-spaced.<br>  <br>  Single spacing will save on paper cost when you're printing up your work to look at, but when submitting material to a publisher they will nearly always require that your work be double spaced.|`|AA11151307	4, maybe 5 pages.<br>  <br>  7 tops.|`|pbw7chpyaa	From one word to 40,000 words.

Continued conflict with the Kingdom of Prussia led to the Seven Years War, (1756 - 1763), and later to the War of the Bavarian Succession. <br>  <br>  she focused her internal and external policies towards the defeat of Prussia, which would help her regain the lands which had been taken from Austria. The Anglo-Austrian Alliance proved crucial as Great Britain sent troops and financial subsidies to support the Austrians<br>  <br>  She increased the size of the army by 200% and increased taxes in order to guarantee a steady income for the government, and in particular for the military.

Are you asking why the battle was fought then, or why the war started?<br>  <br>  Why the war started is a much debated question. But essentially what it boils down to is that the US became involved in order to prevent the spread of communism from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. This was a gradual escalation, originally involving advisers and clandestine technical support.<br>  <br>  As for the Tet offensive itself, the North Vietnamese army attacked during the Tet holiday in the hopes that they would catch their enemy off guard. As with every large scale attack by the North it was initially successful, but the US forces quickly rallied and pushed them back. The US didn't lose the Vietnam war on the battlefield, they lost it in the political arena.|`|KHSOVxViaa	The war had different visions, as viewed from each side.  To the North and their allies, it was primarily a nationalist war of reunification and independence.  To the South and its allies, it was a war to prevent the spread of communism.<br>  <br>  Background:<br>  <br>  The French colony of Vietnam was invaded by the Japanese in WW II, who defeated the French locally.  A Vietnamese nationalist leader, Ho Chi Minh, fought the new occupiers and was supported by the Allies.  He had considerable success and became a national hero.  After the war the French returned, opposed by Ho Chi Minh who wanted Vietnam to be independent.  After being rebuffed by the USA, he turned to communist China, and later the USSR for support, and fought against the French.<br>  <br>  His forces took most of the north, and he defeated France in a big battle at Dien Bien Phu.  France agreed to talks, which resulted in the Geneva Accords of 1954.  Under its terms, France would withdraw form the north and Vietnam would be temporarily divided in two at a ceasefire line (later DMZ).  The country was to be reunified in 1956 following elections.<br>  <br>  Ho Chi Minh's government controlled the north, and a new government by Bao Dai was formed at Saigon in the south.  However, Bao Dai was quickly overthrown by Diem, who refused to recognise the validity of the Geneva accords, refused to have the agreed elections, and blocked all moves towards reunification.<br>  <br>  Many people in the South were unhappy with this, and they formed a guerilla army to fight Diem's regime.  This was backed by the North, and became the National Liberation Front (NLF, nicknamed 'Vietcong').  They increased their activites, and Diem's government struggled to resist them.<br>  <br>  This was the height of the Cold War, and the USA feared a communist takeover of South-East Asia.  It feared Ho Chi Minh's intentions, thinking he would attempt to spread the ideology beyond Vietnam.  It saw South Vietnam as a bulwark against communism, and sent in advisors to help the government, replacing the withdrawn French.<br>  <br>  Still the NLF made gains, and US forces began combat operations.  After a perceived clash with North Vietnamese forces (Tonkin Incident), operations began against North Vietnam.  By 1968 US forces were doing the bulk of the fighting against the NLF and North.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tet:<br>  <br>  Before the Tet offensive, the US-backed South Vietnam forces (ARVN) appeared to be gaining the upper hand.  In 1967 there had been a large offensive by the NLF which had failed.  US commander Westmoreland estimated they had lost the bulk of their fighting strength, and were no longer a significant threat.<br>  <br>  The intention behind the Tet offensive was to take and hold strategic locations all over South Vietnam, and encourage a general uprising against the government and US backers.  This would force the US to withdraw and the Saigon government to capitulate, bring the war to a speedy end.<br>  <br>  The offensive was carefully planned and kept secret - it came as a complete surprise.  Initially the NLF took a large number of important objectives, including many 'prestigious' sites in Saigon.  The North Vietnamese Army (NVA) infiltrated close to Hue in the north, and took most of the city in their surprise attack.  However they could not sustain their gains, and quickly lost much of these as ARVN and US forces counter-attacked.<br>  <br>  Only in Hue did the communist forces hold out for a long time - there was a prolonged fight over control of the city's citadel, and eventually the US/ARVN triumphed.<br>  <br>  Militarily the Tet offensive was a failure for the NVA & NLF, but it gave a huge psychological blow to the US and South Vietnam, who realised that their opponents could make significant comebacks and were far from a spent force.<br>  <br>  It was a profound shock for many of the US population, who had generally been fed stories of successes prior to this.  It increased the number of people who questioned the government's version of the situation, and wisdom of the war in general. Opposition to it grew steadily from that point.<br>  <br>  Ultimately it was this public opinion that caused the US government to wind down their involvement and eventually withdraw in 1972.  The weakened and unsupported South Vietnam could no longer resist, and NVA forces finally took Saigon in 1975.
HJaVcUGwaa	Actually none of the answers is correct, as the plan proposed to divide Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab State.  The Jewish state means a state with a Jewish majority, while the Arab state will have an Arab majority.<br>  <br>  Though it sounds similar, Answer B is wrong because it implies that all the Jews will be in one state, and all the Arabs in the other, which would necessitate ethnic cleansing.  The other possible meaning for a "State for the Jews" and a "State for the Arabs" is that such states have religious discrimination against people of the other religion, which is against UN and international laws.<br>  <br>  In any case, the link in the first answer clearly uses the terminology "Jewish State" and "Arab State", and does not use the terms "State for the Jews" and "State for the Arabs".<br>  <br>  What actually happened was not what the UN proposed, as the Zionists took much more that what was allocated to them in the plan, and they ethnically cleansed 80% of the Arabs from the land they occupied and formed Israel over it.

Bk4eIAWWaa	Any daylight balanced light will do. Since you need a very bright light in the back I would use one of your 300's there and replace the fill light.Do you have a flash that you can slave?<br>  <br>  When I do white backgrounds I actually use two lights on the white background and two or three (if I need a hair light) in the front.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: from you sample I think you are putting far too much light on the background. You are getting splash. Actually in spite of what peopple say, I never light my backdrop more than 1/2 stop over my foreground.. <br>  <br>  How about a reflector? That would be an inexpensive alternative to another light. I have actually used foil space blankets.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	No wonder your background is yellow.  You are mixing incandescent (3400 degrees K) light with flash (5200 - 5600 degrees K).<br>  <br>  You need to use an additional flash on your background (two stops hotter than your key and fill light) to get a good white background.<br>  <br>  If you would take a few classes in photography, this and many more techniques will become clear to you and you will not be stuck in the "try and fail" mode of shooting.|`|0LgpcOBDaa	unfortunately, you will need a 3rd semi powerful flash.<br>  <br>  I would check the pawn shops in your area or any real camera stores still open and see if they have anything used.<br>  <br>  Now, depending on a few factors here, you "may" be able to get by with a camera mount type flash (not to be used on the camera tho).<br>  <br>  use one of your interfit lights as the background light. use 1 as the main light and use the camera flash (now on a stand) as your shadow fill light. seeing as you can dial the power on your flash heads you can adjust the lighting to match the power output of the smaller flash unit you bought used.<br>  <br>  If your using the Ir remote to fire your flashes, or the supplied cords, you could also get a strobe eye to fire the 3rd light as well.<br>  <br>  a strobe eye is a light sensitive peanut looking thingie you plug the pc cord of the flash into. as one flash goes off the eye sees this flash and sets the other flash(s) off too...<br>  <br>  I see you added more info.. your nikon flashes would work excellent here, just go to the local camera store and buy a slave eye for them (or 1 of them) and attach the flash to a stand.<br>  <br>  depending on how powerful the 3rd flash is and how you mount it to a stand, you could bet by really cheap and be under $50...<br>  <br>  however, if your doing this as a business and wishing to be as "pro" as you can about it, you may just have to buy a 3rd Interfit light...<br>  <br>  as your link to the image shows, your doing something right.. haha, and you just need to keep doing it..<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  bob - tucson<br>  <br>  ps - my lights are Interfit as well, older colorflash 500s

OYWqaDtOaa	First of all, 13 and 17 year-olds in the 16th century are not the same as 13 and 17 year-olds in the 21 century.  The customs surrounding marriage, sex, and love were all different back then.  Thus, teenagers should not be modeling the behavior of fictional characters from a text written more than 400 years ago.  <br>  <br>  Second of all, Romeo and Juliet did not both commit suicide intentionally.  Romeo kills himself because he thinks Juliet is dead.  When Juliet wakes and sees Romeo's fatal mistake, she kills herself.  It's not like they engaged in a suicide pact, so I don't think they encourage anyone to kill themselves.  Also, it seems like not many teenagers would find themselves in Romeo and Juliet's bizarre situation, so they are unlikely to commit suicide on that account.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't think Romeo and Juliet really have that much of an impact on the lives of many teenagers.  They may learn to love Shakespeare or develop a passion for romantic stories, but they won't copy the actions of the characters.|`|D6FBLQfwaa	No, it isnt.

<br>  It was called “A Soul By The Sea”.<br>  You told me with pride<br>  I'd exactly described<br>  How you feel when you're by the sea.<br>  <br>  The word Death has no place<br>  Inside my mind's space: <br>  You've simply changed your clothes.<br>  The music for your Goodbye<br>  Was my honour to find, <br>  So a piece called The Waves I chose.<br>  <br>  You came to thank me, <br>  That's how I know you're free, <br>  As one night in bed I lay: <br>  I talked to you a while, <br>  Said 'Goodnight' with a smile, <br>  And you made my jewellery box play.<br>  <br>  Each time I go to the beach, <br>  For your spirit I reach<br>  And inhale the fresh air of the sea.<br>  In this calm atmosphere<br>  Your old saying I hear: <br>  ”Fresh air's the only thing that is free”.<br>  <br>  Now I can't hold your hand<br>  But when I touch the sand<br>  It's just like being right next to you.<br>  Your face I still see<br>  In my memory<br>  And I sometimes can hear your voice, too.<br>  <br>  Amid the salty sea air<br>  Your remains are now there, <br>  Overlooking the rocks and the caves.<br>  In the sun, wind and rain<br>  You can swim once again; <br>  Forever you're riding the waves.<br>  <br>  <br>  ? 21st October 2007 <br>  <br>  Melanie Ann Calvert <br>   <br>   <br>  Oh, and here is site with a few poems about/from beaches and soul. I hope that is of some help. :] <br>  <a href="http://dreamywaves.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dreamywaves.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope it's not too late ... hehehe <br>  Good luck in the video, honey! <br>  I hope it helped.

4vbovQKJaa	It's not unusual at all.  I run into the same problem all the time.  I get so tied up with the daily routine that I never get time to myself to sit and write.  And when I do find the time, I usually end up sitting at the computer and playing a game instead of writing.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that I've found that works for me is to schedule a block of time that I will ONLY focus on writing.  And once I start, I can't stop, and it motivates me to pick it up again the next day so I can finish my thoughts or the chapter or the scene, etc.  I also keep a notebook of all the stories that pop into my head so I don't forget them as they develop.  <br>  <br>  As for publishing, you shouldn't even have that thought in your head (although I think all writers have the dream of penning a best seller!).  So few writers get their books/novels/stories published that, while it's a great goal, it may be unrealistic to expect yours to make it.  You should write because you love it and because the story won't go away until you write it down.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!!!

l9Xg8Dv4aa	This alien invasion by lizards who are chameleons. They take human form and go unnoticed among Humans.<br>   They use newspapers to tell lies and keep people fighting among themselves, so they will never suspect the lizards.Then when Television comes along, they use it to put Humans into a trance They have been here for centuries eating Humans (missing persons, homeless)<br>  Occasionally they are discovered but destroy the entire colony (civilization) before the whole world finds out.<br>  They work their way into high places and plan one day to rule the world. The only problem is that if Humans ever find out It is all over for them, because Humans are mammals and Mammals release adrenalin  when they sense danger.<br>  The Humans Must not wake up!<br>  If they do, they will see that the world has been polluted FOR the Lizards. Chem trails released in the atmosphere to slowly poison Humans and keep them slow and stupid! While it is ideal atmosphere for Lizards. Then When it is too late, the lizards do not care who knows about them<br>   Sceeery, huh?|`|SpHbrSFLaa	how about.. hmmm  how about a horror book? ill read it!
6pszwwl7aa	For just starting out you are off to a great start. Keep working at it. Never be happy. Always be trying to improve.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot...</a>|`|GgVufxlHaa	I just recently started using Flickr too. I love photography, but am just getting started out (I have the Canon Rebel XTi, and it's a pretty good beginner DSLR). I love your photography though! Seriously, for just starting out that's amazing. You seem to have a real natural talent. I also love the Stones and Beatles references...Paint it Black and Lucy in the Sky? You can't go wrong, haha.|`|AA10833445	There is one main difference between fine art painter & a photographer.<br>  That is;<br>  The Fine Art painter can memorise the scenic beauty of the site/ spot and can come back in front of the aisel and finish the art on canvas. Whereas the photographer has to shoot the picture then & there itself.<br>  Secondly. the fine art painter uses colour & brush to highlight the mood in his painting, whereas the photographer can do this only by utilising the natural light. Hence we can say that the photographer paints with light.<br>  The equipment is secondary, but the planning & use of proper lighting conditions is of paramount importance in Photography.<br>  Wish you a good time ahead, flickering, clicking & shooting.|`|b24a63ab0fefcb0091951039cb962b43aa	They were the normal of taking pictures, no experiences at all.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	I really like where your going.

ceBTTCPwaa	Survivor is a novel by Chuck Palahniuk. A satire of commercial culture, it is the story of Tender Branson, a member of the Creedish Church, a death cult. In it, every member learns how to be a servant for the human race—most of them are butlers and maids—and fear most human pleasures. They await a sign from God to tell them to deliver themselves unto Him; that is, they must commit suicide.<br>  <br>  The sign finally comes, and a good ten years later, Tender becomes the last surviving member of the cult. He is thrown into mainstream culture and becomes a personal icon for many people.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(novel)#Themes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(n...</a>

tJr8aFDpaa	Analysis:<br>  <br>  This is deeper than we think. Moon indicates night-time, and thereby sets a natural tone for somnolence. Clouds are often associated with a dream state, whih, of course is in turn associated with the state of somnolence, induced by the night-time atmosphere. Now, the poet asserts "cool cool" as an object/person that can be slept with. overall, sleep is cool, and the night is also a very cool time of day. therefore, the sleep occurs in a general state/atmosphere of cool cool. <br>  <br>  :)|`|htxwTAAQaa	There is not even a coherent thought.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	This is not english|`|wWL934E8aa	cool cool<br>  <br>  means<br>  <br>  cuddling <br>  <br>  closer|`|n9hRyHpqaa	The moon is cool, sleep is cool, sleeping with clouds is cool.<br>  I thinks it's cool, cool, cool.

HORACAnlaa	Common sense since it is the foundation of both philosophy and science.|`|CLB32006aa	science|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i'll just say common sense<br>  religion is passion<br>  science is reason<br>  common sense is practical<br>  but i could argue for a different combination|`|uyQXdKLiaa	They are all equally shitty. All religion was constructed by men as a means to answer the unanswerable and thus has no basis in reality. Science consistently proves itself to be inconsistent and the various theories and 'laws' when applied to the natural world don't seem to add up. And common sense is the worst form of sense, just as anything common is the worst form of that thing. What people generally know is a construct of lies, misinterpretations and useful, but meaningless concepts. <br>  <br>  The main problem with all three of these is that they were all created by humans, and as Kant put it, "From the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made"|`|aBqJhdufaa	Science. With it, you know all common sense and religion, well, the truths anyway.|`|cxDbdhELaa	Common sense tends to pick up the best of what formal categories tend to offer.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Common sense.<br>  <br>  it's pretty good common sense to check out the facts and have a wee look at science, however.  Only a dumbo would ignore the obvious and proveable physical reality around him.<br>  <br>  Mind you, only a dumbo would consider that to be all the story.  The world is not merely physical, there's all that metaphysical reality as well.<br>  <br>  It's common sense to take it all into consideration.<br>  <br>  Definitely common sense is top of this pyramid.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	A little bit of this and a little bit of that - to think and question is really where it is at.<br>  <br>  We humans need rules - The 10 Commandments is a pretty good start.<br>  We also need science, philosophy, poetry, arts, mathematics, intuition, language, physical and mental health and an an extremely large dose of common sense.|`|veufnjsNaa	I would have to say common sense. Religion has been the cause of so much death, destruction, and suffering since the beginning of time. Its just not a logical way of life. Common sense may vary to each individual, but it does not necessarily hurt anybody.|`|U5nwTswfaa	Science.<br>  Don't confuse science with technology. They're very different things.<br>  <br>  Technology is the product of science.<br>  <br>  Science is a rigorous way of looking at the world. <br>  <br>  religion is mythology.<br>  <br>  Common sense is simply a scientific way of looking at things.|`|8ekoa6szaa	Common sense.  Religion is . . .  too abstract for me.  Science is great for what it is.  But we all need common sense to get along in this world.|`|Nli9LDavaa	all are needed i think. but if you want me to pick then science.|`|X4xdLXKaaa	Well Science is how But religion is why so i would say those two

fefYXm71aa	nope|`|pY0n2qDKaa	No. I am cool but I don't smoke.|`|AA10698846	What would you say to American Indians if you actually saw them with pipe in hand. My point being, not everyone "smokes" just to be cool. What about past presidents that smoked? I don't think they were trying to be cool, didn't need to be. I think it used to be better known as a pleasure, like an after dinner mint sort-of. Had most of these people had the knowledge that is known about smoking today, I don't think they would want to be cool. It is a bit yucky in todays standards, but I do know of some that rather like certain aromas from pipe tobaccos.Well, after all that, I don't think it's "cool"- just another bad habit.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	No - having to used a prop to 'be col' is actually telling the world you are a 'fool to be cool'.<br>  <br>  Addictive behaviour of any kind is not cool - it is tragic.<br>  <br>  Marketers and advertising campaigns know and trade on 'sex sells' so sex and cigarettes have gone hand in hand. Feeding the masses with pollutants, stimulants and brain numbing products to fill their boring lives.<br>  <br>  Addicts are sad, but advertising agencies and tobacco companies are even sadder and badder. They make the habit.|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	No. It is, however, an enigma. People no that you gain absolutely nothing from it. There are no health benefits what so ever. It's one of the leading killers in America today and even the tobacco companies say that it's dangerous... yet people start smoking everyday and continue to do it for the better part of their lives. This makes me wonder how much people really care about "fitting in."|`|qkYogI7gaa	No, I think smoking is nasty. It destroys your health. It rots your teeth, makes your tongue look nasty, makes you look OLDER than your actural age, gives you lung problems, even cancer, makes you stink, and it yellows your finger nails. Does that sound cool? Not to me. I will gladly pass.|`|z4LQxaA2aa	Sure, so is coughing your lungs out and cancer!|`|6v4KYFGoaa	No. I think it is disgusting. Ever hear the saying "Kissing a smoker, is like licking an ashtray?" well that is true. It also smells bad, makes people cough. It is also a way to make you unhealthy. <br>  <br>  Nothing good comes out of it. Maybe it will make you look "cool", but even then you are probably hanging out with the wrong type of people (seen more in teens).|`|Yh96NKzXaa	People who smoke obviously think they are cool as f**k otherwise why would they do it? I mean, no one starts off being addicted to tabacco, they have to make themselves do it to start off.<br>  <br>  So the answer to the question is non smokers think its a stupid thing to do but smokers think they're cool as!|`|0vo7tDP5aa	yes. very cool.|`|5XLIPK9Waa	No way.|`|MTJs95Emaa	No I think it's nasty.|`|zS6s7CrDaa	NO WAY MAN SMOKING GIVES YOU LUNG CANCER AND THEN YOU DIE FROM THE LUNG CANCER AND I DONT THINK DYING IS VERY FUN!THE ONLY SMOKING THATS GOOD IS WHEN YOURE SMOKING HOT MAN!BUT THATS A GAY THING TO SAY SO DONT SMOKE OK!OK GOOD glad thats clear : DD|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Yes|`|7ClnS9iaaa	ummmm not really, no!|`|GDdTEEDZaa	lol|`|XrMwDFAyaa	"cool" represents a trend as being popular to enough people for it to be recognized, bak in the day smoking was seen as a "cool" thing for it wsa betrayed in movies and shows and alot of ppl were doing it to look cool but now a days it is seen as a decision made by an individual, i do not find smoking to be "cool" personally on the count of i do not think that inhaling rat poison and ammonia is "cool".

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Slavery was only  one reason.  See below.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civilwarmenu/a/cause_civil_war.htm" rel="nofollow">http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civi...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Yes but only in part.<br>  <br>  Sectional differences related to slavery and western expansion had become apparent through the 1800's. In addition, the Dred Scott case and John Brown's raid focused attention on slavery. Several compromises related to slavery (particularly the one of 1850) were ineffective to reduce tension.  What really started the Civil War though was the issue of states rights. Lincoln did not believe states should be able to secede. That was the impetus for war.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Causes of the Civil War|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Yes because if you study American History it's mostly about how the North wanted no slavery while the South did|`|knKVjOE6aa	There was dissent fomenting in the south regarding the fact that the northern states had the manufacturing wherewithal to value add on to southern primary commodities and thereby generate bigger profits than the southerners themselves who argued that they underpinned the Union and they very much resented it.<br>  <br>  Then, as the 19th Century wore on, people around the world and consequently in the north, began to realise that slavery was inherently evil and barbaric. <br>  <br>  The new thinking was to do away with slavery and gradually groups of abolitionists began to form and became very politically active in the north.<br>   <br>  All of these things led to the southern states feeling economically and physically insecure. They feared that their slaves would rise up and kill them as the abolitionists were stirring them up and in some cases insighting them to violence. Fear fed on fear and the hostile environment that that led to was the perfect recipe for war to break out.|`|AA12353364	The north was not taxing the south in the common sense of the word . The federal government chose to place tariffs on imported manufactured goods such as steel and textiles . Slavery was not the principal cause but it was always just below the surface . The issue of a strong federal government or a weak federal government and strong individual state governments was always a point of contention . Make no mistake about it some of the earliest states to secede were about the slavery issue . The primarily agricultural economy in the south revolved around forced slave labor . There was a mindset among some of the southern people that the black people were literally sub human and not entitled to live as free people . This attitude flew in the face of our founding documents ,   " All men are created equal ..."   and many people in the north sought to end slavery .  The excuse that many plantation owners used was  " I can't get anybody to do this work so I need to have slaves to do it ."   While the statement may have been somewhat true as to the low skilled field work , many slaves were doing skilled work such as carpentry, masonry, and blacksmithing . The slave economy had the effect of depressing the wages of white people in the skilled trades because they had slaves that  could do those jobs for room and board and the slaves had no choice in the matter.  Slavery was this utterly immoral practice that had to be addressed sooner or later and 1861 was finally the time .|`|ANsznbWsaa	No. Both the north and the south had slaves. The Civil War was caused because the North was putting unfair taxes on the South. The South wanted to secede and become their own nation, which they had every right to do via the constitution, but the Union wouldn't allow it.|`|msmVd0apaa	No not at all. slavery even only became a part of the war when abraham lincoln freed the slaves in the south, thats when it set everybody off.|`|Uu633vXKaa	No. That is a common misconception. The real cause was in fact Prince Philip. He dressed up as a southerner and declared independence from the Union.|`|EzYgH0IJaa	Yes that was one of the main reason why it started<br>  the north side was against slavery and the south was for|`|SHwuzsPyaa	no not at all.

ZjoPRHZSaa	The author's full name is William Paul Young. And actually, no, they book isn't neccessarily new; it came out in 2007, but it's just now become popular since newly featured in Wal*Mart stores. Personally, I have not read the book myself, but this is the synopsis on the back:<br>  <br>  Mackenzie Allen Philip's youngest daughter, Missy, has been abducted during a family vacation and evidence that she may have been brutally murdered is found in an abandoned shack deep in the Oregon wilderness. Four years later, in the midst of his Great Sadness, Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend. <br>  <br>  Against his better judgement, he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare. What he finds there will change Mack's world forever.<br>  <br>  In a world where religion seems to grow increasingly irrelevant THE SHACK wrestles with the timeless question: "Where is God in a world so filled with unspeakable pain?" The answers Mack gets will astound you and perhaps transform you as much as it did him. You'll want everyone you know to read this book!|`|cgz85foTaa	The Shack by William P. Young was published in 2007.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	The Shack - by William P.

So, if that's not your thing, I would stay away from it.<br>  <br>  Example, from Toronto, Ontario resident  William Munny:<br>  <br>  This is the first book review that I've posted and, unfortunately, it must be a negative one. As the result of countless recommendations I was expecting a good read, but instead found myself extremely disappointed and even laughing out loud at how poorly written this book is.<br>  <br>  I'll admit from the outset that I have an unfavourable bias towards the subject matter. However, regardless of what your belief system might be, I find it difficult to understand how anyone could convince themselves that this is a good book. It is merely a never ending asinine dialogue that has apparently captivated the limited imaginations of the millions indoctrinated to be receptive to this type of garbage. Sure, it might reaffirm what you are told you must believe and make it easier to continue deluding yourself, but that's not justification for a five star rating. Rate it for its literary merit, not because it makes you feel good about yourself.<br>  <br>  WARNING - SPOILER - THE ENTIRE BOOK IS REVEALED BELOW!<br>  <br>  Papa (God) - "I am love."<br>  Mack - "Gee.

Women are more likely to murder for passionate reasons.<br>  <br>  Some statistics I recently seen, women are more likely to commit adultery than men.<br>  <br>  Women are far more likely to prostitute themselves. Men are far more likely to rape.<br>  <br>  Just because something is technically a crime under law doesnt mean it is unethical or immoral... Just because something is technically *not* a crime doesnt mean it is moral or ethical.<br>  <br>  So which are you claiming?  Illegalities or immoralities?<br>  <br>  Women like to kill their own unborn babies... which they rationalize as moral because it is more self serving... arbitrarily dehumanizing fetuses much like we used to dehumanize black slaves or the Germans dehumanized the Jews... and under law it is not illegal to dehumanize fetuses.  Does that make women more ethical? More moral? Because society wont tell them they are wrong? Does it make women ethical for weighing a nine month inconvenience as a more severe immorality than killing a person?  What constitutes criminal behavior to you? Legal technicalities or the  moral implications?<br>  <br>  Pretty much all women prostitute themselves... the guy with the most money, fastest car, strongest arms... with no regard for the relationship or his personality.  Such intrinsically feminine divine virtues!<br>  <br>  Women lie, cheat, deceive, manipulate, stereotype with the worst of them.<br>  <br>  Do you think yourself virtuous?

Sorry, I am not sure atm. In psychology you'll also learn about the diff. between guys and girls brains which may explain your question.|`|aBqJhdufaa	LOL we have the balls. It's probably because men have to be the providers for the family and sometimes need to steal to make ends meet. And, women get pregnant and can't really commit crimes during that time a lot of the time. Men don't have to worry about that!|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	testosterone makes us brave...|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	I don't accept your argument for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  For example, much genital mutilation of women is performed by women around the world. They are often held forcibly and then subjected to the action by women who are related closely or directly. Crimes within families are often treated differently than those between strangers.<br>  <br>  The cases of women who assault men are treated differently at times than men who assault women.<br>  <br>  The cases of young males assaulted by older females is also treated differently that of young girls assaulted by older males.<br>  <br>  Considerable child abuse is rooted through Child Protective Agencies and never prosecuted in the courts and often by women.<br>  <br>  Statistics show that younger women have increases considerably in their crimes against others -- which includes violent crimes.<br>  <br>  Crime stats are also worth scrutinizing as it only those crimes where one has been arrested, charged and/or convicted that are included.<br>  <br>  Criminal stats are also recognized as containing certain biases -- including sexism and racism.<br>  <br>  Female genital mutilation is estimated at 150 MILLION cases each year. This far exceeds the total of violent crimes committed by men.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Men have a heavier set of obligations, therefore more pressure to provide/achieve/get.  Regardless of what one says, it's a man's job to provide for his family and no matter what his wife says in the matter, when push comes to shove, he knows where the buck stops.<br>  <br>  Consequently he is under far more pressure to get stuff to give that family, and if he has to fight to get it, he does, out of love for them.<br>  <br>  Hence all the burgling, thieving, fencing, stealing etc:  these guys are providing a living for their families.<br>  <br>  As to violent crimes, men have hormones.  Far more overpowering hormones than women.  The sexual drive and all that testosterone has to be seen to be believed: I have a teenaged son, and his hormones call the shots quite a lot.  He might be upset at say mach five, but his hormones will crank that right up to mach ten.  He's more likely than my daughter to thump somebody and he's a lovely kid; I'm not saying anything against him other than that he has to use far more self control when under duress than my daughter.  No, he doesn't thump: but you can see the struggle.  With my daughter, the struggle is not there, she's in a position to cry and release the stress that way; but also she is not being flooded with hormones that scream 'kill kill".  Evolution-wise speaking, girls have a bigger flight response, boys have a bigger fight response.  <br>  <br>  This can lead to more crimes of passion in men than in women.<br>  <br>  I would also say that we chicks are capable of running rings around guys, who are in the main sweet natured and just want a quiet life.  They're not equipped for the mental torture and manipulation that a lot of women put out, and cannot naturally play the game (there's a generation of boys who have learned the girl snotty tricks but they're not very sexy so I think Darwin will deal with them.)  If you push and push and push a guy with haranguing, his instincts do not say 'shout back' or 'scream' or cry or any of that: his natural instinct is to make a physical move to shut your mouth.  Women bait men.  <br>  <br>  And no, of course I am not saying that wife-beating is the wife's fault.  The guy in this world needs to leave if his wife does that (although he might have kids) - I'm just saying that the instincts are different, and the outcomes are skewed towards guys getting into trouble with the law.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	It is called 'Serotonin' - read up on it. Very interesting. The more aggression a person has particularly a male (testosterone) and serotonin the  more likely for violent crimes. As those particular type males age their serotonin levels drop so does their aggressive responses.<br>  <br>  We humans are just bags of chemicals and hormones - sad really.|`|1JsWMX0daa	It's actually kinda simple. most cops are men and so most women have an easier time getting away with stuff because 1- cops don't watch them in the same way they watch men and are more inclined to let them slide than men.<br>   but, also i must say that a woman cannot pick on women and children as discutingly easily a man can. and so alot of discusting men who are of the very discusting, cowarldy kind like to prey on women children and the elderly.  That's why these men rob, rape, and whatever else evil a#$2&^s. because they feel that they can get away with it being full grown men tageting the 'weak'. it is important to remember that these are not your average men. but men who usually are VERY stupid AND are Coward of the worst kind. They are seriously mentally inferior in TWO ways!|`|ohgvcV9Qaa	because women are too busy making babies and cooking. its society that still holds women as the more docile of the sexes, i don't think it has nothing to do with hormones. we still have the believe to treat women differently because they are smaller, weaker and less capable. its good in my eyes to think women should be protected by men, I ultimatly believe is more cultural than anything else.|`|6x99ue8maa	we have the balls to|`|hJU59dAJaa	testosterone = more agression|`|MPxd2nDHaa	Actually, I don't think men are more likely.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	During the Norse era, the "grand family" a set of related "nuclear families" lived in the same longhouse, working the same farm holding and was the standard unit of society. The typical household size was probably ten to twenty people. However, three generation families were rare. <br>  <br>  Young people were considered adults by the time they reached 15 years old, although there were exceptions. Most people (and virtually all women) were married by the time they were 20. Marriage was a business arrangement between the family of the bride and the family of the groom. However, if the marriage didn't work out, a divorce could be easily obtained by either party. After the divorce, the woman was entitled to one-half of the estate.<br>  <br>  A typical woman probably bore 7 children during her lifetime, spaced about 2 1/2 years apart. Evidence suggests that mothers nursed their children until the age of 2 years, which may have contributed to the spacing. During pregnancy, women were expected to continue working. After the child's birth, the mother typically returned to work with little delay. <br>  <br>  When a child was born, the child was accepted into the family by means of a set of rituals, including being formally named by the father. Once a child was named he or she was entitled to an inheritence. However, a child could also be rejected by either the mother or the father, typically for reasons of physical deformity. A rejected infant was "exposed" (let outside to die).<br>  <br>  Finally, it was common for a family to give one of their children to another family to foster. Fostering created stong bonds between families. Typically, a child from a higher status family was raised by a lower status family and the foster parents received either payment or support from the birth parents.|`|fzU2hP4yaa	Mom and the kids stayed at home in a long house, perhaps of wood with a grass roof.  They lived a close-knit extended family clan-like existence.  There was no organized schooling for the children.  They learned what they needed at home from their elders, concentrating on oral tradition.  Dad farmed, hunted or traded, occasionally venturing on the military expeditions for which the Vikings were so famous.
Ow3O7h4caa	When you hear that buzzing, that is a loop feedback due to too mugh bass. Lower the Bass settings and the treble slightly.<br>  <br>  Having said this, it could be the quality of your guitar cable which picks up hum from the amplifier itself. If you move your cable while it is doing that noise, and you hear some noise , than the cable is not good quality and acts like an antenna.<br>  <br>  Another thing yo might do is to plug your amp elsewhere to see it the grounding is good. Sometimes, you cheak socket, ant it works fine.

BWYQdNDbaa	TWILIGHT! Twilight is a great book for anyone, once you read it, you'll want to read the entire series! :)|`|LddkW0JFaa	I think you should just start reading some novels by popular authors, maybe similar in genre to the type of movies you like. If you don't enjoy one book, move on to a different author. It might take a few books before you find what you like. I'll recommend Fred Vargas. (The name sounds masculine but she's actually a woman.) She writes murder mysteries.|`|AA10209040	I would recommend reading either Paper Towns by John Green or Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist by David Levithan and Rachel Cohn. Both of those books are entertaining and easy to read, but they also have a lot of depth and will get you interested in reading other books.<br>  <br>  For the love of God, please don't start by reading Twilight. While it is entertaining, you will gain almost nothing from reading it.|`|GljEiugjaa	i would definetly NOT recommend any of the twilight books because the only way i finished those was by my friends forcing me to read em and i still didnt finish.

wM9oz9Ugaa	Do relaves in 1st, 2nd, and 5th posistion, 10 each and hold for 15 to 20 seconds. While you are doing this lock your knees. When you releve don't lean on your back toes, push on your 2 front toes. This will stregthen your ankles alot, and make your arch great!<br>  <br>  Also to make sure your arch is big enough put your foot on a ruler, and make sure atleast 3 inches are off of it.

XCn2dK1laa	We were neutral and created the Neutrality Acts of 1935,which forbid the US from selling arms and providing loans to nations in war or civil war.FDR got around that by creating the Lend-Lease Act.He figured if we built the guns and tanks but the Europeans shipped them, then he wouldn't be breaking the Neutrality Acts.<br>  Pearl harbor is what changed it.We could no longer remain neutral after an attack on our own soil|`|xESTpylYaa	The policy was strictly " None of our business".

Definitely one of the better mid-gain sounds I heard from Marshall in a while.<br>  <br>  The previous post about Slash using Marshalls now is correct, but it actually recorded the Appetite For Destruction album with Mesa Boogies.

KADDz1EPaa	Renaissance clocks <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  From the sixteenth to the early seventeenth century, one of the largest centres of clock manufacturing in Europe was in Augsburg, Bavaria. Drawing on the skills of the armourer and locksmith, the coiled steel spring was increasingly used as the motive force. Despite its relative inaccuracy this meant that clocks could be made on a scale small enough to make them suitable for domestic use.<br>  <br>  The gilded opulence of these clocks reflects the exuberance of the High Renaissance. They range from relatively simple horizontal table clocks to extravagant tabernacle clocks with two or three dials, often surmounted by a tiered rotunda containing bells for hourly and quarter-hourly striking. Many clockmakers specialised in mechanisms for automata, and the museum's collection includes examples of the simpler kind: the lion clock and the chattering skull clock.<br>  <br>  Augsburg was the centre of the Counter-Reformation, and the images of Catholic Christendom are frequently found in clocks made there. Examples in the Heritage Services collections are the Virgin Mary, whose crown revolves to record the quarter hours, and the crucifix clocks with revolving globes. However the bitter religious conflict of the Thirty Years War ended Augsburg's reign as the clock-making capital of the world. The city was besieged and sacked, and before its position could be recovered, it had been overtaken by London.<br>  <br>  By a i

uHTpBjWDaa	Try taking your story to someone like your english teacher to edit it, and give you some advice on how to make it better.  Also ask him/her about where you could go towards publishing it.  He/her could probably help you out.<br>  Good luck!!!|`|92c0c9e5d7ee893f8f8042c1689ff773aa	What you need to do first is to get someone that you aren't really personally close to and have them proof read it.  It needs to be someone who isn't afraid to point out parts that are incorrect, boring, confusing, etc.  Sometimes friends can overlook those parts because they want to support you.  Don't worry about your age.  I was 11 when I started writing and I'm fifteen now.  Over the four years that I have been writing I have improved considerably.  If you keep writing you will improve for sure.  I'm guessing you're either in your last year of middle school or first year of high school, so you should look into extra courses in your school to help you learn to write better.  Composition classes help a lot, even if it doesn't seem like it.  The whole publishing thing can go about various ways so I'd suggest you do some research.  If you want to get your book noticed quickly then you shouldn't take the self publishing path because most publishing companies tend to overlook people's work that don't have an agent.  And when you do publish a book don't expect it to get big overnight.  If the first one doesn't work out then there is plenty of time to write more.Good luck with your writing!|`|NkVjGDJoaa	Hi, I'm 14 too, and I LOVE writing. Have you actually finished the story??? Kudos to you...well from what I have heard and learned there are a few steps into the publishing process...first you have to copyright your story idea, and I don't know how to do that...sorry...and then there are two ways to actually PUBLISH the book. Either way though, you will have to pay for it...you can do self-publishing or send the manuscript to publishers to see if they will publish it for you. I really don't know how to do this all, but I'm sure you can surf it on google, and well I wish you the best of luck...man, now you have me wanting to read your story...haha...um...GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|fkwYvFBRaa	Writers like you have every potential to get started on a publishing career. If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  It's fun that you get to see your book published with the same expertise and professionalism as the regular books that you see in bookstores.<br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>  Now, perhaps this free information guide will help you get started or just click on the links below.<br>  <br>  I hope I have helped.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I don't know anything about publishing really so I can't help you there but try getting people who arn't your friends to critique it like your parnets or siblings.

W3rXCrr9aa	Words were a big part of it. Germany had lost a major war, plus had big economic problems, and Hitler and others in his Nazi Party blamed everything on the Jews (and also other groups like Communists and other political leftists,  Gypsies, gays, etc.) .  Newspapers, magazines, movies, schoolbooks told the Germans how other races were inferior and the Jews especially were evil.  <br>  <br>  The Holocaust did not happen all at once. There were a series of laws that more and more restricted the freedoms of Jewish people and confiscated their property.   Germany started WW2 and conquered a lot of other territory in Europe that included many more Jews including some who had left Germany. They said the Jews would have to be sent to work camps.  The government came up with a very organized plan to kill the Jews. Some of them in the East in area that was won by Germany, were rounded up and shot.  Then they decided to use gas chambers, which they were already using to kill disabled people. They set up  gas chambers in 6 Death Camps in Poland, and began transporting Jewish people from all over Europe to them.  Many more Jews as well as Gypsies, Nazis political enemies, priests,  resistance fighters, homosexuals, and common criminals were sent to "work camps"  all over Germany and occupied countries.  Huge numbers of people died in these places as well from the mistreatment starvation, overwork, medical experiments etc.. (all in all about 6 million Jews and 5 million others were killed )<br>  <br>  Some people realised the danger early and were able to get out of the country. Many kept thinking with each step that surely it would not get any worse . The Nazis were great at psychologically manipulating people so that they did not realise what was in store for them.  Also any rebellion was punished by killing your family, friends, maybe your whole village. and people hoped for survival.  Yet some people did run off to the forests and formed resistance groups, or fought even a completely hopeless battle just to go down fighting, like in the Warsaw Ghetto. <br>  I think a lot of people in concentration camps felt like they were in a nightmare. They were almost in a state of constant shock,  and just trying to find a way to survive for one more day, and trying to hold onto a little bit of hope. That was not easy to do in such brutal conditions with starvation, beating, overwork etc.  <br>  <br>  Many survivors never recovered entirely. Many have health problems still related to the starvation and mistreatment they endured.  It's hard to give a single answer because it really depended so much on the person, how bad they had been treated,  how long they were a prisoner, how successfully they had been able to find extra food. (It was impossible to survive only on the allowed rations -- it was PLANNED that you would last 3 months) , and if they were in a job that did not require hard labor. (for example scientists, clerical workers, the women who sorted the confiscated belongings of new arrivals etc. had a better chance of survival )  But maybe most were physically fairly healthy again within a year or so. <br>  <br>  however, as my friend says, although she was physically set free in 1945, she was not emotionally and mentally free for decades. She finished school, immigrated to Israel and later to the USA, married, had kids, worked ,etc. but she feels it took over 40 years before she could let go of the pain and anger that crippled her psychologically.  I think a lot of survivors still sometimes have nightmares and even flashbacks if something reminds them. For example my friend had been away from Europe for a long time, and when she went back and heard German spoken she had a panic attack.  I was with another survivor at a building that was burned in a hate crime and the combination that it was hate and the smell of the burning reminded her of when the Nazis burned synagogues and Jewish businesses and homes, and she had to get out of there.|`|DOLFmfWYaa	i would love to tell you the answers to those questions, but there is a reason that entire history books are written about WWII. but one thing that you can do is read the book "Night", by Elie Weisel. he was in Auschwitz and he made it out alive, barely. he was in concentration camps for 3 years. his father, mother, and all sisters but one were killed. he talks about when the germans came into their town and everything. its not a long book and it is an easy read. it stays with you though, and makes you look at things with a different prespective. hope i helped!|`|angW1Lkfaa	You should find what you need<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/holocaust/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/ho...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/Genocide/history_of_the_holocaust.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/Genocid...</a>

Charles Darnay is the new identity of a man whose old identity is that of Evremonde. He completely cut himself off (no pun intended...or, perhaps, it was :) ) from his family and connections, from the old man, if you will. Once he refused the name Evremonde, he began anew; he was a new man. It's a new start, a new life, a new day for Charles Darnay. The guillotine, or so they thought, began a new day for the citizens of France.<br>  <br>  However, the violence that the guillotine symbolizes enfolds Charles Darnay and almost destroys him - and would have, if not for Sidney Carton. (France, too, was almost destroyed by this new type of violence that was exchanged for the old.)<br>  <br>  So, just as in the case of France, Charles cannot completely escape his past. In the case of France, tyranny was met with tyranny, thus the past was not entirely escaped though a new group is in charge of this violence. In Charles' case, he cannot escape his family name and the violence swirling around anyone in any way related to the ruling classes of France.<br>  <br>  Since the guillotine can be said to symbolize France's bloody revolution and the revolution, in a way, mimics Charles' life, the guillotine then can also symbolize Charles.<br>  <br>  The revolution, itself, could be said to symbolize Charles Darnay. However, you asked for an object, and therefore it would be the guillotine (the symbol of the revolution).<br>  <br>  Does this make sense?

XVGmGCDaaa	Saint Catherine of Siena, O.P. (March 25, 1347 – April 29, 1380) was a Tertiary of the Dominican Order, and a Scholastic philosopher and theologian. She also worked to bring the Papacy back to Rome from its displacement in France, and to establish peace among the Italian city-states.<br>  <br>  In about 1366, St Catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a "Mystical Marriage" with Jesus. Her biographer Raymond of Capua also records that she was told by Christ to leave her withdrawn life and enter the public life of the world. Catherine dedicated much of her life to helping the ill and the poor, where she took care of them in hospitals or homes. Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, both women and men, while they also brought her to the attention of the Dominican Order, which called her to Florence in 1374 to interrogate her for possible heresy. After this visit, in which she was deemed sufficiently orthodox, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and the launch of a new crusade and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through "the total love for God."<br>  <br>  St Catherine died of a stroke in Rome, the spring of 1380, at the age of thirty-three. The people of Siena wished to have her body. A story is told of a miracle whereby they were partially successful: Knowing that they could not smuggle her whole body out of Rome, they decided to take only her head which they placed in a bag. When stopped by the Roman guards, they prayed to St Catherine to help them, confident that she would rather have her body (or at least part thereof) in Siena. When they opened the bag to show the guards, it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals. Once they got back to Siena they reopened the bag and her head was visible once more. Due to this story, St Catherine is often seen holding a rose. The incorruptible head and thumb were entombed in the Basilica of San Domenico, where they remain.

sjMIFH9Faa	The saying goes, Nero fiddled (played a lyre) while Rome burned. These were the words of Suetonius, who was a Roman who wrote a book about the lives of the first 12 Caesars. In this book, Suetonius suggests that not only did Nero did nothing to stop the fire, but actually had it created so that he could build a palace. <br>  <br>  This is almost certinly not true. Rome, like every major city, had a history of large fires. Because of movies people think of Rome as this city made of marble, but in fact almost all housing in the city was made of flimsy dry wood. Fire was so common that before Nero, Roman aristocrats built a huge wall of stone around the rich neighborhood so that their houses didn't burn, with the great fire under Nero, the flames jumped the wall. Its really not to hard to imagine why, strong winds probably blew flameing debris over the wall. <br>  <br>  Suetonius didn't like Nero for many reasons and blamed him for the fire because Nero did infact take advantage of the Great Fire and built a palace in Rome in the rich neighborhood that burned down. However, their really is no reason the believe he started the blaze. In all likelyhood a person cooking dinner in his/her wooden home and it spread. Or maybe a candle for light lit a house on fire. My point is, fire was common enough in all major cities, so we dont have enough evidence to really point the finger at Nero.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire—whether accident or arson. Suetonius and Cassius Dio favor Nero as the arsonist|`|re8recMJaa	hi,<br>  im an MA student in ancient history- i can help!!<br>  <br>  Tacitus and Suetonius both say that Nero most likely started the great fire of Rome himself in AD64 but that the christians were burned for it because they hated anyway and made a good scapegoat for Nero.<br>  <br>  Be careful not to get mixed up with the eruption of mount vesuvius which engulfed pompeii and herculaneum in AD79.<br>  <br>  for best results go to tacitus, check the index for christians and his account of the fire and who did it will be there!!! always go to the sources bro!!<br>  <br>  hope this helps...if you need more, email me at worldpeaceboy23@yahoo.co.uk|`|RmcIrzLHaa	not a volcano<br>  no one really knows what started it

2QTktDQsaa	First of all, everyone who said it's too much like Twilight is stupid. Twilight copied from a bunch of other books. Your book is SIMILAR to Twilight in the way you:<br>  <br>  Explained how they were pale and stuff<br>  Have the Hawaiians<br>  Make them fall in love<br>  Make him save her<br>  <br>  I would TRY some more and make it seem a little bit less like Twilight :)|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	Yeah, it's a lot like twilight. Please, think of your own ideas. No one will read it otherwise. Bleh....Twilight succkksssssss. (No offense)|`|00fc3b162df409875cc6c83637f2da24aa	sorry but yes it does. they way she met him in class and how he's particular looking (pale skin), she doesn't want to be in london (forks?) and a few other things, if you changed a few things up it will be fine, just don't put chapters or moments that are too similar to twilight, especially now that it has such a fanatic fan base because peoples minds will jump to that.|`|PkA4hrKWaa	Sorry to tell you this, but yes, it sounds A LOT like Twilight. The fight, the way they fall in love, his appearance, it just makes me think too much of Twilight. And I like how you're trying to direct it away from vampires, but I don't really get what you're trying to get at. The siblings sound too much like the ones in Twilight. Don't worry about it, though. I wrote a whole bunch of stuff based off of Twilight before I started working on the one I am now.|`|feUtQ0GBaa	yes it is very much like twilight but i like the basic idea of it...it seems if u tweak it a little it could honestly b aa really good book...if i did see ur book on a shelf and read the back of it i would definetly buy it=]|`|JbFh1IEAaa	Too much like Twilight.

It's Twilight-esque. (And why, if they crave salty things, wouldn't they crave chips, or pretzels, or just plain table salt? It doesn't make much sense.) You can do better. If you really want to write it though, go ahead! I can give you my opinion and maybe edit it a tad, if you want to post a bit.|`|NkVjGDJoaa	Wow, um...you could have a good idea here, but it is way to much like twilight. The "family" is all 'together'...except for the 'edward' who wants to eat lily's skin but doesn't because he is in love?? All of these aspects are EXTREMELY like twilight. I'm sorry...<br>  <br>  But, keep working on another idea. Don't give up...and you should get an account on www.fictionpress.com and let me read some of your other stories. Like you, I also wish to be a famous author, and I also would LOVE to finish one of my MANY story ideas. <br>  <br>  Keep Writing, and Don't give up, but this story line isn't going to cut it...|`|O0P6HNVBaa	No I don't think so. there's nothing wrong with it being a bit similar, as long as you thought of it originally.

If you want, I can list the similarities:<br>  Girl , age 17, moves to a rainy place<br>  Meets strange, handsome guy with many siblings who are adopted<br>  and has a beautiful sister Calista [similar to edward and rosalie] <br>  Sacrificing and saving [like in New Moon]<br>  Hawaiians sound like the Volturi<br>  diamond hard skin<br>  craving human skin [blood in twilight]<br>  falling in love<br>  father is a doctor<br>  immortal<br>  <br>  And, Kate just feels a bit unnecessary, like you were determined not to make it sound like Twilight by giving the main character a sister. It really is a good story, I like it, but it is  similar to Twilight. Still, very good writing! I would definitely buy the book if I saw it, but I think you should get rid of the too-much-like-twilight parts. But, overall, it's really good!|`|B41roQ52aa	The pale, hard skin, similar-looking family, ability to change people into mythical creatures by injecting fluids into their bloodstream, and father who is a doctor all seem really similar to Twilight. Plus the ruling family  with the one rule (keep the secret) and the whole mortal/immortal relationship are from Twilight. I don't know that you could be sued or anything, but people might be like "Oh, Stephenie Meyer already did this so I don't want to read it."<br>  <br>  Another thing to look out for is the fact that your merpeople seem a lot like the mermaids in H20 (it's some stupid teen nick show that takes place in like Australia or something. I saw it when I was babysitting. Their mermaids are the exact same way.) I don't know if that was on purpose or not, or whether this is a common idea in mermaid legends (I don't read a lot of fantasy XD) But I thought I'd mention it :)<br>  <br>  Ok, all that having been said, you should keep writing!! Don't be like, "Oh, this person said my book was like Twilight so I must be really bad." I don't want to be responsible for hurting someone's career. This seems like a really good story. Just try to original-ize it a little :)

xYAuW0Wqaa	Go for it, only way to get your feet wet.<br>  As someone mentioned, watch out for the shadows and be aware of the sun's location when taking your photos. The sun may give you some lighting and shadow problems, be prepared for it. The lenses you mentioned is adequate for most of your shots. You might want to consider a 28-200 f/3.5 lens to give yourself more distance capability. <br>  <br>  Make sure you discuss what photos will be taken with the bride or groom and the family memebers. This will give you time to find a good location and set-up to take these photos.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a good source of batteries for your flash and several 4GB or 8GB memory cards. You don't want to miss any shots. <br>  I would highly recommend Gary Fong's lightshpere will give you brighter and softer lighting with your flash.  You could  also consider using the custom flash mode on your camera. Practice using this feature and it will help make your shots look better.<br>  <br>  Suggest you take as many shot you think you need. You can always go back and sort out the good ones you want to present your clients. Or you might want to leave it up to the clients to pick the ones they want to keep. In your contract you determine how many frames they can keep for their photo-album. The rest you archive for your records. <br>  <br>  The more weddings you shoot the better you will get at it and then you will know what you can provide your clients for their wedding package for the price you suggest.<br>  <br>  The last wedding I shot for a friend, I took over a thousand frame in less than 5 hours. I let them choose the frames they wanted to keep.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	The best help I can give you is to not do the job.  A wedding is not something you want to be "cutting your teeth on".<br>  <br>  If you do not know what you are doing and have never shot a wedding before, please do not potentially ruin this couples wedding day with your inexperience.|`|6pszwwl7aa	Give me a holler. Contact information is on my website www.BCphoto.biz<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot...</a>|`|AA10912074	This time of year, 3:00 might be an OK time for the sun.  The worst natural lighting is when the sun is directly overhead.  <br>  <br>  Outdoors, you need to be aware of shadows.  You can get some harshness there, don't be afraid to use your flash outside.  Ideally, you would shoot in some shade (but do they have that in Arizona?).  <br>  <br>  Inside, you should be in good shape.  No issues with using a flash, you have a good camera and lens.  Be sure you know how to use the flash in something other than Program mode.  A good addition to your flash might be a Gary Fong Lightsphere, which bounces the flash off the ceiling as well as adds some diffused direct light on the subject.  Without the Lightsphere, rely on bounce.  Maybe have a Sto-Fen diffuser in case the ceiling isn't white. <br>  <br>  Other inexpensive items to have is a second battery for the camera and extra CF cards.  Remember to change your CF cards even before they are filled.  You don't want all the images on one 8 GB card only to have the card go bad.  Spreading out the pictures to multiple cards decreases your risks. <br>  <br>  As far as renting a lens, your camera works with EF-S lenses and Canon makes a nice 10-22mm wide angle.  Another one, perhaps a little less likely to distort, would be a Canon 17-85mm.  Canon also has a nice 17-40mm L lens.   Any of these should work well.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Your 28mm should be wide enough but if you want to go wider check one in the teens. You should also rent a back up camera and flash and purchase a strobe bracket and diffuser or just a Gary Fong Light Sphere.Outside use your flash only as a fill light.<br>  <br>  I will concur with Gryphon as someone whose wedding pictures were ruined by a first timer. Time spent assisting a pro is invaluable. But you know that, so I wish you well.

iNXqiDIYaa	The Korean War officially ended on July 27 1953 with the establishment of the de-militarized zone.<br>  <br>  There was only sporadic breaches of the armistice but I believe that service still serving there were considered on active duty<br>  <br>  one of the main tasks carried out after July 1953 was Operation Glory - exchange of prisoners/bodies etc and burial/repatriation of them<br>  <br>  Following the conflict, the United Nations troop casualties were buried at a temporary gravesite near H?ngnam. Operation Glory occurred from July to November 1954, during which the dead of each side were exchanged; remains of 4,167 U.S. soldiers and marines were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean and Chinese dead. In addition, 546 civilians who died in United Nations prisoner of war camps were turned over to the South Korean government.[67] After "Operation Glory" 416 Korean War "unknowns" were buried in the Punchbowl Cemetery. According to a DPMO white paper [68] 1,394 names were also transmitted during "Operation Glory" from the Chinese and North Koreans {of whom 858 names proved to be correct}; of the 4,167 returned remains were found to be 4,219 individuals of whom 2,944 were found to be Americans of whom all but 416 were identified by name. Of 239 Korean War unaccounted for: 186 not associated with Punchbowl unknowns {176 were identified and of the remaining 10 cases 4 were non-Americans of Asiatic descent; one was British; 3 were identified and 2 cases unconfirmed}. In 1990-1994 North Korea excavated and returned more than 200 sets of remains-very few have been identifed-due to co-mingling of remains.[69]From 1996 to 2006 220 remains were recovered from near the Chinese border. [70]<br>  <br>  I would certainly think that everyone would agree that those involved in that macabre operation were stillpart of the Korean War

But as Britain was fighting to stop a despot from European domination, then stopping American trade from benefiting the French war effort was something worth fighting for.<br>  <br>  The War of 1812 did not make America the most powerful nation, America didn't become the most powerful nation until WW2.|`|NiuYkbGMaa	As the previous answer indicates, the War of 1812 gave a boost of pride and a feeling of nationalism to the citizens of the US.

ohj5sRpsaa	Weee, come on, I know you can do this one by yourself.
E3tDe43Maa	'Give me any detail that shows how US didnt Like bogota or Colombia entirely etc'... you obviously have no idea what you're talking about. US intelligence and equipment was instrumental in helping the Colombian Search Bloc hunt down and kill Pablo.<br>  <br>  Read the book Killing Pablo or at least watch the documentary on Discovery or the History Channel, but do your own homework!<br>  <br>  Against my better judgement, I'm adding more details...but  i think you should do your own homework... a simple search on the wikipedia would give you the whole story. <br>  <br>  A conflict between the US and Colombia does not exist. They are strong allies in the war against drugs and against terror and have been so for a long time. Especially during Republican presidencies. To my knowledge, they've never been adversaries in recent history, although there may have been some disagreement when the US helped the nation of Panama become independent from Colombia so we could build the canal. <br>  <br>  During the search for Pablo, the US provided the Colombian national police with intelligence and specialized tracking equipment to help capture or kill him. It's well document, but was very low key because the US wanted to avoid the appearance of meddling too much in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. <br>  <br>  Pablo was from Medellin and grew up a common criminal but later rose quickly in the drug trade until he became the head of the Medellin drug cartel. The police and government feared him as he brought Colombian crime and terrorism to new lows. He was certainly one of the most dangerous criminals in history. <br>  <br>  There is a lot more to Pablo's story that is worth looking into but fast forwarding a bit... during the efforts to capture or kill him, it is widely believed that intelligence was being given to not only the Colombian National Police, but also covertly to a group of paramilitaries known as Los PEPES, which stood for Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar (or People persecuted by Pablo Escobar). This group began killing Pablo's closest associates and friends to scare him and isolate him because he didn't know who was doing this to him or who he know who he could trust anymore. The strategy worked and Pablo worked to get his family out of Colombia but they were denied. Pablo was extremely furious, and of course increasingly worried about his family. He began to make mistakes, talking to his family on sat phones and cell phones often which eventually gave away his position and he was gunned down on a Medellin rooftop by the special police unit that was created specifically to hunt him.<br>  <br>  Today the US gives billions of dollars to Colombia as part of Plan Colombia which has done wonders to make Colombia a much better place than it was just 10-15 years ago.<br>  <br>  Regarding the title.... US vs. Bogota.... I can't imagine what your teacher is talking about... unless it is over the free trade agreement. The US is very supportive of Colombia's government although Obama's party is not in favor of renewing the agreement with Colombia because of supposed human rights violations and crimes against labor unions. US Democrats say the Colombian government was either complicit in crimes against these unions and/or has not done enough to protect them and this is their reason for not supporting the free trade agreement.|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	All those DETAILS are in his biography.

My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever.” Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. *<br>  (Chapter 58)<br>  <br>  Please rephrase the following (so as to avoid plagiarism):<br>  <br>  --- This proposal and Elizabeth's acceptance mark the climax of the novel, occurring in Chapter 58. Austen famously prefers not to stage successful proposals in full, and the reader may be disappointed in the anticlimactic manner in which the narrator relates Elizabeth's acceptance. It is important to remember, however, that the proposal and acceptance are almost a foregone conclusion by this point. Darcy's intervention on behalf of Lydia makes obvious his continuing devotion to Elizabeth, and the shocking appearance of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in the previous chapter, with her haughty attempts to forestall the engagement, serves to suggest strongly that a second proposal from Darcy is imminent.<br>   <br>  The clunky language with which the narrator summarizes Elizabeth's acceptance serves a specific purpose, as it captures the one moment of joyful incoherence for this supremely well-spoken character. She accepts Darcy's proposal “immediately,” the narrator relates, but “not very fluently.” As Elizabeth allows herself to admit that her love has supplanted her long-standing prejudice, her control of language breaks down. The reader is left to imagine, with some delight, the ever-clever Elizabeth fumbling for words to express her irrepressible happiness.|`|75ea0afe0fae42105f1f002aca825883aa	I would prefer two points. Thank you. :)<br>  This is a good book, all you need is to figure out the best points. And, I am a single mommy in school, I do not have time for this. So, two will do.
ceBTTCPwaa	Foxes are sly, cunning creatures, and seldom have loyalty to anyone besides themselves. Early on in the Redwall series foxes were considered separate from vermin, and even closer to being neutral than evil. It wasn't until Salamandastron that foxes started appearing in the ranks of hordes. Even then they tended to rank highly. Vixens mostly work as herbalists and seers rather than fighters. Both genders tend to be naturally intelligent and treacherous.The most prominent fox in the series was Slagar the Cruel (first known as Chickenhound).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_species_in_Redwall#Foxes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spe...</a>
IUwa027Paa	okay well  you hae to sing in a talent show and use a microphone that was used in your school for generations.  1 day before the concert a monster steals the microphone. he lives like in a cave in a cloud, and it is your job to take it back it.<br>           obstacles should be such as going to the cloud, defeating the monsters friends, going into the cave you see the monster and how you will defeat him....<br>                     oops i just gave you the whole story.|`|i8RWcBcbaa	Depends what your item is.<br>  <br>  For example, if you're stranded on a tropical island and you're trying to find some fruit, then maybe you got mauled by a zebra. Or, maybe, you ran into a prickly bush. Or, maybe you had to dodge all of the coconuts that the monkeys were throwing at you. Or maybe you came across some ninjas and you had to fight them until you became allies and continued your quest for fruit on your tropical island. Then, maybe you found some fruit but it turned out to be a magical fruit that made you randomly dance. And you had to find the antidote. So you danced to another bush where you found the tropical fruit and ate it and then a helicopter came to rescue you, but when you were climbing up the ladder thing you fell off into a big mud puddle. But then you climbed up it again with the help of your new ninja buddies and were saved. Bingo! There's your skit. :)<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Or...you could be trying to get a treasure box from your grandma's house...and your grandma was a vampire. And you had to get in and out quickly before she ate you alive. But you're a vampire too. But you didn't want to fight your grandma. So you crawled in through her window, but your hips got stuck. And then her neighbor saw you and called the police. So you crawled back out the other way and went up on the roof. Now, one of the neighbors is shooting at you because they want you to get down because they think you're a robber, which you actually are. So you jump down the chimney and land on Santa. Did I mention it's Christmas? Well it is. He thinks you're a robber too, which you are, and starts kung fu. Santa's about to knock your head off, when you bolt. You run into the living room, which is extremely fast since you're a vampire, and then you grab the treasure box and get out of there. This time you use the door. Then you go back to your house before the police even get there. That's option two.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Or...you're in an airplane. And you have to go to the bathroom. You need to find the bathroom, and you have to escape the stewardesses, because you're not actually allowed to be walking around since you're flying through a storm at the moment and the seat belt sign is on, and you're experiencing MAJOR turbulence.So, you quietly unbuckle your seat belt, but the passenger next to you yells at you to put it back on. You say that you have to go to the bathroom, but he hits you and buckles it back for you. Then he goes to sleep. So you try again. This time you succeed. You walk down the aisle, but the pilot sees you. He runs back to you and tells you that you must get in your seat. The planes REALLY getting some turbulance. Especially since, thanks to you, the pilot is now buckling YOUR seatbelt instead of driving the plane. Not good. You're going into lighting. You have to pee. Uh oh. You try again. You know that you're not going to be able to make it through the next 3 hours left on the flight. You make it to the bathroom. You're going to the bathroom when you hear the pilot's command, "brace for impact." Oh boy. You grab onto the handrails in the little teeny weeny three-inch-sized bathroom space. CRASH!!! That was hail, announces the pilot. That was some big hail, says a passenger. You continue going to the bathroom. Success! Then the pilot says, that wasn't hail. That was a meteorite with aliens standing on it. Everyone laughs. He says he's not joking. You see these little green people walking down the aisles. They take over the plane, and you go to Mars and become an alien and live happily ever after. And you got to pee. Yahoo!<br>  <br>  Hope these helped!!! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck performing your skit!!!

kvog6ICCaa	Juliet longed for love and choosing her own husband which wasn't something women at that time did. In Shakespearean times, there were still men acting as women in the plays, women's rights weren't exactly a frontier being explored. She would have been expected to marry Paris, no questions asked. (:|`|TJ6KPvaJaa	well, juliet was supposed to marry whoever daddy said, but then she meets a certain fellow by the name of Romeo that takes her heart and she escapes with him... WAIT! No! Juliet should do whatever her dad tells her to do! Yet, she does her will, that is a complete rebellion against the standards of the time, right now it isn't that a big deal, but then, it was huge if a girl did that.

"basic" (noone likes it)<br>  But it lets you draw.<br>  <br>  If you were at work, the computer might have had a version of photoshop. You can look into the different  types of it through google- find if you want to buy it or not.<br>  <br>  <br>  the GIMP is kinda like a free version of it- it's got less choices, but I and many other people like it better.<br>  It's a freeware that works amazingly well, absolutly love the program.
