But when you download songs and movies, you're downloading something that someone ripped from a CD or DVD on his computer - and if he had viruses on his computer, you're going to download a file full of viruses.    Is Limewire bad?  No.  Is downloading a file full of viruses bad?  Not if you're planning on throwing your computer out and getting a new one - MANY people asking for help here end up having to do that because they downloaded "free" music and movies.  Those that don't still have to pay someone to fix their computers.   Those who know how to do it themselves still have to buy a copy of Windows (since manufacturers no longer put a Windows CD in with the computer).  The minimum cost for downloading viruses is going to be over $100.    And when you fix the computer, all the songs and movies you downloaded (and all your documents, pictures and programs) are gone.  (That's where the viruses are.)    So you decide.|`|VSqk5zpnaa	If you don't use this new thing called "virus protection" then yeah. And you can take the share feature off.

For example, a movie like the Dark Knight would have a minimum size of roughly 700MB, and when you search lime wire, you might even see attractive files (due to their name) with a size of 500KB, thes types of files are virus carryers. That is pretty much all you have to worry about, but when you get use to keeping an eye oout for suspicious files, it will all be like 1 2 3 to you.   The newest Pro version of it is much safer, as the creators of the application are now working continuously on finding those suspicious files on their server and taking care of them.

9ECwMzZXaa	1 1/2 hours battery life is normal, in fact its actually good. Some new batteries last a lot less.    You can use the laptop without the battery in the laptop if you have it plugged in.    Otherwise, its not harmful for the battery to leave it in while plugged in. The laptop (new ones, like yours) will automatically treat the battery to make sure it doesn't harm it. If both the battery is in AND its plugged into the wall, the computer will first charge the battery and run your computer, then once its finished charging it will leave the battery idle while run the computer from the mains power.     Short answer: NO its not bad. YES, its normal.|`|tLh7CytLaa	All batteries no matter what kind eventually goes bad. At first when you got the battery it would last a long time but as time pasted and the batterys been charged, discharged, charged, discharged etc etc etc the chemicals inside the batteries wear down and do not last as long as they did before.

The battey has a "trickle charge", which means it stops charging after it is fully charged so it cannot be overcharged.|`|dFRgSbTaaa	This is normal for laptops over time the battery doesn't last that long but it wont lower anymore and no the charger won't effect your computers battery life unless your computer doesn't have a good cooling fan or else you computer will over heat and slow down|`|aqKIOjHqaa	i think the battery on laptop will goon for 1 1/2 hrs. if it is used in high performancemode.  and if itis in power saver it should last around 2 1/2 hrs.  and if you are keeping on your lap top for along time then keep it plugged.  bcz. when plugged in power is used directly from the cord. not from the battery.  but when you turn off your computer than do not for got to un plug that.|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	It's fine.Also people may tell you to take the battery out.Some pc manufacturers do NOT recommend this as dust will get in the battery compartment and can possibly mess everything up.|`|xdlsGvldaa	Yes 1 1/2 to 2 hrs. use is normal depending on what battery you have in it. Leaving it plugged in will not hurt it but you do need to run it on battery at least once a month until battery is low so as to cycle the battery charge. I have two lap tops that stay on 24/7 and one is 6 plus yrs. old with no problems. I do close the cover and let them cool and rest when not in use.  Hope this helps

Obbg9t03aa	Its an obsolete technology popular 10 years back by Internet Service Providers to provide Internet to dial up customers.    They were a bank of 20 to 40 card modems in a compact form factor kept in a rack of hunderds of such boxes collectively called as a pool    With advent of broadband it has been obsolete but still some people with absolute shoe string budget for internet or living in remote parts where broadband has not reached still used dialup connection to connect to the PSTN modem pool.|`|AA12221702	Much as these guys answered, it's a bank of modems with a similar telephone number that provide connectivity to a network (or internet) for POTS (plain old telephone service) lines.      On the front end, you dial a number from your computer's modem, that number hits a switch which directs the call to a modem pool.    On the back end of the modem bank would be a T1(or DS1 to be more accurate) line which feeds off to the network, usually to another switch onto a DS3 or Ethernet segment.    Typically a modem connects at up to 56 (ISDN at 64) Kps, and a DS1 runs at 1544 Kbs, so you can have around 24 active lines communicating simultaneously, the rest of the circuit bandwidth is used for signaling and other overhead.|`|YuRqoIymaa	PSTN is the Public Switch Telephone Network which is basically the telephone service back bone where all calls end up when communicating between providers, just to put it simple.. there is a lot more to it.

There also is "mirrors" that you can go to so that you can download from an alternative website if the server is down. You're talking about Frostwire which has nothing to do with the question he's asking.

2LHgmq97aa	I would get a PC (either Toshiba L305 or Toshiba Qosimo for gaming/video production), I would avoid Mac...    With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts.

As stated above, the mactards that think their precious laptops aren't susceptible to viruses are quite comical: EVERYTHING can get a virus. It's just that with 90% market share, it's easier for a virus creator to write it to destroy Windows computers and cause haywire than it is to write one for Mac.    You should look into the Lenovo IdeaPads or ThinkPads. ThinkPads are known for being almost indestructible- I've got two that are over a dozen years old, and they both operate at near new levels. Sure, their battery life is a little short, but considering it's the same battery in both of them as what was in them the day they were created, you gotta believe they're built to last.

Spyware Terminator can even be integrated with a free anti-virus client called Clam AV (if you enable this protection, it will download it automatically).  If you choose to do this, however, be sure to completely uninstall AVG; having two real-time virus monitors active simultaneously is a recipe for trouble.  All of the programs listed here are freeware (paid versions may be available, but they are OPTIONAL; there is no limit on use of the free versions except for missing certain advanced features) and can be downloaded from http://www.download.com .    Another alternative is Comodo Internet Security, a free bundle that has optional virus protection, as well as firewall and system protection.  Again, uninstall AVG if you choose to use its real-time virus protection.  You can read more about the program's features and download it here: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... .  You can choose which features to activate during the installation.    I hope this helps.

Ev6WQRmzaa	Yes it's safe    It'd be pretty hard to make an open-source virus|`|71HDedRmaa	You Can Check It By the Phishing Filter you can switch it on(In I.E. only)by going on the internet options                                                    Phishing Filter checks the website on microsoft database wheter it's reported or not|`|bDPqMrb8aa	it ought to be. make sure you trust the souce and have a virus protection software just to be safe though.
U9n960GYaa	Service packs are issued for a reason... security and functionality...    YES... it would be to your advantage to install SP3.  Many hours of research and developing has went into making your Windows OS as safe and worry free as possible.... You can always un-install the service pack if it gives you problems... but it won't !!      GOOD LUCK !!!|`|ApOeJ0KBaa	Download, Microsoft wouldn't have released it if it were bad. I think there are some security upgrades in there too.|`|fj6YUwBUaa	More securtiy updates. Kernel patches everything you need to stay up to date with and outdated OS. Download, install, enjoy. You have nothing ot worry about.
sSEy6KYiaa	Yes - No computers "come" with MS Word - that is how Microsoft makes their bilions in cash by selling it to you.    You can use OpenOffice which works with Word and is free.    PCs come with a DEMO version - when it runs out you pay to use it - unless the person who bought the computer bought Office at the same time that they bought the computer.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You don't have to buy Word.  Open Office is as good as Microsoft office in most of its programs, and better in some.  You just have to save files in the Microsoft format - the default is a more efficient Open Office format.  And a few things are done differently in OO (I prefer their way of printing envelopes).  There are also TONS of free add-ons.    Why would anyone spend money on Microsoft Office?|`|9a525103a8f9794c8bbbfec452cdfc7faa	only trial version    you can download openoffice.org for free and it will do everything microshaft word will except charge you high prices. It will open word files and you can edit them also. You just have to save the files as the microsoft format.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	most computers either come with a trail version for Microsoft word or don't have it at all and make you use word pad. these days Word comes in a bundle with other things and some people get sticker shock when they see the price...|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Most computers stop doing that.

You just can't create new word documents.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Many computers come with a free trial version of Office installed.  But if you want one with the full version, you'll have to special order it from a company like Dell.  It will add $150.00 or so to the cost of the machine.|`|SGh5R0rraa	you have to pay more to get the program CD|`|Sp3In8Ksaa	Most do nowadays.

If you are a student, there's a great deal for Microsoft programs -- the Ultimate Steal.  You get 10 Microsoft programs for $60 but you have to be a student and use an email address that ends in edu.  Here's the link:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    If you aren't a student, the best deal is the Home/School version that includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint only. You can find it for about $100, sometimes less on sale.|`|AlGIl16Daa	Consider using Open office, its completely free, and can do everything and more.    http://www.openoffice.org/|`|71HDedRmaa	Nowadays The Budget computers are not having MS Office preinstalled  as Microsoft Corp Has introduced a new range for word processors i.e. Microsoft works It has spreadsheet ,database & word processot too  the features are some but because it is a shareware so you can have it most Computers thet Too preinstalled...That's A deal Between the computer company & microsoft                           That clearly means you cannot have MS OFFICE pre installed in any of budeget computers(Rs 5789-Rs 49,990)|`|uQdurp7iaa	Most Windows 98, XP, or later come with Microsoft Word as the default word processing program.|`|abfk0DsXaa	I'm not exactly sure.

ugKLbpg7aa	Well, if you run a PC, I know what to do, not on a Mac.    Anyway, if you right-click on the desktop/wallpaper, and hover over "Arrange Icons By", make sure that "Align to Grid" has a check mark next to it. If not, press it and that should fix it.    If it is checked, select "Properties" from the original menu, press the "Desktop" tab at the top, and select something else. If that doesn't fix it, keep the different one selected, and restart your computer (Press the Windows key, and that loads up the Start menu).    As for your start menu, if you hover over where it would be at the very edge of the screen, if you see the mouse arrow change to what looks like a black arrow on a stick, click and drag a small way into the screen. That should bring back your start menu and all that other stuff.    If that doesn't work, scan your whole computer with a good anti-virus software like AVG, McAfee, or Norton Antivirus.    Hope this helps :)|`|52NUYQJ8aa	turn your computer off.  then ater about 5-10 minutes..  turn it back on.  if that does not help,  contact at&t or whos ever internet connection you have.  they will help.

Puz4ggr8aa	Have you considered trying Wrap Text and AutoFit Row Height on the ingredients column?      You can get a new line within a cell by using Alt-Enter.     That way you could get all of your ingredients in one record and perhaps solve your merge problem.    ADDED ++++++++++++++    If the ingredients were listed in the format Amount, space, Unit, space, Name (eg. 1 tsp sea salt) the following code would create a complete ingredient list with Amount, Unit, and Name in separatecolumns ready for sorting and summing.    Sub ListIngredients()  Dim oCell As Object, iSh As Long, iRow As Long, iCol As Long  Dim sIngr() As String, iIngr As Long, sSec() As String, iSec As Long    iSh = 2  iRow = 1  iCol = 1  For Each oCell In Sheets(1).Columns(4).Cells  sIngr = Split(oCell, vbLf, -1)  For iIngr = 0 To UBound(sIngr)  sSec = Split(sIngr(iIngr), " ", 3)  For iSec = 0 To UBound(sSec)  Sheets(iSh).Cells(iRow, iCol + iSec) = sSec(iSec)  Next  iRow = iRow + 1  Next  Next  End Sub    It is example code that works but would need adjustment for your exact specifications including carying more information from each row into the ingredient list.   It is only intended to show that a reasonable solution can be developed.    ADDED ++++++++    One more option If you can determine the maximum number of ingredients a meal can have.    For each row in the "normal" source file:  If it is a new meal then  Sdd a row to the target worksheet with the complete record  Else add the record's ingredient to the first blank column in the current record.    You will end up with records that have several columns of ingredients and most will have some blank colums.  Set up the merge to print all of the columns with the ingredients one per line with extra indent like you usualy see them printed.  The blank columns will not show.    There may be a way to handle you issue at the merge side but my experience has to be more successful by tackling thing from the merge file preparation side.    Good Luck whatever you try.  .

That's what I'd be wondering.|`|mOAY4FbJaa	If this is actually a commercial product meant to help ensure the security of the family PC--not to mention the on-line safety of any minors in the home--it may not be possible to block it with standard anti-spyware tools.  Some of the best anti-spyware utilities are Spyware Terminator, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, and Ad-Aware Anniversary Edition, all of which are free and can be downloaded from http://www.download.com.  If you need real-time protection, consider AVG Free Edition.  Spyware Terminator also has a real-time shield; however, it should be noted that enabling two different real-time monitors simultaneously can cause unexpected problems.  Be careful if you choose to activate Spyware Terminator's real-time shield in conjunction with another application, or just pick one and stick with it.  Remember, though, that if this is commercial software, these utilities may recognize it as legitimate software and thus not block it.  They should, however, prevent most types of spyware from infecting your system.    I hope this helps.

c874b1d8eaaa56613f2d2ab359c1a965aa	You are given an array with n elements { x1, x2 ... xk ... xn }. You are also given an array location k.<br>  Using constant space and O(n) time, rotate the array such that it contains { xk, xk+1 ... xn, x1, x2 ... xk-1 }.|`|AA11250450	This....<br>  <br>  <br>  Suppose we have an array A containing n equi-spaced elements. The object is to rotate the elements of A by k locations for some k, 0 < k < n. We can express this by <br>  <br>     A[i] <- A[i+k],   i <  n-k<br>          <- A[i+k-n], i >= n-k<br>  <br>  An alternative way to express it is to represent A as the concatenation of two arrays P and Q of lengths k and n-k respectively. Then we have <br>            A  = PQ<br>     rotate(A) = QP<br>  <br>  There are three major approaches to effecting rotation that I know of; these are: <br>  (1) Move one of the components into a scratch array, move the other component into its final position, and then move the component in the scratch array into its final position. <br>  <br>  The cost of this method (excluding loop costs) is: <br>  <br>     Data moves:  n + min(k, n-k)<br>     Aux storage: min(k, n-k)<br>  <br>  The catch in assessing costs is that the method lends itself to bulk data moves (via hardware instuctions or loop unrolling) so that data move costs are not comparable with those of other methods. Likewise the logic costs are not comparable except for naive implementations. <br>  In short, it shouuld be by far the fastest method of the three, but it does require a substantial amount of auxilliary storage. <br>  <br>  (2) Reverse each component separately and then reverse the entire array. Let r() be the reversal function. Then we have <br>  <br>     QP = r(r(P)r(Q))<br>  <br>  Calculating the costs of this method is straightforward. The reversal of an array of length n requires n/2 swaps. Each swap requires 3 data moves. Ergo, the number of data moves is 3n/2. Each element gets swapped twice, so the total number of data moves is 3n. The number of loop tests is n/2u where u is the loop unrolling factor. <br>  (3) Treat the rotation as a permutation of the array, and execute each permutation cycle separately. This is the most complicated of the three, potentially requires the fewest operations, and has the most varied implementations. <br>  <br>  Let d be the greatest common denominator of n and k. Then the permutation that carries A into rotate(A) has d cycles. For example, suppose that n=14 and k=6, so that d=gcd(14,6)=2. Then the permutation cycles are: <br>  <br>     (0, 6, 12, 4, 10, 2, 8)<br>     (1, 7, 13, 5, 11, 3, 9)<br>  <br>  Each cycle is of length n/d (7 in this case). A cycle consists of runs of indices increasing by k. Thus in our example, the runs in the first cycle are <br>  (0, 6, 12), (4, 10), and (2,8).  <br>  <br>  When the cycle begins at the beginning of a run the length of a run is either ldiv(n,k) or udiv(n,k) where ldiv is integer division rounded down and udiv is integer division rounded up. In our example the lengths are ldiv(14,6)=2 and udiv(14,6)=3. If, however, we start the cycle in the middle or end of a run that run will be broken, e.g., <br>     (8, 0, 6, 12, 4, 10, 2)<br>  <br>  has two runs of length one, one run length of two, one run of length three. <br>  When k > n/2 the long runs are descending runs. For example, suppose n=14, k=10. There are two cycles, <br>  <br>     (13, 9, 5, 1, 11, 7, 3)<br>     (12, 8, 4, 0, 10, 6, 2)<br>  <br>  In this example there are descending runs oflengths ldiv(n,n-k)=ldiv(14,4)=3, and udiv(14,4)=3. In many implementations it is convient to divide the algorithm into two cases, k < n/2, and k > n/2. In the latter case we replace k by n-k and change the direction of rotation. <br>  There are two special cases, k=0, and k=n/2. If k=0 there is nothing to do. If k=n/2 we can swap the first and last halves. The swap requires 3n/2 data moves and n/2 loop tests; this cannot be improved upon. The cases are: <br>  <br>     k = 0          Do nothing<br>     0 < k < n/2    Increment = k, ascending runs<br>     k = n/2        Swap first and last halves<br>     n/2 < k < n    Decrement = n-k, descending runs<br>  <br>  I will use the term "small slide" for a data move that is less than n/2 locations, and the term "big slide" for a data move that is greater than n/2, <br>  When the runs are ascending big slides occur when the array index is in the last k elements; similarly, when runs are descending big slides occur when the array index is in the first k elements. In either case the total number of big slides is k. It follows that the number of big slides in a cycle is k/d; likewise the number of runs within a cycle is also k/d. <br>  <br>  When effecting the rotation of a cycle the last big slide is not executed. Instead the saved initial value is used. In other words the sequence of events is: <br>  <br>        An initial value is saved.<br>        A loop consisting of k/d runs of small slides alternates<br>           with k/d-1 big slides.<br>        Array[final index] is filled with the saved value.<br>  <br>  There are two things to settle in translating the above into code. The first is how to terminate the loop. The simplest way is to determine the final index in advance (it will be the starting index + n - k) and exit when the final index is reached. <br>  The second is how to handle the alternation of small slide runs and big slides. One way is to use a simple loop with a test to determine if the current move is a big slide or a small slide. An example of this method is: <br>  <br>          index   = first<br>          last    = first + n - k<br>          save    = A[first]<br>          while (index .ne. last) begin<br>                  next     = index + k<br>                  if (next .ge. n) next = next - k<br>                  A[index] = A[next]<br>                  index    = next<br>                  end<br>          A[last] = save<br>  <br>  The costs of this code for a single cycle of length n/d are: <br>      Data moves:     n/d + 1<br>      loop tests:     n/d<br>      if tests:       n/d - 1<br>  <br>  The costs for processing the entire rotation (including a loop over d) are: <br>      Data moves:     n + d<br>      Tests           2n<br>  <br>  The above code performs two tests per element, a loop test and a test to see whether the move is a big slide or a small slide. <br>  Most implementations (including my March 2001 article) use some variant of the above loop. All are less efficient than they need be. <br>  We can reduce the number of tests per element by putting in an inner loop for the small slide runs. A naive (and slightly erroneous) implementation for ascending runs (k .lt. n/2)looks like this: <br>          nk      = n - k<br>          index   = first<br>          last    = first + nk<br>          save    = A[first]<br>          while (index .ne. last) begin<br>                  while (index .lt. nk) begin<br>                          A[index] = A[index + k]<br>                          index    = index + k<br>                          end<br>                  A[index] = A[index - nk]<br>                  index    = index - nk <br>                  end<br>          A[last] = save<br>  <br>  This code is wrong because the actual loop is a "loop and a half". That is, the final big slide should not be made. Because it is being made, the loop termination test is also wrong. We can fix this is either of two ways. The first is to move a copy of the small slide loop outside the cycle loop. The second is to move the termination test to the middle of the cycle loop. The code for the second alternative looks like this: <br>          nk      = n - k<br>          index   = first<br>          last    = first + nk<br>          save    = A[first]<br>          loop begin<br>                  while (index .lt. nk) begin<br>                          A[index] = A[index + k]<br>                          index    = index + k<br>                          end<br>                  if (index .eq. last) exitloop<br>                  A[index] = A[index - nk]<br>                  index    = index - nk <br>                  end<br>          A[last] = save<br>  <br>  The inner loop will be executed (n-k)/d times; costs for the loop are <br>      Data moves:     (n-k)/d<br>      Loop tests      n/d<br>  <br>  The loop termination test will be executed k/d times and the big slide will be executed k/d -1 times. The total costs for this code are: <br>      Data moves:     n + d<br>      Loop tests:     n + k + d<br>  <br>  The number of loop tests can be reduced by k by using an "until" loop instead of a "while" loop. This eliminates one loop test for each small slide loop. <br>  A similar economy can be employed in the outer loop over the number of cycles. If for some reason it is desirable to avoid computing the gcd, we can count the number of small slide loops executed; when the last cycle is completed this number will be k. Thus our code for ascending runs can look like this: <br>  <br>          nk      = n - k<br>          first   = 0<br>          count   = 0<br>          until (count .ge. k) begin<br>              last = first + nk<br>              index = first<br>              save  = A[first]<br>              loop begin<br>                  count += 1<br>                  until (index .ge. nk) begin<br>                      A[index] = A[index + k]<br>                      index   += k<br>                      end<br>                  if (index .eq. last) exitloop<br>                  A[index] = A[index - nk]<br>                  index   -= nk<br>                  end<br>              A[last] = save<br>              first  += 1<br>              end<br>  <br>  The analogous code for descending runs is: <br>          nk      = n - k<br>          first   = n - 1<br>          count   = 0<br>          until (count .ge. nk) begin<br>              last = first - k<br>              index = first<br>              save  = A[first]<br>              loop begin<br>                  count += 1<br>                  until (index .ge. nk) begin<br>                      A[index] = A[index - nk]<br>                      index   -= nk<br>                      end<br>                  if (index .eq. last) exitloop<br>                  A[index] = A[index + k]<br>                  index   += k<br>                  end<br>              A[last] = save<br>              first  -= 1<br>              end<br>  <br>  This code clearly is the most economical method for rotating an array in terms of operations used since it uses n+d data moves and loop tests.

If you are using normal DSL or Cable internet then unplug both your Cable modem/DSL modem and your router for an while.  When you reconnect you will most likely have a new IP address.  The longer you leave your router and modem unplugged, the greater your chance of getting a new IP address (if you only unplug it for a short time, your ISP might give you your same IP Address).<br>  <br>  If you have a premium DSL service where you are granted what is called a static IP, then your IP never changes and you will need to call you ISP to change it.

If you decide you want to install Ubuntu, that same disk will be your install CD.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can have Ubuntu ship you a CD totally free of charge.  Or, you can download Ubuntu from their site.  The download will be a special .iso file and you'll need to convert this file into the "live CD".  You do this with an .iso CD-burning application.

For that you will have to install them on different partitions on your hard drive. If windows uses all the space (single partition) right now then you will have to remove it first and then install again. When you do reinstall remember to create 2 partitions and  install linux first.

03066752d5ddd1e27a0c6f19e7d2b29baa	Precisely how much benefit you see will greatly depend on how far you are from the central office of the company providing the ADSL service. ADSL is a distance-sensitive technology: As the connection's length increases, the signal quality decreases and the connection speed goes down. The limit for ADSL service is 18,000 feet (5,460 meters), though for speed and quality of service reasons many ADSL providers place a lower limit on the distances for the service. At the extremes of the distance limits, ADSL customers may see speeds far below the promised maximums, while customers nearer the central office have faster connections and may see extremely high speeds in the future. ADSL technology can provide maximum downstream (Internet to customer) speeds of up to 8 megabits per second (Mbps) at a distance of about 6,000 feet (1,820 meters), and upstream speeds of up to 640 kilobits per second (Kbps). In practice, the best speeds widely offered today are 1.5 Mbps downstream, with upstream speeds varying between 64 and 640 Kbps. <br>  <br>  You might wonder, if distance is a limitation for DSL, why it's not also a limitation for voice telephone calls. The answer lies in small amplifiers called loading coils that the telephone company uses to boost voice signals. Unfortunately, these loading coils are incompatible with ADSL signals, so a voice coil in the loop between your telephone and the telephone company's central office will disqualify you from receiving ADSL. Other factors that might disqualify you from receiving ADSL include: <br>  <br>  Bridge taps - These are extensions, between you and the central office, that extend service to other customers. While you wouldn't notice these bridge taps in normal phone service, they may take the total length of the circuit beyond the distance limits of the service provider. <br>  Fiber-optic cables - ADSL signals can't pass through the conversion from analog to digital and back to analog that occurs if a portion of your telephone circuit comes through fiber-optic cables. <br>  Distance - Even if you know where your central office is (don't be surprised if you don't -- the telephone companies don't advertise their locations), looking at a map is no indication of the distance a signal must travel between your house and the office.|`|20f3f192b6e340166fd282303b6e59a0aa	I think you just answered your own question!

AA10834300	I think it will be alot simpler than you think it is. The technology has come a long way now and connectivity is now very much easier and the price of consumer electronics has fallen.    You will need :    A laptop or desktop computer (with a network card or built-in wi-fi)  A land telephone line that includes broadband Internet.  An all-in-one printer/scanner/fax  A lineline deskphone.    Optional Items:    A mobile telephone (cellphone).  A docking station (in the case you have a laptop).  A wireless router (if you want Internet access all over your house)      Setting up a remote office is alot like setting up a branch depot which I have to sometimes as part of my day job.    Clearly you are working from your home. The procedure I follow is to order the telephone line from the telecoms company. That may take a few weeks lead time to install. Order ADSL or other broadband Internet service on the telephone line so you can have fast Internet access and VPN (remote access) to your agency office.    Think about comfort when you are working. The last thing you want is to be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a decent working area that is seperate from your normal living area (if possible). That is why I suggest a docking station if you are using a laptop that lets you plug a normal keyboard, mouse and monitor into your laptop.    Also think about getting some kind of telephone headset. If you are likely to be spending some hours on the phone, you'll want some kind of headset with a microphone that you can wear on your head. A compatible desk phone will also be needed.    Once the landline is live you can hook up your wireless router (if you want wifi) or a normal network router (for wired connection). This will allow you to plug in any devices that you want to connect to the Internet with.    You might initally decide to get some help with the networking of your computer. It's fairly easy nowadays, however, you might want to get it done properly by a professional. Once it's set up, very little maintenance would be required.     I hope this helps you get started up.|`|AA10280523	Go for an iMac computer with the wireless network. Reliable and easy to use, and if I have it right, Apple will set up for you. They have great support, much less than necessary for PC-centric systems. Apple's higher price is justified by its reliability and features you must pay extra for with Windoze.  Of course, all this depends on whether the agency server will relate to Apple products. Since this would be a "cloud" environment, I'm guessing you'll have few problems.  Hope this works for you- PGC

4MYWPD9Yaa	If you're determined to get a Mac, I'd suggest one of the cheaper Macbooks. They're portable and a relatively good value.    I don't think they're better than Windows PCs. I don't think any operating system out of the major three kinds is better than the others. You use what you like best and what suits your needs.|`|tIDNEwdMaa	I think they are better.  That part of you question is easy.  The first part is too dependent on your needs.
474f4ee43db93ea02e0f93e6d5bee0daaa	You can go to your PC manufacturer website, then support, then enter your PC model, then download the BIOS, then to your floppy or flash.|`|PSVy9ZCpaa	Insufficient info.  The make and model of the computer, or if it is a home/custom built you will need the mobo model number.  Go to the computer/mobo mfg site, download the BIOS flash and utility for installing it.  Note: Flashing the BIOS can turn your computer into a door stop, if things go wrong.  If the current BIOS is not causing a problem, I suggest Leaving It Alone.  I've never had a problem, but have heard a bunch of horror stories.    Good Luck|`|jU8CX1veaa	Unless you have a very good reason to do so I wouldn't bother, using the wrong file could result in a dead motherboard and is not for the inexperienced    As you have given insufficient information about the motherboard this really reinforces the fact that you shouldn't do it or get a knowledgeable friend who knows what they are doing|`|IbxhRebgaa	Do you have a USB flash drive? You can probably download and copy the BIOS image to the drive and update from that.|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	if you hold down your DEL key when you fire your computer up it will take you straight into BIOS you can then look at all details & change the aspects you want to i have done it several times over the years|`|peFufWeYaa	This would depend on why you want to update it. Usually the bios has settings to adjust, say for instance, if you installed some new hardware and it is not being recognized properly. Also it is standard to be able to just push a button in your bios and get either the standard default setting or the best performance default setting, so you should look for that. There should also be a setting to either auto detect your hard drive or cdrom drives or install them manually. Push delete when you turn on  your computer to go straight to the bios menu.    You can go to various  websites and get software "flash updates" or "performance updates" but this is not recommended and unless you have flashed your bios before and are sure you know what you are doing you should not do this anyway, it can kill your computer.    However, bios chips have a tendency to overheat and when this happens, they become intermittant. Some people install special heatsinks on them for this reason. Replacing your chip is easy, it just unplugs. Below are two websites in that specialize in replacement bios. One has a flat rate of $27, the other I think cost $17. This is really your best option if you are having bios issues.|`|Xd19d4aqaa	go to the make of the motherboards website they usualy have something to update it    when updating you have to be realllllly careful because if your computer loses power you will need a new motherboard and there is no fixing it    sometimes you will need a floppy disk to put the update program on othertiems you can just run the program they give you but it should include instructions
uARQSXomaa	You can, and it works pretty well (esp. for the price).    The difference between the Bamboo and the more expensive Wacoms is mainly size and how many levels of sensitivity they have.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	Most often when that happens your docking station or computer system board has gone bad. It is possible that the connectors are dirty and simply cleaning them will fix it, but most likely it is one of the first two problems I mentioned. I've seen all as causes, but never software (I think it's hardwired into the system board & BIOS). You could also check your BIOS settings for the dock (F2 when it's booting up) to see if everything is set correctly, but I don't think there's anything there that would cause a problem. Hopefully it's still under warranty, if not then you'd have to find a good tech to troubleshoot and replace the offending piece or get a new computer and docking station.    Best of luck.

You'll be much happier in the long run.|`|AA11685625	It all comes down to one simple fact: subdomains are free; domains are not.    Even if it were possible to get a domain for free, you probably couldn't get one anyway, since I am assuming you are under the age of 18.     When you register for a domain you have to fill out your personal information. Your personal information then becomes public domain, and anyone can search for it through a whois database. Your email. Your address. Your phone number. Everything. This, of course, can't be avoided, not for free anyway.    There could be liability issues involved if you are a minor, especially if you do it without your parent's knowledge.    So yeah...you would have to wait until you can buy a domain on your own, which you have to do anyway, since there is no way to get a free domain.|`|AA10003024	just pay the 10 bucks/year for a domain dude over at godaddy or siteground or dreamhost. Then make your site at a free site such as wordpress.com or blogger or whatever. point your new domain to the free site. Done. Dreamweaver has nothing to do with getting a web domain.    So what was, yoursite.wordpress.com is now found at yourcooldomain.com    get it? Geez, a domain for a year, and people complain about the price when the blow just as much on a hamburger or a movie ticket in one day.|`|zGkqGZzYaa	Here is the straight SCOOP.  Domain Names are not FREE.  Web Hosting is not FREE.  However, some companies do offer FREE services if you don't mind them getting rich from plastering ADDs all over your site.  These companies are not in buisness to give there services away free. And, if they do there is a downside and you will suffer the downside.
HW0Tkl65aa	Not super sure what you are talking about but one of these might work.    Play with the setting on your monitor. There should be a menu button on it somewhere that will let you move the 'screen' around in the monitor.    Might be something amiss with the monitor. Try plugging you computer into another monitor to see if it shows up there too.
f3555023a5b5891dde0d56d094aff381aa	I love CL and have used it to buy/sell items, find jobs, apts, and dating.  I would suggest if buying from someone on CL to meet to get the item in person.  That way you can thoroughly inspect it.  Don't wire money to anyone, and try not to buy from people who are not in your area.  If you have a Paypal account, you may pay thru that, just make sure you are covered in case something bad happens.  Best bet...meet in person.|`|POsVIAVJaa	It's pretty much like the classifieds in your new paper.  My mom uses it and she found some degus (rodents) and they were fine.

Don't send money via Western Union to any people. They can tell you that Craigslist or eBay or XXXXXX will guarantee your purchase .  Stories my friend. If you send money via Western Union or Money Gram , you are lost. Also, you can loose money by sending in USA, to local bank account. If the price is too good to be true and they don't want to meet with you or they want the money to be sent in USA account but they are in Europe for don't know what reason, avoid that. Deal locally. <br>  <br>  Do that and you will keep your money home.|`|AA10046376	Personally I have not used craigslist...but often I have turned people tothat site and no one thus far has been upset in the least. I recommend that yuo get one that still has a warranty on it, therein protecting you  and keeping your investment on the straight and narrow. and completely above board!!! A warranty will indeed do this. So specify that that is essential...it may take a little bit longer to obtain, but it WILL be worth it!!! Some people have gotten those, and in my case wanting one, I knew somone who no longer wanted it so I did recieve it and it DOES have a warranty on it so I feel safer in using it!!! I really wish you the best as they are a gas and so much fun...protect yourself and your investment and negotiate till the cows come home about it!!! If it is on craigslist, y uwill get a great deal..but stipulate the warranty ...I think that will make yo uvery happy!!!!<br>  Thanks,<br>  Lioncourt

I found your model on HP/Compaq's website, and it states under Memory Layout (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB). When manufacturers list memory like this, it usually means one of the slots (the 1024MB max slot) is not upgradeable. Seeing as the only other slot allows an expansion of a 2Gb stick, you will not be able to use both sticks of RAM you linked from ebay, since it is two 1 Gb sticks. You will at most be able to use one of the 1 Gb sticks.    If you want to take full advantage of the expansion slot, you need one 2Gb stick of DDR2 (DIMM). See the second link in source for some of these.

UF8qU5cGaa	There are a number of alternatives to iTunes out there. I'm assuming you are using Windows, but there are options for Mac OS and Linux as well.    I recommend Songbird, a free, open source music player. But the other alternatives are equally good and ALL of them work with iPods.    EphPod is a more focused tool that is more geared towards transferring your files to your iPod than playing them.    Oh, and you do know you can *manually* transfer files to your iPod? The files are "hidden" when you view the drive.  http://www.mydigitallife.info/2006/07/16...

People are clicking on people's links, and it send them to a page that says they need to re-log into myspace, but it's not by myspace, but instead by people who made a page that looks exactly like the myspace page, and you are typing in your email and password and they store it, so that they can get into your account anytime they want and use it however they want. If you are redirected or told to log back in, go back to your address bar, and type in www.myspace.com. If it ask you to log in there, then it's really myspace, but always go back to the home page before you sign in, to make sure you really need to and it's not someone trying to get into your account. Good luck<br>  <br>  also, remember when you add someone as a friend, they must get on theirs and accept it before you two are officially "friends" on there, so it won't show up until they accept it.|`|1e45363918d03ad0985724b1754a88baaa	I regret joining myspace.com  Too many heathens!|`|07dbecd577f9ea4a7031637996b39fbcaa	they have to respond to your offer and accept it  for them to become your friends|`|d0216f291820c0afb9e4e9345f6f26eaaa	ok what you do is go to your email and click on a message that says myspace verify account then you click on it then it lets you add your friends once you verified your account you get me?|`|lFWB5vQOaa	Have you checked your email inbox?

JUF0rGUhaa	IP addressing is like number of your house so that the mail man knows where to send the mail without it then it would take forever to locate your house. Same thing in On IP addressing, in this case it's the packets that sends to your particular IP address. <br>  <br>  A subnet mask is masking the real IP address. Typically, a subnet may represent all the machines at one geographic location, in one building, or on the same local area network. Having an organization's network divided into subnets allows it to be connected to the Internet with a single shared network address.|`|AA10036593	IP addresses are 32 bit binary numbers. (For version 4, the most common... V6 will have a larger number!)<br>  <br>  For simplicity, it is displayed as 4 decimal numbers separated by dots, each decimal going from 0 thru 255.<br>  <br>  These numbers have special meanings in a fairly arcane code that relates to "class"... representing how many addresses can be directly accessed.  See the reference below for more info about class A, B, C addresses...<br>  <br>  The subnet mask tells the software whether another address is on the same network and can be accessed without rerouting.  The subnet mask is "logically or'd" with the "from" address and the "to" address to determine whether access will need to go thru another router.  Example:<br>  <br>  Let's say MY address is 192.168.0.32<br>  and I want to get to 192.168.0.100<br>  If my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0<br>  then I would be OK, since the "255" (in binary: 11111111) means the corresponding from/to numbers MUST match, and the "0" (in binary 00000000) means the numbers MAY BE DIFFERENT!<br>  So in the example above, 256 addresses (all with the 4th decimal position different) can be directly addressed... any other address needs to pass thru another gateway or router for forwarding to the destination.<br>  <br>  Another example: A mask of 255.255.255.240 would only allow the last number to be from 0-15, with only 16 addresses on the same network...<br>  <br>  A lot to explain in a small answer space!<br>  See the larger article below for more info on this topic!|`|WJAFO2FBaa	IP address shows for all internet connection.   You have a Fix IP or Dynamic.  Fix normally is provided with cable.  Dynamic IP's normally change every so often when you log on.<br>  <br>  Subnet masking is when you hide your ip with a IP that is pointed to another location.  Softwares offer this like GHOST Software they enable you to hide your IP to deter tracking etc.

Pick one on this page http://onlinefaxfree.net/, sign-up and fax away!     It is a lot cheaper then faxing from a fax machine because fax machines are the most electricity consuming office machine, wastes paper, ink can get jammed and online faxing is a green solution!

dkpIjt5jaa	How much power is necessary for the average PC system, if there is such a thing nowadays?    ( Source = http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power... )    Take a look at what youve had in the past. If you bought a standard power supply from one of the top computer manufacturers, chances are you purchased a 250- to 300W power supply of average quality.    Now that is more than enough for your run-of-the-mill system consisting of a hard drive, an optical drive and a fair-to-middling graphics card.    However, if you are going to add more peripherals you need to seriously consider upgrading your power supply.    For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately how much wattage you will need to run various common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):    The Motherboard: 15-30  Low-end CPU: 20-50  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100  RAM: about 7 per 128MB  PCI add-in card: 5  Low to midrange graphics board: 20-60  High-End graphics board: 60-100  IDE hard drive: 10-30  Optical drives: 10-25    So let's calculate a system with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including the 2 (high-end) graphic cards), 2 hard drives and 2 optical drives.    That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+200(2 X 100)+60(2 X 30)+50(2 X 25) = 679    So compare your computer specs with the list and do your own math, you will then know what PSU you should get (NOTE: Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 800 Watts and check prices to get up to 850 Watts if the price difference is slight)|`|812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	Well you will need to check and see if you add the correct ram, and also see if you do have enought power to run everything else on you computer.  you might also want to check if you computer can handle the upgrade you've done. check you MOBO to see if you can add a larger power supply to your system.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	get atleast a 500w power supply you are overloading your current one badly.

There is one MAJOR flaw in macs, which is that only the extremely expensive models come with good graphics cards. That means that almost no macs can run any modern games.

The operating system is clean and intuitive. One hitch is that many Windows programs don't have Mac counterparts. However, the new (Intel Based Macs) can be partitioned and can run both windows and mac osx. Oh, and for the replier who was talking about viruses, he obviously is not familiar with the mac architecture. One simple command on a mac can kill a program, thus making viruses ineffective.

IyCnihLmaa	If you can't afford it, you will have to learn to do without.      The bad economy was caused by those who lived beyond their means and used credit and now it caught up to them.  If you want whatever it is bad enough, you will have to find a way to pay for it yourself instead of trying to freeload off of others who do have to pay for it.
mFUWjeGpaa	Sorry, I think the keyboard's shot.  The reason it took a while is because the milk seeped through the membranes and rubber bumpers etc. inside of it, and once it reached the circuit board, it fried it.  Look for a cheap one, it won't be hard to find, and what kind of keyboard is the other one?  Please add additional details and I'll try to help by editing this post.    Ok... Google the name of the keyboard + "driver vista" and see if that comes up with anything.  If you can, install the driver, if not, look into getting a PS/2 to USB converter.  They're simply little round nubs that have a female PS/2 component, and a male USB component.  After plugging this into the USB port, see if it works.  If not, use the driver you may have obtained earlier.  That's all I have for now :||`|rMs4WBfcaa	Turn it upside down with keyboard facing in front of a window with sunshine coming in and let it dry out|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	get another one they are cheap and dont drink while u use ur computer|`|8nLuyDmPaa	If the spare keyboard is PS2 instead of USB, (Round plug in instead of flat), you may need to turn your computer off, plug in the keyboard, and then turn the computer back on.    If the spare keyboard is USB, try plugging it into another USB port.  When you first turn the computer on with the spare keyboard, can you turn the Num Lock off and on (Does the light go off and on when doing so?)  If that works, the keyboard is working, but may need a driver in Windows. Most keyboards should be found and have basic functionality automatically.  Some with special buttons will not work 100% until a driver is loaded.

7hrOjPwjaa	As mentioned before, the Spanish myspace thing is totally unrelated to the backup and update you did.  If you havent tried to change the resolution using the display settings then try that first. Right click desktop>properties/ or Personalise (vista)>display settings. Here you can move the slider to change the resolution.  Also you can try clicking on an empty space on the desktop and then hold ctrl and scroll up and down with mouse scroll wheel to make icons and font smaller or larger.  If that doesnt work, i'd update my video drivers and then try those 2 things i mentioned again.  If that fails, do a system restore to the nearest point available which was prior to when you did the update.

Although I am not sure for the exact steps for that computer.  If it works the same as windows XP OEM installation, then it should be a graphical interface, easy to follow, and would do the formatting for you. Then you would just need to install the driver for your computer.    You may need to set the bios to check the cd for a bootable program before the hard drive.

Steps:    1- Well depending on the Operating System that you are currently booted into you might want to find the boot disk for the particular Operating System.  2- Take a backup of all your personal files and make sure it is recoverable by windows.(Warning if not done right; you could run the risk of loosing all your files).  3- Place the boot disk into the CD/DVD -RW/ROM drive and then restart the computer.  4- After the computer restarts and passes the BIOS menu, you will have to press any key to enter into the boot disk to install or repair windows.  5- Once into the Installation of the Windows Operating System. Follow the steps that are shown up in the Installation wizard.. this will guide you thought the rest of the installation process to complete the installation of windows.  6- Now you should be able to recover the document's and recover the computer the normal state.
wSPywgSWaa	Computer needs motherboard, processor, RAM, and video card,power supply,harddisk,ROM,and at last casing|`|CwuwsTimaa	right, depends what you want to do with your computer.    if you want a standard gaming rig as is most common in today, with your CPU you'll want an Intel (sorry, im biased, correct me if AMD have gotten better), Quad core will be more futureproof, but a higher spec dual core will be better for todays gaming as games find it easier to take control of 2 cores.    And if your not sure, stay away from liquid cooling till you've learned how to set up your PC    with that you''ll want a decent heatsink, now shop around, basically what you pay for is what you get. Id reccomand a Zalman cooling solution.    If your going for hi-end DDR3 ram then you'll want a ram cooler as well as DDR3 churns out lots of heat (well... comparatively), Corsair Dominator are good, but pricey.    Any good case worth its weight in salt will have fans built in. A personal favorite of mine is the Lian Li PCP-P80, however its pricey.    Do you know about PSU's. if not again just stick with corsair. (theyre reliable and you get a good warranty), if your gettin just the 1 GPU, then ye wont need more than 700 Watts, but if your goin for SLI/crossfire then youll want up to 1200 if your getting the 4 core extravaganza.    Sound cards are good extras, if you ahve the cash. no need to worry about cooling there tho. And GPUs should have heatsink built in. dont get 1 with a passive 1 however.    Oh. and get the most expensive heatsink paste you can get!    its worth it (plus its only like 7 quid. Artic silver 7 i think its called, i cant remember...)

UrUpWmA7aa	Ok, there is a small b and a capital B  small b is bit, and big B is byte. 1B = 8b's. 8 bits per byte.    Most things, like memory cards are measured in Bytes, as where network peripherals, like modems are typically measures in bits.    Now for scale.  a KB or KillaByte is 1,000 Bytes Small files like low resolution pics, office docs are in this scale    a MB or MegaByte is 1,000,000 Bytes - Most files will be measureable in MB - Music, Movies. Note - A CD holds 700MB    a GB or GigaByte is 1,000,000,000 Bytes - Hard drives are measured in GB. A DVD can hold 4.7GB    next is TB/TeraByte at 1,000,000,000,000 - Only the top end hard drives are measureable in this scale    And yes, technically its 1024 bytes in a kilabyte, but the difference is not worth caring about|`|48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	b - bit  B -byte 8 bits in a byte  KB - kilobyte - 1024 B in a KB  MB megabytye - 1024 KB in a Megabyte (don't ask why 1024, it just is)|`|OqVALZDAaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte

a3C6DeNeaa	Really? because every stop motion program I've ever tried has the option to import images from the hard drive.    To actually frame-grab and/or compile the movie, I'd suggest using Monkeyjam if you're on a PC. It's free.    http://www.giantscreamingrobotmonkeys.co...    AnimatorDV: Simple+ became freeware.    http://www.animatordv.com/download7        If you're on a Mac, you could try Framethief or FramebyFrame.    http://www.framethief.com/    http://web.mac.com/philipp.brendel/Softw...    With any of these programs you can set the framerate of your video, and how long each image lasts onscreen (even as little as one frame).  This amount of control will help your stop-motion look less slow and less choppy.    You can also check out this website for other stop motion animation programs; some free, some retail. I haven't used any of them (other than Stop Motion Pro) so I couldn't tell you if the rest of their features were any good or not, but at least it gives you other options.    http://www.stopmotionworks.com/stopmosof...|`|4CDGiSRwaa	I understand your question, but I'm not answering...

Mininova and Azureus Vuze work really well too. It might look complicated at first, but it's really not that bad. It's like 5 steps, really.    1.) Download Vuze   2.) Search "Suspiria" either in the Vuze search bar or on the Mininova website, I usually just use the search bar though.   3.) Click the link with the name of the movie, it'll say something like xViD at the end but it's still the movie.  4.) A new page will open up, click the button at the top that says download (clearly=P) or "Download This Torrent", either one works  5.) When the movie's been downloaded it will appear in the "Unwatched" section.  To watch it go into "Unwatched", click on the movie and hit the play button at the top of the window.    ...Sorry, I'm bad at explaining things.

Create a new MyDocs folder in E drive and Move your "MY Documents" to E drive or any other drive that got enough free space.     To do this.. rt.click on MyDocuments, select properties, under Target folder location, there is an option to "move"..Click on it and select the newly created folder in E dirve...thats all..ones u apply the changes, it will move all ur files in "My Documents" to E drive...this should free some good amount of space on C dirve and this is also a good practice to safe guard important files in My Documents folder ...in case of OS crash.    Hope this helps. :)
pDUI8hVWaa	Most people are Windows users.  They don't understand how to use a Mac, so they say they suck.    I know this, because my art class uses them, and the only people who like them are the people who know how to use them. They're so simple, people think they're difficult.    My family just got a Mac, and my dad (an avid Windows user) hates it. My mom used to hate it, but now since she only uses the one computer, thinks Windows are difficult.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Ignorance. Notice the claims by Windows users that Macs are overpriced. Independent organizations have proven that a Mac costs about 10 to 15% more than a Windows PC when you put the same software & hardware on a PC that comes standard with a Mac. Add in that Macs have the highest resale value, best tech support and Mac users come out ahead. I think the Windows users get upset about having to deal with 1,000,000 viruses.|`|wC78NaFqaa	Simple, one word answer .....

Apple has always not followed suit and been bass ackwards. Ask yourself why sales for mac have never exceeded 5 percent of the market while windows based systems have rules for 25 years.  Soz, I've run some of the most sophisticated software in the world at my job. Now retired, I programmed one off industrial machines that ranged in price from a quarter million dollars to over 50 million, I never once nor any of my colleagues ever saw someone walk in the door with an Apple product, they would have been laffed out the door. You know NOTHING of the facts  Kahless,  I just put together a gamer for a friend, cost in parts, 700 bucks....we went to apple to configure the same, price when done....5,586 bucks.

It is indeed a process to run the game.  :P|`|V0fwqea7aa	What you have is probably not a virus. Here is its description:  "game.exe is a process which is registered as W32.Gaze@mm worm. This virus is distributed via the Internet through e-mail and comes in the form of an e-mail message, in the hopes that you open its hostile attachment. The worm has its own SMTP engine which means it gathers E-mails from your local computer and re-distributes itself. In worst cases this worm can allow attackers to access your computer, stealing passwords and personal data. This process is a security risk and should be removed from your system. Please see additional details regarding this process."  If you haven't opened any file with this name, then don't worry. The Game.exe that you have encountered must be part of your Bejeweled 2 game, since Bejeweled shuts down when game.exe is closed. If you're still worried, though, then run the scan that I mention in my source. Don't worry, you don't have to download or pay for it.. it will just let you know what's on your computer.

FTvkahKWaa	When the file cannot be converted or too small size, it means the file is in the wrong format...    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|3wzCumkQaa	Well make sur its a video format that youtube can easily play!

83vhCGW1aa	Take an Ethernet cable and connect it to the Mac. Take the other end of that same cable and connect it to LAN or Ethernet Port at the back of the access point.     After connecting the Mac to the access point, assign a static IP address. To configure a Mac to get an IP address automatically, you have five steps:         1. Connecting the Devices Together     2. Checking If the Mac Is Set To DHCP     3. Checking the Routers IP Address     4. Getting the DNS Servers From a Linksys Router     5. Configuring a Static IP Address On the Ethernet Adapter    Next its time to access the setup page for your router.  This has three steps:     1. Open a web browser.     2. Go to the Address bar then enter your access points default IP address and press return.     3. A new window will prompt for a Name and Password. Leave the Name field blank, type in your access points password in the Password field then click Log In.  The default password for linksys routers is usually "admin".    Most of my this answer is nearly word for word from the linksys support site, but I didn't go through all of the instructions for doing some of the steps, so if you start thinking, "But how do I know if my mac is set to DHCP?" or "How do I do step number 4?" or something, just go to the linksys page & enter the serial number of your router in the support area.    If you are interested in advancements in wireless internet that could save you all this difficult stuff, check out WiMax from Clear.  http://www.clear.com/?utm_source=bc It is high speed wireless internet that's not too expensive.

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Take it back under warranty.  If you don't want to do than use compressed air to clean it out|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...

If you already have a place where your website files are being hosted online, and would like to place it on your web page, then you will need to convert your movie from the Windows Media Video (WMV) forman, to the FLASH forman.  This will compress the video so that it can be played smoothly over the internet.  You can get a free conterter here.  http://www.squared5.com/    A better solution is to upload your video to a service like google video, and then copy and paste that code into your webpage.

UrUpWmA7aa	A UPS is an uninteruptable power supply, which would have nothing to do with performance. It is a battery that the computer runs off of if your power goes out.    Wild guess, but I'm going to say that you are best of reformating your computer. If things are super slow, you probably have spyware or something. In any case, you system sounds unstable and a reformat will fix this as well.
AA11282699	A UPS is a universal power supply; a battery back-up.  They do go bad and no longer hold a charge.  That will not cause a slow-down.  Try doing both a virus scan and a spyware scan.  If needed, download spybot S&D (free) and run that.  You will be surprised by the amount of malware it will find.

I also suggest that you try to login to "www.myjoomlainstallation.com/admin/" instead of "myjoomlainstallation.com/admin/" (or vice versa... check the hostname in the joomla admin section).|`|1ibHGaAhaa	I agree I am having the same problem today, something wrong and it might be related to the date I suppose. Or maybe just a coincidence. Let me know if you find out something, other sites I have seem to be ok.

I tried to install 1.5 and couldn't but when I told the installer to use the old DB, it installed  (in a different directory) and fix the problem I was having correcting the session errors.  Hope this helps. Good luck!
48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	SQL is a language (Simple Query Language I think). MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft MSSQL are all database products. To query a database (get meaning full information from data) it is very helpful to understand the SQL language.|`|v6BcjOdWaa	If you can learn all of them, great.  First, know what you are good at, what you want to do, and what you can do for long time without getting bored or tired.     MySQL, Access and Oracle are about relational database management system(RDBMS). If you want to be a database administrator, SQL is the basic, and dive into vendor specific like Oracle, DB2, etc.     If you want to build a custom application for company's internal use or for any other purposes, you need to have firm foundation about programming. Try C, C++, Java, VB     If you want to build a dynamic websites or web applications, try HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP or ASP and/or Perl, Python or Java.     Just find out what you are good at, and dive into that area.  If you tend to pay too much attention to small details, and if you don't mind spending hours, days or even weeks trying to find out small typo(bugs) out of tens thousand lines of code, you are a natural born programmer.     If you are trying to learn the above just to get a job, you'd better find another field.|`|zmPuqU0zaa	Things are moving more towards web solutions rather than standalone Windows apps so you may want to explore ASP.net or PHP. If you want to work in a company type environment you may be better with ASP. Database wise you should probably look at SQL Server..

fUF1UIZbaa	OK, first of all not many laptops are under 450$. You might find some windows xp machines with pentium mobile or centrino processors, but nothing newer with the now standard dual core. Plus, they would be 14-15 inch screen size monsters (heavy and thick). 12.5" is ultraportable range, and there all computers are fairly expensive. My recommendation: if you need to carry the computer around, do medium performance stuff on it, etc, I would suggest a more expensive computer from a company like HP or Toshiba. If you are not going to walk around with it, and are just going to do basic basic stuff, one of the 450$ bricks might work for you. If you want a portable laptop you will need to spend more... Some of the HP and Toshba satellites are nice. I have a Sony VAIO VGN-SZ440 (low performance 13.3 inch thin and light) and although it is very expensive, it is easy to carry. Any computer larger than 13.3 inch screen and 4-4.5 pounds is a PAIN in the shoulder to carry around. Don't buy computers used, laptops can get quite abused, and soon you'll find band sectors on the hard drive, blue screens, nonexistant battery life, etc.|`|j9cfPJ1Zaa	here is one at best-buy for $449.99, and it has better specs then you had listed there: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Check the compaq at www.radioshack.com

Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

fUF1UIZbaa	I don't know much about ATI cards (I am an Nvidia user) but crossfire / SLI give only modest framerate improvements. They also use up much more power (a problem if you have a small power supply) and you need a special motherboard (expensive.) A single powerful card is a good choice if you only have one monitor. IF YOU HAVE 2 monitors, 2 cards are better than one, running a game on 2 monitors really slows down a card so if you get 2 but do not use crossfire / sli it will help a lot compared to 2 monitors on one card.I might recommend an Nvidia 8800GTS, I have one in my recently built computer and it works well. Make sure you have PCI express and a 450w power supply.|`|793IpAn1aa	Single 4850 (or if your budget is really tight, 4830)    Better performance, keeps the option to CF another card later down the road, uses less power and generates less heat than dual cards...|`|xGTXUFtiaa	That's a tough call really, they are both good cards, and actually the two 4650 cards probably won't draw that much more power than the single 4850, note that they don't require an external power source.  I am running Crossfire 4670 cards right now and love them, but in your case I'd say the single 4850 would be a better choice.  As others have said, you can add another card later if you want, and it won't even have to be a 4850, Crossfire can support different cards.  You will also leave more space inside your system and generate less heat.|`|RfsiA3Zeaa	go for the single higher one now.  that way you can cross-fire it with another one (for cheap) later.|`|zxyevbRgaa	looks like the one card is better than the 2 in crossfire.Most of the specs on the 4850 are more than twice the specs on the 4650  except texture fill rate.    http://www.techarp.com/article/Desktop_G...

You'll have to write a convincing plan, as less than one in 1000 startups actually get funding.  You'll need to convince the VC's that your company will offer something no other company does, and how you will be able to protect that position to ensure profitability.    Generally, funding is done in phases, so you'll get a little bit to start, and as you show progress, you'll get more and more.    Always be careful, however, that you don't sign away your entire company to the VC's before the IPO (if you're lucky enough to get there).

eMastNfraa	Yeah, you're right. Whatever you choose to do, someone else will probably already have done - but why would that stop you!? Do you feel the same thing about being born? About living home at some point which you probably did or still do? Just figure out what you really want to write about and write about it, don't care about if anyone else have done it!    I'm blogging about Japanese popular culture on my blog at www.yokazeblog.com (check it out if you're interested in that stuff) and millions of people have done that before me and still do, but that doesn't stop me.

2dkCdd3Yaa	In order for the computer to see the new Hard Drive you will need to turn the SATA Port/Drive on in the BIOS.     To enter the BIOS press the F2 key when the system first turns on (at the Dell Screen). Once you enter the BIOS you will need to press the down arrow key to "Drives" and then press the enter key. Go to the port you have installed the drive at, and change the option from "Off" to "On". Once the drive has been turned on exit the BIOS by pressing the Esc key, and then choose the option to "save settings and exit".     One other thing is that once the drive has been turned you should be able to see the drive's detailed information in BIOS (capacity etc). If this information is not listed here there might be another problem. First I would check your power cables and connections and then if that does not work try swapping the drive to another SATA port. Make sure to have the computer off when attempting to change/move cables/ports.     Once Windows boots it should find the new hard drive and you will be able to format it.     I hope this helps.    On a side note you should also update your Chipset to the latest version. If you have any further questions please let me know.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Most new drives do not come formatted, check and see|`|PSVy9ZCpaa	Don't know if these drivers are pertainent to your problem, but Dell has SATA drivers for some specific drives.    http://support.dell.com/support/download...

Once there, (AND BE COMPLETELY SURE THAT THIS IS THE MICROSOFT.COM) follow the steps to restoring your computers correct identification.    I hope you have patience... This could be time consuming.

Do you mean they messed with the cables between like the desktop and the keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor, etc.  Or did they open the desktop and mess with the wires inside the case?    If the opened the case and messed with the wires inside, pack everything that even looks like it might belong and head for a computer repair shop.    If they messed with the cables, between the various devices, it depends.  Is this a PC or a MAC?  How old is the machine.  Device cabling has changed over the last few years with USB becoming popular and Serial/Parallel losing ground.    Generally speaking, look at the shape of the ends of the various cables.  They should match with only one section of the devices.

5O7NmZDZaa	As far as im concern when you install lime wire you were asked on what folder you will save the downloaded songs, You should have browse to where the destination of the downloaded songs. But then what is done is done, just try to copy or cut the downloaded music then paste it  to the my music folder."Be very careful in downloading files from limewire, you don't want to reformat your computer"|`|fHReeuALaa	visit http://audiomaza.blogspot.com
srtoPxN2aa	I use both the web uploader, and the imeem uploader and I get the same results from time to time...not sure why though. The songs seem to play fine on my Windows Media Player, yet imeem wont accept them. Though initially they appear to upload correctly, without the dreaded red imeem "error"...  I have uploaded thousands of 320 kbps songs to my imeem accounts without incident, so I'm 100% sure bit rate is not the issue.  I have only encountered this problem with music I've uploaded from obscure blogs. I have had success by searching for another blog with the same album, and repeating the process again.    Funny you should ask an imeem related question, as I answered this one a few minutes ago:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Here's the imeem feedback link...click on "Product Feedback" to create a new thread if you have any questions. I've found the moderators to be very helpful:  http://www.imeem.com/feedback    *No, their methods are the same. I've been a member for over a year now, and the only significant change they've made does not effect uploads. That change was a design upgrade on the "Create" page.  Of all the music files I've uploaded to imeem over the last year (thousands), I've only received the "We weren't able to recognize the file format you uploaded" a couple times...and this happened to me yesterday. So if this happened to you yesterday as well, maybe it's a temporary imeem glitch?  I received the message after trying to upload songs from this album, into one of my imeem playlists...  http://www.raremp3.co.uk/search/label/TH...  Click on "The Adventures of Robert Savage" in the first sentence of the first paragraph to obtain the upload. You may have to use a program like "Winrar" to extract your file. I've uploaded thousands of albums from these types of blogs over the last few years, and have never had a problem with music files not playing.   Let's trouble shoot OK? Once you've downloaded it, try to upload a few songs from the album to imeem....then let me know what happens...Cheers!    *Edit - Update...  I just tried uploading songs from the album I mentioned above with the web uploader, only this time I limited it to uploading two songs at a time...it worked fine. So this problem you're experiencing..."We weren't able to recognize the file format you uploaded"...must be a temporary imeem glitch...they have those from time to time.   Try uploading one or two songs at a time...see if that makes any difference for you...also, try running whatever anti- spyware program you use...sometimes that makes a big difference.|`|L0fAWSdHaa	right click on the music and under type of file it should be mp3, if not you can not upload.

48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	I suppose if you connected the PS3 to your computer with a crossover cable those two could communicate. But I'm not sure your PS3 will pickup an IP that way. You would have to look at your computer and get the IP, gateway, and DNS IP. Then manually assign the PS3 an IP in the same subnet as your machine (unique) and the same gateway and DNS IP as your computer.    I don't know if that will work but my two cents worth.

i9PhENN6aa	the torrent system uses a distributed database approach. its very similar to any P2P file sharing program such as Limewire. a seed is simply a computer that has downloaded the same file and has completed, thus uploading peices of the file (sharing) to others that request it. because the distributed database is so large users are broken into separate networks depending on geographic location. which why you might see 730 seeds total but your only actually receiving pieces of the download from a small portion of that. the more people or computers that share files the more networks they connect with giving you a faster download speed.    so you can either download and seed multiple other files over a period of time or find other torrents that are similar in contents from other sites. that will increase the number of seeds.    you also have to take into account not all seeds are actively seeding.|`|TZCzjpGmaa	It depends upon your broadband download bandwidth available, if you have a 256 kbps, broadband then you can download at a max speed of 40 kbps and hence decided the number of seeds...if it is less than that, then you need to increase the number of concurrent connections in your settings..    If you want to download from all the seeds at a time, then you need a very high bandwidth, i.e.  2 MBPS.|`|gFf3H9zjaa	Well, there is something in the system that slows down the download.  First the torrent have to find a source which is other computer. When you have a little download speed, it continues to find more and more computer to increase download speed. Then one of your source shut down and go offline, your download will come to a halt and have to wait much longer time to resume your download    730 seeds may increase your chance of keeping your download go, not fast, just keeping it survive. Maybe 5% of bandwidth connected to the sources and the others wasted during connecting the other 600+ seeds
aqJhF71Raa	From my understanding of the question you need to write a program which takes as input two values: x and n_end. Your program should calculate sum(x^n/n!) for n = 0 to n = n_end. This calculation should be done in a for loop, and every 10 iterations of n you should print the partial sum so far. All prints should be done using printf with the given arguments (%e, %g, etc...).    Is that correct? I just want to check before I try to help write the wrong program.    Here's what I came up with. Issues/bugs are noted in the header comment. Compiled and tested with gcc. You need to include the math library when compiling.  gcc file.c -lm -o    //Calculate sum(x^n/n!), an approximation for exp(x) Note: Due to the size of  //the values used in this calculation, large values of n_end and large values of  //n_end  and x will cause the result to be infinity. For large values of n_end,  //the calculation of n! will exceed the maximum value of a long long int. For  //large values of x and n_end, the calculation of x^n may exceed the maximum  //value of a float.   include    include     int main() {    float x;    unsigned int n_end;    unsigned int n;    unsigned long long int n_factorial = 1;    float sum = 0;      //Print header message    printf("Series evaluation: x^n/n! from n=0 to n=n_end.\n\n");        //Get Input    printf("Enter x: ");    scanf("%g", &x);    printf("Enter n_end: ");    scanf("%u", &n_end);      //Print value of x and n_end    printf("x = %g\nn_end = %d\n", x, n_end);      //Evaluate the sum for n=0 to n=n_end    for (n=0; n       //Update n!      if (n > 0) {        n_factorial *= n;      }        //Calculate the partial sum      sum += pow(x, n) / (n_factorial);        //If n = 10, 20, ... print partial sum      if (((n % 10) == 0) && (n != 0)) {        printf("Partial sum for n=%d: %16.8e\n", n, sum);      }    }      //Print final results    printf("x = %g\nn_end = %d\nsum = %16.8e\n", x, n_end, sum);    printf("exp(%g) = %16.8e\n", x, exp(x));      return 0;  }|`|FTC8VKQfaa	Does not look easy , if it is urgent you may contact a C programmer live at website like http://ijug.net/ ,etc .|`|WS95be3Raa	I can help you out.

FBQZ06vraa	I would suspect the pointer you're handing off to free() doesn't point to an allocated block of memory.  Some C malloc/calloc systems put a hidden block descriptor right before the memory block they provide to the program.  The descriptor would contain the actual allocated length and, possibly, a pointer to the next block.    The most likely causes are:    1. A NULL pointer.  2. A pointer that never pointed to an allocated block.  3. A pointer that points to a block that has already been free()'d.  4. A pointer that once did point to an allocated block but has now been overwritten.    Good luck finding it.  Hope that helps.|`|ZpigBI9naa	You trying to deallocate more or less then what you allocated.

kDj1NSiVaa	Recently, some Internet providers, i.e. Comcast, have been setting limits on download/upload activity, and are making it that your internet connection will be temporarily slowed down if activity is too high. This means that Limewire and Bittorrent and similar programs will actually cause you to be penalized by your internet service provider.    This is a matter completely unrelated to viruses, which by the way are rampant when using limewire. :)|`|9cub6mMQaa	Yes. When you are downloading on a peer to peer network (what Limewire uses) there is no central server so it is all connecting one computer to another and many connection points are open at once. That cuts down on all available bandwidth.    Besides, if you are using Limewire to get music and videos that you would otherwise have to buy then you are breaking the law.|`|jylgnn64aa	Yes...|`|EXdonSNnaa	LimeWire is loaded with malware than can slow things down.

So they may just be saying that|`|nDdVLmjyaa	Yes this is true, because it will take half of the bandwidth allowing only the other half to acces the other people on the network.|`|GwQevn2Gaa	It is true Internet providers throttle the bandwidth of p2p programs in  peak hours.

So it is best to lower your upload and download rates  in Lime wire so it doesn't hog as much bandwidth.|`|ojd37Xrtaa	yes i have it, it makes the computer slower and sometimes it gives it viruses i suggest you get a virus scan on your computer but if you have a mac you dont need to worry about any of that.|`|3LFqKLvyaa	I have Limewire and so do my friends.

fUF1UIZbaa	I have a lot of experience doing server stuff on a home network (don't ask...) Anyways first go in Windows firewall, then click exceptions, add a port, put in the number you want to allow (example: port 4534 for a game called armagetron) and the protocol (TCP for most, UDP is used for some games and voice/video... you can do the same port twice with one entry TCP and the other UDP if you're unsure.) Now the port forwarding. Your router assigns each computer an IP address that may change. To make it static, you can try enabling MAC address (aka physical address) control, which will assign specified computers a specified IP that you can forward to. Look up a tutorial on google for MAC control, but if there is an option, you should allow unspecified addresses to connect / associate / whatever. Then, forward to the newly fixed IP address. ISPs would never block this kind of stuff, so they aren't part of the problem.|`|UrUpWmA7aa	It sounds like you allready kind of know what you are doing. And you can always check with your ISP if they have any information on your issue.    If your not sure if the router is doing its job or not, run wireshark and check out what is going on at the packet level. That will give you a better idea of whats going on.    Also, try plugging straight into the modem and see if that resolves the issue|`|nDdVLmjyaa	http://www.portforward.com/english/route...

sosisPXbaa	You should tell people what you want to do to the image...  For example, make it lighter or darker, larger or smaller, etc.    Because as it is, your question is like asking: How do I style hair?|`|HJI8778baa	Right click the image and save it to your desktop. Open Photoshop and then go to File --> and open the image. It will then appear in a window. From here you can change the image in my different ways.

kK9tLKhHaa	If the signal is infrared based then the answer is yes. If it is bluetooth based, you should be good to go.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Idk.  Our wireless transponder (whatever) is on the desk behind the computer, but it was on top of the monitor, not pointed at anything, and it was working fine.    TX Mom|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	My wireless came with a Receiver that plugs into a usb port and about a 3 foot cord.  If you have one of these it should work from at least 10 ft. away.  Position the Receiver wherever you tend to use your wireless keyboard/mouse.
U7Tl0B92aa	Put the CD in your drive, and reboot the computer.  If it's set to boot from CD, it should come up with a menu, or at least a warning stating "This will erase everything on your hard drive" or something to that effect.  It should be fairly straightforward at that point what you need to do.    If it doesn't boot from the CD, and still goes into Windows, then you might be able to press a key to get a boot menu as soon as you turn the computer on.  This is usually one of either the F11 or F12 keys, but sometimes computers don't have this option.  If it does, select the CD/DVD drive, and press enter.    If not, usually either F1, F2, F10, or Del as soon as you turn the computer on, will get you into the BIOS setup program, where you'll be able to find boot order options.  Your CD/DVD drive needs to be before your internal hard drive in the list.    Unfortunately, all computers are different in this way, so I can't give you a really definite way to do it.  You'll have to play it by ear a little.|`|E0chY1b5aa	Reboot with the CD as the bootable drive.

OIC0vsEWaa	RAM is Read Only Memory. the computer uses it for temporary storage, instead of going to the hard drive of the computer which takes much longer.    so the end result is that you get higher in game frame rates and you can load applications faster.    nowadays i would go with 4 gigs of RAM, seeing as that is becoming the standard.    As for computers, all brand name ones are essentially the same. the real thing of interest is what is inside. but from what i have heard from my friends who have Dells, they seem to be all right.    you will want at least a dual core processor, a 250-500 gigabyte hard drive for storing games and music, and about 4 gigs of RAM.    If you know nothing about computers, then customizing is not for you. it involves a high technical knowledge of computer parts and how they interact.    and if you are going to spend money on something, at least get something that looks good.|`|o95hv7jjaa	Dell machines are good, and when you order them, yopu can customize the specifications to suit what you need.    RAM is the memory. The more the better. At least 2Gb (gigabytes), preferably 4Gb.    For gaming, I would also recommend that you get a dedicated Graphocs card - look for an NVIDIA GEFORCE. They're good. :)    The main processor should also be at least a dual-core, preferably a quad-core, and again, the faster the better.|`|tLh7CytLaa	Computers are computers, some may be bigger than others, faster, heavier, colorful, etc. However most all of them have the same principle. Yes,in my opinion Dell computers are good computers.     On another note RAM (random access memory) comes in many different sizes, pin layouts, brand, color, etc. However depending upon what the computer is mostly used for that results in different size of RAM. If gaming is mostly used and alot of detailed graphics are involved that requires more memory. As for if just e-mailing is used, barely any RAM may be required.     A good amount of RAM is 1gb (1 gigabyte) to 2gb.    Computer sellers try to nickel and dime people to death. Most things they try to sell people have any impact. For example extremely huge hard drives, and extremely fast CPU's which the computer cannot use to the fullest so it just gets what it can out of it.|`|xlFUk0sGaa	Registry Easy  is a fantastic programme!. After the first scan and the use of the optimizing utility for startup programmes, the speed of my computer increased by 20-30%. Had decided to reinstall my operating system before using Registry Easy, but now things are running smoothly  http://www.keep-pc-clean.com/
1NPVVxW0aa	The fact you talk about a possible 'computer'  bodes ill.    If you don't know what drivers, processors or video cards are you don't have an great idea for a computer...    Linux is not as affected by malware because Microsoft is almost overwhelmingly predominant as an o/s. That is why there are so many anti malware solutions for Microsoft....|`|fCOq04lNaa	Drivers-This is software for a piece of hardware that allows the operating system to use the hardware. It's a good idea to keep these up to date, as updated drivers can increase performance.    Processors: Well you're going to need a good one for gaming. I would recommend a good dual-core like the Core 2 Duo E8400 model, which is an excellent gaming processor for only $165. A processor is attached to a motherboard and usually there's a heatsink attached to the top of a processor. A processor is about the size of a small cracker(you know those cheese or peanut butter filled ones).   http://www.hardwarezone.com/img/data/art...  A motherboard is about the size of a sheet of paper, but a good deal taller. A heatsink varies in size but usually about the size of 2 tuna cans on top of one another.    Video card. This is a device in your computer that processes and converts instructions from the CPU and sends them to the monitor. They're usually used to apply graphics effects. For gaming get a good Nvidia or ATI dedicated card, avoid Intel ones.    Linux isn't too practical for gaming unless you use the Wine Emulator and only some games work well unde Wine.    External processors aren't practical because USB transfers data way too slow compared to a processor socket and will severely hamper performance.    As for external graphics cards I heard Asus made one but it wasn't very successful.    You can't make external drivers as they're hardware.    You can write drivers, but you need good programming skills and know exactly how the hardware works.    As for the virus-free computer it would be impractical considering how much people download these days and eventually people will simply ignore the warnings. The good thing with Linux is that it requires you to enter your password to perform admin tasks or install things. Also since Linux has a small market share people rarely create Linux viruses. Still Linux isn't foolproof. Or you could just disconnect the computer from the internet.|`|IyCnihLmaa	google.com|`|mp1MfFMraa	Drivers - will come with your hardware purchase.  Processors - they help a bit, but these days you don't really need one. If you do, get the Intel i7.  Video Cards - these control your sound along with the sound card. You should have at least two of them for a good gaming pc.  Don't use Linux for gaming. That is silly.  If you use a virus scanner on Windows, keep it up to date there is little change you will become infected with a virus.
48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	The sticker would be face up.|`|v8W02iwGaa	The metal plate side faces up with the ports for the connectors faces towards the motherboard. Most cases are like that but some cases have many unique ways where and how things are placed.|`|AA11282699	A modern hard drive will work no matter how it is placed.  Be sure the attaching holes line up without having to force anything and you will be fine.|`|985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	The metal side should face up, with the green board facing down.

e876eafacf2c7a947fdbd79971851b40aa	probably network traffic is high, or something..    these will help you...    1. Use Opera browser, it will load faster and smoother, and re-install latest flash (the correct way).    get the latest flash player, and install it.. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation...    OR..    2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just yahoo or google search "zillatube" to get it.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Your speed to the YouTube server (which has nothing to do with your speed to your provider) is slower than the display speed of the videos.  Short of changind providers, or moving closer to the server, all you can do is start the video, immediately pause it, and watch it once it's fully downloaded.|`|UDJz5HYGaa	What's your internet speed? Go to www.speedtest.net and test it. Anything below 1000KB/S download is HORRIBLE and you need to upgrade.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	depends on the processor speed you have, amount of ram, and internet connection. all of those have an effect on video speed|`|IuGbaLMEaa	go outside and get some fresh air bro.

Youtube's videos buffer depends on internet speed.Check your KBPS of internet.|`|2QsYZvmOaa	Im guessing you have broadband, but try a different internet browser, or upgrading current one. Does it happen on any streaming video sites or just youtube? If its just youtube then there might be some trouble with permissions on your firewall.|`|odZJpUVnaa	1  It sounds like your internet connection is slow, so the buffer on YouTube is not too long to hold the video playing without interruption.    Resolution:  Test your connection, if you have around 1000+ Kbps download, you are good to go.    Go to: http://speedtest.net/    If your connection is slow, try upgrading to a better provider.     2  It might be your flash player that is outdated. Maybe trying to download the newest version should fix it, if you have a decent connection.    Resolution:    Go to: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/?promoi...

985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	Yes.    Read the manual that came with the board. If you can't understand it, don't go near a motherboard with a ten foot pole. Hire someone else to set it up for you.
RXI8ImdIaa	go to your desktop and right-click on an empty space. choose "properties." If you are on vista, it's called "personalize."    you should be able to find it from there. The exact location varies by operating system, but look around until you find the desktop settings. Change the desktop to something else, then go uninstall your wallpaper.    If you're unable to do this, then you downloaded a doozy of a program and you'll need more advanced help. Post again if this is the case.    p.s. don't download wallpapers from those internet sites that offer them for free. you are likely to get spyware at the least, or potentially worse. your best bet for getting wallpapers from the internet is to search for images that you are interested in, and grab them from those sources. not from wallpaper sites.|`|wX7qPI3Naa	on your desktop right click and go to properties; desktop; and click one of them that come with your computer! :)|`|ezd55MPgaa	Right click on ur desktop than click on propities or personalize than go to desktop wallpapers, change ur wallpaper and uninstall animated wallpaper.

AA10096102	If you want to put a Flash application on your page, you can usually find an HTML code on the applications website which allows you to embed it into your page. As for SQL, I think that is only used with databases, probably not what you are interested in.

2QsYZvmOaa	I would recommend Backing up the My Music/ iTunes/ iTunes Music folder to an external hard drive. Also, make sure that all the music in your library is in that folder by going to the File menu and clicking Library > Consolidate Library|`|AmntnHCtaa	my old pc just crashed recently and luckily i didn't lose my music, but DEFINITELY get an external hard drive. it's not the cheapest thing in the world, but it'll literally save your life.     also, like some other people said, if your pc should crash (hopefully not) then go buy a mac. again, not the cheapest thing, but definitely better and wayyyy more reliable.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I back up all my work to flash drives (well, SD cards in an adapter, actually, but they're the same thing inside).  I use Karen's Replicator, so I only back up things that are new or changed.  It's free, pretty good and open source.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	u find where it stores ur music like in my music in my documents then put it all on a memory key,    or u could get a mac and not have 2 worry about that!|`|IHzv611caa	You could copy them to an external drive, which you would have to buy.
pA8lfKbJaa	And their prices could all be obtained via a Google search taking you to their vendors.
lozkkrpcaa	The guy probably won't know if you like him or not by a simple friend request. Seriously, because I've gotten tons of friend requests from people I do and don't know, and half of them are boys. If he's on that "Friend Finder" list, then you should add him. It won't show that you like him just by friend requesting him, because he probably has a lot of friends on facebook that are also girls who friend requested him.  Also, you can wait for you two to have more mutual friends, and this way you can say "Oh, I noticed that we had a lot of mutual friends."  I personally felt awkward at first friend requesting some old friends of mine from a couple of years ago, but really, it's no big deal. As long as you see that you guys go to the same school and you have mutual friends, he'll probably accept your friend request. You shouldn't worry.    So the answer is yes, add him.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	It is not a marriage proposal, it is adding someone as a friend on Facebook. Add him. Peace:)|`|xxr2Zflvaa	this is a tough one. i was in the same situation as you were in.  if you guys talk like on a regular basis or every now and then go ahead  but if you dont talk to him at all then try making yourself known to him before you add him. and sometimes the girl has to make the first move :]|`|59613b589c9ab8ff380b23b5cb2f61e6aa	Go ahead and add as a friend, later he'll tell you his mind.
Xg8Tzjfraa	Microsoft Word is a part of the Microsoft Office collection of programs.  It is not free and cannot legally be downloaded for free.    I highly recommend that you do not use Microsoft Office at all.  It is overpriced.  Go to http://www.openoffice.org and download Open Office.  It is a 100% replacement for Microsoft Office and is completely compatible with MS files.    OpenOffice includes a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, and other essential applications.|`|ULw1777caa	Nope, Word is not free.

e876eafacf2c7a947fdbd79971851b40aa	My answer is YES!! You can buy a crosscable for 10+ bucks and simply hook them together, use Windows Explorer to transfer files.  or  Probably you would be to get a external hard drive, depending how much data you have, you can get ones from 4gb up to 500gb and  all u do is connect the hard drive via usb to laptop, use the inbuilt program to back all your stuff, then plug the external hard drive into the new laptop and do the same thing, except you now extract the data to the new laptop|`|9ECwMzZXaa	Get an external hard drive to transfer the files, and your allowed to reinstall the expensive software on the new computer if you have all the keys/ activation codes ready.    You have to uninstall the programs from the old computer but.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Why not?|`|6e7d9mxRaa	For data, it's easy to transfer via an external harddrive  For software, just make sure you keep the activation codes or licenses whatsoever that ensure your software would run on another computer.|`|PGMIrRrAaa	You cannot migrate the actual programs on to your new computer so you will need the original installation CDs for any programs that you installed.

Your looking for "VISA" which is a trademarked money handling/distribution company.|`|AA12380885	Its VISA r MASTER CARD.  Bank acct is compulsory.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you're talking about a credit card, there are two types, secured and unsecured.    A secured card lets you deposit money and then spend it - and they charge you for spending your own money.  A debit card is much better - you put money in the bank, it earns interest, and you can spend it with the card.  It's doesn't cost - you earn interest.  You can put as much or as little as you want into a bank account.    An unsecured credit card is different - you have to have a good credit rating these days to get one.  Your first one will probably give you about a $500 line of credit - if you can even get one.  (Someone with no credit rating might not be able to.  Capital One is about the easiest place to get one.)  You don't need a bank account to get a credit card - you need a credit rating (and a good one).  Most credit card companies won't issue a card to anyone under the age of 18, because it's a hassle to force a minor to pay.    A bank account won't send bills, but they'll send statements.  Credit card companies will send bills.
5zSSGKBpaa	You should go to :  http://distrowatch.com/search.php  and use the search engine to filter which distro would be best for you. You can select a version for beginners, or multimedia, or a special purpose. They are all free to download. You can read reviews and articles about each distro. You can select a distro for ease of use, needs little ram  or hard drive space, popularity, most software packages available, amount of  customization,etc.    I would also suggest that you go to that distros website to read their documentation, especially if you are new to linux. They have tutorials on how to install, how to setup various hardware, and tips and tricks. I would also recommend using their forum to search/ask for info/help.
dc388b2eb23692bc6ba6dd6d72b063d5aa	the page you are trying to see has a programming error ... whoever created it made a mistake and the server is unable to display it properly. all you can do is tell the website administrators which page is having the problem and they would need to investigate and fix it ... nothing on your end will fix it.|`|9ff50eac6fa480a892f8f42861f11968aa	You don't. It's the web site's problem.|`|iwTLThD8aa	The "500 Internal Server Error" message can be customized by each website. While this isn't very common, keep in mind that this error may present itself in more ways than the common ones listed below:   "500: Internal Server Error"   "HTTP Error 500 - Internal Server Error"   "500 Error"   The 500 Internal Server Error displays inside the Internet browser window, just as web pages do.   Cause  The 500 Internal Server Error is a very general HTTP status code that means something has gone wrong on the web site's server but the server could not be more specific on what the exact problem is.   Resolution  The 500 Internal Server Error is a "server-side" error, meaning the problem is not with your PC or Internet connection but instead is a problem with the web site's server. Even though the issue is not yours to troubleshoot or resolve, there are a few things you can do:   Retry the web page by clicking the refresh/reload button or trying the URL from the address bar again. Even though the 500 Internal Server Error is reporting a general error on the web site's servers and not your computer, the server error may only be temporary. Trying the page again will often be successful.    Note: If the 500 Internal Server Error message appears during the checkout process at an online merchant, be aware that duplicate attempts to checkout may end up creating multiple orders - and multiple charges! Most merchants have automatic protections from these kinds of actions but it's still something to keep in mind.      Come back later. The 500 Internal Server Error message is one of the most common error message seen when checking out during an online purchase so sales are often disrupted. This is usually a great incentive to resolve the issue very quickly.

Basically, the speed whatever the CPU is listed, in that case. 2.5GHz.|`|CNJyyYIpaa	Stock speed means the speed right out of the box, which in your case is 2.5GHz. Some people overclock their CPU's to different speeds such as 3.0GHz etc.   The other components of your computer come into play as well when choosing a PSU. If you are going to have a high end graphics card I would go for a PSU with a minimum wattage of 600-650 watts.|`|0GtonJONaa	check link below for specs. 3.0 Ghz is max.|`|DJeV7XQKaa	not srue|`|fkVX3oR1aa	stock speed means the speed that the manufacturer made it out of, if u want it to be higher, u can overclock it but u SHOULD do some research b4 messing it with cuz u can ruin the computer without researching.
Vt0xnuWpaa	You're downloading the wrong driver.    Nvidia only has beta drivers for notebooks in the version 179.28 so far. You might be trying to install the desktop drivers.    Check out their site:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/notebook_dr...
XlyLakYAaa	Core 2 Extreme is a Core 2 Quad that's slightly faster and has an unlocked CPU multiplier so it has more overclocking options.  i7 is a new architecture that's faster than the Core 2 architecture.  Core 2 Quad     The best "bang for your buck" like either with a Core 2 Quad or an i7, depending on how much you're willing to spend.

2iLLZBjyaa	1.  Without using generic type safety on the list constructor, you must cast the return value of get to the appropriate type.  Won't compile otherwise.    2.  You can't call set() on a position that doesn't exist.  The add calls define index 0, 1, 2.  Calling set on 3 is an IndexOutOfBoundsException.    Not sure about the third. Since the call to set is out of bounds, so is the second get call.  Adding a date into a list of cities also isn't a good idea, but it isn't an "error".|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	The instantiation will work.    Errors    1. String city = list.get(0); needs casting since you didn't define a type for the array list.    2. System.out.println(list.get(3)); will throw an error since the size of the list is three.    There are absolutely only two errors.

Xg8Tzjfraa	I'll give you a very brief and simple description of it:    Bittorrent is a method for downloading files quickly and efficiently.  This is done by SHARING the bandwidth.  This is how it works:    John creates a torrent file and uploads it to a torrent site.    Bryan downloads the torrent file and now is connected to John's computer to download any files that are contained in the torrent.    David downloads the torrent file and is now connected to both John and Byran's computers to download whatever parts of the files they already have.    It's fairly complicated, I know.  But basically, you search a torrent site like htttp://www.torrentz.com for whatever you're looking for.  Download the file and boom... off you go.|`|6ANHVRegaa	Bittorrent is basically a file sharing sofware that uses torrents to keep track of files, through the work of a tracking website, which are being shared by people, also known as the seeders. The people who are trying to download these files from seeders are known as leechers. If you whant to share a/several file(s) in the form of a torrent, you will need to find a website that tracks torrent files, a website like Demonoid.com has good tracking service, but you will need to be a registered user in order to create and upload the torrent.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	"Also, I'm a noob at this so could anyone explai"    No.    There are FAQ's, tutorials, and guides on this subject so we don't have to explain it. And if you're not able to follow said guides, you're to stupid to be using BitTorrent and just need to go back to your virus downloader.|`|6e493640b4ac78141e0378dfa50e5a8baa	Bittorrent is basically sharing a file(s) with many other people at the same time.|`|An2FpBRIaa	a movie = a dollar ($1)  bittorrent breaks the dollar into nickels and sometimes pennies and spreads it across the internet!  a bittorrent program collects all the change at a much faster rate then simply HTTP downloading...sometimes!LOL    ppl are quicker to give you a nickel than a dollar!! right?LOL|`|hfTZ2zg9aa	hi, bittorrent is not made to download music. it is made to download games, movies, software. however now they made it possible for mp3 and other music formats.  to use it you first open it, it will ask you if you want to set it as your default torrents downloader chose yes. now go to any of those websites to get whatever you want. except   documents.  mininoova.com , the piratebay.org, bitenova ,demonoid.com, torrentscam.com, torrentmatrix.com, torrentz.com, gpirate.com iptorrents.com, bitenova.com, youtorrent.com.   the most popular are thepiratebay.org and mininova.com  nex websites are where you can get free songs.  filemp3.org, spiralfrog.com.    it is fully recommended have you antivirus working propertely.  good luck.  thanks for reading

2LHgmq97aa	It depends on the Application..   Some Applications (such as pure math)- Require pure processor speed, in this case it is equal to 2.6ghz  Some Applications benefit multiprocessors- Games, video editing, multitasking (more than one program running), etc.. in this case will be equal to 5.2GHZ- 10.5GHZ, depending on the application..  (104ghz+) for multitasking...  The plus comes in where an application using all four processors (or multitasking) actually benefits more from having  4 processors working on the job and since each of the processors can simultaneously work on the issue without having to wait to finish each individual task will actually run faster than a single 104ghz chip (a little faster) since all four can be loaded in at once instead of "waiting in line"     Here is an easy way to understand it clearly...  Example: Pretend that each core is equal to a human being... Quad core would be like having 4 human beings...  There are some jobs that only require one person to do.. Other jobs might be a two person, or would benefit having all four people..  There are benefits of having four people over one person since there are jobs that benefit from having four people working on something at once (each person has only two hands). If one person was 4 times faster than each person in the four person group, the 4 person group will still get some jobs done faster since they have 8 hands vs the one person having only two hands.  .   A good example might be tightening a screw. If you only need to tighten a single screw, having four people will not help since only one can do it (this example would be like a math problem or a program that will only use one cpu).. If two screws need to be tightened and there are two or more screwdrivers, then other people can simultaneously screw in the screws. (example: Video processing, games, multitasking). In this case if you had a single person working 4 times faster, the person would loose time since the person would have to move from one screw to another and then the small amount of time aligning the screwdriver  to each screw.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I am afraid not.

There is a script to open the drive, but it is classified as a "Joke Open/Close CDROM" virus by modern virus scanners.  Here is the code:  Set oWMP = CreateObject("WMPlayer.OCX.7")   Set colCDROMs = oWMP.cdromCollection   if colCDROMs.Count  then   For i = 0 to colCDROMs.Count - 1   colCDROMs.Item(i).Eject   Next    For i = 0 to colCDROMs.Count - 1   colCDROMs.Item(i).Eject   Next   end if

(If you don't understanmd why, my explanation won't do you any good, but if you install it, then have problems with it, don't say you wern't warned.)    Modems aren't software-driven devices, they're peripherals that connect to your Ethernet adapter - which *is* software driven (you install drivers for IT - but the driver is usually already installed when you get your computer).  Installing software for a router only hinders Windows (and Vista has finally come out with great internet connection software) in setting up your internet connection.    (Don't install the software your provider gives you - for that reason, and because the garbage they give you is usually not as good as the equivalent programs you can download from the web.)

Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|fHReeuALaa	visit this site http://audiomaza.blogspot.com|`|L1TaB0QTaa	utorrent/seekasong.com|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's not the program that gives you viruses.

If you want free, download, if you want to keep your computer, buy.  You ARE going to pay - for the songs or to have your computer fixed.  Your only choice is which one you'll pay for.  (And, when you have your computer fixed, you lose all the songs - and all your documents, and all the programs you installed.

Because I can give you a bunch of bests.    I think the Acer Aspire One is the best netbook. I also think that the Lenovo ThinkPads are the best notebook if you want something that will last forever. I think the HP notebook line is the best overall. I think Acer and Dell are tied for being the best of the crappiest products and support.    I think Apple's the best at convincing people that their notebooks are actually worth what people are paying for them. It's amazing how people will pay $1000 for a Macbook with the same specs as a $650 laptop....    In my opinion though, anything made by Lenovo is "the best" since they last forever, aren't extremely expensive, and have amazing build quality.

However, I am confused by your description. How can people who cant open an .odt file save the file as .zip file and then rename it to .odt? What are they using to open and save it?    Is it always on the same machines that this happens?    It is possible that some user has used the object context menu to set .odt files to be treated as ,zip files, but that doesnt seem to fit either.

aqJhF71Raa	If you really want to keep the entire image, you can use an image map to make regions of the image into links. The way this works is, you define coordinates (x,y positions in the image) which are click-able, and put the link there.    For example, you would do:                This will create a map called "mapname" which has one rectangle which is 100x100px. The rectangle goes from 0,0 (top left of the picture) to 100,100 (100 px to the right, 100px down). That rectangle, when clicked, will link to your_link.html.    When you add the image to your page, pass the usemap=" mapname" parameter to associate the image map you created with that image.      I recommend against this only because you would require anyone visiting your page to load that entire image, which is quite large. It would be much better to cut the image up into pieces and only load those you need. The rest of the page could have a black background to match the image.|`|AA11620962	You'd have to cut the picture then use the  for each section

AA10006450	There is a problem with the way that site is designed.  It works fine if your display is set for a resolution of 1024x768 or higher.    I tried it at a setting of 800x600, and I think I saw the same problem you were seeing.    You have two choices:    (1) Change the resolution setting of your display to something higher than 800x600, such as 1024x768, and visit that site again.    or...    (2) Use a different computer to sign in -- a computer with a larger monitor and/or a better video card, that supports a higher resolution.    But if you use that option (2), and then come back to your own computer and try to make use of the site, you may run into similar problems.  It seems that the site is not designed to work with the sort of monitor you are using.

And it is not in itself difficult. Some things are really great to do under X in a Mac, other stuff is far more easy to do under Windows, even in a Mac running Windows.    I am not religious about OSs and I see that even a linux desktop can be great to use.    The compiz linux desktop is nothing but great. Far better than X dock or the Vista or XP interface. But to get compiz working is a pain.   File management under X in a Mac is silly at best. Try to move files between folders or manage a few hundred files and you will see.  Explorer under Vista crashes way too often. Even after SP 1. Rename a few files under the photo gallery and you will probably crash it.

elhRdmuFaa	Strings are not mutable, so that code probably runs really really slow as well. Every time you do a string concatenation you have to do full copy.

wxOO8A8eaa	I need your help. Let me tell you my story and why I made this site. Six months ago I met a girl named Liz. She looked really hot and also had a fun personality, we started dating and very quickly became a couple.    Then one day when I was out with my friends I saw her making out with some random guy at a bar. I thought maybe she was just drunk, and didn't know what she was doing. She didn't know I was there so I decided to confront her.    As I was about to walk up to her they both started walking towards the door and left the bar. I followed them from a distance. I saw her get into his car which was parked in a small dark road. I waited for a minute or two but the car didn't move. I walked up to the car and caught them having sex inside. My heart was broken and I immediately broke up with her.    When we were going out she let me take dirty pics of her with my camera. To get revenge I decided to share those pics with everyone on the internet right here on this site. I'm hoping that lots of people will get to see her pics and know that she is a cheater.    To help me out please take the following link (its your link) and share it with your friends (through instant messenger or email) and the more people that click your link the more pics you'll be able to see. There are 59 pics, each click will reveal an additional pic at the bottom of this page. If 100 people click your link, a dirty video of Liz will also appear.     It is spam

This could be the same thing that happened to your router. If so, first, check if the router's DHCP server is still working. To check, connect a computer directly to the router and check the computer's IP Address. If it's not a 169.254.xxx.xxx or 0.0.0.0 then it's still working. Otherwise, call the router's manufacturer. (Not your ISP if it's not an ISP-provided router 'cause they won't help you.)    If the IP address is a 192.168.1.xxx or 10.10.x.xxx, run the router's setup CD and follow it.     This means that you're starting from scratch. Better plug the router to an AVR next time.|`|1cDBxIxoaa	Reset your internet. Call your ISP and ask them to come out and fix it.

Example link to that is also below.|`|AA10783818	talk about what you like/love, ask the person you're talking to about his/her likes and dislikes.talk about current news.you could even try a bit of gossip.talk about your job and his/her job.recent movies/tv shows or books you've read lately.just ease your mind of any kind of tension and continue a flow of talk about anything that comes to your mind.dont feel shy or back out easily   Ask questions! You can ask a date anything. What do they do in their free time, what is their favorite food, music? Have they taken any interesting vacations, do they have any pets.   Don't worry about it! It's easy, just talk about things going on now, or ask what they have plans on doing in the near future, or ask what they like, or if there having fun. Don't necessarily talk about u to much ask them to.  You are talking about a date right?? you should probably write some answers down.   I can sympathize with you. I used to be like that. Best thing to do is relax. Talk about anything, it really doesn't matter, just don't start babbling. If you're with a girl you like, talk about a movie you liked, an interesting book you've read, something funny you heard. Look at her, don't stare. Compliment her on something you like about her. Be subtle, but sincere. Ask open ended questions and let her answer them, but really listen to what she's saying also. You can feed off of each others Q&A's. Don't worry, just be yourself and when you're with the right girl, things will just flow naturally. If you run out of things to say, gently take her hand and ask if she wouldn't mind going for a walk or something. Let your sense of sight, smell, touch, and sound guide you making small talk. If a girls see's that you are at least trying to hold a conversation, many times they will do what they can to help the conversation flow. Before you with someone you're interested in, I used to find it helpful to practice having a conversation before I meet up with her. Although not spontaneous, it does help you build up some confidence. Smile and look at her eyes, this will show that you also care. Good luck to you.|`|AA10811401	If you don't want to do it in Linux, Windows 2000/2003 server both support this through the Internet Authentication Service.

Once you reinstall and when youre ready to import, then click IMPORT and use your disk to import them.  Or the option to export might be under Bookmarks --> Manage Bookmarks, and then the Tools option.    If you want to know the physical place Mozilla puts them then:    On Windows XP/2000, the path is usually %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxxx... where xxxxxxxx is a random string of 8 characters.

On Windows 95/98/Me, the path is usually C:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.d...   On Linux, the path is usually ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/   On Mac OS X, the path is usually ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/xxxxxxxx.defaul...   %AppData% is a shorthand for the Application Data path on Windows 2000/XP. To use it, click Start > Run..., enter %AppData% and press Enter. You will be taken to the "real" folder, which is normally C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data.
AA12042975	I just did this recently so hopefully I remember:    Step by step direction:  On computer 1, go to control panel and then systems. Go to Computer name and make sure you put a unique computer name and a unique workgroup name. It will probably ask you to reboot.    On computer 2, do the exact same thing, but make sure the workgroup name is the same as computer 1. It will also ask you to reboot if you changed either the computer name or workgroup name.    Then go to computer 1 and go to control panel again. Click on network connections and set up a small homeoffice network. Just follow the steps.    You should be networked by now. Just make that folder you want to share a shared drive by going to the folder and right clicking on it and going to properties. There is an option to "share this folder in network". Then just go to your start menu and click on MY NETWORK PLACES and you should see two drives in it. One for computer 1 and for computer 2 and the folders that you are sharing.    This is all assuming you have Windows XP.

If you don't...well. you most likely do.    The next thing is whether your new laptop has wireless (probably does), then another easy setup.     Now, connect both to the router, either both wireless, both wired, or a combination. Now, select whatever documents, and hit copy or cut. \    When you setup the new computer, you'll be told to give it a host name. Make a note of whatever it is. Now, in the address bar (My Documents window), type "//hostame" (without the quotes)". You'll probably just see Shared Documents. Click on that folder and paste inside of it.    And that's it!

AA12042975	HD = hard drive.    It is a storage system for your computer. It is located inside the motherboard of your computer. It is the "brain" of your system and it stores a lot of data and information. It is the memory of your computer that you can store large amount of data and it will keep it in there until you want access to them. It is internal, but it can also be external. Your local harddrive is normally your local memory thats internal and it might have stored your O.S (for example, Windows XP, Windows 98, Windows NT) and other programs that you have stored into it. It is generally referenced as your C: drive.    Also, the hard drive goes by different memories. The bigger the memory, the more you can store things in your computer like programs and games. They go by megs or gigs. One mp3 song that you download is about 4-5 megs. Nowadays, computers come with gigs of memory. Every 1 gigabyte of memory is equal to 1024 megabytes.    If you have any more questions, just contact me =)
AA12042975	It shouldnt be running slower, you probably have little memory. Java takes up a lot of memory since its part of an applet and applets run on the client side using your java runtime. You might want to upgrade more memory if you dont want any lagging.     Go to Control Panel, then go to Systems. Check below under the General tab how much memory you have. If you have 128Mb-256Mb, then you will definitely need to upgrade your memory.     With any game, it takes up memory.

AA12042975	Its a graphics problem. Just means the website did not load the picture correctly or its because your computer is somehow not processing the pictures correctly to display on your browser. Most of the time its because the website did not load the images correctly. I would just hit refresh and see if it fixes it.    Try cleaning out your temporary files. Go to tools, then internet options and clean your temporary files. Reboot your browser and try again.

AA12042975	Thats a browser issue. The only way the person on the client side can avoid that from happening is to go into TOOLS, Internet Options, and then Security. Under the security tab, in CUSTOM LEVEL, there are options in there to download and give script warnings about Active X being present on a website. This can only be done on the client side. I do not think there is a special HTML tag that will prevent this from happening.  And when it comes to play .Wav files, it depends on the client side too. It will open with the default software that the user has set his computer to use to play .wav files.

AA10727407	They are compatible.  One of the specifications of the 802.11g standard is that it must be compatible with 802.11b.  There may be settings which disable 802.11b mode.

I have yet to see a "G" only card...that wouldn't make sense for a computer manufacturer to make a wireless card that cannot be used in a "backwards compatible" state....|`|AA12042975	802.11b  IEEE expanded on the original 802.11 standard in July 1999, creating the 802.11b specification. 802.11b supports bandwidth up to 11 Mbps, comparable to traditional Ethernet.   802.11b uses the same radio signaling frequency - 2.4 GHz - as the original 802.11 standard. Being an unregulated frequency, 802.11b gear can incur interference from microwave ovens, cordless phones, and other appliances using the same 2.4 GHz range. However, by installing 802.11b gear a reasonable distance from other appliances, interference can easily be avoided. Vendors often prefer using unregulated frequencies to lower their production costs.     Pros of 802.11b - lowest cost; signal range is best and is not easily obstructed   Cons of 802.11b - slowest maximum speed; supports fewer simultaneous users; appliances may interfere on the unregulated frequency band     In 2002 and 2003, WLAN products supporting a new standard called 802.11g began to appear on the scene. 802.11g attempts to combine the best of both 802.11a and 802.11b. 802.11g supports bandwidth up to 54 Mbps, and it uses the 2.4 Ghz frequency for greater range. 802.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11b, meaning that 802.11g access points will work with 802.11b wireless network adapters and vice versa.   Pros of 802.11g - fastest maximum speed; supports more simulatenous users; signal range is best and is not easily obstructed   Cons of 802.11g - costs more than 802.11b; appliances may interfere on the unregulated signal frequency       In other words, g is just an upgrade from b so your laptop should be able to use the b router connection.  In layman comparison, its like playstation 2 and playstation. Playstation 2 will still be compatible with games that you bought for the original playstation.

Microsoft Help:  SYMPTOMS  On a Windows XP-based computer, you may experience one or both of the following behaviors:   ? The Volume icon is no longer displayed in the notification area at the far right of the taskbar.    ? When you try to add the volume control icon to the notification area (in the Sounds and Audio Devices utility in Control Panel, click to select the Place volume icon in the taskbar check box on the Volume tab), you receive the following error message:  Windows cannot display the volume control on the taskbar because the Volume Control program has not been installed. To install it use Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.    As a result, you cannot start the Volume Control program and adjust the volume and sound level settings of your computer    CAUSE  This behavior can occur if the Sndvol32.exe file is damaged or missing.     RESOLUTION  To resolve this issue, extract a new copy of Sndvol32.exe from the Windows XP compact disc to the system_root\System32 folder on your computer's hard disk. To do this, follow these steps:   1. Insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent it from starting automatically.   2. Click Start, and then click Run.   3. In the Open box, type cmd, and then click OK.   4. Type the following lines at the command prompt, pressing ENTER after each line, where CD-ROM drive is the drive letter of the computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive that contains the Windows XP CD-ROM, and system_root is the path and folder name where the Windows system files are located (generally C:\Windows):  CD-ROM drive:  cd i386  expand sndvol32.ex_ system_root\system32\sndvol32.exe       Note that there is a space between "ex_" and "system_root" in this command.     For example, if your computer's CD-ROM drive is drive E, and the folder that contains the Windows system files is C:\Windows, type the following lines at the command prompt (pressing ENTER after each line):   e:  cd i386  expand sndvol32.ex_ c:\windows\system32\sndvol32.exe    5. Type exit to quit the command prompt.   6. Verify that you can start Volume Control and that the Volume icon is displayed in the notification area (if you selected this option).

AA12042975	Check your connections and make sure they are connected correctly.    How long did you have your speakers for?  Its possible that you might need to get new speakers. All hardware has a life limit. Some just last longer than others.     I can help you if you lost sound or if your sound card is not working correctly, but static speakers is a hardware problem.    Edit: Hmm maybe its conflicting with another hardware. Do you have any webcams or mics attached to your computer? Try pulling the jack out and plug it in again. Remove any magnetic devices that might be screwing with your computer. TAke out any additional hardware and see if that helps, like a webcam or mic, etc.    Is it both speakers?

Make sure your CD is clean and not scratched.    Get all your required Windows updates.  Get the latest Windows Media Player.    If you are ripping the CD at the same time as playing it then it will probably skip. Are you running a lot of other programs besides Media Player? Close them first.    Make sure you can see the Menu Bar in Windows Media Player (WMP) - where it says "File View Play Tools Help". If you don't see this then right-click on the top of the WMP. If you're in "Skin Mode" click "Switch to Full Mode". From "Full Mode" right-click on the top and click "Show Menu Bar".    Ok, now to try some solutions.  From the menu choose "Tools | Options ..."  Click the "Player" tab and check "Download Codecs Automatically".    Click the "Devices" tab and choose the CD (or DVD) device.  Click Properties and change the "Use error correction" check box. (If it's checked then un-check it, if it's un-checked then check it.) Click OK and OK and try your CD again.     If this doesn't fix it go back and put the "Use error correction" back to what it was before. Then change the "Digital / Analog" option on the same properties dialog. Click OK and OK and try your CD.    If this doesn't work either then go back and put "Digital / Analog" back to what it was before.    Now select the "Speakers" in the "Devices" tab. Click "Properties" and select the "Default  device".  If it is checked then un-check the "Use 24-bit audio" check box.  Click OK and OK and try your CD again.    If none of these work then try this.  Go back to the "Devices" tab then the "Speakers" properties.  Click the "Advanced" button.  Now in the "Speaker Settings" click the "Advanced" button. Select the speakers that match your setup.  Click the "Performance" tab. Move the "Hardware acceleration" slider to "None". Click OK (four times) and try your CD again.  If it works now, then go back to the "Hardware acceleration" slider and keep trying at a higher setting.    Good luck.

AA12042975	You cant set up an email address because Outlook is not an email server. Its a client tool that helps you download emails from another email server to your Outlook which you can then save in your hard drive.    If you have an email account where you are allowed to set up in outlook for pop and smtp (incoming and outgoing), then you can set up outlook so that they all get forwarded and downloaded into your outlook instead of using the browser to check your email. You can also use Outlooks easier interface to send and filter email. Its just a client tool, its not an email server. You cant just create an email account using Outlook.    For example, if you want to set up Outlook to retrieve your hotmail email messages, then you go to TOOLS then ACCOUNTS and you add an email. For hotmail, if you enter your hotmail address, then it will automatically configure it for you. If you use gmail, then the configuration is pop.gmail.com under POP and smtp.gmail.com under SMTP. You add your account name and password.    The setup is different depending on which email server youre trying to connect to. If you have more questions, just contact me.|`|1e5a0ad58d46fff36c2421b096673d56aa	I am telling the email setting of Outlook 2003  Got to Tools-Email Accounts-type name & email adress.

AA12295272	Just adding to the answer given by Sean I.T.    Because in Java, a multidimensional array is a single dimensional array having elements as array, its possible to have a two dimensional array that is not symmetrical.    Consider following code,    int[][] multiArr = new int[2][];    multiArr[0] = new int [20];   multiArr[1] = new int [15];    in this case, the array is a two dimensional with two rows. But its not symmetrical. First row is 20 columns whereas second is 15. This is an example of a ragged array.|`|AA12042975	All array objects in Java encapsulate one-dimensional arrays.  However, the component type of an array may itself be an array type.  This makes it possible to create array objects whose individual components refer to other array objects. This is the mechanism for creating multi-dimensional or ragged arrays in Java.     Such a structure of array objects can be thought of as a tree of array objects, with the data being stored in the array objects that make up the leaves of the tree.     For example, we could create a lower triangular array, allocating each row "by hand" as follows.     int[][] tri;  tri = new int[10][];  // allocate array of rows  for (int r=0; r      tri[r] = new int[r+1];  }    // print the triangular array (same as above really)  for (int r=0; r      for (int c=0; c          System.out.print(" " + tri[r][c]);      }      System.out.println("");  }
AA12042975	You ever watch these sci fi shows where someone from outter space escapes from their ship on a POD?    Its just a storage device. iPOD was created by apple and because of their "i" trademark for iMacs, they call it iPOD.    POD is just a storage device, but the reference to it in multimedia means its a storage device for a data of music collection. If you want to carry it with you and make it mobile and if you want storage for just music instead of using your hard drive, then you use a pod. When you hear the term "pod", you should automatically assume they are referring to the iPOD. When it comes to the recent multimedia bonanza, pods are referred to as the iPODS. There are no pods that are independent from Apple's iPod because they have that term "iPod" patented. There cant be another POD reference to a different device because the pod reference in multimedia is patented by apple.    When it comes to multimedia software being distributed over the internet and cell phones, pods are not in that category. We use software that enables us to listen to certain music extensions like .mp3 and .mp4 and .wav. In order to listen to these extensions, we need a sound player....for example, realplayer, winamp, even itunes.    .mp3 is to multimedia software as .doc is to Word processing softwares.

AA10811401	Actually, Sean has you on the right track.      But if your recipient has only e mail and no internet access, you'll have to send the JPEG images along with it.  HTML doesn't have images in it, only references.  So you have to send all the files along at the same time.  His suggestion didn't work because when files get saved into the temp directory, the names are altered (so the HTML can't pick it up).  So in order to make this work, you'll have to send the entire framework together, and have your receipient save it to their hard drive before they can view it.      All this said, it would be easier to save it all into something like a word document and send it.  That would handle it in line in the file as a MIME type so you wouldn't have to worry about all this.  Another alternative would be to convert the entire page into a screen shot using something like ScreenPrint32 and just send a single JPEG of the whole page.|`|AA11135225	Place the images in your personal web space(website) and use the img tag in your email...    [img]h  p://www.my.website.com/image.j... [/img]    When the email is openned the image will be download into the email.|`|AA12304102	You may have to save the pictures in the html as .bmp.  Try that.    Good Luck|`|AA12208856	inlcude the pics...place them in a folder...    edit the scr of the pic|`|AA12042975	The html will be referencing the jpgs so its expecting to see it in the same folder. You should include the pictures in the attachment with the html and it should display correctly. You dont even need to make a folder because when the email server receives the html and the jpegs, then they will read it from the same temporary email attachment folder and it should display correctly when the receiver opens the email.  Another trick is to upload the jpegs to http://www.villagephotos.com cuz after you upload it (for free), they will give you a http (url) web address to the picture that it stored for you. So in your html file you can just put in the code  and it will show the picture correctly.    Edit:  Another thing you can do:  Go to http://www.winzip.com and download the zipper. Its a program to help you zip together files and make into one compressed folder. You create a zip file. You can basically drag all the pictures and the html page itself into the newly created zip file. You can just send that zip file.    The recipient will also need winzip or some sort of program that will unzip the file. Most computers already come with a zip program so he or she might have it in their computer. If the recipient unzips the files into his or her harddrive, it will all get unloaded into one folder automatically. That person can just click on your html and the pictures will show up since they are in the same folder.    Otherwise you might just want to send the htmls and pictures to the recipient and make that person "save all attachments" in one folder. However, it takes up a lot of space so I dont know what the person's email client limit is when it comes to receiving files. Thats why I think the zipping method would be more helpful.|`|AA10256226	Try using zip or rar to compress the folder containing ur html file and then send across the file.

If you dont want others to be able to manipulate the files, choose Read Only too.    To accommodate this LAN extension interface architecture, a new     Network Control Protocol (NCP) for PPP exists. This NCP is called     PPP-LEX. The basic functionality of PPP-LEX is to encapsulate LAN     extension interface control and data packets. The IETF has assigned     two new protocol types for these functions, as shown in Table 1.                     Table 1  IETF Protocol Types for PPP-LEX       Protocol Type       Function       0x8041              Encapsulates control packets     0x0041              Encapsulates data packets (MAC frames)       PPP is a natural choice for a LAN extension interface protocol     because it allows for negotiating a specific control protocol and     options at connection time. This means that network administrators do     not have to statically configure the router interface for remote     interfaces. Rather, remote interfaces negotiate the link at     connection time.       The LAN extension interface protocol employs PPP link operation as     described in RFC 1331(-> 1548(-> 1661std51)), which reads as follows:          In order to establish communications of a point-to-point link,        each end of the PPP link must first send [Link Control Protocol]        LCP packets to configure and test the data link. After the link        has been established,the peer may be authenticated. Then PPP must        send NCP packets to choose and configure one or more network layer        protocols. Once each of the chosen network-layer protocols has        been configured, datagrams from each network layer protocol can be        sent over the link.          The link will remain configured for communications until explicit        LCP or NCP packets close the link down, or until some external        event occurs (an inactivity timer expires or network administrator        intervention). (References, [1])       Thus, the LAN extension interface unit and the host router exchange     PPP-LCP packets at connection time to dynamically configure and test     the WAN serial link. Once the link reaches an "opened" state, the LAN     extension interface unit and host router exchange PPP-LEX NCP packets     to configure the LAN extension interface protocol. Once it is     configured, the NCP (PPP-LEX) reaches an "opened" state, and PPP     carries the PPP-LEX control and data packets across the serial link.     At this point, link traffic is a any combination of LCPs, PPP-LEX     NCPs, PPP-LEX control packets, and PPP-LEX data packets.

TCP/IP is an open acrchitecture network protocol, so it simply means it's FREE, yes, that's why it's built-in on most commercial OSes... it has its own feature, one is that TCP/IP is a routable protocol in a complex network which means, that if you happen to expand the network on a larger scale, you can use this feature... TCP/IP provides QoS or the Quality of Service feature, which means that as TCP/IP sends packet to the wires, it makes sure that data is successfully sent to the receiving computer... and there are many more features that TCP/IP provide, i just cant list them all in here....    by the way, you say you're using Windows 98? i advice you to upgrade to a more newer OS because from what I've read at Microsoft.com, they would be killing the support for Windows 98, no more upgrades or updates for Windows 98.. use windows 2000 instead
AA12042975	Find out what his birthday is and give him some cologne or deodorant as a gift.    If he smells really really bad and he wont do anything about it, then you might want to just tell him. I would want someone to tell me that I smell rather than people avoiding me. Its like warning someone about having an eye booger, you should tell them if youre a good friend lol    Dont be mean about it but just tell him nicely, but I think a person should know when he smells bad. Then he can do something about it instead of people talking about him behind his back.    If you think hes cute or if you like him, then go for it!  If you dont like him, then just tell him you would rather be his friend.

Its a VB language that creates interactive graphics and the viewer for it is Macromedia Flash. You need Shockwave installed for it to work popularly. Its like a plugin.    Info:  Flash, a popular authoring software developed by Macromedia, is used to create vector graphics-based animation programs with full-screen navigation interfaces, graphic illustrations, and simple interactivity in an antialiased, resizable file format that is small enough to stream across a normal modem connection.  Animation software used to develop interactive graphics for Web sites as well as desktop presentations and games (Windows and Mac) by the company Macromedia. Flash on the Web is displayed by a browser plug-in. Non-Web presentations are run by a Flash player, included on a floppy or CD-ROM. Flashcan be used to create vector-based graphics in one or more timelines that provide a sequential path for actions.  Flash is Macromedia's vector graphics-based resizable animation format with navigation and simple interactivity features. The files are small and practical for low-speed modem connections and yet provide much of the look of real-time video. Macromedia offers a free player. Macromedia Flash  Created by Macromedia, Flash animation is one of the hottest technologies on the web. Because Flash is vector-based (a way of storing computer graphics), the file sizes are extremely small.

AA12042975	There really isnt any add-on tool for such a task. I only deal with JAVA programming, but maybe VB logic would be simliar.    You can parse an excel form by converting it to a .csv file which creates a row of data and the deliminator is a comma. You can just create a filtering tool that would manipulate this csv file the way you want. Then just rewrite the results into a file in csv format, then you can actually create a macro to open this file in excel and then convert it to an excel format. It would only take a few programming logic to create the filtering tool you want it to just by running the program on your server.|`|0217e7d0f74649c5b60716366d9e1ae3aa	I fell pretty lonely here in your question.

AA12042975	Programmers who are more into linux and an open source environment will prefer openOffice because it gives them the flexibilty to contol what the program does.    It is a lot more flexible because you will never hear a complaint like "how do I do this" or "how do I do that"....you are basically engineering your documents to do things according your own program and commands. I think its more versatile and reliable when it comes to programming your own macros and functions.    Yes it can be object oriented depending on if you are an object oriented programmer. Most perl or cobol programmers find it hard to create object oriented programs since they like to see their entire program in just one class.     "OpenOffice Basic is a variation on Microsoft Office Basic, which is a variation on Visual Basic, which is a variation on the original BASIC that those of us of a certain age learned as our first programming language."    If you know VBA, then I think you will definitely prefer openOffice and you will be able to learn it quickly.
AA11307236	For many years now, most all voice and data that is transmitted long distances is digital.  This means that it has been converted to a stream of ones and zeroes that can be decoded back into something usable when it reaches the recipient.      "Ones and zeroes" is really just a figure of speech, because any 2 opposing states can be taken to mean 1 and 0.  On and off, high and low, light and dark.  It is this last pair that fiber optics use.  The "ones" are transmitted as extremely short pulses of light, and the "zeroes" are the gaps between the pulses.      So why not just use copper wire and transmit the ones and zeroes as electrical current?  Well, you can, but over long distances, the ones and zeroes kind of run together and the recipient can't tell which is which.  This is because all sorts of interference along the way messes them up, just like how you can't understand a radio station if you're too far from it or your radio is too close to something emitting a lot of interference like a motor.  Light inside a glass fiber is not susceptible to this interference.  In fact, nothing can interfere with it except if the fiber is physically broken.  You can bunch the ones and zeroes up extremely closely, and they'll still be readable on the other end because nothing along the way messes them up.    It's really easy to think that fiber optics are faster because light is faster than electricity, but this is wrong.  Light is faster, but it's not the speed of the signal that matters as much as how quickly the signal can revert back and forth between light and dark or on and off.  Over long distances, fiber's the winner.|`|3d011fedcc6a7184046c28721876daafaa	Most simply yes, light travels faster than electrical current, thought most fiber optic connections, are not completely fiber optic.

Lithobid|`|AA11665518	light travels faster than electrical current|`|AA10811401	Actually, light and electricity move at very close to the same rate.  The reason it is considered to be faster is that there is more bandwidth (more capacity for information) in fiber optics.  A cable that supports 500 homes might be 6 inches in diameter where a fiber optic cable supporting the same thing would be the size of a quarter.|`|5c2469822fc61f1e9929f82e02df0232aa	Having worked for over 30 yrs with a communication company, unless you are an engineer in electronics, you should just be content with this revolution occurring.

Multi-mode, and single-mode.  Single mode employs only single-directional information transfer, meaning that there has to be 2 cables from one computer to another (one is transmit, one is receive), and they only hold one type of data.  Multi-mode uses different wavelengths of light to support multiple signals on one cable....    The fact is that light travels at 186,000 miles/second, approx.  This is a lot faster than electricity can travel on standard copper wires, etc.    Its like the difference between reading a book like you and I do, and someone that has a photographic memory just flipping pages as fast as they can see the whole page.  That is pretty close to the difference in speed.    It is transmitted using light wavelengths in Binary (on/off) usually, but it can be done other ways.  Cheers!

In my opinion WinAmp is the best ( www.winamp.com ) on the Windows operating system.  It is quick and the controls are laid out like a CD player.  A lot of the other MP3 players try to be fancy and complicated.      When using WinAmp choose the classic skin option.  It greatly improves the speed of the player.  I also think it has an easier interface to use.    -= Portable (harware) MP3 player =-    If you want a portable mp3 player then the iPod is really easy to use and sync with your computer.  iTunes is really straight forward and streamlines all your processes.      I have an iPod nano.  It has a nice color screen and a simple interface.  The shuffle is probably easier to use, but you loose the ability to browse your songs and see what is playing.  It really depends what you want to use it for.      For example for audio books the shuffle does have an audio book mode where it doesn't shuffle the tracks.  Since you most likely have one audio book on it at a time then you don't need to worry about what is playing, so the shuffle would be the best solution.    Beyond ease are there other concerns you have about an MP3 player?  Price? Flexibility, etc?|`|c0f12240ff685124f7697ee085bcaa7baa	the iriver players may not be easy to use, but the sound quality rocks, reckon it's better than the ipod...

AA12042975	It might just be doing an automatic update. Components are just addons , it doesnt necessarily mean it is trying to install Microsoft again.    The Microsoft Component Installer for Windows SDK provides a mechanism for developers to package common redistributable runtime components for installation on an end user's computer. Developers building applications for Windows often need to ensure that runtime components are installed on the destination operating system in order to run correctly. With this SDK, developers can streamline the installation process and include this installer with their own installation package to ensure the pre-requisite components are in place.    The SDK provides support for installing any or all of the following components:    * Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0   * Microsoft Windows Installer 3.1   * Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.8   * Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 and language packs   * Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1   * Microsoft Visual J  runtime and language packs  * Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (x86) and language packs  * Microsoft Visual J  2.0 runtime and language packs  * Microsoft DirectX 9.0c (December 2005 )   * Microsoft Report Viewer 2005 redistributable and language packs  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for the Microsoft Office System redistributable and language packs  * Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition redistributable    The resulting user experience is a small application they can download and run (or run from a CD). It provides the user with a simple wizard user interface that has details on the components that are needed and on the progress of the installation. The customer experience is already localized for over 20 Windows languages and will auto-detect the system locale at launch and will adjust its language as appropriate. The following languages are supported (If the language on the computer does not match any of these, the English user interface will be presented): Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, German, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Iberian), Russian, Swedish and Turkish.|`|AA11332348	Well i think i once had this problem.

AA12349307	The technology race between American engineers and those in Japan has accelerated. A Japanese laboratory has now been credited with building the fastest computer in the world. The computer is so powerful that it can match the combined raw processing power of the two fastest U.S. computers.    The Japanese achievement was reported by an American computer scientist, Jack Dongarra, who tracks the performance of the world's most powerful computers. Dongarra, who works at the University of Tennessee, has maintained an authoritative list of the world's 500 fastest computers for many years. The Japanese accomplishment is evidence that a technology race that most U.S. engineers thought they were winning is far from over, he noted, adding that American companies have built the fastest computers for most of the last decade.    Differences in style and commitment between the U.S. and Japanese engineers are vast, indicating to some that the U.S. research and spending efforts have grown complacent in recent years. "The Japanese clearly have a level of will that we haven't achieved," said Thomas Sterling, a supercomputer designer at the California Institute of Technology in an interview with The New York Times. "These guys are blowing us out of the water, and we need to sit up and take notice," he added. The Japanese government spent $350 million to $400 million developing the system over the last five years.    The Japanese supercomputer will be used only for climate research. Some American scientists have already begun preparing to move some of their climate simulation research to run on the Japanese machine. Formally dedicated in Spring 2002, the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center said that the machine had reached less than 90 percent of its theoretical peak speed.          --------------------------------------...      TALKING IT OVER AND THINKING IT THROUGH!      What country current has the world's fastest computer?      To what do the experts attribute Japanese ability to create such a fast supercomputer?      For what will the Japanese supercomputer be used?          --------------------------------------...      THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE!  NEC Corporation sells a scaled-down version of the new supercomputer. U.S. universities and government agencies have tried to buy the machines over the last decade. They are primarily interested in using the supercomputer for seismic geological studies, aircraft simulation, and molecular modeling. However, the Commerce Department and member of Congress have stopped the purchase of these computers. They have complained that NEC was "dumping" the machines, or selling them below cost to the detriment of U.S. supercomputer maker, Cray Inc. Faster machines are being designed at U.S. government-financed labs in Livermore, Pittsburgh and Los Alamos, N.M., but they are far from being useable any time soon.        --------------------------------------...      SHARING THE NEWS!  Debate is raging over the Japanese supercomputer design. It is argued that the best way to increase speed is by building massively parallel supercomputers that chain together thousands of off-the-shelf microprocessors. Others champion supercomputers made from specialized processors dedicated to solving a particular class of problem. In small groups of three or four, research the different types of supercomputer designs. Using presentation software, each group should report their findings, using handouts as appropriate to share the status of supercomputers today.|`|AA10504017	man so smart, man make fire. man make computer, then get sex with woman.|`|AA12366625	coz it is a machine|`|AA12052910	Because it can't think on its own?!|`|d98d2c561742fc8839013afb90c3ffa2aa	B'cos it's a computer ha! ha! ha! ha!

AA12042975	She needs to contact the seller. When is the auction ending? Only the seller can retract the bid but you have to contact them before the auction ends. Even if she bid 2 pounds, there is a limit of increments...so if she bid 2,000 pounds and if the bid was at 2 pounds, then it would only go up .10 penses at a time. I dont think its possible to bid 2,000 pounds and have the auction set at 2,000.    Tell her to contact the seller as soon as possible. As the seller, it is his responsibility to retract bids when the buyer requests it, otherwise, he has to pay seller fees again if he doesnt retract it right away and if the buyer bails out too late.|`|AA12396944	Contact ebay support immediately, and explain the situation.

AA12042975	Which programming language do you want to create counters?    If you just want free counters, try http://www.statcounter.com/free_hit_coun...    With every program, they differ on how its coded. With Java, you need to keep a session alive. There is a way to capture the user info when someone visits the page and its easily done in java since they have libraries that give a user a unique ID. Once they visit the page, we just increment the counter in the session.    Then I would say it would be in a "while loop" since the conventional "for loop" requires a maximum. But since there are no maximums in a counter, I would use the "while loop". While theres a visitor, increment the counter to +1.    counter = 0;  if user visits then you increase the counter to  counter = counter + 1;    When the counter is 1 then the counter will be set to 1+1 which is 2. When another visits, then the counter would become 2+1 which is 3. For each visitor, the previous set counter will be increased by itself +1. All programming codes usually use the same logic when it comes to dealing with counters.

Let's assume you have two computers: one is in front of you running Linux (machine A), and the other is in the next room on your local network, and also runs Linux (machine b). Assume for this demonstration that you have a user account on each machine, and they are the same: username fred and password pizza. Machine A has an ip address of 192.168.0.1, and Machine B has an ip address of 192.168.0.2.    First: from machine A, open a terminal window. Call that window A.     Next: from machine A, open a second terminal window. Call that window B.    From window B, enter:     ssh fred@192.168.0.2  ...and when prompted, enter your password...     password: pizza    You should now be logged into machine B using SSH in window B. If not, there are many things that might be wrong; wrong ip address, SSH not configured or installed on both machines, firewalls or whatnot in the way -- that's outside the scope of this document.    Now, let's say we want to transfer the file /home/fred/magictricks.txt from machine A to the /home/fred/ directory on machine B.    Type this into window A:     scp /home/fred/magictricks.txt /home/fred/  ...and enter your password when asked...     password: pizza    This will transfer the file to machine B. In window B, type...     ls /home/fred/    You'll get a directory listing for /home/fred/ on machine B, and the file magictricks.txt should now be there!    That's the basics. For more information, type...     man scp  ...into the command line of either machine, and read the details about that application.    A few things to keep in mind:    1. If you don't understand things like Unix directory structures and file permissions, you need to learn about them before trying to do this;    2. If there's a file of the same name on the destination machine (in this case, machine B) in the same directory, that file will be overwritten by the one on the source machine (in this case, machine A.)    3. SCP copies files using the same encryption that SSH uses; you probably don't need your file transfers encrypted, but isn't it nice to know that they are?    Hope this helps. By the way, SSH means "Secure SHell", and SCP means "Secure CoPy".|`|AA11957331	try ftp or ssh ...
4d0c159c1518329e52c1c7cb8e63c3f8aa	Hi,    I hope you'll listen to this answer because it is grounded in knowledge. Although some have answered that "No. He can't sue." The fact of the matter is anyone can sue anyone, over almost anything. Someone else tried to answer that someone can only sue "a financial burden or emotional burden that's irreversible or irretrievable without the court of law's help." That's not really accurate. What he is sort of describing is a tort, but that still wouldn't be even 75% accurate. Let me explain:    The two follow-up questions to the simple "Can he sue" are, "Would he win?" and "Is there a basis for the suit?" Let's take the latter first. The basis for the suit is grounded in his belief that you entered into a contract with him. The fact that it is electronic is irrelevant based on Federal Law, so disregard any comments suggesting that the fact that this is online has any bearing. A contract is a contract and you did, in fact, enter into one. Is the contract binding? Generally, yes. By joining eBay you agreed to be bound and by bidding you once again acknowledged the binding nature of your bid, agreeing to buy at a certain price. There was a meeting of the minds and a contract resulted. You may argue that there was no meeting of the minds, but to do so, you would (although there are other ways) probably have to show that you gained some knowledge of the item, after the auction concluded that was not *available* prior to your bid. It could not be something you missed or that was ambiguous, it would have to be actual new knowledge generally. So, YES there is a basis. In fact, it is this very basis on which a service, gaining a lot of popularly, called ReliaBid is based. ReliaBid helps sellers collect on bids, when necessary, through traditional debt collection services.    As to who would win in a lawsuit: nobody ever knows. However, a few things to consider. Any action for this amount would have to be brought in small claims court. It is highly unlikely that it would be brought. It is not unlikely that if you failed to show up, that a judgment could be entered against you. I doubt that legal fees would be awarded (I even doubt someone would retain or find an attorney to retain) for damages of this amount. It is possible that court fees could be assigned to whoever lost. So, who will win? Hard to say. But more importantly:    One thing brings me to believe that this person will not bring any action: he claimed his basis for action would be fraud. Your auctions do not constitute fraud. Your actions constitute a breach of contract. Clearly, he has a weak legal background and has not consulted an attorney. I'd guess that he is making idle threats. If he really cared about completing his transactions, he probably would have joined ReliaBid. Folks have taken other folks to court before, but my guess is that it won't happen this time.    I hope this has been informative and left you with some good decision making information.    DISCLAIMER: This information is not meant to constitute legal advice does not constitute legal advice or legal opinions and should not be used as a substitute for obtaining legal advice from an attorney licensed or authorized to practice in your jurisdiction.|`|AA11608496	im not expert, but id think he probably could if he really wanted to, ebays says a bid is entering into contract in which you agree to pay. but i doubt he will over $20... unless he's a dumbass or a psycho. now maybe he would do it if you bought a car or house or something else valuable... but he'll end up paying way more in court fees then getting his $20.    if you wanna get out of it, just offer to send him $2 or so to cover his ebay fees for the auction. maybe he'll back off and not leave negative feed back    on a side note though i really hate people like you who bid on something and then decide they dont want it, though i try to be honest and upfront about my descriptions so i dont have this kind of issue that often|`|AA11067290	No that happened to me once too. They can block you from buying i think, but not sue you. Especially not for 20$. I believe there is a certain amt you can sue for.|`|AA12042975	I highly doubt anyone with a reasonable mind would sue over a $20 item. He wont win in court and he would have spent thousands of dollars on legal fees so I honestly do not think he can do that.    Anyway, legally, he cannot sue. Ebay is an online auction and if the buyer does not pay, then the only thing a seller can do is contact ebay about it. If the buyer still does not pay, then he has the choice to leave him a negative feedback.     All sellers are risking something when they sell online. All he has to is contact ebay and tell them that you did not pay for the item and after a week, he gets his ebay selling fees back. He cannot sue, so dont worry.    A person can only sue in a court of law if the accused has caused a financial burden or emotional burden thats irreversible or unretrievable without the court of law's help. Ebay will return his fees so there is no point for him to sue. The courts will just laugh at him and send him away if he tries to sue you over a $20 item from an online auction. You should read ebay's terms and services. All sellers are taking a risk when they sell things online since its not a physical tangible store. The seller will get his selling fees back if he contacts ebay, so he should stop acting like a child.
AA12042975	I wont be able to know this answer unless I see your framework. Make sure you called the correct frame. Just because you named it a certain way, doesnt mean you can just use the name and it will end up on the right frame.     You need to know which frame position it is in because once you create a framed website, they are all referenced like an array.     Example:  document.frames[0].location would reference the parent frame.    Check out this tutorial:  http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/frames/f...    It will give a better explanation.|`|AA12371148	you can't set target frame in firs file .   target=framename must be set in frame tag.

AA12042975	Trademark    A trademark or trade mark[1] is a distinctive sign of some kind which is used by a business to uniquely identify itself and its products and services to consumers, and to distinguish the business and its products or services from those of other businesses. A trademark is a type of industrial property which is distinct from other forms of intellectual property.    Conventionally, a trademark comprises a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements. There is also a range of non-conventional trademarks comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories.|`|AA10031674	TM = trademarks    it's a registered trading mark that is recognisable by others.
