X7KjqVy5aa	In order to evolve your Starters, all you have to do is put Palkia on your team roster from Chimecho Assembly, then head to Luminous Springs. Your starters should be able to evolve now. If you're talking about regular Pokemon, just level them up or get evolution items from Kecleon Stands inside dungeons. Hope this helps. Good Luck evolving.

2PGIoNUHaa	Hmm old card lol.<br>  <br>  I mean, does it load? Can you hear sounds of the intro of the game starting, but can't see anything?<br>  <br>  Also how much memory do you have on the card? And what type?<br>  <br>  I'd say if you could upgrade it, otherwise sounds like it's pretty outdated or something.
oA6mwhFQaa	You seen this on Game stop.com didn't you? They just made a joke, frankincense and myrrh are harvested from certain plants and have weird colors about them. Since Pokemon has so many games, the thing on game stop was just making fun of it.
4f2GaLhpaa	You can play some of their games, they're pretty easy. Or you can make an account and do nothing, log in a year later and you get money and items just for being a loyal member. LOL
MHzCLacmaa	Well, if I understand right, your game corrupts sometimes and the game fell on your bed when your sister tossed it to you. You also said that there was a duplicate of Raichu and Pichu. If I got everything right, then yes, your game was probably glitched. If your game gets corrupted a lot, a simple drop on the bed can easily screw it up. Sorry about your Pokemon.
Z2EzfQFvaa	Eggxecutor(sorry if I misspelled)|`|4EZbkQ1kaa	you mean Exeggutor|`|MFAVIW1waa	Exeggutor. The evolved form Exeggute which is the one that looks like a bunch of cracked eggs huddled together. Exeggutor looks like a walking palm tree with 3 coconuts for faces. Awesome pokemon.|`|MHzCLacmaa	Ummm...If your talking about a Pokemon, I think your talking about Exeggutor?|`|g9PbLVolaa	Ohh you mean Exeggutor? It is the evolved form of Exeggcute. It evolves with a leaf stone. It is half psychic and half grass. Hope I helped!|`|4qWnVPqOaa	eggsicute or exicutor??
i3goVAkdaa	You had to buy the limeted edition gears of war two which came with a code for a golden lancer. The hammerburst was given out at the midnight releases, and the shotgun is staff members only.|`|UADLdXBtaa	Lancer codes can be purchased on ebay. Last I checked they were going for $40-$60 (some have the flashback map pack with them too). I got mine in the limited edition of the game.|`|PQy6if0Waa	You get a Golden Lancer from using a code found inside the Limited Edition game case.<br>  <br>  A Golden Hammerburst is from going to the Midnight Mayhem event that most Gamestops (or any game store) had when the game was first launched, first night, as Nov.6 changed to Nov.7... At midnight. :P|`|KXSQ2zC0aa	Well...<br>  The golden lance is some thing you can still get from the limited or premium addition of gears of war2. <br>  The golden hammerburst is some thing there was a limited amount of and people were only able to get it if they had pre ordered the game or went to the midnight premier at game stop or some game crazy in america

wZuBbA2Xaa	every person is different.  I'm actually shorter than all the members of my family.  The only way to know for sure is is you get an xray of your growth plates. Since you're only 13, you should grow more though.  It also depends of whether your male or female because genders grow at different times during their teenage years|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	You will have a growth spurt when your about 14 and a half, happens to everyone.<br>  <br>  dont worry so much.<br>  <br>  is this to go on roller coasters?|`|HD8Cm7PSaa	I'm not sure cause my family is at least 5 foot 6 and above and I'm the shortest and I'm 17 years old I'm 5 foot 2.

tHZtPo9Zaa	Once you get started, you could go on seemingly forever thinking about the <br>  theoretical probabilities and odds involved in the game of monopoly.<br>  <br>  Start simple: when rolling two dice, the most likely result is a total of seven.<br>  I expect that you are supposed to know how to figure that out using math.<br>  If nothing else, list all the possibilities. 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1 are sevens.<br>  The next likely rolls are six or eight; both have the same probability as each other.<br>  <br>  Next: Park Place is one of the least landed-on squares <br>  because the square seven places behind it is Go to Jail ?.<br>  I saw it a million times when I played, and only later understood why:<br>  you can't get to Park Place with a roll of seven.<br>  <br>  The Jail / Just Visiting Jail space is visited often. <br>  So you want to have the properties that are 6, 8, and 9 away from Jail.<br>  Those are the Orange group: St James, Tennessee and New York.<br>  <br>  There are properties that have Chance Cards: Illinois, St Charles, etc.<br>  They âˆ´ have increased probability of being landed on because of that.<br>  There are two "advance to the nearest railroad" Chance Cards,<br>  and only one Advance to Reading Railroad card.<br>  There are "advance to nearest utility" cards, etc.<br>  <br>  When you trade properties, you can consider the chances that you will be able to buy the rest of the colour group and establish a monopoly for that group and buy houses.<br>  <br>  I observe that the rent increases the most percentage-wise when you<br>  buy the third house. Check it out.  Demonstrate it with some math.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that's enough to get you started.

LyyE7lq5aa	Wynauts are common on Mirage Island in Emerald.<br>  <br>  Also, if you put a Lax Insense on a Wobbuffet when in the daycare, they egg will hatch into a wynaut. But, one of the wobbuffets in the daycare MUST be holding a  lax insense for a wynaut egg. You can find a lax insense on the fifth floor of Mt. Pyre.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|wLgGD63raa	The reason why you cannot get a Wynaut is because you need a Lax Incense attached when you breed the Wobbuffet.|`|uAMUG0xaaa	No, im pretty sure the incencse items are not in the 3rd generation games. I really don't know why it's not working. I use action replay on my<br>  nintendo DS so if you use game boy advance or gameboy advance SP <br>  you can get a device called Gameshark.

HzSfDevkaa	okay here goes :D<br>  <br>  so theres actually only ONE WoW (World Of Warcraft, World of Warcraft:Burning Crusade, and World of Warcraft:Wrath of the Lich King)<br>  <br>  but you should definitly try the trial if ur unsure.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial...</a> <br>  <br>  and actual membership is WAY better than the trial, as you can get to lvl 80 (with latest expansion), make groups to finish difficult quests, etc. The only downside to WoW that i see, are that the lower lvls get kinda tiring when you keep getting ganked (owned by a lvl MUCH higher than u), which happens alot if ur on PVP servers. (this resolves itself as u gain lvls) an the second downside is people dont like paying 15$ a month... well if u but usig a credit card, an buy it 6 months at a time, u get more money off than if u bought it 1 month at a time... I didnt want my credit info out there, so u can also just go into EB Games, an ask for a pre-paid WoW card, an its about 33$ got 2 months. So if u've got the time to spend, (an the money lol) then i heavily suggest gettin the WoW games. :D hope i helped :P (btw, if this didnt help, the expansion with the most additions to lvls, items stuff to do, etc.. is the 3rd expansion; WoW:Wrath of the Lich King.. Buying information: i got all 3 games for around 105$ :/) [40$ for the "battle chest" of the first 2 games, than about 60+tax for the third expansion] Again, hope i helped with ur question, an gl in the World of Warcraft :D (btw, ill hate u forevr if u go alliance lol :D)|`|ArKT9O7Maa	... There is only one World of Warcraft.  However, it has 2 expansion packs, all of which you need to play effectively.  However, if you are talking about Warcraft, I have no idea.|`|uAMUG0xaaa	I think you misunderstood. There is just one World of Warcraft, but<br>  there are two Expansion packs that give you more things to do. You also can't just buy the game and start playing. When you get the game you<br>  log in to the account you had on the trial, but after 1 month, you have<br>  to either subscribe, or buy prepaid cards from stores like Target or<br>  Gamestop. But technically there is only ONE world of warcraft and 2<br>  expansion packs. I hope this cleared things up.|`|0uHtqvI3aa	None. Unless you want to pay high amounts of money to neglect your friends and family.|`|RqW6DLzPaa	I don't exactly know... It's all so good!
RqW6DLzPaa	Double kick, then ember, then peck.|`|k8h2kAd1aa	use ember,then kill it with another amber|`|uAMUG0xaaa	I haven't played Sapphire version in years, but it's probably best to level<br>  up your combusken on trainers you haven't faced yet, and on low level<br>  pokemon. Also, if you only have your combusken, you should either<br>  get it to around 4 or 5 levels higher than all your rivals pokemon. If you<br>  have more than one pokemon, you just have to know what "type trumps"<br>  are. For example, water beats fire, fire beats grass, and grass beats <br>  water. This is true for every type, like water beats ground. You just have<br>  to try and get a few pokemon that "type trump" your rival's. If you have a<br>  guide that was released when Sapphire version was there should be a section that shows the type trumps. If not, there's probably a website somewhere. One last thing, I always have used the water starter on every pokemon game, and usually when I would use fire, it was nearly impossible to finish the game...

nNHdQTcUaa	I haven't played fallout 3, but I don't think any game can beat the 3rd person shooter RPG that Mass Effect offers.  If you've played KOTOR and loved it, you'll die when you play Mass Effect.  The dialogue is far superior as well.  The only downside I could see is not being able to pick a new class when you beat the game and play it over as the same character.  Other than that, it's fast to start you out, fully customizable face, easy to learn, and the backstory is so thought out and detailed you could write an entire Mass Effect book series on each character.|`|ha2B8vuTaa	Fallout 3 is much better. its starts out ok but then just gets better and better. plus the map is huge theres so many places to go|`|klFq4ZAWaa	Fallout 3 hands down|`|0uHtqvI3aa	They are both awesome. It depends what kind of setting you like. Sci-fi or Post Apocalyptic.|`|1WASp5iuaa	From experience I can refer to you the knowledge of the infinite greatness of Fallout 3, while Mass Effect is still quite enjoyable. <br>  <br>  I would say that it depends on the type of RPG you like. If you played and enjoyed the Star Wars KOTOR games or Jade Empire you will most likely enjoy Mass Effect. In contrast, if you prefer RPGs like The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind or Oblivion, then you will most likely prefer Fallout 3.<br>  <br>  CONCLUSION:<br>  <br>  Fallout 3:<br>  Story:4/5<br>  Gameplay:5/5<br>  Graphics:5/5<br>  RPG Elements:5/5<br>  <br>  Mass Effect:<br>  Story:5/5<br>  Gameplay:3/5<br>  Graphics:5/5<br>  RPG Elements:4/5<br>  <br>  I hope you make the right choice.|`|A7BmtHwaaa	both are amazing, i recommend both whole heartedly, plus, they just announced mass effect 2|`|IggK1Eklaa	Fallout 3.

I'm not sure why exactly, but I just couldn't get into Mass Effect.
lin0jVvXaa	Well it depends on how busy the park is. If its a quiet day you could have the whole train to yourselves :P <br>  But usually you wont have to sit with screaming kids. Haha. Anyway, its all a part of the fun. You should give a scream with them. But in the que lines you can see who your going to sit with. So just get onto the ride when theres not much of a que. Eg lunch time, or during a show, parade etc. It shouldnt be this time of year. Peak season is summer so you should be sweet. Have fun!|`|cCAGstnpaa	It doesn't matter who you sit with.|`|ziFo76Yiaa	Yes they will catch up will two other people screamers can be annoying! Or go on one  with two free Adults.
k5f1lDmXaa	The series has definitely not finished.  Nintendo has announced that the next Legend of Zelda game is going to be for wii, and will come out in late 2009 or 2010.  Apparently the makers are thinking of changing the story, so the adventure may not be based on rescuing Princess Zelda anymore! Also, a lot of people are saying that the game might have a first-person view, and might use motion-plus and real voice-acting to make it more realistic - and it will probably be more difficult. I can't wait!!!|`|bws8ZQoxaa	Give it time. You know Nintendo, they tend to work on the mario series a bit more, milking it, you know. Mario party, tennis, golf, etc.<br>  <br>  Give it some time, if they stopped, they would have told everyone. Zelda is not dead.|`|wQOoiAwsaa	I don't know if it help much, but you check at Dnd Game Shop for the Zelda games.

I'll keep checking to see what people say.|`|V7qbMDp3aa	no because zelda is 2 gay 2 make another
cMHTVMpMaa	The BIOS is the firmware of the playstation and is not included with any of the emulators as owning them unless you have a ps1 is illegal. look for SCPH-3000 as that is the most recent version of the ps1 firmware. I would recommend ePSXe as that has been there the longest and is the most compatible. Even with the working bios, you'll need to configure/experiment with which sound/video plugins work the best with your computer. I recommend playing the games from the .iso disc images on the hard drive to avoid any latency issues played from an optical drive.

rY88iqudaa	For Fallout 3 there is some DLC if you have PC or XBOX versions.  Right now the only one out is Operation Anchorage but I believe there are two more on the way, one of which will allow you to play the game past the ending and raises the level cap.  As for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 you are not alone in wanting news of a sequel.

rDqlu532aa	I suggest unplugging the internet/online compatibility cord out, wait a few minutes and plug it back in. If it keeps on doing it, then it's either the disk, the PS3 or your internet. Can't be much further help. If you still can't connect, contact the PS3 people and they'll help.

43RPjLZlaa	i had 2 of my kids grow up before i even beat the game. <br>  when you have a kid, do a quest or leave town for a while, then go back to your wife and your kid should be grown up. <br>  i don't know how many kids you can have though. im trying to have a 4th kid. but no luck on it yet. i think it depends on how big of a house you live in. but im living in fairfax castle right now and i have 3 kids and they are all grownup. so if you want more than 2 kids,  have your wife move to bloodstone mansion or fairfax castle. <br>  <br>  fairfax castle can be purchased after you beat the game for $1,000,000.<br>  &bloodstone mansion(reavers home) can also be purchased after you beat the game for $84,887. actually most of the big homes including the graveyard mansion can be bought after you beat the game. i THINK you might be able to have more than 2 kids in the graveyard mansion.. i haven't tried. but it is possible to have more than 2 kids with the same person. <br>  <br>  hope this helped. :)|`|NEhl9UGlaa	I personal Thought 1 But my freind Had 2 so maybe like Unlimted or 2 lol :P

Tzw6UsHvaa	Its sort of like a demo of Killzone 2. Its the game demo early but the developers use it so that they can see bugs and glitches and how they can improve them.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	It's the Beta for the PS3-exclusive Killzone 2. It's looking to be the biggest game of this year at this point.|`|jxpV13rTaa	i believe it is the demo. people refer to it as beta (dont know why you wouldnt just say demo it makes much more sense since beta means incomplete and demo is like trial)

Vy4jvBjDaa	Ok. I had the same exact problem. I was completely afraid of loops and such, but really, I can almost guarentee one of your friends is also afraid, so no worries. And if you got a good friend that isn't afraid, let em know you are. Then sit by em on all the multi-passenger rides and it gets to be much, much easier. Trust me, if you get on, you'll be terrified but all you need to do is close you eyes on all the scary parts. Roller coasters are great even with your eyes closed, the rush of the wind and screaming, (from ENJOYMENT) is awesome. And soon enough, you'll be able to keep your eyes open.|`|bWLdtkhlaa	There are plenty of rides at Six Flags that aren't roller coasters. You can ride those with your friends, and they understand if you are afraid, but if they don't just make them respect your wishes and wait for them outside of the exit for the ride. And not saying that your a wimp, but some roller coaster rides aren't all that bad. Of course, Medusa or Kong are pretty intense rides that you shouldn't do, but some others aren't that bad. Think of this: if your friends know that you are afraid of roller coasters, just go on 1 that you think would be fine to go onto. If you don't like it, your friends can't say you were a coward for others because you tried at least one. Also, if you do go on one and like it, you might go with your friends on others! Just be yourself, and don't worry. Your there at Six Flags have fun. HAVE FUN!|`|tWXkm134aa	OMG! this summer the same thing happened to me. I was terrified of anything in the air. But one day my friend took me and said yeah well go on what ever you want. the next thing i know she is grabbing my arm pulling me on to a looping roller coaster i was almost crying! i was so scared but when i got off i was begging to go on Again. don't be afraid you will love it. loops are what? ten feet off the ground? its ok even if you do hate it its only 3 minutes long? big deal, Trust me, you'll love it sooo much. DONT BE AFRAID!!! DONT BE AFRAID!!!!! you'll be hooked like I am!! I am also is 7th grade and i love six flags but are stupid band teacher said we were to big for six flags so now were going to dourney park.... and our band sucks! so have fun trust me 100% you have no idea what your missing out on. =)|`|cCAGstnpaa	I used to be the exact same way. When I was afraid of roller coasters, I was worried about other people's safety on roller coasters. But ever since my mom tricked me on an upside down roller coaster, I can't get enough of them. I loooove Six Flags!!!!!|`|tXk0oymyaa	Yes follow what the above said <br>  <br>  roller coaster that has the protective gear that goes over your head is much safer and not as scary<br>  <br>  if you do not want to seriously go on<br>  other people or teachers might not either<br>  you can wait till the ride is over<br>  and do something else
nx02ftaVaa	that game`s awesome :P
NYmazpVkaa	Kairi,<br>  There's no real proof other than the storyline and FMV's.<br>  In the first game Kairi is revealed later to be one of the seven princesses of heart. Her heart was seperated from her body. Later in the game, Sora gives up his heart and becomes a heartless in hollow bastion in order to restore Kairi's heart.<br>  There's no mention of their relationship in the future, but it will probably be explored in future sequels.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	He wants inside of Kairi.<br>  I think the answer is pretty obvious...|`|Xlpv8WDtaa	Her name is Kairi. Here's a few of pictures of her.<br>   <a href="http://www.laughingplace.com/files/KingdomHearts1/Kairi%20CG.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.laughingplace.com/files/Kingd...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.icybrian.com/fanart/johnjoseco/kairi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.icybrian.com/fanart/johnjosec...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.khmaniacs.com/imagenes/walls/kairi_1024.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.khmaniacs.com/imagenes/walls/...</a>|`|eEY8ShQtaa	He's totally all about Kairi. You don't even need proof it's like a known fact. In Kingdom Hearts 2 he's always having little flash backs about her and in Kingdom Hearts 1 he's always running around trying to save her. And I think the other girl your taking about is the blonde one Namine. <br>  Marriage? Neither Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 says anything about anyone getting married.|`|F1eXdz0baa	Agreed with the previous poster. He obviously loves Kairi because he chases after her in all of the Kingdom Hearts games/vids I have seen..|`|d34e0e4d9f69e31f438e1aaa0516f046aa	They could have answered you properly if you'd just use a proper grammar. It's Kairi obviously.|`|vu6fHBwMaa	he likes your mom or the kiri one
rONX4rdxaa	When you attack people make sure you lock on to them using the L1 button. if you play through the game there is a mission where your cousin Roman is getting beat up and u have to save him.

Cuz the game says "E for Everyone" which means EVERYONE can play this game. Im 15 years old and i play pokemon diamond, and i find it pretty fun. I plan on getting pokemon platinum.|`|tfIunOU5aa	There's no age limit for Pokemon. There are cute little animals for young people, and combat for older ones. And besides, its E for everyone.|`|FoJlzQB4aa	Your never too old or too young to play Pokemon or even watch the Pokemon series on TV.|`|jK7pklCKaa	im 20 and still play pokemon and theres nothing wrong with it, they are good games.|`|biAMTiREaa	yeah...ive seen 10 yr olds playing it lol.<br>  and its rated E for Everyone.|`|i9tgxukbaa	I know a few college students who play Pokemon. You can outgrow the TV show, and you can outgrow the card game, but the games themselves are too fun to give up. By the way, do you know anything about how you get Shaymin in Platinum? I hope I don't have to go to a Nintendo event to get the Sky Forme...|`|vVO9AL5faa	Nonsense I'm 27 Years old and I just bought the Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia game...|`|mXcDW0RCaa	Yes, but just barely, I would say 16 is the minimum or pokemon...|`|HoskOfjaaa	Not at all,who says u can't do wat u enjoy doing.And plus it's rated E for everyone.

To get some good Zombies- they are mostly Dark Attribute- then use the Structure Deck Zombie Madness and Zombie World. I highly recommend the cards from the Phantom Darkness set.
M7G3MZb5aa	it doesn't matter, they are about 4 miles apart, you can drive to the other one for the second half of the day and do both.<br>  <br>  If i had to pick, i would vote for mohegan sun, because its easier to get lost in foxwoods.<br>  <br>  mohegan sun is big and open and you can kinda keep yourself orientated as to where you are, where foxwoods is a labyrinth of long hallways and interconnecting minicasino floors separated by walls and stores.<br>  <br>  The better blackjack game is at mohegan sun, for the non card counter, though the game at foxwoods is more exploitable by card counters.<br>  <br>  I don't condone the use of slot machines, but have fun.<br>  <br>  Both casinos are huge, foxwoods is the second largest in the world, i am sure you will find whatever it is you like to play in either casino.|`|JrrDtwVZaa	never been to foxwood but mohegan definitely has a wide selection of slots.
PBa3uaiJaa	well...take out all of your call of the haunteds *illigal card* take out one monster reborn*can only have one, Take out all the exodia cards cuase right now there not useful what so ever.Take our primal seed.Take out Slypher both,and obalisk the tormentor becuase there illegal and they arnt to good.also take out hyozanryu since you have to sacrafice two monsters i think and it has low attack points.<br>  Take our Dragon Zombie.Take out koumori dragon and replace is with luster. All and all pretty good for a new guy. Id also suggjest not having to many monsters with more than 4 stars. Risky if you have to much high lv monsters. Keep working at it and im sure it will be awesome. If you make a new deck or upgrade this one please contact me. The best way is through email...Well duh...I feel so smart-_-
FoJlzQB4aa	Well Japan get it on Spring then North America will follow but it had no release date yet just wait for it.

43zXRpLYaa	That is a very busy time. The weather suddenly gets nice around then and a lot of people and schools are off. When I worked at Disneyland there was a sharp jump in park attendance at that time, atleast 75,000 per day. That's a lot and it means long lines.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Yes, a LOT!!!!!!!!!|`|KAw7yVCbaa	yeah that time of year is one of the busiest times at the Disneyland Resort since all the families go there for spring break. The lines will be a lot longer then normally and be prepared for lots of crowds.|`|pR0oJUx2aa	not millions, but we had to Q around 45 mins 4 all the major rides =D
AvnG6t4baa	In all games, if you beat the elite four, then lose to the champion, you will have to start over. Save before you battle Gary. His first pokemon should be hercross. Get a flying type for it. If you use zapdos, he will use blastoise. If you keep trying, and find yourself unable to beat him, even after trying tons of times, you can try again, this time dont turn off the Gameboy. You will lose half your money (i think). But after your out, you can train your pokemon more.|`|MFAVIW1waa	Yeah so save right after you beat lance and heal (at the door. SAVE RIGHT BEFORE THE DOOR.) because if you don't and go through it you verse him straight away and you have to win or lose.|`|vVO9AL5faa	Yes you have to face on the Elite four again...<br>  But I do recommend saving the game before battling him...<br>  Hope I helped|`|VrR9ojRRaa	I think you do because it counts you as losing. You start again in the Pokemon center out the front.|`|FoJlzQB4aa	Yes you will repeat it over again.
pscUJ4SBaa	That is a pretty good choice for a game!|`|SOxzD2Waaa	i would be guessing sometime in the medieval age and europe. no one really knows.|`|eifgt8U4aa	i think zelda was made based on the way that fairy tales are made. it was just supposed to be kindve in the renasaince time with princesses and all that crap|`|zIsxw1PPaa	Not specifically any age of time per se, but the aspect is fantasy... and the clothing designed for the game is of that genre... fantasy.<br>  <br>  It's got a subtle hint from the gothic ages as well as from the generic clothes of the middle ages (albeit the colors have changed).<br>  <br>  But yeah... It's all pretty much original ideas by the game's creators and designers.|`|7k5gsPANaa	well those games were started by the first nintendo so you should look more into that game
PpXAXEG9aa	My friend sold his psp for $50. He also had a carrying case that ran around $4. According to the popularity and price of the other games I would say the total would be around $80-$90 in game credit. If you want money they take a huge chunk off, it's so big that it's not even worth trading it in there. If you want to sell them for a good price then go for ebay. I sold my phone there (LG Vu) in an hour for $170, I was trying to sell it for weeks at school for $90.|`|VZu936Utaa	I agree with the first dude, ebay is the best bet. Gamestop rips u off and if you sold it on ebay u would make a lot more money that u could spend towards video games. I'd have to say 15% of wat u paid or lower depending on the condition(mint is 15%). 15% is ripp-off, i tried to sell stuff there but didn't because they offered me 2 bucks for a gamecube game(rare too!)|`|a3fb758bf3b46f1560bdbc2cd4286acaaa	it really does matter on what the condition and the value of your items. it cant be messed up. it has to be in good condition.|`|XRJNuWvXaa	you will get back at most 45 percent of what you paid for and that the truth gamestop and ebx are a rip off.<br>  <br>  I would sell it off ebay or something.
zF8Ai3imaa	Well i don't really know, try going somewhere for become a vet and anything to do with animals, and try to have as much experience as possible, although this can only happen if they need a tiger trainer. But this most likely won't happen at six flags for you, since they are expected to go out of business and get bought out in 2010. (not to burst you dream or anything)
xdRI2QhRaa	Most likely either eBay, or Amazon.<br>  <br>  You could type the name of the toy into google and find the website.<br>  <br>  Or got to Martha Stewart's website and find it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to You.
94MKdwmCaa	yeah, you should click the little tag icon then click on the produce thing and set the price or just get a produce display and click on it, it should say set price..
0TpMqyBzaa	Yes you defnitely still need to otherwise anyone could lend you a game and you'd never have to buy anymore.  Installing just slows down the loading times and makes the system run more quietly.  Theres a website somewhere that lists all the differences it makes when you install certain games, I forgot it but I'm sure someone will post it|`|ha2B8vuTaa	Yes|`|PQy6if0Waa	Yes. You need the disc to start the game once it's installed.<br>  <br>  General idea is to prevent people from going out and renting a bunch of games and installing them all to their harddrive.<br>  (That harddrive would have to have quite a bunch of space, though!)<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, that's why. Would NOT be a good marketing idea if you didn't need the disc.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Yes, it would be considered piracy if the CD wasnt in there. Its just for better load times.
PfxqdgZLaa	The number of y-digit combinations chosen from x numbers is given by the "choose" function.<br>  <br>  xCy = x! / (y! * (x-y)!)<br>  When x is 49 and y is 6...<br>  49C6 = 49! / (6! * 43!)<br>  = 49*48*47*46*45*44 / 6*5*4*3*2*1<br>  = 49*47*46*3*44<br>  = 13,983,816

vtJDHJDYaa	There are Navi-G pieces in the following worlds:<br>  1. Wonderland. After defeating Trickmaster (the boss), you get your Navi-G after the cutscene.<br>  <br>  2. Deep Jungle. After locking the keyhole of Deep Jungle, you get another Navi-G.<br>  <br>  3. Traverse Town. Go to the Third District to find Riku. Once you are done chit-chatting, head up the stairs near the entrance to the Second District and enter the lit up house here. Inside the Small House, talk to Cid. After talking about stuff, he hands over a WARP-G, a very helpful Gummi indeed. You won't have to manually fly to worlds that you've been to before.<br>  <br>  After the chat, head back to the Second District and enter the Gizmo Shop. After fighting off the enemies, exit through the other door and climb the ladder to the roof. Defeat the enemies here, and then use the Red Trinity Mark on the wall. Pull the rope inside three times to reveal the keyhole to Traverse Town. Sweet! Unfortunately, when you jump down, a familiar nemesis appears. It's Guard Armor again! Level 21 is a fair level to be at for this fight. Remember to equip as many abilities as possible, and to fill up everyone's item slots. Also, equip Cure on a shortcut button of your choice.<br>  <br>  The battle starts out simple enough, but when you cause some damage, Guard Armor will suddenly transform into a different boss. Opposite Armor!After the fight, you will learn the AERO spell. Excellent. After sealing the keyhole, you will get another NAVI-G PIECE. Excellent again.<br>  <br>  4. Neverland. After locking the keyhole of Neverland, you get another Navi-G.<br>  <br>  But in my guess, your next destination should be Atlantica and you do not need a Navi-G for that world.

Get someone to hold the loops over their hands while you wind<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCA5roBFxo." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCA5roBF...</a>|`|AA12066269	If you have a straight back chair you can place the yarn around that to wind it if you don't have anyone to help hold it.   In the future when you buy yarn this way you might ask the shop to wind it for you.|`|IUpIHFTKaa	The first thing I now do with my yarn is to wind it into balls.  This way I know exactly what I have in store for me.  <br>  <br>  I made an afghan for Christmas and when I got to the last skein, about ever 2 feet there was fat spot where they had put 2 skeins together. The worst part was I was in a hurry to finish the project and the local stores were out of the color.  I ended up buying yarn on my trip (I went by train) and finished it on the train.<br>  <br>  It got so frustrating that I actually cut out about 12 of them and sent them with a message to the customer service of the yarn.  They ended up sending me 4 skeins for nothing, which I never expected but liked the customer service. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zVTFWI9iaa	The best way is to simply wind it into a ball. It is an extra step, but taking the time to wind your yarn into a ball is well worth the extra effort--as you can attest to yourself! I start by finding the end of the skein and winding the yarn over 2 fingers. Then, when I have about 10 or 12 go-rounds, I slip the yarn off my fingers and begin to wind and wind and wind and wind, changeing direction to keep the ball round. When I come to the end, I can start my project. It takes only a few minutes compared to the hours of untying!<br>  Good luck! Happy needlework!<br>  --Erik
505oVIRyaa	You could also try sculpy or other modeling clay. It would have to be layered on pretty thick, especially sculpy, so that it wouldn't break, but you could mold it into just about any shape, and it's pretty cheap at JoAnns. <br>  <br>  A slightly more expensive option is Wonderflex. People make full suits of armor out of the stuff, so I'm sure it's strong enough for a little crown, though I don't have personal experience using it. I've heard it's very simple though.|`|cb5fd91e97ad8b80648bb2c68479cbe3aa	you could use cross-stitch canvas cut and shaped like the crown.  .  the canvas can easily be stiched together to form the crown.  then use spray adhesive to cover surface of crown and smooth out so that you can apply a metallic fabric/vinyl. then embellish with stones.  good luck sounds like a fun project.

85K9nMq8aa	A representative of square enix has that the characters aren't really their and it doesn't count, with Aeris being alive it kind of becomes obvious. However, another square enix rep has said that the part about auron being resurrected may become part of a possible final fantasy x-3 sequel.|`|cPHsPIqMaa	Most of what you see of Final Fantasy in Kingdom Hearts has nothing to do with the original series. Heck, Leon isn't even "Leon's" real name!<br>  Hollow Bastion is a completely made up world, and no, Cid, Yuffie, "Leon", Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa don't live there. Same with Auron, he has nothing to do with Hercules outside of Kingdom Hearts. I think the only thing that's real similar to their original worlds is the fact that Cloud is chasing Sephiroth.|`|bVS64AZjaa	No, nothing of the presences of FF characters in KH is considered canon for FF. Everything they do there is separate and unrelated to their individual plotlines in their respective FFs. I'm 100% on this.|`|i09pUyE4aa	i don't think anything from the kingdom hearts series effects the final fantasy one. like i don't think they care, gives them free advertisement.<br>  hahah but kingdom hearts is kind of trippy, like they go to different worlds and what not, and with Roxis(how do you spell that) yeah, the second one was weird...<br>  but everyone obviously knows Leon lives in Hollow Bastion really and hangs out with some kid and a duck and dog, for serious. ;)<br>  <br>  hahha but when donald and sora appear in a final fantasy, i'll change my opinion.|`|ivnKDjxNaa	I think squeenix just used final fantasy characters and fit them into the plotline as they thought best.

4He3bNO7aa	Second Life (SL) is one of those things you have to try for yourself. Some folks love it - some folks hate it. If you've played The Sims and you like that, chances are you will like SL too. What you will decide to do there is purely up to you. It's much more than an interactive chatroom.<br>  <br>  The addictive factor? Well it's high, but as addictions go it's a pretty cool addiction. There are days when you forget you have a real life, but it really depends what you do there. My friend in SL makes shoes and she makes a very good income from it, so she juggles a real world life of job, husband and kids with her SL job as shoe designer. She's in no way addicted to SL, but her SL career demands she's there for a while most days, but if her real life calls, she drops whatever she's doing in SL and attends to things in the real world. Another friend had to leave the real life job she loved because she has lupus. Her condition restricts what she can do in real life, so SL has become her life. She owns a hat shop, has a partner an runs a nightclub all in SL. For her, SL is pretty much the place she lives her life now. Me? Well, I work for a charity in SL that supports breast cancer and I also have an SL partner. I spend more time in SL than I should, but I have made many friends in SL (some that have become real life friends too) so I spend a lot of time in SL and I'm even considering becoming a mentor (someone who helps other people in SL who have problems).<br>  <br>  There are other problems to consider though. SL has become incredibly popular recently. The CSI episode based in SL was the first major draw, but something has happened in the last few months to almost double the number of people reglularly in SL at any one time. Right now should be a quiet time. Two years ago there would have been no more that 18,000 people in SL. Right now there are 53,000 people in SL. Two years ago, you would have had around 32,000 people in on a busy Saturday night. Now you get over 83,000 people.<br>  <br>  Second Life wasn't meant to handle this many people. Two years ago the owners of SL needed to install newer - better servers, but they didn't. Recently, they started updating some of then, but only to cope with the numbers we had two years ago! So the result is lag everywhere, failed teleports to new locations and crashing. Music streams at live events fail, textures don't appear on items and the lag gets so bad you can end up walking into infinity forever (or until you get logged out). More recently, scripts (SL object software) has either stopped working or works all wrong, changing clothes won't work, objects placed on the ground disappear and never come back, and sales vendors won't work.<br>  <br>  So is SL worth joining? Yes! But I would say you may be very disappointed by what you find and you wouldn't be seeing it at it's best. Be patient with it - hopefully the next client software update (which we've known has been coming since October last year) will improve things. For certain, the owners of SL now really have to do something if they want to keep all of the people who are now coming to SL.<br>  <br>  Sweetiepie is totally wrong. You cannot get a virus from SL - it just doesn't work that way - everything is on the SL servers and the only information that travels to your computer is the client software (which is 100% virus free) and in world textures (which are just like BMP or JPEG files). What you mean Sweetie, is that SL has *memory leaks*. This can cause a slow down on your computer and even other programs running in the background. The solution to this is simple: You clear your cache in SL; log out of SL; open up the login screen for SL; do a Windows Disk Clean-up; log back in to SL.<br>  <br>  Personally I find the current viewer to have no memory leaks and it's been good on that score. Shame about the other problems in SL though.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	You can make real money, meet real people, find real love, and much more good.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, its loaded with players, hateful people, business owners with poor business practices, the grid is very unstable a lot of the time, they have a lot of downtime, the people that own it can depreciate in value any virtual land you pay real money for at the blink of the eye, they have poor customer service, and they have in their terms of use that they can shut down at any time without notice.<br>  <br>  Overall it is a fairly good place though. Its just like the real world. It has good and bad.

Thats one of the best parts about the orks.<br>  For example, you can take a space marine rhino, rip the top off, put ork stuff on it, replace the storm bolter with ork weapons, and paint all or parts of it red, and you can call it a looted wagon.<br>  <br>  "GREEN IS BEST!"

SfSr3bALaa	(Horrible answers!) I have bought magnets several times. I know in Tx you have Walmart's & Michaels (the craft store)<br>  <br>  Either one WILL HAVE them!!! Their fairly cheap in $ so thats good. Your best bet is those two stores. They have them in circles or other ways. Good Luck!|`|MVHGnU59aa	Go to a hobby or craft store. If you need them to be marbles and you have little time, then you need to just make them yourself. Buy a bag of marbles and the size magnets you need.

eAm2HLFAaa	I had this same issue. The game will not run with 4GB of memory, for whatever reason it doesn't recognize that you have any memory at all. I'm assuming you have Vista, correct?<br>  <br>  If so, here is the work around that made the game work for me.<br>  <br>  1. Press Windows and 'R' key simultaneously to get Run window. <br>  2. Type msconfig in Run Window and click OK <br>  3. If system prompts for User control account permission, please click on Continue. <br>  4. In system Configuration Window, select Boot Tab <br>  5. Under Boot Advanced Option Window. <br>  6. Click check mark on Maximum Memory <br>  7. Type memory to 3500<br>  8. Click on OK, again click OK to close the window. <br>  9. Restart the system and test the game <br>  <br>  Basically what you're doing here is making it so your system only uses 3.5 gb of memory. If this doesn't work, you can try the same steps and set it to 2000, but that really sucks especially if you are using Vista 64 bit. <br>  <br>  You can always change the memory back by just unchecking that box, so you can just limit it when you want to play the game if you want the full 4 GB normally.
BwsTfgWaaa	Nobody in their right mind will accept this trade. First of all its hard enough to get a golden hammerburst, why would they give you a golden lancer which cost about 70 bucks?<br>  If you want it that bad sell your current copy and buy a limited edtion.
BwsTfgWaaa	about 67 missions, 6-8 hours to cruise through the story.|`|S30Dcsvgaa	It's great and there's a LOT of fun to be had. Even if you tear through the story it should take you a good while and there's stuff to do afterwards. If you DO get it I just want to advise you not to save over your Niko file because there's no way to just switch from TLAD to the original on the same file. Save it on another slot.
PQy6if0Waa	For Xbox360:<br>  Slightly holding down the LT puts you into Free-Aim.<br>  Holding down LT all the way should lock you onto a target. <br>  Flick the RS left or right to switch targets while locked on.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it's not working in story mode, you may have to take a look at controller options to make it work.<br>  <br>  If you're playing online, the host may have made it to where you can't lock on to others.<br>  <br>  (Oh, and you can't lock on with an RPG  :P)|`|p2L4AB5Laa	@ iLag<br>  <br>  You also forgot the sniper... u can't auto lock with the sniper|`|lcsBEotdaa	If you want to lock on to the target then hold down the left trigger on the 360 or the L2 on the ps3.

They have to be polished or faceted, which is a time consuming process.  Agood faceting machine can cost close to $5000 dollars.

I have an elite and all it does is looks cooler and gives 120GB hard drive. So if you're pondering on weather to get one or not, my opinion is only if you have online and you  are a hardcore gamer|`|i09pUyE4aa	i would think so.<br>  i mean since you can for wii and ps3 and things.<br>  <br>  but i don't own an xbox, but my friend does...<br>  but i'm not much help. XD<br>  <br>  <br>  also if you google it, they answer it.
lXE75yQjaa	Do an advanced search on ebay to check closing prices. There are so many variables here, it's really hard to say. Color and how popular the "look" of the quilt is, factors in big time. If can be the difference between a $10 quilt and a $100 quilt. Also, recession times have made for very tough sales..if you  can afford to wait until the economy straightens out a bit..that would be my suggestion.|`|y02PZj22aa	High quality hand-quilted quilts sell better through craft galleries and are more likely to fetch a reasonable return on your investment.  You should show them (or some of them) to the manager of such a shop and ask what they'd charge and what they'd think you could expect from a consignment arrangement.<br>  <br>  The Highland Craft Guild might be another good contact for you; they sell art-quality quilts at their shops.  Here's their web site:  <a href="http://www.southernhighlandguild.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.southernhighlandguild.org/</a>|`|gyixPyOsaa	couple hundred up to probably 1000 depends on the size the type of pattern etc. you can google hand made quilts and see what other people are selling them for.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Calculate the cost of fabric, then add the number of hours you spent making the quilt.  I have seen queen sized for over $2000.  You could consider donating a couple to a service club, or someone that could use it as a raffle item.|`|Sd8aH8QAaa	Lap size.....maybe 20-25 dollars<br>  <br>  Twin...maybe 75-100 dollars.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the economy and the complexity of the designs as to how much you may get.  Good Luck.|`|1dKfCT80aa	something else to consider would be to sell them at local craft fairs or regional quilt shows. you're more likely to get a better price there than with e-bay, especially if your quilts aren't antiques.
i09pUyE4aa	yeah i read about glitches and stuff to get you to 999, i doubt people can get very far though, i mean mentally and physically without cheating, because you'd have to go to the bathroom and eat and drink and exercise, and sleep.<br>  <br>  so i guess it depends on endurance and stamina and what not.<br>  <br>  but i also think it's a never-ending thing.<br>  or no ones made it to any special levels.|`|YI2P5gKIaa	It never ends, the waves simply get progessively longer as you play.|`|NPFuyuKiaa	It will never end, hahahahahaha, the zombies will always come baack and win!

Z2EzfQFvaa	You are not able to transfer Pokemon from pearl to firered.|`|QJwaagGWaa	Actually, you can NOT transfer pokemon from Pearl To Fire Red, but you can transfer your pokemon From FireRed to Pearl and to do this, yes, you need to pass the pokemon League, but in your case, no.|`|6tDFpxUJaa	While you aren't able to transfer Pokemon from Diamond/Pearl to Fire Red you are able to transfer the other way around.  But, to answer your question, yes you have to defeat the Elite 4 to create what's called Pal Park.  Once that is created simply put Fire Red into the GBA slot (located at the bottom of your DS behind a panel) and turn on Pearl.  Go from there, choose the Pokemon you want to transfer and then you will be able to capture them in Pal Park.|`|MHzCLacmaa	You cannot trade Pokemon from Pearl to Fire Red. Although, in Pearl after you beat the Elite Four a place called Pal Park will open. In Pal Park you can put Pokemon from Fire Red/Leaf Green, and Sapphire/Ruby into Pearl. This is called migrating. You also cannot trade Pokemon from Gold/Crystal/Silver to Pearl or the other way around. Hope this helps!|`|jK7pklCKaa	you cant do pearl to fire red but you can do it the other way round if you complete the league and see 150 pokemon to receive the national pokedex

9h5phsluaa	If you want to model as a hobby then you want to be a "freelance" model; with a normal job you wont have the time for extensive travel and other demands that come with agency representation.<br>  <br>   I've been a freelance model for about a year after a background in dance & pageants.<br>  <br>  The most amazing tool for ANY model, freelancing OR signed, is  www.modelmayhem.com.  It's a free networking website for models, photographers, designers, & makeup artists.<br>  <br>  If you want an example of a typical model's profile you can visit mine:  www.modelmayhem.com/HillaryDevi   I LOVE this website, i couldnt live without it.<br>  <br>  Here you can find numerous opportunities to work with other artists in your area. There are casting calls, forums, etc. There are many positive aspects of ModelMayhem which include, viewing a photographer's portfolio, the ability to collaborate and create the exact theme of photo that YOU want, learning from mentors, and much more.<br>  <br>  The only catch is that you must have at least 4 professional or semi-professional photos before your profile can be approved. (Basically no "mysapce" shots). No holding the camera in the mirror, etc.<br>  <br>  Another option is checking out Craigslist under the "gigs" section... but it's more dangerous and less professional (i've had some BAD experiences).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  xoxo|`|jjDZJmfpaa	Have you ever thought of going to colleges and universities where there are courses in the fine arts. Instructors look for models in the life drawing department all of the time. Though you may have to pose nude, it will be experience and there is a possibility of payment. You might also look in the high end suburbs where there are YMCA and YWCA where there are art classes there as well.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	modeling isnt a hobby, its a job, and not anyone can do it. you have to have a unique look, great bone structure, be at least 5'11 (for men; although that is the bare minimum, most agencies consider that short) and have a perfect, chiseled body. you send shots of just shoulder-up and full body to eevry agency in the area. beware that many agencies arent legit and are modeling "schools"- if they ask you for a dime, its a scam and you will never book anything. its VERY difficult to get signed by a legit agency; there are literally hundreds of people applying for one spot. also, if you dont live in or very close to a major city (miami, chicago, new york, la, etc), you wont find many agencies, and the fewer there are, the less chance you have to get signed. the fact that you think its a hobby is your first mistake- as a model you WORK. its not fun or glamorous. it takes hours to complete a shoot or runway show, and they will not say "oh you work during the week? well we'll just do this on the weekend then!". jobs dont usually take place on the weekend, so you wouldnt be able to do them anyway. models have to be very driven, passionate and determined, and when an agency hears that you want to do it as a "hobby", theyll boot you out the door.|`|pG21SQ4vaa	Depending on where you live, there will be modeling agencies.

mIfY1ZxMaa	There aren't any in 3.5, nor do I know any deities from any other D&D source material (any edition) that have both domains.  Of course, a cleric of a luck god could pretty easily have access to the healing sphere as a major sphere in 1st or 2nd edition, as being a healer is a major calling for many clerics, but I don't know much about 3.5, so I don't know how the domains limit those clerics.  <br>  <br>  If you wanted to import a god, I would choose Hotei, one of Japan's Seven Lucky Gods, the Shichi Fukujin.  Hotei is responsible for abundance and good health.  He is depicted as a fat, jolly god.  He would be the closest I can think of for a deity that would have both the Luck and Healing domains.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.|`|ciG5yrgFaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dungeons_&_Dragons_deities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dun...</a><br>  <br>  they have a list of the deities and their domains.  found one for healing, one for luck, but not one with both.  there were others that had healing or luck, but they were not class deities, they were from the greek or egyptian pantheons, which most DMs won't allow.

fs27NcEoaa	first off if you are selling marbles, then i would stick with that. if you sell marbles and also gamble, then you are taking the chance of losing the money you made selling marbles. besides the only sure bet when gambling is one that you know you can't lose and in gambling, there is no sure bet. you can never tell if your bet is a good one until the game or whatever you bet on is over. lets use any kind of sports for example, i have seen where one team spots another a huge amount of points and you think that the underdog (the one getting the points) can't lose and yet they still do. i saw a football game once where a team spotted the other team like 45 points and they still won by like 50. not only did they cover what they spotted but had a few points extra to spare. it isn't often that you see that happen so if i were you, i wouldn't gamble at all. i know to many people that have lost a lot of things by gambling when they couldn't afford it. they lost their cars, home, savings and a bunch of other things to go with that. DON'T GAMBLE - stay away from it before you even start. it is addicting and then you could end up owing money and then have to find a way to earn that much more - stick with something that you can do like the marbles and not lose money with it. good luck whatever you do though, this is just a person speaking from experience about gambling. i didn't lose anything but i did end up working to pay my debts and took me a while before i did get them paid off. i got very lucky i didn't lose my stuff. i suffered through quite a bit during the time i was paying off my debts and was barely making it paying the other bills i had. i cant say enough - dont gamble at all. talk to your parents and see if they know of a way to make some extra money around the house of even help your neighbors out with things and see if they would be willing to pay you for that like cut their grass, shovel snow, whatever you can think of to help them and them help you. you never know unless you ask.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Doesn't sound like you want to gamble.

VM8ANGVvaa	Well more specifically, if the whole ring is red, it means the console AV cable isnt plugged in, if there is a half circle of red then your xbox is overheating, and if your xbox has a three-quarter circle then it is broken and you need to call microsoft for a replacement....if you have a 3 quarter circle then you have a 3 year warranty on that|`|JEUshzOVaa	if it keeps doing it send it in as there is probably somthing wrong with it......also it cud just be overheated (depends on the temp of the day)|`|8SPKsHozaa	you can do that but it will only work for a couple hours you can also try putting the console on its side..your best bet is to call 1800-4my-xbox and tell them you got the red ring|`|rBWm8pPuaa	Your warranty is over by now I would think but you could not have got RRoD before when it happens it means your Xbox over heated and ****** up something if its happening now then its dead|`|joyRBLK9aa	the best thing u can do is get a pro to hep or send it to microsoft

Could have been a contributing factor to it as well.  People with pre-existing conditions they didn't previously know they had typically find themselves in medical trouble after riding amusement rides, the condition triggered by riding an intense ride; some eventually died within hours of becoming affected.  This could be your case, as I've read about your injury previously.  Frankly, I'm a little confused how you can be "afraid of looking or riding an upsidedown coaster" but "i want to be able to ride another upside down coaster again" can be mentioned in the same explanation.<br>  <br>  My helpful tip: you need a doctor's advice and clearance about riding amusement rides, perhaps even a diagnosis for a medical condition that could be the cause of your problem.  Until you get it, I advise you stay on the park bench before you permanently damage yourself and traumatize the park, other park patrons, and the employees.  Take it from someone who learned the hard way not to ride certain rides because they trigger blackouts and migraines.  It happens, and I deal with it.<br>  <br>  Sorry, it's just really impossible to predict what your body will experience from ride to ride, as g-forces are not evenly distributed per seat, per person.  An overweight person is going to feel positive g's more than a size 2.  A rider with their hands in the air is going to feel more gravitational pull than someone with a tight grip on the grab bars.  A rider with the lap bar pressed into their legs won't feel negative g's as well as the rider with the lap bar halfway up.<br>  <br>  Ride at your own risk.  But don't ignore your instinct.  And for crying out loud, seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY if you choose to ride and become ill.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	they almost dont put any pressure at all. if they do, its on your shoulders, but not much. just remember to have fun.|`|RVMwRuxvaa	Dude, your like that one guy on Discovery Channel who almost got eaten by a shark 3 times but still goes inside shark cages.

iu0vQxR9aa	Personally, I love WW2 for online. Here's the online breakdown.<br>  <br>  Pro's: <br>  *There are new perks such as reconnaissance (which you can see artillery, dogs, and tanks)<br>  <br>  *You have a wider range of guns, such as bolt action (for snipers with scope and for people who like 1 shot kills)<br>  <br>  *Maps are more strategical<br>  <br>  *You die a tiny bit slower<br>  <br>  *You can use a flamethrower(But it isnt really effective)<br>  <br>  *Zombies are fun<br>  <br>  *There are two new game modes (such as war and I forgot the other)<br>  <br>  Con's<br>  <br>  *There is no miracle gun (like the M4 in COD4)<br>  <br>  *Most automatics have bad recoil<br>  <br>  *Guns have smaller clips<br>  <br>  *Tanks are cheap<br>  <br>  *Dogs are annoying (But at least you can prevent being killed by them unlike helicopters)<br>  <br>  *Prestige is not worth it.<br>  <br>  Overall I like the online play. Once you get used to it you get just as good as you were in COD4. As for campaign it was decent. I am not a fan of WW2 campaign modes. But If you get bored on COD4 try solid snake mode. Get a class with UAV jammer, C4, and last stand and run around with a silence USP and pwn people. It takes like 5 games to get used to but I would get like 30 and 4.|`|GiONso7zaa	The multiplayer is really fun but the graphics suck compared to COD4.|`|4gliQ2H9aa	I was obsessed with COD4 and I have to say there is a ton of BS in COD5. (I don't suck I have a 2.25 KD w/30k kills) So that isn't a biased answer.<br>  <br>  Anyway it uses the same exact engine as call of duty 4 so the only differences are maps, graphics, and guns. Other than that it's pretty much identical because treyarch are lazy pieces of crap. I'd say just keep playing COD4 and buy Modern Warfare 2 when it comes out. It'll be a lot easier to adjust to MW2 from COD4 anyway.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah to give you an example of what's the same...literally everything. Most of the same type of perks like UAV jammer = camoflauge, bouncing betty's are claymores, iron lungs, extreme condt., they hardly added anything.<br>  Even the challenges are identical with only a few added ones.|`|3MuepdWzaa	It's awesome get it I have it and most part of this game is Nazi zombies it's bada$$

They are scripted to act like a child and most are interactive.  They attach to your avatar in order to be out and the person holding them has control over them.<br>  <br>  2.  Create an avatar and make it a child.  You can get body shapes resembling a child and act like a child.  <br>  <br>  Some people do nothing but roleplay kids and families and some people despise it and the people that do it.<br>  <br>  Oh and if you roleplay a child, make sure to always stay PG as if you dont and someone reports you, they will ban your computer from Second Life.|`|8SPKsHozaa	have you seen any kids on second life before?this might answer your question

UPHf7kgbaa	It sounds like your DM is boxing you in (a good DM should never say you "can't" do something, like fight monsters - a staple of D&D).  Still, your DM might be wanting you to take some time to roleplay your way.  I'm assuming you're a caster of some sort based on having alot of spells.<br>  <br>  1.  Are you in a city, village, hamlet?  Look at the PHB and even the DMG.  Boy, spells, scrolls, and even potions are expensive to buy.  But play your cards right and you could be the one selling them...<br>  <br>  2.  Develop contacts.  Do ad stunts in the market with use of illusions.  Surely someone around town could use your skills.  Are there adventurers who kill monsters coming back with treasure that needs to be identified?  You're their guy...for a fee.<br>  <br>  3.  Any ranks in profession?  If worse comes to worse, you could sign up for the town guard, do a few midnight shift rounds, etc.  <br>  <br>  4.  Become an interpreter.  Got the Tongues spell or Comprehend Languages?  Surely, as it is in the real world, deals have to be cut with an interpreter present.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, I hope you can get to the meat and potatoes of D&D and hack your way through a dungeon at some point in your character's career, but if not, good luck!|`|ZJjdur9Waa	Use Major Creation to create a cubic foot of valuable material then use a Permanancy spell on that. Keep in mind that Permancy costs you XP depending on what your making permanent. <br>  <br>  Note: this will only work if the DM allows it. <br>  <br>  But if you really have all the spells and such why do you need money.
