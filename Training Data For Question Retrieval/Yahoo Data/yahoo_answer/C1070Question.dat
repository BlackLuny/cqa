20090225150753AAZZiAb	Sports;Basketball	Will the Celts Pick Up Marbury?	Yes, he is a team cancer and I think he has a chance of ruining chemistry. He already had a huge fallout with KG. But, there is no denying his talent and Rajon Rondo does have a lot of holes in his game, like the fact is his jumper is near none existent and he is a terrible FT shooter.      Also, I understand in acquiring Mikki Moore. Not that he is better than what Brown gave em. But, he an upgrade from O'Bryant. Why not go after Antoine Walker as well. He can be a very good scorer off the bench and is heads and shoulders better than Scalabrine and can still be a double digit scorer off the bench. He has good chemistry w/ Paul Pierce and maybe he can ease any future tensions Pierce and KG may have w/ Marbury.      Drop either Giddens or Walker to accommodate a roster spot for Antoine and regulate Scalabrine to the IA.      PG. STEPHON MARBURY - Even though he a head case is better in every aspect than Rondo is. But, maybe they keep Rondo as a starter to keep the peace.       SG. RAY ALLEN    SF. PAUL PIERCE    PF. KEVIN GARNETT    C. KENDRICK PERKINS    6. --------Rondo (or) Marbury    7. Eddie House    8. Tony Allen    9. Antoine Walker   10. Leon Powe   11. Glen Davis   12. Mikki Moore   IA:   13.

20090128191022AA9ZkAd	Sports;Basketball	**** Yes: Who is Witnessing the Knicks?	With this win over Atlanta we continue to streak @ MSG and are 3 wins away from equaling our win total from last season. At this rate, we will win 40-43 games and become a playoff team for the first time since 2004 and have possibly have a winning record for the first time since 2001.      Another important undertaking in this game as well is it was against a good athletic team in Atlanta and pencil in another double double for David Lee. Who finished w/ 17 points and15 rebounds. He currently is the NBA leader in double doubles slightly ahead of DH12 and in the last 10 games has posted 23+ PPG, 13+ RPG, and shooting 60% from the field.      For, the year he is currently 4th in FG% and RPG. He also puts up 15.7 PPG and 11.5 RPG all doing this with only shooting 10 FGA's is incredible. Anyways, Go Knicks and this win was much needed as well as Houston and Phoenix because next week we have the Lakers, Cavs, Celtics, and Blazers - whom we played well against this year.

20090128191434AAww9X2	Sports;Basketball	The Atlanta Hawks...What's with them?	I'm seriously going into a sport fanatics-depression right now. The Hawks lost to the Knicks and are currently on a 3 game losing streak. The Hawks next game is New Jersey which I predict that it will be a bad lose for the Hawks, only because we are 0-3 against them. Joe and Mike are playing like they're 40 and Josh Smith's free throw percentage tonight was worse than they're terrible three point percentage. (2-10 for free throws of Josh Smith). I'm sorry to the Hawks for speaking badly on them but Miami is .5 games behind and they are on fire. Hawks might not get homecourt advantage.    SO WHAT'S WITH THE HAWKS PROBLEM?    My Opinion : Joe and Mike are being overused in minutes per game and the Hawks 3 point % and free throws MUST improve GREATLY.

I am about 5' 2" and weigh approximately 105 pounds. I talked to the cheer captain and she is about my size too although she may be like 5 pounds heavier and half an inch shorter. She's a base. I want to be a flyer. I probably will be a base, but being flyer would be so great. For middle schoolers, what stunts do you normally do? I know it varies from school to school, but my school isn't competitive, its just for the football team. The captain (the girl I just talked about-her name is Mikayla) said that the squad also has front and back walkovers and handsprings along with 2 girls that can do fulls. She didn't mention what stunts they do, but according to those tumbling stuff, what would you say would match up with stunts? Also, I know that being a flyer has to do with major tightness in the air. I've only been in the air once before and I didn't try anything other than a heel stretch. I did that ok. So do you think I should be a flyer?

Yet Baresi wins comfortably away with 10 men.  Hmm...I say make Baresi the permanent coach of Inter.

And it's getting way to boring. I mean, this storyline has been going on for many months and they haven't end this V & E storyline? That's why Smackdown rating are falling down because they keep on repeating the same old storyline and it's getting way too old and boring. I hope they better change this storyline and end this Vickie and Edge storyline. (Soon if Christian Cage comes back). But if they don't end this storyline? And if they keep on repeating same old Vickie and Edge storyline or if Smackdown rating goes down to 1.3 because of V & E? Then I say they need to fired the head writer or the creative for screwing up smackdown with this V & E storyline. You don't have to agree with me if you don't want too. But I'm just telling you guys, why the Vickie and Edge storyline are getting boring.

20090128195315AAeVWPK	Sports;Basketball	Sport Injury on the top of the foot?	About two weeks ago at a basketball game, I noticed that my foot was hurting. It was just vaguely hurt from then on, if a ran or had another game. I do remember a girl stepping on my foot, but I don't know if that is the cause. About three days ago it really started hurting. I can't even walk on it, but I know it's the same injury because it hurts in the same place. It's a little bit swelled. It hurts very badly, and when I touch it, it sends a pain through my foot. When I do try to walk on it, it pops, and it feels tight, aside from the bad pain. I'm not asking for medical advice, but I would like to know if this has happened to you or someone you know and, if so, what it turned out to be. I'm going to the doctor like tomorrow, but I want some sort of idea as to what it might be. Thank you so much. :)
