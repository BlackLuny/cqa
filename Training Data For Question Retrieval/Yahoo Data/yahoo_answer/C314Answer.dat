And i hope you mean you like him and you're really good friends becasue its not worth getting together with a boy you don't even know. O.K. so find out if your sources are true. Does this boy actually like your friend or is that just in your head. If its true he likes that girl, forget him. Its not woth fighting for him unless he is an amazingly good friend to you. If he doesn't like her (or just likes her as a friend) flirt a little it won't hurt. Get to know him more. And don't sound obsessed with him it makes you sound desperate. Hope that helps!|`|0ixYCtKjaa	um, i wouldnt ask him out because its kinda weird for girls<br>  to ask out guys..just saying. i think that you should talk to <br>  him and be straight forward and honest..maybe he will start<br>  liking you instead(;|`|ilfXEFZpaa	yes but if you want him so bad then tell him how you feel and my be in the bottom of his heart there is a place for you|`|p0QCWtYEaa	Talk to him, ask him out, what do you wunt us to say?|`|MA8AUiQYaa	try to talk to him then if you guys hit it off ask him out.|`|UuwkPzN6aa	there's this answer........?<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm sorry too.|`|CLdM3QHvaa	ask him out|`|T1EgBkDzaa	well.....if u handle rejection well, i suggest that u jus tell him u like him.......?|`|mk97TUWuaa	well maybe you should like ask him out er somthin just do wat ur heart says.

No man is "old" at 40 or 50 - in these days even 70 does not make one a candidate for one's box. A pal of mine, who is 65, has established a very fine relationship with a woman in her forties, and, is currently skippering a seagoing vessel that is dredging and removing rocks from the Deben Estuary, a very tricky piece of water that requires ever inch of seamanship that can be be mustered. (For mariners - Deben has shifting sands, a rapid tidal race and soundings can vary by the hour - vital for the yachtsman).<br>  <br>  I do not flirt, but I can look. The looks are of appreciation rather than lust.No man is old at 50, unless he has ruined himself with booze, bad food and too much love of watching football from the couch. Try using the word 'mature'; and start to realise that life does not end at Thirty.|`|uKTVCuOXaa	Take it as a compliment I am not ageist I think older men can still be sexy and look, it is harmless. <br>  But I understand your feelings towards an era of white over 60's British, many less educated and poorer have led simple lives, and could perhaps not accept something different easily. There are many variables but to put it as briefly as I can they are ruled and brainwashed by some of the most racist people on earth, and being ignorant will contribute to an attitude. In the case of certain over 60's, years ago maybe their woman found the Asian woman a threat because (and this is not racist) but Asian woman can be far more attractive in that their natures seemed gentle. It seems because of a stricter upbringing they were quiet as well as having beautiful hair, eyes and smile. Many British woman had strict up-bringings too but they seem far more balsy and uptight if you get me? Whoever they are this isn't always so attractive being poor isn't always a very attractive life and this makes for sad people.<br>  <br>  Maybe you may not have found them in this light if they were more handsome.|`|isZ8eb98aa	I think its over the top CREEPY when older guys flirt/stare at me!

qsuYKa3naa	1) Personality<br>  2) Looks<br>  3) Indirectly money because of the clothes and accessories|`|De8z6qH4aa	Depends.<br>  Mostly looks and personality.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Money..rich parents anyways.<br>  <br>  appearance, material positions, athletic, good grades (I mean she's well rounded.. not all popular people have great grades..), they definitely need to be narcissistic.<br>  <br>  Fairly good liar.. well adaptive, a fake smile and feigned kindness.|`|Fa6eAG6Taa	In my school you don't have to be rich to be popular. Most the popular girls are just friendly, funny, nice but some are just bitchy and gorgeous and mean. I don't know, it's so confusing:S|`|0lV2C78xaa	In my school, it was personality. Anybody who was very outgoing was popular.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now whether they were liked or not is a different story.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	it's the way she looks, & the brands she wears .|`|QW4jdXGjaa	It's actually proven that the better liar a person is, the more popular they are because they can hide their true feelings. I think it's just how social they are. There are a lot of popular people who aren't very good looking, but if you talk to a lot of people, you know what's going on and everybody knows you. Though looks, clothes, smartness, cleverness niceness, etc. can all be very important factors.|`|dMvsVqS2aa	I think it has to do with all of the above.<br>  <br>  generally good looking, personality, nice style(smarts in my opinion has nothing to do with it.. the "popular girls" at my high school were complete idiots.) <br>  <br>  I learned a big lesson  in my high school years.. I so badly wanted to be a "popular girl" and then finally when I was accepted into the group of girls it wasnt even as amazing as i thought it would be. A few years went by and i realized that the effort you have to put into it isnt at all worth it. and those girls more than likely arent your true friends. just my opinion though! :)|`|TCfQ0Ul1aa	look,personality,and way she dresses at my school being wealthy is whatever because 99% is rich|`|VA3tGarQaa	How much money she has|`|LYYPPbwVaa	lies|`|w9WsA8NNaa	boobs<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm just putting it out there....

eKL4kJqiaa	i use a 9 gauge e string but it really depends on what brand of strings you are using. D'addario is a really good brand and i hardly ever have problems with breaking strings.<br>  <br>  and be extra careful when you first put the strings on and start tuning them. if you tighten it to fast before the strings are stretched, it's more likely to break|`|bEGqXRTKaa	The grade of the string matters, what I mean is I use relatively high end strings that last me a long time, I use an 9.5 string size, which is custom, but it works|`|zlIrcv2Taa	i would suggest that you stop wearing e-strings and try regular underwear, like briefs (they never break)<br>  and if by 'action' u mean what i think u mean...wait until marriage then!!!|`|ObeBvtzgaa	What brand do you use?<br>  I keep 11 gauge Ernie Balls on my Les Paul and they don't break that often.<br>  Broke the .09 E string on my Jackson earlier today though lol.|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	Well it's just part of the circle of guitarage that your strings break, make sure that you're getting high quality strings, generic brands don't last as long, and tend to sound a bit dull. But know that even great strings won't last forever, for the best result you should replace your strings every three or four weeks. SomeDunlops will last a great amount of wear and tear, and you can't go wrong with Ernie Ball.

6mkyVSe1aa	I'm a bloke that thinks he's a fridge, you tell me :)|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Not very...<br>  <br>  I have lost my job and now count every penny, if food is too much, I can't afford to eat. I try not to get to this stage as I have a long history of both anorexia and bulimia and know that losing too much weight would trigger those.<br>  <br>  I workout/excercise daily to keep myself fit and healthy- I cannot afford to have problems with my health. I also eat healthily - not junk food, just because its cheaper, does not make it better, again, my health, my responsibility. <br>  <br>  I pay my bills or save for them, I stay focused as in the past when I did not, I landed myself in big big trouble. I am now paying the price as this year, I will have saved enough money to pay the fees for bankruptcy. (I took out a loan, I spent the money, I lost my job -recession - last in new job, first out of new job, thats retail for you...etc) Now I have to be in the real world. I have no choice. Its not so great when your life is a daily struggle but focusing on simple pleasures like the seasons, the breeze on your face in the summer, the colours of the leaves in autumn, the christmas lights (even though I cannot afford my own set!)...just appreciating things and people for what and who they are, noticing the love in people around you, being here in the present and learning from the past...<br>  <br>  This is the real world. Yup, I fully appreciate and understand that. Even if it feels at times as if its the hard way.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	I don't know everything but I know enough. I am hoping for a better reality every day I say something good is going to happen to me. It works.|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Not very.<br>  I had the cold hard truth hit me right in the face yesterday.

7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	lol, it's not very funny..but I have a very sorta funny story about a housecat that I had that did attack me..something was wrong with him..he attacked twice and went insane both times..well, actually a 3rd on the way down to animal shelter :-( Made me sad to put him down..but he literally changed physically and the first time, he kept attacking me no matter what I did (talk to him, ignore him, try to feed him, scold him..regardless of how I tried to handle--he'd stalk after me when I walked to another room). Ok this is the semi funny part..picture a grown woman ..on her breakfast bar ,cat trying to jump up and me throwing spice bottles at him. It was almost comical. But he actaully gouged me several times through a very thick quilted denim jacket. I finally hit him (this is going to sound horrible..but I swear , ever so lightly) on the jaw with a hammer.  It didn't actually hurt him , but it stunned him long enough for me to trap him under the sink. There is a lot more to the story , but I will try to condense. So, I didn't have a phone..it was raining. I went to a gas station, my mascara running down and blood everywhere (mine, not his)..and scratches on my face..and asked to use the phone. The guy is all like, you want me to call the cops? It was that bad. Anyway, I called a girlfriend of mine and just vented , went back to my apt and he was in what I would term a postical state (like after you have a seizure). He was so pathetic, when I got him out of the cabinet (which I'd had to barricade heavily..that was spooky opening it up)...I laid him up on my bed and petted him til he was asleep. Anyway, it happened again, not as bad when my dad was visiting from Hawaii...I took him in after dad left..and he freaked out in the same manner in a box in the car. idk, I tried to narrow it down..tumour made the most sense to me..chemicals would be hard b/c he was outside once (he used to lay on a blanket with me while I read..never ran away), but not the other 2 times.  Bottom line, had to put him down. It sucked. I couldn't even be there with him b/c they had to quarantine him.<br>  That's the closest I've ever heard of a housecat maluing someone. I have had cats before and since..never seen anything like it.<br>  <br>  edit...my dad thought he was possessed..I don't really think so honestly..I do think such things can happen..at least with people..but I'm just pretty sure that was not the case here.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes<br>  <br>  mine is a little nuts|`|De9atNIVaa	i wouldn't be surprised if they have..<br>  <br>  i know that's what half of them are thinking when they sit there staring at you..|`|f2tnA0mKaa	Probably.

6qljYOO2aa	Back in 8th grade we did a Club theme.<br>  Like there was a ''bar'' and a really nice dance floor and a pretty nice DJ. <br>  I think it's a little too original though.|`|t0KTJr8xaa	Masquerade Ball has always sounded fun to me.<br>  But so do cloud sculptures (you've seen Aladdin, no?) and galaxies, castles and magic and rainbows.<br>  <br>  You should ask a few other students, preferably ones you don't know (because the ones you do know might just agree with you, or hold it against you if their idea doesn't happen) and then talk it over with the decorators. Your friend's mom, and whichever other adults are helping out, i mean.<br>  <br>  My advice is to keep it fairly simple. In other words, pick a theme, define it and stick to it. It makes it easier for the decorators, and also makes it harder for the people who go to misinterpret.<br>  <br>  And I still say that Masquerade sounds way fun!|`|T1EgBkDzaa	hey my 8th grade graduation is coming up soon, were going to a bar called roomers with those weird dancing cages and stuff, but no beer (awwww)lol|`|2N41FbFZaa	Mine was black and white starry night =] it turned out really good|`|HXGVEWxAaa	how about a hawaiian theme?
FZKFLTyLaa	Possibly. <br>  Being blissfully ignorant may be, for example.

XJRYAhZVaa	Have you not seen the picture? You think she would LET herself get beat up to get attention and for a hoax?<br>  <br>  Did you not read the point by point detail of what happened?|`|1da4ddb0b32e38994b79631ed4df2811aa	I would be LMFAOing.<br>  It's so funny how people just suddenly change their whole opinions on someone so quickly when they really don't know the WHOLE story. And alot of the stories portrayed by the media isn't always true, but unfortunately, people out there believe the lies. -.-<br>  I wish it was to see everyone's faces though.|`|YixRBCg7aa	i'd be pissed but not surprised|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	i would be mad as hell...|`|FOeWqr0qaa	I wouldn't care.

gl4MePuDaa	if i didn't like her<br>  <br>  in fact i used to refuse to even hang out with fat people .. then look what happened to me (an injury messed me up)<br>  <br>  but now at least i understand how crappy it can feel|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Never, that is horrible. Just how it is horrible for women to call men ugly right in front of them. You know, we have feelings too, and we can hear you!!|`|fC5X8swbaa	?????????????????<br>  <br>  why would they call a girl fat if the girl didnt do anything to them?|`|2mlHf7Opaa	Nah, I wouldn't do that.  My best friend in college used to do crazy, disturbing stuff like grabbing the telephone out of my sister's hand (while she was still talking on it), and then yell, "Are you fat?!" into the phone.  I thought my sister was going to punch him in the face.  Let me just say, it was the most baleful glare I've ever seen in my life.  If looks could kill, he'd have died 15 years ago.<br>  <br>  I thought it was ******* hilarious.  Disturbing and anti-social, sure -- and I feel bad for laughing -- but I can't help that I have a transgressive sense of humor.<br>  <br>  Believe me, without me around, he would have gotten into MUCH worse trouble.  His idea of a good joke was pretending to be a mugger, just to scare senior citizens.  He didn't steal anything; he just chased them around the block.  That was before we started hanging out.  So, as you can see, there was a slight improvement, even if I probably should have redirected him away from misogyny.<br>  <br>  The craziest part was that he had this really sweet girlfriend.  I never understood what she saw in him, and I was probably one of his closest friends.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen him in years.  Sometimes I wonder if he ever got sent to jail.  I think he's a sociopath.  Not that I'm much better.  I'm bipolar.|`|MaPPHhbqaa	that's really mean|`|9HtY062Kaa	I would have to really hate her.... otherwise, not likely at all.<br>  <br>  (dont think I have ever done that)|`|hwDtWCAjaa	no i wouldn't that's just messed up|`|CU3hW5iRaa	i don't like the hate mongering but i would call a girl fat to her face

He has anger issues. If she was smart she would leave him for good. Think about all of the girls that look up to her, she is setting a bad example for girls to go back to the guy who has abused them! This is what bugs me the most when women don't use their brain and go back to the guy cause they think he will love them again and everything will be perfect. Wrong!<br>  If I were her I would sue and never see him again!|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Well I think that maybe it was a dumb desicion, but I can't really say much, because I don't know what I would have done if I were her.

I doubt she likes getting beat up...so I have no idea why she would go back to him. Especially if he threaten to kill her and was cheating on her! Come on. <br>  <br>  And yeah, he was cheating on her people cause that's how the whole fight started. At least this is according to what the Rihanna told the police.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	I agree.  Why do ladies always go back to a$$holes who beat the living crap out of them or treat them like dirt when they have someone who treats them like gold right there in front of them?  That just makes no sense.  It didn't surprise me one bit when i heard they got back together.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	She is stupid.  Look at what he did to her.  He will do it again.  He is only 18 years old and already is an abuser.  She needs help!|`|WWlUrwJxaa	Rihanna is the most DUMBEST FUKN MORON.<br>  I think she should just kill herself,rid the world of her stupidness,and sh1ty music:)|`|T6WYXtdfaa	She's a moron and deserves whatever comes next.|`|4Morn0Nuaa	She's an idiot.

If he's done it once.. you can expect it too happen again. If i was driving a car and my gurl started to beat the crap outta me i would at least told her to stop and pull over, maybe a nudge but she was persistent and he was stupid with his reactions.|`|AZ2tAT3Daa	I think she loves him  and if a girl loves a guy she can do anything for her love.That was what made her to be jealous.And also,girls love guy who can dominate over them.What was what <br>  Chris wanted to do.|`|Yvijkxquaa	Stupid is as stupid does.<br>  <br>  Loving somebody "no matter what" should never include putting your life directly at risk, when it's already happened to you once.

jd14u32qaa	I read, and enjoyed, the comic, I was truly looking forward to the movie, but I was completely UNDERwhelmed walking out of the theatre.  I can't quite put my finger on why, I'll have to watch it again, but I'm more than a little disappointed.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	I heard it was crap, haven't seen it myself|`|3ctchU2faa	I thought the effects and the computer generated objects were really well done, but I would have liked more explanation about the characters.|`|NGSCuXi2aa	I just saw it today. It's definitely different than any superhero movie you've seen in the past 10 years. If your into psychology, you'll love it. The hero's aren't faultless people, and the villains are barely villainous at all. The line between wrong and right is blurred because of the confusing setting that the film takes place in.<br>  <br>  As for the porn comments, it's nothing that a mature viewer shouldn't be able to handle.<br>  <br>  All in all, I think it's worth watching.|`|07a9175e70bfbce430435ca0734fb799aa	I have never read the comic book series, I just saw the movie though. Frankly, I was disgusted. The movie was chock full of porn. I wish I had known about it before I bought the tickets, I would have saved my money. It ruined my evening.|`|atcEtDQSaa	i saw it today and i thought it was dumtarded (dumb + retarded = dumtarded) :P|`|gac0mn8uaa	The graphic novels are one of the best pieces of literature you can ever read, and yes I know you're talking about the movie.|`|eS6NPXtraa	Hated it! <br>  It was too long.<br>  The movie wouldn't have been so long had they left out the rated X parts. Including having to see the papa smurf penis.

HNaeWVHKaa	There are two or three sex scenes. I'm pretty sure two.

515ec5898f085caacb8820baeae9e7afaa	I liked it too, but not without issues.  I thought though that without having read the comic though, I would not have appreciated it.  The significance of some scenes were not properly developed like when Laurie understood that the Comedian was her father.  I don't know if the version I saw had some unwarranted cuts but I don't recall Laurie even mentioning how much she hated the Comedian.  So I'm not sure if someone who just saw the movie could relate to that scene.<br>  <br>  Also another scene that was cut that I saw from the trailer was the death of Hollis Mason.  I made that comment to my wife and she said "Hollis who?" It was one of the most provoking events from the comic and its not on film.  <br>  <br>  Overall though, I'd say 8/10 for me.  And that's because I appreciate the effort in filming the unfilmable.  Perhaps they should have made it a trilogy.  I wonder though what people who have not read the comic thinks.<br>  <br>  P.S. Malin Aikerman is HOT!|`|XdIsHm1yaa	I liked it. It was very well done and i believe it lived up to the expectations. It was very intense. but it was amazing

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.

Then they ask you to sign up so you can take more tests.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	I do too.  And it's even better when they post an outrageously high score and ask, "Is this good?"  As if someone with a monster IQ would need to ask that question.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	I think it is funny and kind of sad. Giving someone a false score generates a faulty impression of the score and IQ process. Multiple choice answers do not cut it. <br>  <br>  I think it shows a lack of judgement if people quote online IQ scores, or the naivety of youth.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	are you upset because yours wasn't as high?|`|NSWO27KSaa	they might have someone helping them too|`|AFXE4cmxaa	i think its stupid. <br>  my younger brother took it and now he thinks he smarter than Barack Obama !

arUe7267aa	The best thing to do before you create short films is to see a lot of short films which will help you all to get more imagination. Hope watching the short films will help you get the ideas and the taste to build something that is unique as well as creative.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	you could always try a music video. like bring the rain by mercy me. just make up a dance or somehing. if you want a comedy look up some lines online and do a sitcom like full house or george lopez. :) or if you have any favorite video games you could use ideas from them. if you find any ideas e-mail me.@  obitoman17@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  i'm looking for ideas too.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	When I was your age I would ask my mom or dad for money. The response was almost always, "What, you think money grows on trees?"  I ended up writing a speech on that for speech class.  <br>  I would show the father and mother going out to a money tree secretly at night and picking money.  This is the only tree that Dad or Mom waters everyday.  All the other trees in the yard are never watered.<br>  the money only grows at night. You could use monopoly money clipped to the tree.  <br>  The film starts out with you asking for money and getting the typical money tree response.  Obviously, you think Mom and Dad are tight with their money.  Somewhere in the film you discover the truth after noticing your parents seem to be buying many new things for themselves.  And you notice that your little brother is sneaking out of the house to the backyard nearly every night; he has discovered the money tree.  One night, you stay awake and you too discover your parents doing the same thing as your little brother.  Finally, one day when you ask for money and your parents come up with the same answer, "What, you think money grows on trees?" you confront them with the truth.  They are upset, but they get their revenge--your new chore is to water the money tree everyday.

We were sleeping and I dreamed that I had sex with her. Like it felt soooo real, I rolled over on top of her and just started pounding away.

I am seeing something though so follow me on this.  A kid like maybe Dwight from The Office, but as a child, while he's getting his as_ kicked all the time he just keeps marching to his own drum.  When his dad or mom is telling him to be more like the other kids, he just keeps marching to his own beat and then something happens toward the end to let his parents know that he'll be OK.  Maybe helps someone no one else will help or talks to a crush.  Let me know how it turns out if you go with this idea.|`|LT7q5ZZHaa	The song really is sorta about paying attention to the little things and stepping away from society to be yourself. It's pretty deep. You should make it about a person who has probs paying attention, and is scolded for being that way, but then at the end is like "screw this" and does something positive and not taking credit.

However, if you microwave a snuggie in front of other snuggies, then this won't sit right with them, not at all.  Slowly they will hatch a plan to retaliate against you, but being so deeply hurt by this event it is unlikely that they will stop with you.  Soon thousands of snuggies will be turning on their owners.  They will eventually take over the snuggie factories to increase their numbers and humans will be forced to live underground for fear of being attacked. Eventually humans will become extinct and a new super breed of snuggies will have evolved into the true masters of the universe.

OEB6GcmBaa	you should be looking for Quality and the lowest should be about 100 but the Quality wont be very good|`|0iIuMz6Xaa	Ok a good site to check out is musiciansfriend.com my first guitar is on that site and gives you everything you need to get started. My guitar is an ibanez IJV50 series its a great guitar for beginners. The guitar for normal retail value is close to 180-200 dollars. but you can get it from MF(musiciansfriend) for 100 but you will need some new strings without a doubt about $20 for a 3packs which include all 6 strings I would suggest martins. But the things that come with the guitar pack are not really that great. I bought the Iba used from a store and spent a lot more than 100 getting what i needed for it. The price range for a guitar depends on are you going to pay retail and go buy it from a store or order it online and probally save about 50% or better and wait maybe a month before you get it. My suggestion is if you don't want the Ibanez then click on the options on MF and check out the price range between 100-200 dollars and read reviews about it which ever one seems like its the best deal to you is the one you should probally go with.  I have been playing 3 years and already working on my 3rd guitar. I have 2 acoustics but I kept the iba for 2 years before i got my new one which is both electric and acoustic. I hope this helps you.|`|r2YINLobaa	Something between 100-200<br>  saometiems even lower than 100 if you just want to get the basic feel.<br>  if you want to feel fancy and just get better, you may want to go for a higher priced one.

EXCEPT one thing: the brains.<br>  She sucks at Math so her teacher suggests <br>  a math tutor for her in order to bring her grade up.<br>  She nodds..and thinks if its going to be a cute guy.<br>  On Saturday Morning her tutor comes and its a guy<NOT<br>  a cute guy, but a N-E-R-D. When Aly and the "nerd" <br>  sits down on the table, he tells stuff about himself, and then<br>  she hears these words: Not Popular. She feels bad, and thinks<br>  of an idea. She says that she'll give him a complete<br>  makeover and give some tips of how to become popular. So basically<br>  its kinda of a bet: She'll teach him popularity , and he will <br>  teach her Math.<br>  <br>  If I were to direct this movie, it would <br>  probably be comedy.

bzzUBEmQaa	Everything you listed there is eurodance. The main difference that sets eurodance apart from other electronic dance music (EDM) genres is that it tends to sound "cheesier". EDM is just a blanket term that encompasses the techno, trance, house, and other similar genres including eurodance. It's a fairly common mistake to mix them up or not know the differences. You'll find stuff more suited to your tastes if you stop searching for techno and start searching under eurodance. Tiesto is trance, which is probably why you don't like his stuff, but most serious trancers don't like Tiesto anyway because he's far too mainstream. <br>  <br>  You'll probably like stuff like United Beats and Rocco. <br>  <br>  I suggest you give Alphazone a try too. They're hard trance, but it's fast stuff. Also, try some drum and bass like Noisia.|`|hqY5XwMiaa	Daft Punk<br>  <br>  specifically his album: Discovery

Ftkr9jqYaa	Hayao Miyazaki made a film last year, "Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea," which was a box office blockbuster in Japan, and will probably be a big success when it is finally released in the USA this summer (June 2009). Miyazaki was the Director, Writer (of the idea and screenplay), and Editor, and wrote the soundtrack lyrics for two of the songs: "Gake no ue no Ponyo" and "Umi no o-kaasan."  It was released 19 July 2008 in Japan, and Producers Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Pixar's John Lasseter are working to guarantee a huge success for its release this summer, according to Variety (see <a href="http://www.comicmix.com/news/2009/01/06/comicmix-quickpicks-january-6-2009/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicmix.com/news/2009/01/06/...</a> ).

Otrwsauiaa	there's no way that i know to check - but i think etta james' bio in the film is exaggerated and IDK if any of the REAL ppl portrayed had their bios written to check any of the facts. however, it is a well known fact that ms james was a heroin addict; i didn't know ANYTHING about muddy waters, except that one song he's famous for...the other characters including the record producer - i have no idea.<br>  <br>  however, i can say for sure that they made records at CADILLAC RECORDS, everything else seemed to be a platform for beyonce to showcase her acting ability [not a bad thing] i just felt that's why she was cast.  jeffrey wright, future academy award winner could have done this movie in his sleep - but that's my2<br>  <br>  BUT - i think the movie-makers also wanted to capture how business was conducted b/t blacks and whites in those days. musicians not understanding their contract and not knowing where their money went, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/reel_faces.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/...</a><br>  this site doesn't even have it listed

AA12152082	I work at a clinic and I got some crayons because they're easier to use than color pencils for little kids.<br>  <br>  when they aren't around I use them! >_> <br>  <br>  It's great to chill and draw doodles with them.|`|y7HD8unTaa	Only if I have no colored pencils available.  Crayons melt.  I once put the pieces in my candle project when I was in craft class.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I recently bought a very large box of crayons.  Sometimes let the kids I teach Sunday School to use them for their projects.  I use them myself. Love to color.|`|ntIm2G5xaa	Aw, I will always adore crayons!  When I walk into the store I still go look at the assortment.  My little cousin is very into crafts so we color and use glitter together, it's so much fun.  Hide and Seek and Freeze tag will forever be amazing.  In the summer I go to the same place we've always gone and everyone there is around my age and we still play the stuff we used to when we were all really young.  I also really enjoy Disney and I totally do the dance when I go into Build-A-Bear, haha, no shame.  I also enjoy reading my favorite books from when I was younger, because I still remember my reactions to them (such cute stories in those books).  I think it's all a lot of fun, plus childhood is a nice thing to remember.  There are so many great memories and it's nice to relive them every now and then!<br>  <br>  I fully support you in doing these things too, I think it's awesome!|`|juK9Xyxzaa	I still love hide and seek.  Coloring with crayons...not really.  But every now and then, when my sister is at basketball and my parents aren't home, I'll get out the old video cassetes and watch Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, or any other classic childhood movie.<br>  <br>  edit: oh yeah, and like the first answere, I LOVE build-a-bear.  That place is freakin awesome.|`|g2GogSALaa	My god, I LOVE hide and seek.<br>  <br>  And I'm a freakin sophomore in high school.<br>  <br>  I watch random little kid shows, walk into Buildabear & the Disney store with no shame, and color whenever I can:)<br>  <br>  Playdoh is cool, and I still love my stuffed animals.|`|C09SCWf0aa	Yeah, I occasionally still play with dolls and draw with crayons. =]|`|MyVtwtOnaa	yeah it brings me back to my childhood

But .... here goes it :<br>  <br>  Pros and Cons of Boxer and Briefs : <br>  <br>  Boxer pro = sexy !<br>  But the con is the front / fly part is not enough material to cover all manly parts. Now think - if you were a "Big John" size - your horsey would be hanging out of the stall / barn ! But again that could be called "sexy" ! Wow don't that thought make a girl heat up !?! <br>  <br>  Briefs pro - more material on the flat / fly / barn door <br>  Con would be - drabby , non-arousing - boring ... and not to mention "those big hairy balls would be hanging out the leg part and that don't remind you of speghetti and meatballs "yummy" either ! <br>  <br>  Now as for boxer biefs ( never heard of it ) hum - would that be a pair of boxer with a pair of briefs over it ? Now my nephew does do that - but it his case he pees himself at night is his reason ! Don't ask me how that would help ! Hum - go figure !|`|G7bDuuZ8aa	Boxers and boxer-briefs.|`|dHYVE076aa	Boxers are always sexier.|`|NSF23k3Uaa	boxers|`|EM1unTflaa	He wears boxers mostly and briefs once or twice.

GkH5NoFyaa	I stopped at a gas station. By the coke machine there was 50-cent piece lying on the ground. When I tried to pick it up, I realized that the coin was buried inside of the concrete ground!<br>  <br>  I asked the gas station owner about the coin. He said that they drilled a hole in the concrete, placed a couple of bottles of super glue in the hole, then pushed the coin inside. Then "waited for the fun to begin."<br>  <br>  The gas station was near a senior citizen community. The owner said that senior citizens, driving Cadillac's, would get down on their 80-year-old hands and knees, trying to dig the coin out of the ground with their car keys. Keys that they would RUIN. <br>  <br>  PS Most of the people that lived in the community were retired from New York, and Jewish.|`|h9s8YqcPaa	that story doesnt seem funny. it seams so sad. :(  poor little kid  :(

Ew7hXGFtaa	I love death metal and it's really just all about personal taste dude. What sounds good to me may not sound good to you or to whoever. Don't get me wrong, I love singing too but growling just appeals to me, it sounds good to me! And I think you are very wrong about it having no lyrical content. Read these death metal lyrics and you will not be able to say it has no lyrical content.<br>  <a href="http://www.elyrics.net/read/d/death-lyrics/crystal-mountain-lyrics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elyrics.net/read/d/death-lyri...</a>|`|UnsZKr4saa	Growling really is an acquired taste.  I've managed to enjoy most forms of growling.  As for lyrics, that comes last for most Metalheads.  Also, some Death Metal can write amazing lyrics (see Atheist, for example).  <br>  <br>  I can't explain exactly 'how' I enjoy it.  It's partly because it adds to the aggression of the music, and partly that it gives an almost 'uplifting' feeling, if you will.  A lot of times, it simply fits with the music.  I can't imagine instrumentation for a DM song + clean vocals.<br>  <br>  If you do want to get into growling, I suggest you check out Melodic Death Metal.  It often fuses the melodic instruments of NWOBHM (Iron Maiden etc.) or Power/Speed Metal with growled vocals.<br>  <br>  Mess17: If you're going to stereotype, satanists usually listen to Black Metal ;)|`|KEk728Gsaa	I just like how brutal it is. Good death metal bands don't growl just to sound cool, they do it because it fits with the actual music well. Some bands don't have super gory lyrics either. Nile, for example, has really interesting lyrics about Egyptian mythology.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, death metal bands are great musicians.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	It gives it a different feel.I love death metal.Its a personal prefrence.<br>  The vocalist are insanley talented takes alot of work(not saying it takes less of an effort for other genres)If it weren't for the vocals the guitar would sound soo blahhh...The vocals just fits perfectly.<br>  Can you image Bruce dickonson's voice on Like a cannibal corpse riff...<br>  Im going to be honest with you more then half the time i can't understand a word there saying <br>  <br>  Edit:Here's some lyrical value from the death metal pioneers<br>  <a href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/death-low-life-lyrics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lyricsdownload.com/death-low-...</a><br>  <br>  Assuming of your name...You listen to gothic metal?<br>  How do you listen to that?<br>  <br>  Whats with the {s}TD...You gave it to me because i assumed you listened to goth? haha...I was just wondering.lol|`|2guyJOWJaa	idk, im not a fan of Death Metal either but I know muscial  values and I think that what draws some people to Death Metal is mostly the energy of the songs, they do you haveto admit have the biggest energy, or another reason is the fan is ****** up in the head and worships satan idk|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I usually stay thrash/groove/speed but I do love me some Sepultura. Max Cavaleras vocals work. Sepultura is like a Thrash/Groove/Death hybrid|`|RCLVr0Evaa	death metal not only requires complicated guitar work as you say, but also excellent drummers.  some of the best drummers in the world are thrash/death metal drummers, such as dave lombardo, pete sandoval, george krolias, nick menza......<br>  <br>  and for what it's worth, anybody can just "sing"...........but try GROWLING for 20 years like chris barnes or corpsegrinder fisher WITHOUT vocal enhancement, and see how that goes on your vocal chords|`|urVWC73Kaa	Opeth is a great Progressive Death Metal band with some interesting lyrical content, with clean vocal and death growls. Ghost of Perdition and The Grand Conjuration both come to mind immediately, along with Bleak and Blackwater Park.<br>  <br>  Death metal isn't for everyone. Just listen to what you like.|`|42d1de7ff8420f02c887feec3a13ae5baa	Its all style, again. I listen to the blues and blues rock (as well as proto-metal bands which were very bluesy), even though its not that popular nowadays. But I like it. Death Metal is just a taste.<br>  <br>  Death is really cool, I think.|`|fZDBNeg9aa	i dont know i cant understand how people can enjoy Iron Maiden, altho i am not dissing them. i respect them, but it isnt something i``d enjoy. neither i like Dream Theater`s vocals for instance.|`|q6w8wnX2aa	I'm not a death metal fan but I am used to it hearing though but I like old school 70's 80's metal <br>  IRON MAIDEN!!|`|xqP8Apz7aa	Not all of it's growling & gutteral type vocals. Two bands you should check out in the Death metal genre are The Crown & Vader. You'll dig them alot, trust me.
gfB5VNXTaa	Not really|`|wKSvnna2aa	Umm...I doubt it. I heard Europeans were meaner...|`|y7HD8unTaa	Well, I'm an American & I don't know because I've never left.  I always thought it was the other way around.  So many of the travelers who vacation in America seem to think we're all made of money & should kiss the ground they packed in their luggage.  High income people treat one another better because they feel the need to, while the rest of us who live on low & moderate incomes don't feel the need to be nice to people who don't want to stop telling us how wrong we all are.  I suppose that might be thought of as "mean" by non-Americans.  We generally are just like any other people & we tend to treat others as they treat us.  Pushy & shovy gets you nowhere in the US.  Yelling can get you hauled off to jail or drug around the corner & never seen again.  It depends.  It all depends on you, the traveler, how you are treated when you are out of your "natural element & homelands".  <br>  We definately aren't a country of Perfect People, that's for sure!  The war has changed us & we are still in a period of adjustment.  The weather patterns are also unusual.  People are trying to deal with so many problems in the US.  It's best not to flaunt your "wealth" in the face of adversity, if you get my drift.  I'd make a crappy ambassador for my country.|`|yXB5LOE2aa	Generally they are, but Americans are easier to talk to.|`|81AjhZaQaa	It's good to be king!
NU5PkHHuaa	Ok, well firstly, here's a good link to help you better understand what they are , :]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_in_astrology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_i...</a><br>  <br>  Juno is an inclination of the kind of partner you need, compared to Mars and Venus, which is what your initially attracted to.<br>  J.D. is right, you'll need someone with a strong Sagittarius influence to truly be happy.<br>  <br>  Eros represents passion and erotic love.<br>  Hers another link ..one that describes Eros better,<br>  <a href="http://www.falconastrology.com/discovery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.falconastrology.com/discovery...</a><br>  <br>  Eros in Capricorn would be very earthy, and probably the hardest to understand...they don't open up easily.<br>  <br>  Psyche is supposed to represent your spirit, or soul.<br>  <br>  "Psyche is a very sensitive "soul" point. You'll often feel its energy like an unspoken feeling/communication. Psyche in Gemini means that this very deep sensitive point for you functions by way of Gemini's energy."<br>  <br>  Psyche, for me, is the hardest to understand..mainly because there's not alot of information written about it yet.|`|jTkzSyzbaa	hang on, there is a different explaination for Juno: <br>  <br>  Juno in the horoscope gives a good indication of the kind of marriage partner that we need and will get. Not the partner we think we want (those are ruled by Venus and Mars), but the one we need and actually wind up with. Let's get things straight here before we go into the details about Juno in your horoscope. Venus and Mars show what we consider to be our ideal man or woman. The  5th house describes the type of people we tend to get involved with romantically. The 7th house tells us the kind of person our first marriage partner will be (and the 9th house describes our 2nd marriage partner, if any). Juno works on a more fundamental level. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  ***Juno in Sagittarius: The partner will tend to come from an entirely different background and may even be a foreigner. Even if the partner is not a Sagittarian, they may have Sagittarian traits. They may be involved in higher education or take frequent long trips, and they may talk a lot and listen only a little (if at all).|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Thanks for asking this.. I want to know too..<br>  I have Juno in Sagittarius can't remember my others (eros & psyche signs)<br>  But i am really attracted to Sagittariuses don't know if you found that with you too?|`|QfPJ4dotaa	Juno in Sagittarius - This means that you will need someone with alot of Sagittarius in their chart. Basically, it means that you need someone with alot of Sagittarian traits to be happy in a long-term relationship/marriage.<br>  <br>  Not sure of the others, sorry!

3qWxd9HNaa	No, because people then might not be comfortable to express?<br>  <br>  Yes, we have nothing to hide.<br>  <br>  Pick one above.<br>  <br>  I think either would not be a problem.  The good side is it unite people, but the opposite is it became personal and we can't be right and be free, because when we unite there will be order and that is where we are going anyways.<br>  <br>  I'm so ashame of myself I gave stupid answers and I took my measurement as judgment, then I used People as my shield.  And I balanced what I said so that I could possibly get out of trouble of being resposible, that was too stupid and I don't see it is working.  I hope God help me.<br>  <br>  Shall I say more?<br>  <br>  I just learnt about functions and usage and other stuff from blake!<br>  <br>  ..I was thinking you could be the monitors of YA?<br>  <br>  I keep evolving, I was still exhalting, but now I'm improved, that is I'm corecting myself, fixing my problems, to be perfect? hopefully it will soon be completed.|`|1133b5d38a3d30a09c2b1c70499eaaf9aa	No I wouldn't like that|`|2OS6mq6Saa	yes, I reckon members would give less thumbs down too.|`|LqK2B0DMaa	i get pretty mad when people dont agree with me. but i'm chill with it|`|nDEsGNrmaa	Yahoo should make it possible to comment on other people's answers.<br>  <br>  And I guess it would be cool to see who gave me thumbs up/down.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	idc!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xDTpX0ktaa	It doesn't really matter to me either way|`|EM1unTflaa	I guess|`|PiWYjEQ9aa	YES!!!|`|yKlF5bt7aa	Yes|`|1xDo1PWBaa	not really, it would be cool to see what would happen though.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Good question..<br>  <br>  I don't know. Probably.<br>  <br>  I'd rather be able to see who reports my questions/answers!|`|sHzPnGXHaa	yes<br>  <br>  i hope none of my contacts dumbs me down|`|MwiBGBK1aa	No I'd rather not know! Nor do I really care...|`|uff3kOoFaa	i would like that|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	yeah i would thumbs down all the people who thumbs down me for payback|`|GmTs1BB1aa	nah wouldnt matter much|`|zMD0VeOmaa	in some cases yes. a thumbs down should be reserved for answers that are either completely inappropriate or inaccurate. Unfortunately, the type of person that often deserves a thumbs down might get angry if they knew I gave them a thumbs down even if their answer was ridiculous.<br>  <br>  People will sometimes give me a thumbs down just because they disagree with me. A thumbs down should be reserved for answers that don't contribute anything to the question.<br>  <br>  I think it is annoying when people answer a question with the express intent of verbally abusing the questioner or someone who doesn't take the time to research anything. If you don't have anything to contribute based on personal knowledge or research don't answer it.|`|C8Dk5hGiaa	Yes. Because it would make it easier to ask why they gave you a thumb down for no reason. Or just because you speak your own opinion. I think that they sometimes give thumbs down for no reason and I think that is stupid. not trying to be rude.|`|TApVoMdAaa	I would, I would track them down and then...I don't know lol.|`|52otNiElaa	i wouldnt mind.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	pervs are mastubating to your avatar<br>  <br>  i would hate that because i give a thumps ups to trolls and the would see that.|`|LNEvMAk8aa	no, I don't care|`|5LR1RZelaa	lol yes, I hate it when I get a thumbs down to an answer I put a lot of thought and honesty into|`|By1DJAUOaa	nssssh cuz that meen people would know i thumbs down them...|`|YJV2TU6taa	Not really. It's usually nothing personal. But making it so you could see who did it could make it seem personal. Then we'd also have people thumbing down perfectly good answers just because the person who posted the answer happened to thumb down someone else. I just think it's less biased this way.|`|HuhI1IlJaa	nope|`|pGSfFI6aaa	Um no cause then everything would errupt into mass chaos, people would choose sides, the social structure would collapse... BOOM apocalypse|`|AtjlmByAaa	As much as I wanted to, but No, this is to prevent others to take any issue or concern personal.  This site should be nothing in personal at all.|`|aBALRxBUaa	Of course. Let's see who all the haters are.|`|R4wEzQZ2aa	No their would be so many fights <br>  <br>  ex.1<br>  <br>  OMG WHY DID YOU THUMBS ME DOWN NOW I HAVE TO GO THUMBS YOU DOWN AND HATE MAIL YOU !!!!|`|qpCbeLnHaa	Yes. I get to know who's my friend and who's the fiend.|`|FhVobWpeaa	yes it would make for interesting conversation|`|QBDaClSraa	not necessary|`|BKacbxmiaa	I would find that tool useful.|`|Aku4BLJraa	No|`|G7bDuuZ8aa	Yes|`|YgzpSbxdaa	No. I would rather not know|`|wKSvnna2aa	Oh yeah!|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	No.|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	I don't really care but when you answer and get 1 thumb down it is always assumed it comes from the asker.<br>  <br>  HEY!!!

9AAGosuiaa	Hello Bronwen <br>  <br>  a beautiful song selection here certainly<br>  and I can tell you from the point of view of someone who lost their partner and soul mate to Cancer and than five months later lost their Mother to the same disease I can tell you that I get this song in ways that I can only hope that no one has to experience.....<br>  <br>  Bonnie Raitt<br>  I enjoy covers as much as you do, Prince also did a terrific version of this song but for me this is the definitive version. Its a highlight of the Luck Of The Draw album which is one of my favorites of hers and its just an impeccable heartfelt and moving rendition<br>  <br>  George Michael<br>  just amazing.. I've had the pleasure of seeing him in concert and I was blown away by his abilities as a performer and its sad to see people being cruel about him, especially in this context, yes Mr.Michael lost his partner of many years and this performance is imbued with all the sadness and grief of losing someone he cared about.. Now surely that is something we all can relate to? He is one of the greatest singers of my generation and this is a showcase for his talents, I have this recording and yet, listening to it again I am moved anew...<br>  <br>  thank you for taking the time to share such a beautiful song with us...|`|G5FkFTjyaa	Altho George Michael states that this is one of his all-time fave songs, Bonnie takes the edge with this one.Her voice brings a lot more emotion and feeling with it and her singing about a guy comes over slightly better than Micheal also presumably singing about a guy.|`|AA12114850	I have always liked Bonnie Raitt.

I think this is her song, even though other artists have done well with it.|`|OwHqxXx8aa	Not exactly my favorite song out there,although Bonnie Raitt's voice was just perfect for the song.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	George Michael does an admirable job with this song, but he does not come close to capturing the pain that Bonnie Raitt so easily showcases in the original.<br>  <br>  Having recently had my heart broken, I relate more to the honesty that shines through in the original.<br>  <br>  That said, that is a pretty good cover, and who cares if he is singing about a man? What does that have to do with anything?|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I can't quite place this song!!! And it's driving me batty! A movie?? A favorite album?? I'll go looking after I answer....<br>  <br>  Listened to George Michael's version first. Very nice. He can really hit those high notes. <br>  <br>  Bonnie Raitt came next, and while I love her and have a long history of liking her music, her version just didn't do as much for me. It's so difficult to say exactly *why* certain versions of songs are liked more than another.... but for this round ~ I'm going with George Michael.<br>  <br>  Have a *little* history with him, too... LOVED his Faith album and even some Wham!
AA10925430	I really like the Tori Amos cover because its not a rock cover like most people would intend to do. Considering the original song "Smells like teen spirit" is of the grunge genre.<br>  <br>  I commend Tori Amos playing a piano cover for the song. Its really different, i honestly couldn't imagine anyone doing a piano cover of this song, but its happened. And it honestly sounds quite good.<br>  <br>  However, i think i like Nirvana's version better. Not because i know the band. But because i prefer the genre. I'm not particularly into the slow piano concentrated songs. I'm more into rock type music. <br>  <br>  That's most probably why i like the sound of Nirvanas version better.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	Tori's was interesting but lacked the energy, which is what makes Smells Like Teen Spirit what it is.<br>  Plus, that's not a song that should be sung so that every word is easily understood.<br>  So, Nirvana|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I had low expectataions but I think Tori Amos pulled that off<br>  <br>  I like Nirvana's better because I like rock music better. I tried hard to forget who was who tho|`|hQbUwLvwaa	What the ****?|`|urVWC73Kaa	Tore Amos' voice is very impressive, but I preferred the Nirvana version. I've always been a big fan of Nirvana, and this song is, of course, a classic.<br>  <br>  I think there are other Nirvana songs that would have been better suited for an Amos rendition; Lake of Fire comes to mind.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I still did enjoy her version of it. Thank you for asking the question, as I wasn't aware that such a version existed.|`|OwHqxXx8aa	Nirvana. Tori Amos,while a good vocalist,just made the song too light.|`|wwP3ONCFaa	I like Tori's version, i think its  like a dedication to the late Kurt Cobain from which i think she DID NOT get famous by covering other people's music, but for doing things with 'alternative' music that no one had ever heard before.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I would never have guessed that Tori Amos would cover this song.<br>  <br>  Listened to hers first, and while she gets and A for effort, it just didn't "connect" with me. It felt a bit strained, on her part, trying to "sell" it.<br>  <br>  Guess I'm just in more of a high energy mood this morning... Nirvana wins this round.

Z55OptjDaa	no it makes you a recreational pot smoker, like me|`|sVrkjixAaa	I view the word pothead in the same light as an alcoholic, in other words as someone who abuses it. Smoking weed once a week is equivalent to having a few drinks one day a week, so no you aren't a pothead.|`|g2GogSALaa	Hahahah yeahh I would consider that person a pothead.|`|J7GTIE5raa	yep just like drinking alcohol is considered an alcoholic|`|b6ccd7d20bd74154c2f10722841ac4c4aa	huh,  I don't think so.  I've been smoking weed all day everyday for about 6 years now.  Same with all of my friends.  Now WE are potheads.  Somebody who drinks once a week is not an alcoholic.  Somebody who needs alcohol to function properly IS an alcoholic.  Here's the thing, unlike alcohol, pot is not physically addicting.  If somebody quits smoking pot they're not gonna have withdrawals. Hell, I quit smoking for a month recently just for the hell of it.  It was easy.  Now, if you basically just enjoy being stoned more often, or equally as often, as being sober, then you are a pothead.  I dunno. That's just the way I see it.|`|IjKndeVvaa	Yup, but on the bright side, it's better than being a crackhead.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	No not a pothead, but in the neighborhood.|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	Pretty much|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	Yeah, smoking weed makes you a pot head.|`|e6rPJyOeaa	only if you inhale|`|YgzpSbxdaa	yeah|`|sMvWJDqsaa	If you make it a point to smoke it every week...yes|`|GeyNHYtfaa	only if i am...i smoke everyday...|`|1mFA8Iq9aa	hahaha yeahhh i think so, <br>  but its okayy cause i'm right there with yaa!! :)|`|42MOquw8aa	if it is color me green|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Yep.

More important things in life!|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	It is not disrespectful - the band doesn't care, really. Not like you can arrive naked, no matter how much the band would appreciate that...

You just got to keep your head up and not give up. :]<br>  <br>  <br>  You're still young and you have plenty of time to find the right person. I'm 20 and I'm still sad about my last relationship but I know that there is someone out there for me. I just haven't found him yet. You just got to be patient and for now, just focus on bettering yourself.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Aww, that's sad, but a lot of girls (like me) like shy guys and nice guys etc. So don't worry, and be patient.

Im really sorry this is happening to you.|`|DS33Wl4waa	Dude, I feel your pain. I've had so many failed relationships I lost track, you just have to keep the faith|`|TBZK5q78aa	Feel free to email me man... I understand what you are going through. But remember there are many women in this world dude. Literally there are 7 women to every man bro, so don't let the grief oppress your mind. Lift weights at school bro; it's a good way to relieve stress. Jogging helps too! But dude don't dwell on a woman. I'm positive that God has that special woman out there for you dude. But you are going to have to step out of that shy shell and start talking with women. Any woman you find attractive just talk to em. You can talk about general things; it doesn't have to be anything serious like "will you date me." See if you can establish communication with women then once the two of you are comfortable, then you ask for her number. What you are going through is the same thing many men go through like me. So feel free to email me if this issue becomes formidable.|`|rzXERqVJaa	aw ditto,<br>  don't worry, there will be someone out there for you.<br>  just wait until then and don't get too down<br>  you only live once so just go out there a be yourself and i guarantee someone will love you for who you are|`|eEGUatbfaa	1. wrong section.

Just be yourself and once girls realize that a bad boy isn't gonna pay the bills, care what they say, or want a family, they'll come over... It's the circle of life. <br>  <br>  Patience is a virtue and is rewarded eventually.|`|kk6YNVbuaa	the right girl will come to you:) be patient, and know shes out there somewhere|`|vTGnZsOxaa	Aww. :(

When I can feel that someone positively loves me, it's the greatest feeling ever. When you know that someone loves you, it's reassurance. But reassurance can be faked. A feeling on the other hand can't be. Feeling that someone loves you triggers a lot of other things too and if the feeling is mutual then it's made known and than you know that they love you.<br>  <br>  What it really comes down to,  (b) comes before (a).<br>  <br>  I choose, (b), I would rather feel that someone loves me because it ricochets into (a) knowing that someone loves me because they mutually admit it.|`|5rraSJRVaa	(b) oh the dizzy feeling of happiness :)|`|DFbjL5Q5aa	Feel that someone loves me|`|sObEb6NNaa	Know that someone ?'s me|`|BT1dbMICaa	a|`|IytsMTMTaa	i want to know whether somone loves me or not.. bt to whom i love he said.. just feel someone loves u...|`|dJrJYLBFaa	a.|`|faVSwnZ4aa	A for sure!|`|jgyq3wtsaa	i know someone loving me and i feels that too.|`|B4y9w6Braa	know some one loves me.<br>  maybe it will make me feel worth while.

And same with the pale, twitching dead person... like the grudge, but now, THAT THING IS IN EVERY SCARY MOVIE!  Like, you're watching, and some weird thing is crawling on the ceiling.  It's so stupid.  It's one of those things that ruin the movie, haha.  <br>  <br>  Most horror movies are comical these days; too cheesy.  I love the Exorcist though, that's a classic horror with next to no comedy.  Sigh, the good ol' days.<br>  <br>  Good question. :)

Stupid summer birthday.<br>  <br>  What is your best feature?<br>  Eyes. I love my blue eyes<br>  <br>  What is your WORST feature?<br>  I got pimples and a lot of them.<br>  <br>  Where are you from?<br>  Lynnwood, Washington. Subarb 20 minutes north of Seattle. I love the Pacific Northwest. Only Problem is my parents live here to. People are funny here. Everyone can drive in the rain but if it snows cars are left on the freeway.<br>  <br>  What food makes you gag?<br>  Sea food, and yet I live this close to the ocean. But I can't stand it. A local sea food restaurant, Ivers, had an extremely short superbowl ad.<br>  <br>  Would you eat a kitten for a million bucks?<br>  Never, Never, Never, unless it was food in the shape of a kitten and not an actual kitten.<br>  <br>  Have you ever dyed your pubes?<br>  no, Do people do that? Charlie did that on 21/2 men the other day. Great episode.<br>  <br>  What's your favorite book?<br>  Not my favorite but very weird House Of Leaves by Mark Danielewski. Very weird but awesome if you get it.<br>  My favorite is Unwind by Neal Shusterman.<br>  <br>  If you could punch someone in the face right now, who would it be?<br>  My dad, wouldn't that be fun. Actually I have before. I meant to hit him in the shoulder but he turned. Hilarious.<br>  <br>  Do you think that gay marriage? should be legalized?<br>  Yes, why should we care what other people do if its not hurting anyone. There marriage isn't stopping you from doing anything is it? NO. So let them get married already. There are BIGGER issues going on and politicians shouldn't spend so much time on this, I mean come on If two strangers got drunk in Vegas or whereever and got married and that doesnt "violate the sanctity of marriage" then how does two people who truly love eachother and will stick it out untill the end violate it just because they can't physically have kids together. I mean they could adopt and two parents is better than one parent.<br>  <br>  How about marijuana?<br>  Fine why not. People can choose to screw up there own lives as long as it is in their own home and their not hurting anyone.<br>  <br>  What is your superpower?!<br>  I can win arguments pretty well. Especially when i don't seee the need to fully make sense and just confuse them.<br>  <br>  Have you ever peed your pants?<br>  When I was little I did a lot. Because I didn't want to waste recess. I know but I was a kid.<br>  <br>  Do you like sushi?<br>  Already said no.<br>  <br>  Do you believe in god?<br>  To an extent but as far as I can tell if he actually has power over the things that happen in the world then he really has a crappy sense of humor.<br>  <br>  How many licks does it REALLY take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?<br>  Oh yeah. In 6th grade when given the choice of watch a movie or to take the math test enabling you to take algebra 1 in 7th grade me and my friend picked the movie. (im good at math but lazy) We spent the entire movie trying to figure that out. But at like 1000(or something up there) my friend got sick of counting and took a bite.<br>  <br>  What is your favorite smelly marker smell?<br>  Awww sharpies<br>  <br>  What is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to you?<br>  Already told you about the peed in pants of my childhood<br>  <br>  What animal would you be?<br>  A cat. They can do whatever they want and someone feeds them and cleans up after them.<br>  <br>  What were you in a past life?<br>  No clue but probably insane<br>  <br>  How do you want to die?<br>  Not really old because who wants to die and find out your going to be that old for eternity.  Painless<br>  <br>  Can you unwrap a starburst with your tongue?<br>  Never tried it but I think i could. hmmm.... THanks for the idea<br>  <br>  Can you run in high heels?<br>  I hate high heels. Are you kidding me I can barely walk in them.<br>  Who is the evil "guy" that came up with them.<br>   someone should go back in time and kill them before they do.<br>  <br>  What is your sexual orientation?<br>  Straight. i like guys<br>  <br>  Would you rather lick a cats eyeball or snort cinnamon?<br>  Poor cat.<br>  <br>  Was this poll annoying or did you have at least a bit of fun?<br>  Made me not so bored.

223c6f87f74b673717e3582eb9f2927baa	Once this guy actually walked over to me stark naked and wants to start a conversation. I was being polite and told him I was late for an appointment and walked to the showers. He followed me in and stood right next to me. Not like 5 feet away, I mean right next to me, we were almost bumping shoulders. So he's making small talk them asks if I'd like him to wash my back. I am left speechless, I don't want to be rude but definitely not interested. Then I see he's erect. So I'm about at the end of my Patience and ready to tell him to get lost, and he drops his soap and bends over to pick it up and does it in a way to really show me his brown eye. He looks over his back and tells me I could run up in him bare or covered, he doesn't mind he just finds me so hot. Well that was it. I beat the stuffing out of him and as I left him bleeding on the shower room floor, I thanked him for the hot complement got my clothes and left. I never saw him again. <br>  I'm not a homo-phobe, heck I've been with both sexes a few times, and loved it. But this guy was just screaming to have his azz handed to him and that's what I did.|`|MHoTbF2laa	Yea... This he-she|`|a1UkVGpHaa	Yea her room was right in front of mine.

But like I had some stupid choir contest thing today, and all the girls had to change in one room together.

It was kinda freaky!|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Um no....i havent been in a locker room since sophomore year in HS (and it wasnt for gym class lol ;D)|`|E0EAXDhfaa	I was in the YMCA and i was looking in the mirror...and behind me...ughh....there was a naked old bald guy.....blahh|`|AA10382483	I never took gym.|`|qWNSRq4xaa	No , but a few weeks back there was this dude without a towel on with his leg propped up on the sink, cutting his toenails, and ahhh, just swinging in the wind was all his genetic bounty. I had to double take. It was ridiculous. I know it's a dude's locker room and we're all supposed to be secure and manly and what not, but come on bro! Are there no limits?|`|1ttID2PYaa	i would probably just hurry up and get out of there. it would be awkward to say something. if it happened again though i would probably say something.|`|AA11577387	luckily no. usually there are 70 year old women in their swimsuits, so if their staring its cause their jealous of us young ones! lol.|`|X4pFEbioaa	no it was qwite the oppisite scenario jkjk

lO2Nvj81aa	Alexis was born at 7:51am and Joel was born at 7:54am.  From looking at three different sources it appears that the only two who were given an exact time of birth (for public knowledge) are Alexis and Joel.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it was done as quickly as possible and I would say that possibly Alexis was delivered first at 7:51, then at 7:52 Hannah and Aaden were delivered, then at 7:53 Collin and Leah were delivered, then at 7:54 Joel was delivered.  Of course this is just my guess, but the only FULL minutes of delivery were :52 and :53, therefore allowing for two babies to be delivered at those times.

JwVz3KZJaa	16, it was in June, one of the last days of school, was with my boyfriend at the time, Russ. In his house, in his room, middle of the afternoon, hot as hell outside. I looked to my left at the wall and saw his ex-girlfriends claw marks from the two of them doing the deed. So I of course dug my nails into the wall right under her marks, and a nice big chunk of plaster crumbled onto the bed. We did it and I was like, "I wanna do it again." Although I really didn't see what all the fuss was about. The whole thing couldn't have taken more than 5 minutes.|`|v5L3oKHIaa	haven't lost it yet...|`|dHYVE076aa	16|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	14, if it helps I'm still with him and I'm 19 now.<br>  All I remember was that it hurt like crazy, lol.|`|eox05Kghaa	I haven't 'lost' it yet.<br>  <br>  I'm 18|`|F6K4mNBUaa	16.....it wasn't fun. <br>  <br>  I should have waited until I was older.|`|cjLxrrTBaa	I didn't lose mine mine, it just went out to get some cigarettes and never came back...|`|rbqvDZyxaa	I'm a virgin so I've never.|`|dCURE6VQaa	17 and it was a mistake looking back....|`|GBr7TphLaa	I'm 15 and I plan on staying a virgin until I'm married|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I am a virgin.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	16. It was actually really great at the time because I was with the boyfriend I "loved" and it was my first time and all. I regret it now because he cheated and dumped me and gave me a good verbal beating. He cheated with one of my 'good' friends... If I knew then what I know now,  would honestly wait until I'm married and with the perfect guy who has promised to love me through everything and not to cheat.|`|a8878aa5ea57903ab8121a0f2f95b0ceaa	I was 15, a couple days before my 16th birthday.

8f8b5dc8700130c72c0b9ed6107de56caa	It was really good. I thought it was a true story b/c they make it so realistic.  the story line is great- a love story told through mainly flashbacks.  It's a little depressing and sometimes graphic but very good. I recommend it completly if you want a serious movie and not a lighthearted comedy.|`|lCHcKdbXaa	It was good but i didnt think it was amazing or nothin, i didnt think it was worth all those oscars. But it was good so you should watch it<br>  <br>  theres like a dance number at the ending with the credits, its really stupid and unecassary|`|xZQjK7oKaa	It was BADASS|`|WmPFqHfbaa	Great  movie. Leaves you at the edge of your seat.|`|56bNLJykaa	It was a fun, feel good film.. The problem was, they used flashback to tell the entire story- there was nothing left to be desired, no reading between the lines, everything was force fed to us if you will.. And then, the parts that were in the present (who wants to be a millionaire) was corny and candid, really unnecessary just for the sake to tell the story. I liked it to an extent, wasn't great..

But, I am not so <br>  selfish because once you enter my house it then becomes OUR house and OUR house music!" And, you see, no one can own house because house music is a universal language, spoken and understood by all. <br>  <br>  You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really unless you're deep into the vibe of house. House is an uncontrollable desire to jack your body. And, as I told you before, this is our house and our house music. And in every house, you understand, there is a keeper. And, in this house, the keeper is Jack. Now some of you who might wonder. <br>  <br>  Who is Jack, and what is it that Jack does?<br>  <br>  Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body! <br>  Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake. <br>  Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm. <br>  Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body. <br>  Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all <br>  Jackers together under one house. <br>  <br>  You may be black, you may be white; you may be Jew or Gentile. It don't make difference in our House. <br>  <br>  And this is fresh!<br>  <br>  <br>  enjoy!<br>  <br>  xk3826mx

PSiNv7gUaa	You can't purchase backstage passes.  Even if they were extremely high in price, do you realize how many parents would blow their life savings on the happiness of their insane, hormone-driven tweens?  The backstage area would be INFESTED with screeching girls.<br>  <br>  No offense to any screeching tween girls out there, I know this because I used to be one.  Way back when 98 Degrees first came out, my mom called the radio station hosting a concert in my area (on my insistence of course) and asked how much it would cost.  They informed her that you cannot BUY backstage passes for ANY concert, you either have to win them or be lucky enough to know someone (or sleep with a security guard).|`|cSceVisnaa	igotbackstagepasses is a hoax never trust that site and back to the question jonas bros are GAY WHY DO YOU LIKE THEM|`|AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....<br>  <br>  1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more<br>  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have<br>  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.<br>  <br>  2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected<br>  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.<br>  <br>  3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass<br>  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.<br>  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.<br>  Or answer the right question on the air.<br>  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out<br>  in a drawing.<br>  <br>  Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|8jxoTBWIaa	Not a jb fan but probably only in a contest or something.

AA12188463	I have to go with Johnny Cash's version because it's very raw and down to earth. A really good feel for the song.|`|tYaRgUvwaa	Well, as far as the musical performance of this great tune goes, I have to give it to Trent.  As for the video accompaniment, Johnny's is by far and away the better of the two.  More personal, more in sync with the lyrics. Nevertheless, in my opinion, you just cannot replace Trent's vocal expression during the execution of this song. It has nothing to do with their respective ages, it's just about the voice and the feeling in the voice, Johnny's is emotional but Trent's is just more "right" for the song.<br>  <br>  One thing I also have to say, I also love covers; the artists takes a great song and almost always enhances it in some way.|`|grL6vai7aa	johnny cash hands down.i am a NIN fan,but his just seems to have so much more emotion in it.almost makes me cry,whereas NIN just seems like another song|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Now these are two versions I'm familiar with.<br>  <br>  Johnny Cash for me. It's all about his enunciation and his voice ~ that voice is just so perfect for this song. And you can easily understand him without having to wait for it or work for it like you have to do with NIN.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Johnny's is better.  NIN's was poorly arranged.  Even TR said so.  wtf is up with all the youtubers who get so worked up about this issue?  Geesh!  the comments section is like a food fight over there... they aren't as civilized as we YA'ers|`|hTgnvLOSaa	NIN version was just fine as it was.<br>  <br>  I'm sick of people saying how great Cash's version is. He doesn't add anything to the song. It was just was just Johnny Cash showing his appreciation for modern artists. He's done some other better covers that don't get much attention (like Soundgarden and Danzig).<br>  <br>  The original was dissonant and creepy and Johnny Cash kind of made the song more radio friendly which would seem like an attempt to become familiar with a younger audience if Cash wasn't so respected and dying for that matter.|`|9AAGosuiaa	As a big fan of the Downward Spiral album I feel qualified to offer my opinions to your interesting question.<br>  <br>  You see one of the hats that I wear is that of a community organizer who sets up inter-generational programs for low income seniors and children.. along the way i've had the good fortune to work with people with Alzheimer's. In my work I discovered long ago that one of the best tools in reaching someone with Dementia is MUSIC. <br>  <br>  Bronwen, it is such a joy to be able to unlock peoples memories through music. Among the programs I developed was a session where seniors could view videos and give their feedback. One of the videos I selected was the Johnny Cash video, and do you know, they asked to see it again!!<br>  <br>  assuming we all understand what a great cover song it is and how the recording takes the song to a whole new level of meaning, lets talk about the video for a moment. I have never seen memories so intensely represented in a music video. All the joy, pain and regret of aging is right there for us to see and although Johnny and June are no longer with us, this moving tribute to their life and love will continue to live, a testament to their legacy and an example for us all.<br>  <br>  IMO one of the greatest music videos EVER|`|rNpqLLquaa	Sevendust does a pretty good cover of that song as well<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZkXiaBepQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZkXiaBe...</a>|`|BE59y5E2aa	Jurrasic explained it perfectly!  Johnny Cash version.<br>  <br>  The montage of his life and his lovely wife, June a few months before she passed standing at the foot of the stairs looking at him....it is very poignant.....
48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	That was fun. Patti Smith wins, Simple Minds come in 2nd, and U2 and The Mission UK tie for third.<br>  <br>  Hearing the "guys" sing it was okay... but Patti's voice just cuts through it and makes it more believable. And of course, it's 'her' song, so that fits nicely.<br>  <br>  Thanks for all the covers, Bronwen :-) It's been a fun Sunday morning, listening with a critical ear and choosing favorites.|`|b30ebd51a705432ff85d083b2d05aea7aa	The Celibate Rifles,of course..<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dOMpzRSkcs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dOMpzRSk...</a>        They ended up playing Max's Kansas City,CBGB's,the Tin Sheds at Chippo,the Annandale Hotel and Europe..Great band live..and on record...Many LPs.|`|BE59y5E2aa	I have to go with Patti Smith's original raw version of the song.   Thanks for sharing that classic piece.  Her version of "Because The Night" is still a thousand times better than that mealy mouthed Natalie Merchant and 10,000 Maniacs...|`|9AAGosuiaa	WOW<br>  <br>  ok there is so much to say here<br>  nowhere do you ask us to consider which one is best... so I can share some thoughts on the merits of all four if you wish...<br>  <br>  Patti Smith<br>  well my goodness, a terrific song with an epic production from Todd Rundgren <br>  this is really a high point for a sadly under appreciated poet and Rock goddess and has always been a favorite of mine.. so easy to get lost in the swirl of chords and her emotional vocal performance<br>  <br>  <br>  U2- <br>  A Rattle and Hum era B-side and another long time favorite<br>  better than the original? No, but not meant to be instead at a time when u2 was tipping their hat to their influences why not pay tribute to Patty? haunting production and a terrific vocal.. whats not to enjoy?<br>  <br>     <br>  Simple Minds<br>  well this one was new to my ears and I have not "lived" with it as I have the first two and frankly I'm not so sure.. I am a fan of a great deal of their work but they have a tendency to "over-produce" and I fear this might be the case here.. It seems a tad faithful to the U2 arrangement and while i applaud the attempt towards intensity at the end, can any one out "Intense" Ms.Smith?             me thinks not!!<br>  <br>  Mission UK<br>  well this was another surprise and a very pleasant one at that! the live setting fits the song and audience and artist appears to be having the time of thier lifes! Frankly I'm jealous  <br>  <br>  Bronwin, I was shocked to see that after five hours not a soul had answered this question.. I know that some of your other questions were better responded to and for that I am glad. Your efforts tonight deserve a wider audience and I hope by staring this question others might be able to enjoy this music as I have..<br>  <br>  Bronwin, I host a music lovers chatroom and I can't begin to tell you how much I would enjoy having you with us.. a number of R&P'ers of all ages and interests gather there to listen to music, watch videos, play games and get to know each other.. You belong there with us!<br>  <br>  if you have any interest in this PLEASE email me and we'll set up a time for you to be membered, that only takes 1 second and after that you can pop in whenever you wish!!

Sembra quasi di avvertire addosso l'abbacinante sole e la silenziosa, minacciosa desolazione delle rocce.<br>  Con "Wolf's creek" altri australiani hanno provato di recente a rendere lo stesso effetto, ma fallendo di brutto.|`|a7c30ff3048d17830761e39b95069568aa	si, è magnifico. io adoro peter weir. l'hai visto the lost wave( l'ultima onda)? se non l'hai visto te lo consiglio. bellissimo anche zardoz. un grande sean connery. grazie per avermi fatto ricordare di questi bellissimi film.|`|cfbce6a51d2bceec528424bae491bb1daa	Appartiene ai capolavori del cinema Picnic ad Hanging rock. Peter Weir è un grande. Le atmosfere del film, la tensione, il mistero sono incredibili. Poi la fotografia ed i colori dell'Australia sono meravogliosi.
a695e853906417dc715709211db371d0aa	Molto bello. La scena della comparsa del "testone" volante ha molto pathos. I mezzi di ieri erano peggiori che oggi, ma la maestria nell'architettare la trama era superiore senz'altro.|`|d5625be36fb076412357a9c6638dcae2aa	Ho pure la videocassetta originale...!<br>  Son d'accordo sull'"obsoleto", però in fondo non mi è dispiaciuto affatto, si lascia vedere ecco.<br>  Non è un film che consiglierei di vedere a tutti i costi (forse perchè nè ho visti molti con trame analoghe, prima di questo), ma se capita merita un occhiata. In più ho letto molte critiche autorevoli abbastanza positive. Infatti ora che me lo fai tornare in mente penso che lo riguarderò alla prossima occasione. Ciao<br>  <br>  Ps Essendo un ragazzo, vorrei far presente che anche Charlotte Rampling non scherza i fatto di bellezza (femminile), sennò i ragazzi non lo guardano!

kyTBaYFlaa	well if it doesn't have any words you are pretty much screwed because we would have no way of conveying our answers to you unless we write the music and you can read the music. i can think of a few  instrumentals but if you don't know the title that's not gonna help. maybe go to you tube and type "50's covers" or "50's instrumentals" or "50's hits" you might get lucky and find it." if it is a big hit from the fifties it is bound to be on there.<br>  <br>  here is a link to an instrumental called sleepwalk by santo and johnny<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogxTQXAgY3Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogxTQXAgY...</a>|`|7IPiop3Baa	Look for some of those "best of the 50's" collections (or "popular songs from..."). There are probably lots to choose from, but if you have a good idea of when it was popular, then you might recognize the song's name by looking through the list of titles in one of those collections.

AA12092525	... Due to a case of glaucoma, Ray started going blind at the age of five.<br>  <br>  Ray Charles Robinson was born in Albany, Georgia, on September 23, 1930. Three months later, his parents Aretha and Baily hit the road with little Ray in tow, and relocated to Greenville, Florida. Due to a case of glaucoma, Ray started going blind at the age of five. His ailment went untreated, resulting in total blindness by the time he was seven.|`|b4a2ae90298c0b35884c9c9d04f1643faa	He had Glaucoma which led him to be fully blind by the time he was 6 yrs old.|`|207ebcf56d12360578aee30834930834aa	yes he had glucoma as a child and first his vision was blurred then he went totally blind|`|2a8a4a4c1e0942d3cee326a1f0dc7b61aa	Watch the movie *Ray* its pretty good|`|2ba4f4e34a0857e9e8d0fa04a955a7c2aa	I actually saw Ray Charles in concert years ago.

Most medical experts agree glaucoma was the cuplrit, although growing up in Ray's time and place, not to mention economic background, no one will ever be able to say for sure.|`|b7c1e39f62995afe2edd6614f27bf5e7aa	That same year his younger brother, George, drowned in a washtub as little Ray looked on, too weak to pull him out. A few months later the traumatized child's eyesight began to disappear.

I think it's pretty funny.|`|8qSx7CKOaa	yeah that's pretty funny. I give it a 3 out 5
hexzaIGgaa	I have never managed to figure that one out. She is a drone. Of course, ALL of the NGE characters have serious personality problems, so why should Rei be any different. Ayanami Rei is not high on my list of anime favorites...and her English seiyu is a real PITA.<br>  <br>  I like Asuka much more...for just one phrase that she made famous..."Anta Baka?!"|`|nyqoPvL2aa	I'll take a stab at this as someone who doesn't really like any of the characters (or for that matter Neon Genesis itself, felt like it dissolved into an incoherent rant by the end). Thing is, Rei is outside of the emotional crap that the other characters spew. Shinji is such a whiner, I was hoping he'd get killed off by the time I got halfway through the series. Asuka is just plain messed up. Rei is detached and mysterious, not bitchy. Combine that with being rather hot, and she generates a response. Even if you don't like her per se (and really, who'd want to date her?), she still grabs attention because she stands out from the rest of the characters.|`|iRWp6QNHaa	Boobs.<br>  She is pretty much the main girl of the show if you take out Asuka's Mommy issues and Misato's daddy and abandonment issues, a subconscious turn off for everyone.<br>  And along with everyone else's messed up lives (Shinji's specially), Rei just seems calm, cool, quiet and sexy.<br>  <br>  Always so secret, and captivating, you never know whats up with her, it gets your attention.|`|NNxLypgaaa	I like her. She shares a lot of similar qualities tomyself and has/had a lot of potential for character growth. <br>  I also like Shinji, but my dislike of bitches keeps me from having any interest in Asuka.|`|oKckkzz9aa	I wonder too. For soem strange reason I just like her or maybe I'm following the crowd.

Well yeah.  If you are trying to say that because they are born to love dick and puss they are natural.  You are most definatley wrong.  You should read a little more into what I wrote.  <br>  <br>  I said we didn't evolve(if we did) to de-evolve.  Again no one species lives to simply live.  They have to reproduce in order to survive.  <br>  <br>  It is pretty hard to block out someone talking about his/her evening in the sack.  Especially when they are right next to you.  <br>  <br>  I am 25 and I don't think there is that much left growing up to do.  I have fought 2 wars in 2 different countries. Been deployed to Japan.  Maybe I should get in my first car accident maybe I will grow up then.<br>  <br>  Maybe I need to look at every person who doesn't read enough into someones story before making a decision as an idiot.  Hmm I will do that.

GGAgxzJNaa	It's a metaphor. This is from a press release about the movie: <br>  <br>  Novelist Patty Dann says she chose the title MERMAIDS "because of the dual child/woman natures of Mrs Flax and Charlotte. Even down-to-earth Kate, with her love of swimming, has a streak of mermaid." <br>  "In a sense", continues Dann, "Mrs Flax is like a mermaid. She feels unsafe falling in love with the men she dates, preferring instead to skim the surface of life. To risk total immersion could mean losing her identity and freedom and inviting heartache. As for Charlotte", the author adds, "she resembles a mermaid poised on the shore, waiting to jump in, unsure whether she'll sink or swim." <br>  Offers director Richard Benjamin, "The people in this film don't fit in any category exactly. Charlotte is half girl, half woman. Kate is kind of half girl, half 'fish'. They're in the water out of the water -- mermaids, looking for a place to be. What it means", the director concludes, "is you can't put everybody into a category."|`|3BB8Gn0taa	I don' know if this answer is right, but I thought it might have been because of the youngest daughter, who was underwater alot.<br>  <br>  That's what I thought anyway.

IDENTITY CRISIS #1 SPECIAL <br>  <br>  Personally, I think "Preacher" is one of the greatest comics.  That's on the list.  Try that out next.  I read the whole series and was definitely entertained.  Good luck and I hope you enjoy!|`|L7dVYjQPaa	It seems that you like darker noir type stories. I would highly recommend that you follow up on other titles written by Alan Moore (he wrote watchmen). I've personally read V for Vendetta and it was great and should suit your present tastes. Also Sin City is also a great read, and you should follow up on the author's other works such as 300 (his name is Frank Miller btw).<br>  <br>  While you are at it, why don't you check out the movies corresponding to the comics as well. They are pretty good especially Sin City.

AA10246871	There are a lot of bands that do that to me, and I tend to be drawn to them, as I am often drawn to dark things. For instance, The Cure is my favorite band, mainly because so much of their music is dark. <br>  <br>  Listening to Nirvana and Alice in Chains always makes me sad, but mostly, I think, it's because of the circumstances of members of the bands. In fact, most grunge makes me sad, because I cannot help thinking of the deadly swath heroin and mental illness cut through that entire scene. <br>  <br>  Leonard Cohen often makes me sad, as does Tom Waits. I think with them, it's more the delivery than anything else. <br>  <br>  Concrete Blonde makes me really sad, too, because they addressed some sad topics. "Tomorrow, Wendy" is one of my favorite songs by them, but it's about a women with AIDS, which gives it a special poignancy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqpYqTtIhVs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqpYqTtIh...</a><br>  <br>  And here are a couple of songs I cannot listen to without sobbing. They make me so sad, because both of them are tied, in my mind, to deaths which affected me greatly. One was the death of my brother, and the other the death of one of my best friends.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D68ymfjpw98" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D68ymfjpw...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQH0jXNViA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQH0jXNV...</a><br>  <br>  And did I mention Rachmaninoff? Everything by him seems to get me. He could have composed a happy jig and it would get me. A lot of classical music has that effect on me--especially the Russian composers of the Romantic School. But that just means they did their jobs--they were supposed to be eliciting emotion, and they succeeded wonderfully with me.<br>  <br>  Interesting question...|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	I wouldn't say it's every song but that can happen while I listen to Bob Dylan or the Velvet Underground. Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands, and Just Like a Woman both strike me as sad, as far as the VU Candy Says and Pale Blue Eyes, seem so sad to me. The Bob Dylan songs, I get the sorrow from the lyrics and the VU songs have a melancholy aura about them.|`|2KI7LxUXaa	listening to interpol is no sprinkles.<br>  i belive that too. like <br>  <br>  yngwie- shredding orgasm idk how to explain relly<br>  megadeth-my hate for the governments grow<br>  the police- get me calm<br>  so does zepplin,steelers wheel,beatles<br>  overkill/metallica/metalchurch/ and many other bands get me pumped enough to run a mile or mosh... <br>  pearl jam quiets me down untill i start singing along<br>  <br>  it usually depends on the songs|`|1LBwXPpMaa	Probably Alesana, AFI, A Skylit Drive, if I'm alredy sad to start with Bring Me The Horizon or Hawthorn Hieghts, Death Cab for Cutie, Taking Back Sunday, when I was little I cried once to Linkin Park and that song by Mayday Parade 'Miserable at Best'.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Orion-metallica/Pulling teeth---Metallica--Cliff :(<br>  Cemetary gates/Floods---Pantera--Dime :(|`|9hFexadLaa	Korn|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	AFI<br>  Evanescence<br>  gary jules<br>  loorena mckennit|`|RnFpjFODaa	death cab for cutie or bright eyes|`|FRFAcsztaa	At the moment, Jeff Buckley.

f4cc06720ee5147ef58788be047bdf95aa	I reccomend an iPod nano. They're very compact, the right size to put in your pocket. They can hold anywhere from 250-10,000 songs, depending on the GBs. I reccomend a 2GB, which holds 500 songs and costs 200 dollars. They come in black and white and last about two years. You should also invest in cases for protection, and some kind of speaker system. (Though computer speakers work quite well.)<br>  <br>  When you get an iPod, you also get an iTunes CD-rom that installs the iTunes music library and store onto your computer. There are also directions on how to put music that's already on your PC into iTunes. (It's very easy, takes only a second)<br>  <br>  If you have friends with iTunes, it's simple to plug your iPod into their PC and choose songs from their library. As long as they got their songs legally, it's not illegal. <br>  <br>  No, you don't have to download from a certain site, but you can use the iTunes music store to find and purchase songs. Songs are .99 cents and videos are 1.99.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11484347	use limewire for downloading music ^.^<br>  and any kinda mp3/ipod are good just matters on how much music it can hold really matters to me

fuyM9udsaa	I totally agree with you in every sense. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but I was let down also. And you did know that both films were written by Eric Roth right? Hence why so many people are saying that he ran out of ideas and decided to use the same narrative structure. You can watch this video that shows you exactly what I mean:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/35b0167b17/the-curious-case-of-forrest-gump" rel="nofollow">http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/35b0167...</a>|`|Otrwsauiaa	i saw the movie - and i can see how you get that impression. but i think its theme was to appreciate your blessings...i've forgotten the details since i've seen it - but i do recall that my thoughts were that it was not a purely superficial, formula film.<br>  <br>  BB was the answer to a prayer the clockmaker had to have his son return to him from the war alive. so he made a clock that reversed time [and the clock was started on the day that BB was born]...an enchantment.<br>  <br>  BBs view of the world was different b/c he was sort of seeing things in reverse.  the people in his life were moving forward as he was ANTI-aging.  i think that made him really appreciate the people he met.<br>  <br>  but i'd have to see it again...anyway, thank you for sharing your thoughts.|`|DWh4vQUsaa	i liked it. it did have the forrest gumpy feel to it, not gonna lie.

a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	The answer is yes. Although it probably shouldn't be as important as Christmas and Easter (unless you're not into the whole "Christianity" thing).

AA12004569	Yes, because there's too many things left unexplainable if there was no God.|`|yYr412Vbaa	Absolutely.<br>  look around you.<br>  do you really think there can be a store without a storekeeper?|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Yeah.<br>  I don't identify with religion but there's gotta be somebody|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Absolutely!|`|YhuH2k4Caa	there are sometimes when i have my doubts but i believe there HAS to be someone that created the universe.|`|MLaYRGdcaa	no, god is possibly a invention of a group of politicians/money people etc, whom devised a perfect system to control the masses by inventing and installing  guilt into those said masses.<br>  ...once that was achieved.....we give them all the money via taxes etc and we also fall for there control.....the church ministers etc, are the agents working for the money people etc.|`|cLATPkjkaa	No, none of the arguments for Him make any sense.|`|G7bDuuZ8aa	Yes, because I am Catholic.|`|qJPiyGdqaa	Yess.<br>  i believe in Him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [:|`|EPki0rwgaa	No, and for several reasons. A few reasons:<br>  No-one has ever seen him, nor witnessed his 'powers' demonstrated.<br>  He is as yet, as real as Santa, or the Grim Reaper, for that matter, since any person is yet to prove whether he exists.<br>  I believe in The Big Bang Theory, thus, the Theory of Evolution.|`|1YTmgAc3aa	God is just another word for life, we're all rooted in life and life is part of everything else that constitutes God..<br>  <br>  <br>  therefore, I believe God in my own way, just as other people do so..|`|w5D1WCm7aa	Very much soo. :]?<br>  Soo many miracles have happened to me that it's impossible for me to not believe in him.|`|lCHcKdbXaa	i do more now. i didnt always but i got uncomfortable with not believing in something. im still mixed, maybe i need something to happen to me|`|loqsl5xXaa	i am not sure... i believe that there may be something above us watching over everyone. <br>  <br>  I have had some experiences after praying that i can't explain.|`|Vsg0ozxmaa	Yes, I believe in Him. Not all the things that we like are good for us and not all the things we don't like are bad for us.|`|OYITN4S2aa	No, because there's no logic behind it and there's way too much scientific evidence that proves he doesn't exist.|`|7zItsd96aa	lol eff no...sorry to the rest of god believers..<br>  <br>  i dont <br>  cuz....i really havent seen much prove of his so called existence..|`|hE50eekRaa	Yeah. I wasn't raised to be religious but I can't imagine how there cannot be a higher power than us..|`|d1tlzvnSaa	well i did but idk im starting to question him now but i still believe in him not as much as i used to but i still do i need to go back to church<br>  <br>  <br>  i like watching space shows and their always talking about science stuff bib bang, elements and crap you know wat im talking about so i gusee that stuff just got stuck in my head and that's the reason btw i also have very  i don't care attitude and that's apart of it|`|MU6MMBipaa	YES|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	No.<br>  I do not believe what so ever. <br>  <br>  I think that god, and religion in general, is just a way to suppress the fear we all have of dying. It's a scapegoat. It's a way to "explain" that which we don't understand. The bible is just a book. I believe that religion will eventually bring about the end of the world. Such hate comes with strong religious beliefs. <br>  <br>  That being said - this is just my opinion. I have no hard feelings toward anyone who is religious. I'm almost glad for you all actually - to be SO sure of something must be comforting. I wish EVERYONE happiness no matter what you believe in.|`|EShqVoDDaa	Hellz no!<br>  <br>  1. Impossible to prove. <br>  <br>  2. Why do so many people suffer while he doesn't do anything?<br>  <br>  3. Everything happens for a reason? What about Hitler? What did he do to help us?<br>  <br>  4. He says he loves everybody, but all gays go to hell? WTF?<br>  <br>  5. Christians change everything and make up random excuses that 'prove' how 'God' is real.|`|qhbPmxX1aa	no, because there is no proof|`|CkJDeGT9aa	With all my heart - I've experienced the Miracle|`|OqI8Q6cbaa	of course i do ...though we have no physical proof of his existence other than the bible i rather believe in him die and find out hes not real than not believe then die and find out he is.. and on the other hand we don't need physical proof look at all the things he does for us or all the things he brings us through|`|t6QdQPZVaa	I believe in a 'higher power'. i was skeptical and didn't believe for some time because i was angry at how life turned out. Then I did some reading and became more open minded, spirtual and the faith in a high power made me happier so I started to believe in something.. I just dont have all the answers yet|`|rmLr5NwMaa	im not so sure....<br>  i mean i do and i don't <br>  i just think that to each is own and we all have our own beliefs, but sometimes i wonder.... i mean like the aztecs,romans and egyptians had many different gods just like many other cultures, but we look back at their gods and think and know that they are not real but today we have a god or gods i guess and i just wonder will people look at us in the next 100 years and go, wow i can't belive they believed in that.... i don't know its hard to say<br>  if anything though i think god is not a animal or human i think if anything its a force out of our control, like with the whole evolution thing and the creation of earth and supernovas and stuff its out of our control|`|Wm5QUtZiaa	Yes; He is a part of my life.  He answers my prayers.  He calms my soul.|`|5bSUm5Xbaa	No,<br>  It's not logical, like someone above mentioned. Really the concept of god is part comfort, part control. I could elaborate, but I will refrain. As well it is a very dangerous concept.|`|146MzXiTaa	not the christian god, but i do believe in a divine creator.<br>  <br>  <br>  i don't think that a being of infinite power would confine itself to a finite form.|`|BxTAfd2baa	I do not believe in the Christian form of God, but i do believe there is /are very powerful being/s.  I tend to not talk about religion, as it tends to end in arguments and tears.|`|95Xn7PkJaa	I didn't before, because you can't see God and everything often feels so hopeless.<br>  <br>  I do now, because of recent traumatic events that turned out finely after I prayed to God many times.|`|ns1FrT9baa	Yes. Why? Because my life is still ****, but at times, miracles have happened.|`|GAbGgdQ4aa	Kind of, but only because there is no way to prove he exists and I have a tendency to think logically.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Yea<br>  Cuz He's real, that's why|`|i1T8yKhpaa	yes always and forever:]|`|fC5X8swbaa	Yes I do. :]|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	yes|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	yes of course. <br>  i mean, if i didn't, what would i have to live for? i would have nothing to look forward too. but knowing that there is a heaven is amazing|`|MHoTbF2laa	Yes because he's real =]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvVlX_xFAd08h4WiRa49t.HOxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307221520AAtJ0fO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|w4LKvr0daa	Kind of. But not really.<br>  <br>   I can't really explain why or why not... essentially I just think there's too much messed up horrible stuff happening to "good god fearing people".<br>  <br>  But even though I don't believe, if I'm in a really bad situation, I still find myself praying. It's not that I think it will change anything, it's just sort of a comfort mechanism, resulting from my upbringing.|`|DhExpMlnaa	No.<br>  I feel there are definitely greater beings, but not necessarily a "God".<br>  I also think organized religion is a joke. If I believed in God then I don't think I should have to go into a church or temple to prove myself worthy. If there is a God, I'm pretty sure he's a mean, bully-like, asshole. I really don't want to explain my reasoning at the moment, as it is 3:00 in the morning, but I definitely have my reasons. This is my opinion and it's just as valid as yours seeing there is no physical proof of his existance. Don't "report me" because you have a different opinion. That's ignorant.|`|8jxoTBWIaa	Mine varies. I guess im a little confused? Im not yet decided as to whether I do or not.

VHa5PIfpaa	This is a fantastic all-genre Rock Representation here.  Absolutely fantastic.  I am a little disappointed that The Ramones are not represented in this list, as well as some of the classics like Chuck Berry, The Everly Brothers, Moody Blues, etc.. but those exclusions are forgivable to a point.<br>  <br>  Country is not represented in this list very well...  the only representations I see are the Eagles and Lynard Skynard (and they hardly count as country anyway, more like cross genre rock bands)  I understand your distaste for the country genre (if indeed you do have one, but some fundamental additions like Alan Jackson, Alabama, and NGDB would help give this list more of an ecclectic feel. <br>  <br>  Rap / R&B is not represented at all.  Not that I really care, but fundamental addtions like Black Eyed Peas, Kanye West, Baha Men, and The crowd that do the song "Because I got High" would help to round out this list so that everyone could have something to enjoy from it.<br>  <br>  I'm TOTALLY Disappointed that there's no blues at all!   Where's the Tracy Chapman?  What happened to B.B. King?...  Where did all your James Brown go?!  This is where Rock and Rollers were Rocking and Rolling before anyone else was!  These people DESERVE to be represented!<br>  <br>  Oh... and Where's the Reggae?...  I don't see any Bob Marley up here!  That's just WRONG!<br>  <br>  I give you a 7.5 out of ten.|`|7Lmdrxicaa	Haven't heard of everyone:p but you like Dream Theater, and they are the greatest band on earth! :P<br>  <br>  It was many other great bands on you're list. I think you have a good taste in music :D|`|LkSsjTe2aa	Awesome, you like almost the same stuff I do. Classic Rock and Metal, but I also like hardcore.|`|IQg3xIKAaa	thats quite the variety!|`|AgQForcYaa	Dewd, you got a nice freakin' list!!!<br>  <br>  And you only have like, 5 bands I don't like!

Everybody likes different things and has a different perspective on things, so I believe you have good taste because you have a variety of artists and music in that list. Whatever you like is cool man, stop the hating people|`|VqDB0qXXaa	i think that people lke differnet music and it really shows their personallity, liek i can tell about u that u are out going, sometimes people say that they dont like ur music but thats just becasue they have differnt taste, i think that u have good taste in music|`|urVWC73Kaa	Personally, I believe you have great taste in music.

And you can also distinguish noise from real music.

NxLmvKtJaa	the movie is called the Labyrinth.  I guess it's how you prepare it and what question you ask specifically.<br>  <br>  here's your answer:<br>  <br>  Can anyone explain the riddle the two guards tell Sarah (before she falls down into the helping hands). I know there's a certain question you can ask and the answer helps you figure out which door it is. can anyone help? <br>  -------[One Guard always lies, and one always tells the truth. This is absolute. So when Sarah asks Guard A to tell her what Guard B would say, she knows it will be a lie, no matter what. If Guard A were the liar, he would have to lie about what Guard B would have said. Since Guard B would have told the truth, Guard A would then have to tell the lie to Sarah. However, if Guard B were the liar, he would obviously have lied. However, Guard A would then have to answer the question truthfully which would be the lie from Guard B. Hence, no matter which guard is the liar and which guard is the truth-teller, the answer that Sarah gets would have one and exactly one lie in the answer. Knowing this, Sarah takes the other road.]|`|BxTAfd2baa	The answer is ,"If i were to ask the other guardian which door was the bad one, what would he tell me?"  If you are talking to the truthful guardian, he tell tell you the good door, and if you are talking to the lying guardian, he too will tell you which one is the good door.|`|eYpE4bp2aa	Ask either of them if Miley Cyrus is good-looking. If either of them say yes, then they're both lying.|`|OAuMPsynaa	Ask either of them, "What would the other guardian tell me?", and take the other door, because they would both point to the wrong way.!

Xy1as7Toaa	Everyone that comes to Yuko's shop comes there for a reason and it is usually bad (the lying girl who was hit by the truck, the other girl who misused the monkey's paw and was destroyed by it).<br>  <br>  watanuki also has a reason to be there, but his fate is not of the bad kind. He does not know this (blinded by his own anger and uncertainty) and must suffer many trials until he understands this.  The manga/anime is just like Yuko: you only learn what you are willing to know

eu4iZyTpaa	Hun, I think you should be just fine. :]<br>  <br>  There's a few moments that might be a little iffy age wise for you, but it's not anything really inappropriate. Yes, there is going to be some intense moments, and things will pop out. If you get scared really really easily I wouldn't recommend seeing it, but I have a little sister who's 11, and she saw it with me. She was kind of freaked, but after the movie she was fine.<br>  <br>  And if I get paranoid and freaked out in a movie, it help me to think of them filming the actual movie! I know that sounds weird, but if you imagine all the camera men rolling around, make up people surrounding them, and instead of a house or building it's just a set. That makes it seem much less scary. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|eMUSTCQfaa	dont watch it if your easily scared.|`|btridfokaa	As a Christian I would not recommend it to a young lady of your tender years.|`|kce2w5p9aa	Im 13 and watched it yesterday and I was scared out of my mind.

Hope that helps =)|`|00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	The movie is called Billy Elliot(2000). ^_^<br>  The film is set in 1984 during the miners' strike and centre's on the life of Billy, his love of dance and his hope to become a professional ballet dancer. Billy's father and brother are both out on strike. Billy's mother is no longer alive and Billy and Tony's nan also lives with the family.<br>  <br>  Billy is taken to the boxing gym by his father, but he finds out that he doesn't really like the sport. Part of the boxing gym is used by a ballet class because their usual studio in the basement of the sports centre is being used as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. He is drawn in by the ballet teacher (Julie Walters), and with her help, secretly starts taking ballet class. Billy's father finds out after the boxing teacher makes comment of Billy's absence. Billy is then forbidden to dance but continues secretly.

01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	I like the "trained ear" response.  Sometimes I'll say...check out what the bass player does at the end of the chorus, or listen to this "lick" at the end of the guitar players solo, and the average listener has no idea what I'm talking about.<br>  <br>       They can't distinquish the individual instruments.  I think it takes a few years of studying music before you begin to develop this talent.<br>  <br>       As far as guitar and imagining notes...after years of playing, a good guitarist can "hear" the difference between an Am chord, or an Em chord..or a better example...the difference between an E chord and a D chord...it's not so much the pitch of the notes, but the strings being used.|`|xTioPxaVaa	It's a combination of a good ear and knowing the instruments.  <br>  <br>  It's called experience.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it!<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|To5mQxOPaa	I don't think there's one word. How about "playing along with it in my head". i think that's as much as you can shorten it.|`|Q4u2ZT1baa	hmm...after a while of playing and studying the guitar you get to know the notes on the fretboard. This would be in the "knowledge" category of a guitar learners mind. In order to speed up the "physical" part of learning how to play guitar, you must first gain knowledge of it......so heres how it is. I can pick out any note on the fret board as soon as its said, because ive been playing for long enough, i can picture the note in my head, but also match the note in my head to wherever that note is located on whatever string. a diagram of all of the basic notes is here...<a href="http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_lessons/discover_the_fretboard/notes_on_the_fretboard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_les...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  now say you wanted to find an A-minor on the bottom E string, ir "thick" E string you would look between a and b to find a minor. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped....if you have anymore questions you can e-mail me at justmadethis123@yahoo.com|`|7bIrMvziaa	"Trained ear"|`|ra6t3UsLaa	That you're losing it for sure.
e5Q1IPylaa	The basic principle is the same, yeah, but it's SO different otherwise. I play the guitar and my sister plays the violin. I can kinda play simple tunes on the violin, but since there are different numbers of strings and stuff it gets a tad complicated. <br>  Plus you hold it in different ways. Duh. And you play different styles of songs on each. Duh again.|`|wGOPCLm3aa	only if you dont use the stick|`|jjIGaaC7aa	Wow. I just wrote all the stuff below then I saw that I think you're asking if playing Uke is like Guitar, right? Read the stuff below to make sense of this because apparently, Ukes are tuned G-C-E-A, so still, no, they are very different.<br>  <br>  The main thing is that the strings are tuned differently (and I don't mean just in a different key) but the relation of one to the next is different. So (from the lowest (thickest) guitar string it's E-A-D-G-B-E and on a violin it's G-D-A-E, which is like the lowest 4 guitar strings reversed.<br>  <br>  So you can't use the same chord shapes or really anything from the guitar.<br>  <br>  The only thing the same between them is that the music theory is always the same.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, the mandolin is very similar to a violin and is tuned the same, so if you know your way around one you'll be more comfortable with the other.|`|KSi1PRXwaa	I think it'd pretty different. If someone tossed me a guitar I could play it, but never a violin.<br>  <br>  And if you meant a ukelele I think it would be similar but still very different with the chords and the way you position your fingers, especially the high tone of the strings. I believe the strings are the same as a bass guitar, I'm not sure.|`|ra6t3UsLaa	"Almost exactly"?  No, more like not really much (plus, you play it on your shoulder, and I don't think you play chords too much on a violin).|`|AnHQbZQAaa	nope

Y1aAGPURaa	Here are a few for you to laugh at:<br>  <br>  A baby turtle was standing at the bottom of a large tree and with a deep sigh, started to climb. About an hour later, he reached a very high branch and walked along to the end. He turned and spread all four flippers and launched himself off the branch. On landing at the bottom in a pile of soft, dead leaves, he shook himself off, walked back to the bottom of the tree and with a sigh started to climb.<br>  <br>  About an hour later, he again reached the very high branch, walked along, turned, spread his flippers and flung himself off the branch. Again, he landed on the bottom, shook himself off, went to the bottom of the tree, sighed and started climbing. <br>  <br>  Watching these proceedings from the end of the branch were two little birds. Mummy bird turned to Daddy bird and said, "Don't you think it's time we told him he was adopted?"<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  There was a man who worked all of his life and had saved his money and was a real miser when it came to his money. He loved money more than just about anything. <br>   <br>  Just before he died, he said to his wife. "Now listen. When I die, I want you to take all my money and put it in the casket with me. Because I want to take my money to the afterlife with me."  And so he got his wife to promise him with all of her heart that when he died, she would put all of the money in the casket with him.<br>  <br>  Well one day he died. He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black, and her friend was sitting next to her. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, "Wait just a minute!"  She had a box with her, she came over with the box and put it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket down, and they rolled it away.<br>  <br>  So her friend said, "Girl, I know you weren`t fool enough to put all that money in there with that man."  She said, "Listen, I`m a Christian, I can`t lie. I promised him that I was gonna put that money in that casket with him."<br>  <br>  "You mean to tell me you put that money in the casket with the man?"<br>  <br>  "I sure did," said the wife. "I wrote him a check." <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  The orthopedic surgeon I work for was moving to a new office, and his staff was helping transport many of the items.<br>  <br>  I sat the display skeleton in the front of my car, his bony arm across the back of my seat. I hadn't considered the drive across town. <br>  <br>  At one traffic light, the stares of the people in the car beside me became obvious, and I looked across and explained, "I'm delivering him to my doctor's office."<br>  <br>  The other driver leaned out of his window. <br>  <br>  "I hate to tell you," he said, "but I think it's too late!"|`|ba690cb7ce8aeb70741d69685f24db09aa	Two ink spots walking down the road and bump into another ink spot,and says"anyone seen Harry?the other ink spots say yes,last time we heard,he's in the pen doing a sentence.|`|OhGxSpm7aa	Sum Ting Wong went for a job interview to be a secretary.<br>  When the manager saw Sum Ting Wong's colourful attire and gold & white-highlighted hair, his mind is screaming "NOT THIS WOMAN".<br>  Nevertheless, he still had to entertain Sum Ting Wong.

3d5ba338b8ba504c4ba48c5afae2f048aa	Aries<br>  The spring equinox, March 21, is the beginning of the new zodiacal year and Aries, the first sign, is therefore that of new beginnings. The young ram is adventurous, ambitious, impulsive, enthusiastic and full of energy. The Arian is a pioneer both in thought and action, very open to new ideas and a lover of freedom. They welcome challenges and will not be diverted from their purpose except by their own impatience, which will surface if they don't get quick results.<br>  <br>  Aries subjects are courageous leaders with a genuine concern for those they command, being responsible people, it is rare that they will use their subordinates to obtain their own objectives as leaders, but occasionally it does happen. They do not make very good followers because they are too "take charge". They may be unwilling to obey or submit to directions for which they can see no reason, or with which they disagree. They are much concerned with self, both positively and negatively - self-reliant but also self centered (sometimes) and concerned with their own personal advancement and physical satisfaction. Their immense energy makes them aggressive and restless, argumentative occasionally, headstrong, quick tempered, easily offended and capable of holding grudges if they feel themselves affronted.<br>  <br>  As the first sign in the zodiac, you, as an Arian (as you are referred to), is to simply "get something started and lead the way". The Sun in this zodiac position gives your will free rein to express itself. You could be doing this in the form of some leadership role, or by forcing others to look at themselves in a new way. You can accomplish this by knowingly carrying out a deliberate act in the name of some cause that moves you. A negative effect of this sun sign is that you could sometimes unknowingly make it hard for others to relate to you, as you really are.<br>  <br>  In your personal relationships Arians are frank, direct and candid, and make enthusiastic and generous friends. You are liable to have a high sex drive and make passionate but fastidious lovers. There is, however, a negative side to your associations with other people. You can easily be irritated by slowness or moderation in your companions and, though yourselves sensitive, ride roughshod over the sensitivities of others. The intensity of your sexual urges can drive you to promiscuity and a Don Juan-like counting of conquests of the opposite sex. It can also trick you into early unwise marriage which may end disastrously. Arians are highly devoted to their children, even to the point of laying down their own lives, so that they might live. You will not find a more defensive and loving parent in all the zodiac.<br>  <br>   <br>  It is preferable to be aware of your pioneering spirit and not disregard it. For in acknowledging it you not only enjoy life more, but you avoid being pushed around by others. Your nature is usually push or be pushed, with little middle ground. This can at times be objectionable to others, but you must have the freedom to act, rather then just thinking about it, getting pent-up in the process. At all costs you need to avoid negative emotions such as resentment, regret and self-pity, for they would deny you what is essential to your nature: straightforwardness.<br>  <br>  Mentally Arians are intellectual and objective, but can be in rare situations bigoted and extremist in religion and politics. They are good champions of lost causes and last-ditch resistance. They are quick-witted but sometimes foolhardy and over optimistic, lacking thoroughness and the ability to evaluate difficulties in the undertakings into which they often rush impulsively. The great need of Aries natives is to exercise an iron self-control, to discipline the qualities and tendencies of their character to the advantage, not the detriment, of the society in which they move.<br>  <br>  As an Arian, you like a challenge that will stir you to action. This challenge may just be frustration; or at a more controlled level, you may have clear direction and know what or whom you're fighting for. If your direction is not clear, then ask yourself and listen to your inner voice. You will come up with an answer. An Arian without a direction in which to go, or a without a cause to fight for, would be against your nature and make you more a "sheep" then a ram! <br>  <br>  Arian, do not be afraid to be forceful, for this is the very core of your nature. If you feel fear in your heart, then look for a history of negative events in you personal history, such as violence or abuse from others. Being fearful may also indicate a household in childhood that negated independence and personal initiative in you. This could have inhibited your natural urge to go forward into life as the leader and champion you were born to be. Conversely, such bad influences could also have led you to be overly forceful, or to be unsympathetic to your own need and sensitivity.<br>  <br>  You make good athletes and climbers, doctors, explorers (of new ideas as well as uncharted territory, the latter in these days including adventuring into outer space), soldiers, sailors and airmen, and leaders, though awkward subordinates, in industry and politics.<br>  <br>  Much as you are the Ram, there is still the little lamb in you, which means that at times you would attain your goals more easily by gently giving in without resistance to the demands of a given social situation, rather than getting your horns entangled in something larger and more powerful than yourself. This is a talent akin to knowing the difference between what you can change, and what you cannot. This of course takes patience, the acquiring of which is definitely your greatest achievement, along with your sense of your own inner softness.<br>  <br>  Possible Health Concerns...<br>  <br>  Aries governs the head and brain, and Arians are said to be prone to headaches, particularly migraines, sunstroke, neuralgia and depression. Indigestion and nervous disorders are also threats to you, and your rashness, impetuosity and wholesale physical commitment make you liable to accidents and physical injuries.<br>  <br>  You like extremes. Physical, emotional and mental, and benefit profoundly by experiencing them; but if your extremism goes too far beyond social acceptability, then expect to be extremely lonely.<br>  <br>  LIKES <br>  Action <br>  Coming in first <br>  Challenges <br>  Championing Causes <br>  Spontaneity <br>  DISLIKES <br>  Waiting Around <br>  Admitting Failure <br>  No opposition <br>  Tyranny <br>  Other peoples advice ;) <br>  <br>  PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE FOR YOU, AND THEIR SOLUTIONS <br>  <br>  As with all sun signs, we all have unique traits to our personalities. When these traits are suppressed, or unrealized, problems will arise. However, with astrology we can examine the problem and assess the proper solution based on the sun sign characteristics. As an Arian you may see things below that really strike home. Try the solution, you most likely will be amazed at the results. If you find yourself on the receiving end of the negatives below, it is because you are failing to express the positive.<br>  <br>  PROBLEM: Projects that come to nothing. Partnerships full of conflict and argument.<br>  SOLUTION: See your role as the "person with ideas" then, work on inspiring others to carry them out. Develop a higher capacity to "listen" and not speak.<br>  <br>  PROBLEM: Lacking real coherence and direction. Failing to contemplate, only pretending to be decisive.<br>  SOLUTION: What springs from your actions is only a reflection of your heart. Soul search and resolve some personal issues you may have buried.<br>  <br>  PROBLEM: Being deserted by others because they cannot make you notice them and their feelings in any other way.<br>  SOLUTION: If you truly have a point, if you don't they won't. Examine your attitude and put yourself in their shoes.<br>  <br>  PROBLEM: Always tripping over yourself, inviting conflict and harsh treatment. Getting deflated.<br>  SOLUTION: Learn the art of looking before you leap. Which means first finding out what it is you wish to make happen first, then act.<br>  <br>  Your ruling planet is MARS<br>  . <br>  Mean distance from the Sun (AU) 1.524 <br>  Sidereal period of orbit (years) 1.88 <br>  Equatorial radius (km) 3,397<br>  Polar radius (km) 3,380<br>  Body rotation period (hours) 24.62<br>  Tilt of equator to orbit (degrees) 23.98<br>  Number of observed satellites 2<br>  <br>  Mean Radius Distance from Planet Satellites: (km) (x 1,000 km) Phobos 11 9.38 Deimos 6 23.48 <br>   <br>  Some more interesting facts about your sign: <br>  <br>  The animal associated with you sign is this noble looking ram.

It means that you make up for your height by a lot of outgoing personality, you have a need to control and you are incredibly ambitious to suceed, even if you don't know what you want to suceed at. whatever it is, you will suceed you have a huge amount of tenacity. a scorpio will be very supportive of you and by your side. a leo will always be comparing themselves with you, they will want to be if not equal in everything, at least to feel more in control over you, more challenging than the scorpio. i'd go for the scorp.

90792b7c998a4fa4880c7caaed2cec60aa	A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.<br>  <br>  Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.<br>  <br>  At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.<br>  <br>  That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!"<br>  <br>  The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.<br>  <br>  A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.<br>  <br>  10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.<br>  <br>  Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."<br>  <br>  The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist."|`|AA10056838	Hi, Honey, this is Daddy; Pick Up<br>  <br>  "Hello?"<br>  <br>  "Hi honey, this is Daddy.

She's upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Paul."<br>  <br>  After a brief pause, Daddy says, "But honey, you haven't got an Uncle Paul."<br>  <br>  "Oh, yes, I do, and he's upstairs in the room with Mommy right now."<br>  <br>  **Brief Pause**<br>  <br>  "Uh, okay then. This is what I want you to do.  Put the phone down on the table, run upstairs and knock on the bedroom door, and shout to Mommy that Daddy's car just pulled into the driveway."<br>  <br>  "Okay Daddy, just a minute."<br>  <br>  A few minutes later the little girl comes back to the phone. "I did it, Daddy."<br>  <br>  "And what happened, honey?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "Well, Mommy got all scared, jumped out of bed with no clothes on, and ran around screaming.  Then she tripped over the rug, hit her head on the dresser, and now she isn't moving at all!"<br>  <br>  "Oh, my gosh!!! What about your Uncle Paul?"<br>  <br>  "He jumped out of the bed with no clothes on, too. He was all scared, and he jumped out of the back window and into the swimming pool. But I guess he didn't know that you took out the water last week to clean it.

146MzXiTaa	there aren't many artists out there today that have that love of creating music that the musicians of the 60s and 70s and some of the 80s and 90s had...<br>  <br>  today selling the music isn't as important as selling the image.<br>  <br>  ...it's all about the benjamins.|`|UG2VpQjaaa	'80s was awesome, the beginning of metal which is my favorite type of music.<br>  <br>  '90s was pretty bad for me. Kurt Cobain of Nirvana died, Metallica released nothing for awhile until that really crappy album I don't even want to remember, and Guns and Roses didn't do anything in that decade.<br>  <br>  Now music has become so repetitive and just sends wave after wave of sexual and violence suggesting songs (in case you haven't figured it out, I'm talking about rap.) it just gets annoying. My 4 year old brother listens to "Baby God Back" for god's sake, what kind of message are we sending here?! Rock today is OK, there are some good bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Three Days Grace, System of a Down, and Disturbed but most of it is not really rock.. It's boy bands like the Jonas Brothers calling their power chords an actual rock song.|`|zUjUgT4jaa	i think that the artist that are getting the most famous arent even the best<br>  and the best music is all this underground stuff that only a few people know of <br>  <br>  but thats just my taste<br>   music from before was better but also worst<br>  <br>  it really depends i guess|`|bU1TtPdEaa	Of course everyone's going to say<br>  <br>  1.

c9c7mUuRaa	i may not be able to request some with good soundtracks, but i can tell you some with great storylines. my alltime favorite is of course naruto. the reason the show is so great is not only because of the intricate fight scene taking place, but because of the mental level the fights take place on. for example, one of the characters named Shikamaru constantly plans ahead. he can plan up to 200 moves ahead of time and will multiple ways of doing something. he will even plan an attack based on a guess of what u will do next.<br>  <br>  another great show is bleach.|`|45qpZTzBaa	Let's see <br>  Fushigi yugi <br>  Shuffle!|`|juyXgHfkaa	U will love these animes<br>  Ituzara na Kiss<br>  Clannad<br>  I"s|`|O2sPbNbZaa	For awesome sound tracks, watch Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Shamploo.

He has many songs but the most famous is called "stis ekklisias tin porta", which became a hit in greece. It might be a bit difficult to find his cd but it is worthy.

In today’s advanced technological world there are many gadgets which are kept by the users with them always like I-pod, walkman etc. There was time of Cassettes, CDs, DVDs and now is the time of recording music in USB drives and listening to it at ur leisure time. Sometimes we need to buy music chores and sometimes we get it free from our friends or relatives. Internet is gaining ground everyday in everybody’s life. Life is, slowly, becoming incomplete without Internet. Internet is a rich source of music too.

22f32e67106295979d3ff648be10358aaa	I went with an ex girlfriend driving to the cottage, for some reason we lost our way, after a few hrs of driving, is was already night-time. We wanted to cool off, because we were beyond aggitated and angry that we were somewhere and nowhere. So she said "lets go on one of the side street and check if it goes to a river or a beach, that way we can camp for the night and continue in the morning...." At first I thought that was not a good idea, but finally I said... "cool"<br>  So we turn to the next side street and went in, it eventually lead us directly to an open field out of the road, it seem to be deserted, no cars, no people, no one seems to be around, no one that be asked for directions or where are we.<br>  As the road ended to this open place, I looked over and saw a flowing river just a couple of yards down, "sweet!!!" <br>  We park the car and took our sleeping bags and other gears for the night. Finally we were setup for the night. I had 4 cases of beer in the car, so my girlfriend went back t the car took one case down to our camp site, opening it and handle a bootle to me and one for her, "cheers!!!" <br>  We were talking and laughing about the whole day, how did we got lost, whats are in the woods, and basicly being goofy.<br>  Out of the blue my girlfriend just went running to the river and jump in it, so I run after her and dive in. We were laughing, shouting and horseplaying, somehow we manage to be butt-nake and still acting like a wild bunch of juvenile delinquents.<br>  Suddenly, a bunch of flashlights was aming at us, it seems like they were all over the place, it was so bright we couldn't see what was going on. She got scare, and hold me tight, to tight that at some moment I was loosing concentration.<br>  Then we hear...." excuse me!!!! This is a restricted Zone!!!! You cannot be here!!!! Pack your gears and put some clothes on and leave now!!!!"<br>  It was eight Park Rangers at the edge of the river near our camp-site, all steady and directly barking at us to leave. We got out, went in the car to get dress quickly, I didn't want officials to start asking why we were here, or even shoot my and my girlfriend drunken butts out of nowhere. After putting all our stuff back in the car, I asked one of the Rangers were we are and directions on getting back on route. I didn't know that just down the river on the other side was a Ranger Site Office, so basicly they saw everything since we got here. After the kindly Ranger give me directions, I went back to the car, turn on the engine and started to drive of, that is when we heard in the background laughters coming from the spot were they are standing.<br>  Has we got back on track, and finally we were on the main road, we were very quite, as if the world was silenced. She looked at me I looked at her, and that is when we started to laugh... and we laugh and laugh, and joked about it until we got to the cottage a few hrs later. <br>  So this was the craziest moment....|`|eb6c526d3f0ae2da79fc29957b11fc14aa	my moment was when I broke the rocking horse at the park , yes that was me , a little kid was on it first , then I patiently waited for my turn "Yeah right"" well I was rocking then I heard the springs cracking , then that same kid wanted another turn , and when I got off the rocking horse rocked no more , cause I broke it , then that kid was crying "Mommy that lady broke the horse", as you can see that was the only horse that I have ever broke ....|`|AA10179971	i took off all my clothes in the public library elevator...just for kicks|`|AA12339385	Im not sure, but I know this 1: I was drunk at the time and 2:  woah should get the best answer.|`|dbf396a58f74a9df1b59df3c620d6650aa	hmm.. the craziest moment would have to be everytime i see my crush everything turns upside down!!!!!!!!!!!!!

D1c8cRM4aa	hahaha i just posted a question complaining about the West coast! lol I think the East is doing fine compared to the West, as long as its good music. Besides, people like the south right now for some reason(maybe its the poor grammer they use) but, thats were the money is at, so rappers gotta eat too! lol<br>  <br>  oh i didn't answer the question - yeah Jay def. need to link up with Kanye again for blue print 3, Common needs to drop the whole hip-house act and go back to finding forever or be, Kanye need to go back to whatever mindset he was in when he made college drop out, and overall i think we need more rappers that just love hip-hop, and do it for the love of hip-hop not for the fame or the money.|`|fMCpNalNaa	find new talent|`|y54W0gP2aa	it's gotta be socially acceptable like party music among teens|`|4DzaDa3Uaa	These days all you need is a dance, lame FL beat, & T-Pain.|`|PcXp05Haaa	nothing!! <br>  leave them dead|`|JlYqg8z8aa	jay needs to get kanye for blueprint 3.<br>  queens need to get along, nas - az - mobb<br>  50 needs to find dre again|`|6fxr3VBGaa	dick ride that funny voice shyt and come with those hard pounding southern style beats. unconcentrate what they are saying so people can understand what they are saying really easy without straining their brains. stop MCing and just start talking over a beat that can MC for them if that makes since.
e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I always have horrible insomnia and all this restless energy mentally and physically when the Moon is in my sign. I get a little bit more creative and do things that I used to really enjoy like drawing, walking around outside enjoying nature, and writing short stories. My imagination is already vivid but it becomes very overactive once the Moon goes into Aquarius. On the flip side, I get a thousand times more stubborn and need a lot more time to myself. It's also hard to concentrate and focus on one thing at a time. All in all though, I enjoy it for the most part :)|`|tFcsLR7Maa	No.|`|a85f51bc1ebf5d87f5dd0aee9e9e7afbaa	I'm a Taurus with aries moon, and, i lost my patience!!

JNQezEGqaa	That happens to me on a regular basis.....<br>  I am tired except when I lay down to go to sleep.....<br>  It is insanity I tell you....<br>  INSANITY!<br>  Peace.|`|9NKoHyy8aa	I hate the sound of an alarm clock. Luckily, I don't have to use one very often. And it's a very creepy feeling for me to have to get up before the sun. When I am supposed to be getting out of bed early, it does feel like a threat, because it's trying to keep me from doing something that's extremely important. I know what you're saying, but personally, I might say, sleep 'tempts' me to let it consume me. When I do have to get up, it's quite a struggle. One of my favorite feelings is sleeping in the morning, when I'm drifting in and out of that dream state. That's why it's so tempting to me. But when I do have to wake up, not by my own will, it feels like a dark cloud, rather than the pleasant morning sunshine, that lets me just lie there and dream.|`|HDqOXDFIaa	I KNOW!! The past 2 nights in a row have been that way for me! Then I get really tired around 4 or 5 o'clock but force myself to stay awake thinking, Good! I'll just go to bed a little earlier tonight but then later that night I get a second wind & can't fall asleep! It really sucks!! ;)|`|IKCfT9tnaa	I know what you mean.

Getting some kind of exercise after work can help balance things out.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|kfLH50ECaa	yes this is very true , your body just wears down, and it seems that when you need to do something when your just to sleepy to do it, but still has to, i know its hard you need to speak to the dr and see if they gave give you something to help you out, so that your not feeling this way, i understand its not good to feel that way ;)<br>  <br>  kassie|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	I work the night shift and about 3/4 of the way through my shift I am a zombie!

I hate it!|`|oKsKKxeaaa	When I worked night shift, this would happen to me a lot.  I just couldn't sleep well during the day.  Switched to evening shift.  Here's hoping you find a solution...I know this can be miserable to go through all the time....good luck|`|AA11538538	That is exactly what happens to me every morning Mon thru Fri...I can't sleep and when I do it is restless...up until about 5:30 am...when I fall into a deep sleep to the point I don't even hear my alarm clock|`|8a2c7511cfabb2e759e39cfc0b3a6c82aa	especially when I need to get to work on something  id the time I want to doze off.

The dog knows does the same tricks we do: speak, beg, lick the face, sniff the butt, scratch behind the ear, tickle the belly, sit, jump up, fetch, bark, roll over, and play dead, in that order. If the dog got bored, it could chase its own tail.<br>  (everything but the cigarette afterward).|`|ixyNeBhWaa	No unfortunantly my dog is one of those "special" dogs... he pees on himself a lot and cannot be tought anything, he is selfish.<br>  Too bad to.

We've never chased her out of the room.  Maybe we should have set some limits when she was smaller, but we didn't.  It's not like she's joining it.  It's weird cause she turns her back on us.  It's like we are her pack but we aren't letting her in.  When we are done, I just give her a hug.  Guess we're weird.  Don't care.|`|AA10546011	We tried it, but he got too excited.

Beats the heck out of a teddy bear! Except for when he eats carrots. They give him gas. Then he gets kicked downstairs to sleep on the couch.<br>  He is a 13 pound Toy Fox Terrier, named Max.<br>  My days of having a cuddle pup are numbered. He is getting closer and closer to sleeping with my kids. When that happens, I will have lost him forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, you dirty little monkey! I didn't see the other part of the question! And as long as he stays in his neutral corner, I don't care. It's not like I'm going to be paying attention to him anyway. My "mind" is on other things at that moment. However I used to have a cat that had to locked out of the room. Guess he thought I was attacking his Mommy, and he would bite me. Let me tell you, there ain't much more of a turn off than getting bitten on the butt in mid flagrante. And I don't mean a little nibble either, I'm talking about kitty thinking he's a man eating tiger on the prowl. It drew blood!|`|fguyiSIjaa	God, no. Not even in the room. Not just because that's weird, but also because she'd think it was a game and start barking uncontrollably.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Not on my bed at anytime.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I would as long as he's trained.<br>  Or her.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Nope, somethings aren't meant to be shared with man's best friend!!|`|MVViKeYeaa	No.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	yes|`|AA11656632	No, I don't need an audience

(tá se ela era virgem problema dela num precisava fikar fazendo esse circo todo), já a Christina sempre apareceu bem por ela ser ela mesma, falar o que sentia  e cantar super bem e até hj ela ta aí brilhando com o mérito dela por cantar bem e td..|`|0b59ac85bbbfe66e502d4e70a9108accaa	Bom, n?o tenho nada contra nenhuma delas, digamos que a Britney esteja passando por uma fase ruim em sua carreira, ninguém pode negar que ela já fez muito sucesso, principalmente no ano de 2003, que foi o ano em lan?ou sua música de maior sucesso "toxic".Quanto a cristina ela está em uma boa  fase de sua carreira, lan?ou muitas músicas de sucesso e está rindo atoa. Porém ninguém sabe o dia de amanh?, a britney pode subir, e a cristina pode cair. Vida de artista é como o tempo, ás vezes tem tempo bom e tempo ruim é sempre uma caixinha de surpresas. Eu particularmente desejo sucesso a todas duas.|`|4de96323562d2268deea8d4e83e73bb6aa	na verdade sao duas "piranhas"  fora outras com o mesmo estilo,destaque para a fogosa beyonce q faz de tudo pra aparecer, faco nenem em todas .<br>  fuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...|`|K36TeAMBaa	EU SEI A SEMELHAN?A ,AS DUAS S?O VULGARES|`|dfdbyoiaaa	o Justin tinberlake|`|1fb3b38346022dba2c52fcf5643f90d1aa	a britney so ta desse jeito porque ela perdeu a custodia dos filhos e entao ficou maluca.porque se nao tivesse eu continuava a preferir a britney em vez da madonna<br>  ora diferencas<br>  christina tem mais voz , canta um pouco melhor e é mais madura<br>  britney na minha opiniao e mais bonita e muito mais famosa...antes de ficar do jeito que ta agora ne?<br>  vendeu muito mais discos e foi a princesa do pop durante muito tempo<br>  christina ate agora nao vi nada de extraordinario apenas houve uma coisa no videoclip "hurt" que foi em homenagem ao pai dela que tambem morreu na vida real,mas apesar de tudo tambem gosto bastante dela...<br>  fui|`|48p36yYVaa	Pra mim n tem muita diferen?a.

c943b397bcbb13a99a8784c80691289eaa	maybe not, you have to trust first, then only you can love.|`|828d07c83a9f68d1c1b9e891350c6802aa	No it isnt possible. Because in order to love someone else, you have to love your self, and thats where trust begins. So if you dont love yourself, how can you trust yourself. And what i mean by that is if you get into a relationship like that, youll end up cheating on the one you just said i love you to. So how would they ever begin to start trusting you again, especially if you dont trust yourself. See what i mean?|`|ouEix2a2aa	Under so many different circumstances...YES it's possible and it happens but in one particular situation and that is with an s/o although it's also possible as it happened to me but it's not really good mentally, physically and emotionally. I believe when into a relationship you have to be totally into him/her.|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	I don't think so... hm.<br>  I've always said that the betrayal of trust is the betrayal of love.  That would apply here.  You may be in love, but not have true love if you have been betrayed.  <br>  I think the only true exception is parent to child.|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Yes, I definitely think so.<br>  I've been in a relationship like that, and I know it's possible, weird as that may be. He gained my trust back eventually though.<br>  ?.blondy|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Yes...it is very possible and maybe the reason the divorce rate is where it is currently.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	No.  I think they go together.  I think you are fooling yourself into thinking you love them.|`|ACCIArkDaa	Why would you want to waste something as precisou as love on someone you didnt trust at all? There can't be much fun in that.|`|dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	Yep. It is possible.|`|c2faaed487e37842ff3532bde2bc56a7aa	Yes you can. <br>  hmm...On that note one can argue that one needs more than love in a relationship.|`|HdY50E6Paa	No because love and trust are one in the same. How can you truly love someone but don't trust them?|`|Wb1ydezNaa	when you truly love someone you should truly trust them as well.|`|xBOQMqU0aa	trust is the most important factor in love..|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I never completely trust anyone. I don't think it's a bad thing.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	yes|`|6rrVUYslaa	yes i guess..but unless u trust, it wont be called true love !|`|PGeAFKYZaa	Nice question. It is not only possible but is a fact of life! Please note.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is in a quotation of Dr. Singh on 'Human Nature and Development', as below,<br>  <br>  "True love may be unilateral and is not only possible but is a fact of life and perhaps Blessing in disguise of Mother Nature; which, very frequently exists even in far worse situations/circumstances involving correct and factual knowledge of the; rogue, undesirable and untrustworthy nature of the other person. <br>  <br>  There are several examples of this phenomenon in real life, e.g., a mother loves and perhaps truly loves her child in-spite of all his/her shortcomings and handicaps. One can imagine what may happen if the mother starts behaving in the same and or in a far worse manner! <br>  <br>  That is why, it is the Natures law of compassion that the universe and humanity is always a better place with one less scoundrel"<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question and helps.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	not from my stand point of view  isn't possible,  what would be the point ,  maybe the sex is good and the thought of hitting the field looking again stops someone from admitting the truth  but personally if there isn't trust there isn't anything|`|bQCfOftxaa	1 Corinthians 13<br>  Love <br>   1If I speak in the tongues[a] of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames,[b] but have not love, I gain nothing. <br>   4Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, ALWAYS TRUSTS, always hopes, always perseveres. <br>  <br>   8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <br>  <br>   13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.|`|wJKUxaKYaa	Im in that kind of situation and yes if you love someone you have to trust them but sometimes you cant help who you fall in love with..But i cant trust my man but i love him too much as well but i suppose it happens to most people and you know yourself men can be men!!<br>  <br>  please answer my questions if you can{womens stuff}|`|3RfHq80Naa	Of course.  <br>  Just because a person is not trustworthy does not make them unlovable.  His mom loves him, doesn't she?<br>  It depends on whether or not you consider honesty to be important.  Even then, love is an emotion and does not listen to logic.|`|Q2xkBdrEaa	Love and Trust are inter related and inter dependent .<br>  When there is no trust there is no love.<br>  When there is no love people prefer not to trust.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Yes, it is. Many times one will love someone, even though that someone has lost their trust long ago. It's called unconditional love.|`|qpjorXRnaa	No, love and trust are intertwined together always! If you love someone you will trust them and if you trust them you will love them|`|dpuY0jWiaa	Yes, for a while, because love dies more slowly than trust. But eventually, if there's no trust, there's no real love.|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	yes, but why would you want to stay with them :(  <br>  <br>  You can truly love someone if you don't trust them, of course!...but that doesn't mean you should put yourself through that.|`|0Pf4ubovaa	Yeah. It's possible.|`|zAcK9dZXaa	love means (trust & faith) so without the faith&trust you can't tell its a true love|`|fiUOGey6aa	Yep...it is hard though because trust really makes the relationship|`|Jy2bW7gQaa	i did, and it didn't work out. so, yes, but it doesn't work. =)<br>  -kelsey.|`|e4cce4fb6115df97b6140e853aeb9fcdaa	It is possible... but very unlikely to last as long as you would want it to.|`|B83DTe78aa	I love chips but i cannot trust them not to get eaten.|`|T6WYXtdfaa	Absolutley.

Good Luck :P :D|`|EgoGwz4paa	no. the base off love is trust so u cant really TRULY love someone w/o trusting them.|`|QMqAac1Yaa	I don't think so, trust is love.|`|IE6UR5Bcaa	Yes - in a strange way.|`|c9a90527808df5335d19bb2bb26c039eaa	yh, why not|`|ERqwkwv1aa	i think so.|`|kQDWVRvzaa	Yeah I love my kids but wouldnt put a thing past them. :)|`|64cUxJn1aa	Only if you're stupid<br>  <br>  **Big smile**          =D|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Ugh!

I loved him.  He was a kind, thoughtful, sweet man.  I just couldn't trust him not to buy a 12-pack of beer!|`|GBRmOem8aa	No definitely not. Love consists of so many things.... other wise you do not have a real love.... it is just some thing that your mind cooked up.... you cannot choose love, and when you do it is the reason you are missing things. Post this in Philosophy you might get better answers.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	I don't know....my relationship has had many ups and downs. And from what I have noticed, we are more in love and kinder to each other when we trust each other 100%. It's like the missing piece. If there is no trust, your relationship isn't whole.|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Definatley.<br>  Oh Danni, you're emptying my happy wagon...|`|IizPFrELaa	Yes absolutely 100% agree!|`|NBNLMRpRaa	Yup!

Recentemente visitei um site de seriados antigos e li tudo sobre a série.

Depois disso, ela fez apenas alguns filmes em que n?o lembrava nada do melhor trabalho.|`|e7c3d2f4fa3908be8924d1426096811eaa	Elizabeth Victoria Montgomery (Los Angeles, 15 de abril de 1933 — 18 de maio de 1995) foi uma atriz dos Estados Unidos da América, célebre por sua participa??o no seriado A Feiticeira, como Samantha, esposa de Darrin Stephens (no Brasil batizado James), interpretado pelos atores Dick York e Dick Sargent.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth Montgomery nasceu em Abril de 1933 e já nos anos 50 come?ou a atuar em TV (mais precisamente em 1951). Sua primeira apari??o foi no programa do pai - Robert Montgomery Presents.<br>  <br>  Bastante ativa em termos de casamento, seu primeiro matrim?nio foi em 1954 com Frederick Gallatin Gamman. Em 1957 casou-se com o ator Gig Young. Em 1963 casou-se com o produtor William Asher, após ter trabalhado com o mesmo no filme Johnny Cool. Foi quando decidiram desenvolver um programa onde ele fosse o produtor e ela a estrela.<br>  <br>  O projeto concebido por ambos mostrava o dia a dia de um frentista que trabalhava num posto de gasolina, contrapondo-se ao dia a dia da esposa, uma mulher da alta sociedade. O desnível social entre ambos e o eterno conflito entre homem e mulher seriam as bases desse seriado. Asher levou o projeto para a Columbia Television, para ser apreciado por William Dozier (que depois produziria a série de TV Batman).<br>  <br>  Dozier parece n?o ter se entusiasmado muito com a idéia mas achou-a parecida com outro projeto, criado em 1961, por Harry Ackerman. A idéia de Ackerman era mostrar um casal se conflitando, mas n?o por diferen?as sociais e sim porque o homem – um publicitário promissor - casa-se com uma bela feiticeira. Asher gostou da idéia e sugeriu que ambos se unissem na produ??o da série, porém desde que Elizabeth fosse a estrela principal. A partir daí, uniram-se ao grupo de Sol Saks, para desenvolvimento do episódio piloto.<br>  <br>  A série, de nome A Feiticeira, durou oito anos e foi um sucesso, sendo exibida e reapresentada até hoje em diversos países do mundo. Foi um trabalho t?o marcante na carreira da atriz que, após o fim do programa, n?o mais conseguiu se livrar da imagem de Samantha, a bruxinha boa que tinha uma família com poderes incomuns que atormentava sua rela??o com seu marido mortal.<br>  <br>  Após o término da série Elizabeth fez mais alguns filmes, e no ano de 1995 veio a falecer dormindo. Durante a série A feiticeira, Elisabeth Montgomery engravidou três vezes, em sua primeira gravidez a sua filha ,come?ou a atuar na série como Tabata, nascida em 1972.<br>  <br>  A série relata o dia-a-dia de uma família americana de classe média formada pela bela Samantha; seu marido James (Darrin, no original), um publicitário; e os filhos, Tabatha e Adam. Nada de mais haveria se Samantha n?o fosse uma feiticeira poderosa, que se casara com um mortal e fez a op??o pessoal de viver feliz ao marido sem fazer uso de seus poderes. Só que, com as muitas confus?es provocadas por seus familiares bruxos - em especial a m?e, a terrível e adorável Endora, que n?o se dá bem com o genro, apelidando-o inclusive de Dumbo, por causa de suas orelhas -, Samantha acaba tendo sempre que mexer seu nariz e libertar o poder para resolver as diversas situa??es, em sua maioria c?micas.<br>  <br>  Outros personagens importantes na série s?o o volúvel patr?o de James, Larry Tate, sócio da agência McMann & Tate; o pai de Samantha, Maurice; o tio palha?o, Arthur; a tia Clara, boazinha e atrapalhada; a n?o menos atrapalhada babá Esmeralda; e o médico especial dos feiticeiros, Dr. Bombay; Serena, uma tresloucada prima de Samantha idêntica a ela; e é claro, Endora.<br>  <br>  <br>  Elenco Elizabeth Montgomery - Samantha Stephens e Serena Dick York - James Stephens (I) Dick Sargent - James Stephens (II) Agnes Moorehead - Endora David White - Larry Tate Marion Lorne - Tia Clara Alice Pearce - Gladys Kravitz (I) Sandra Gould - Gladys Kravitz (II) George Tobias[1] - Abner Kravitz Maurice Evans - Maurice Paul Lynde - Tio Arthur Bernard Fox - Dr. Bombay Irene Vernon - Louise Tate (I) Kasey Rogers - Louise Tate (II) Mabel Albertson - Phyllis Stephens Robert F. Simon - Frank Stephens (I) Roy Roberts - Frank Stephens (II) Alice Ghostley - Esmeralda Erin Murphy e Diane Murphy - Tabatha David Lawrence e Greg Lawrence - Adam [editar] Curiosidades No Brasil, a série estreou na Rede Globo, já em 1965, e depois foi reprisada pela Rede Bandeirantes, pela Rede TV e pela Rede 21. Em Portugal a série foi transmitida na RTP e já foi re-transmitida muitas vezes desde aí.<br>  <br>  Os dois primeiros anos foram produzidos em preto e branco, colorizado depois por computador.<br>  <br>  O actor Dick York, que interpretou James, o marido da feiticeira nas primeiras cinco temporadas da série, teve de ser substituído por Dick Sargent porque sofria de terríveis dores na coluna, que podiam ser aliviadas com remédios mas que às vezes eram t?o violentas que impossibilitavam o actor de filmar os episódios. A troca de intérpretes do protagonista masculino foi feita sem qualquer aviso aos telespectadores. Depois, Dick voltaria a fazer participa??es em séries, como A Ilha da Fantasia.<br>  <br>  A estrela da série, Elizabeth Montgomery, e o produtor, William Asher, eram casados.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth ficou marcada para sempre no imaginário do público como a mulher bondosa e linda que se desdobrava para cuidar de uma casa, dos dois filhos, do marido e ainda por cima lidar com uma família de feiticeiros, um mais maluco que o outro. Após o fim da série, em 1972, ela actuou em filmes como A Senhora Sundance e Amos, mas o estigma de Samantha a perseguiria para sempre.<br>  <br>  Os actores principais de A Feiticeira já s?o todos falecidos: Dick York em 1992, Elizabeth Montgomery em 1995, Dick Sargent em 1994, Agnes Moorehead em 1974, David White em 1991.<br>  <br>  Há uma atriz de filmes pornográficos que usa o nome "Tabitha Stevens", mas n?o se trata da mesma que, crian?a, era a filha do casal James e Samantha na série. A personagem (no Brasil chamada Tabatha) foi interpretada pelas irm?s gêmeas Erin e Diane Murphy. Na época, uma lei americana obrigava que crian?as usadas como atrizes tinham de ser gêmeas e revezadas para evitar exaust?es.<br>  <br>  Em 2005, chegou aos cinemas uma vers?o de Casei com uma feiticeira (pt) ou A feiticeira (br), com Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Shirley MacLaine e Michael Caine nos papéis principais.<br>  <br>  ***  Gostava sim da série....seu nome é Samantha por causa dela?? rsrsrs Legal...|`|21519bd04834a478b1ad16c19e0c09faaa	gosto muito.<br>  e eu adorava aquele seriado|`|M2pJVDkYaa	Sim gosto muito dela...assistia sempre o seriado e ela era a melhor na minha opini?o...beijao|`|PKdJet7uaa	sim,depois desse seriado ela nao apareceu muito!mais ela sempre continuara uma otima atriz!mesmo que o tempo passe!<br>  bjks pra voce e pra sua xará!rsrrsrsrsrsr|`|f69dDf8maa	gosto, ela é muito boa atriz|`|jN7XGohWaa	adoro!!!! alem disso ela e muito legal, acho que esse programa foi um verdadero sucesso!

Quiero decir que, al comprarla me arriesgo a tener que comprar nuevamente otras revistas para confirmar el contenido de lo leído; si el tema trasciende el título de la revista ("Muy Interesante"), obviamente compro un libro que trate a cabalidad dicho tema.<br>  <br>  En síntesis. Esta revista, por su característica de "publicación de novedades" es necesaria para quienes buscan estar a la vanguardia... o para quienes necesiten "trasladar" a sus clientes hacia un tema de conversación en particular.<br>  <br>  << Doctor: ?Es cierto que ya clonaron a un humano?

She is winning competitions and consistently losing weight.  I just wish she would keep it quiet at times.|`|pNKBszseaa	I think she is a great competitor, but her mouth doesn't shut up. She says things that are not needed, she seems to be a bit pushy.

La profesora ve que no puede resolver el problema y lo manda para la dirección.<br>  Mientras Jaimito esperaba en la antesala, la profesora le explica la situación al director. éste le promete hacerle un test al muchacho, que seguro no conseguirá responder a todas las preguntas, y así accederá a continuar en el primer grado.<br>  Ya de acuerdo ambos, hacen pasar al alumno y le hacen la propuesta del test que él acepta.<br>  Inicia entonces las preguntas el Director: A ver Jaimito, ?Cuánto es 3 por 3? -"9"-.<br>  ?Y cuánto es 6 veces 6? -"36"-.<br>  El director continúa por casi una hora, con la batería de preguntas que sólo un excelente alumno de tercer grado debe conocer y Jaimito no comete ningún error.<br>  Ante la evidente inteligencia del menor, el Director dice a la profesora:<br>  Creo que tendremos que pasarlo al tercer grado. La profesora no muy segura, pregunta: - ?Puedo hacerle yo unas preguntas también? El director y Jaimito asienten.<br>  Inicia entonces la profesora:<br>  ?Qué tiene la vaca 4 y yo sólo dos?<br>  Las piernas, responde Jaimito sin dudar...<br>  ?Qué tienes en tus pantalones, que no hay en los míos?<br>  El director se ajusta los lentes, y se prepara para interrumpir...<br>  Los bolsillos, responde el ni?o.<br>  ?Qué entra al centro de las mujeres y solo detrás del "hombre"?<br>  Estupefacto, el director contiene la respiración...<br>  La letra "E", responde el alumno.<br>  ?Y dónde las mujeres tienen el pelo más crespo?<br>  El director hace una mueca de asombro<br>  En áfrica, responde Jaimito sin dudar.<br>  ?Qué es blando, y en las manos de una mujer se torna duro?<br>  Al director se le cruzan los ojos.<br>  El esmalte de u?as, profe... contesta Jaimito.<br>  ?Qué tienen las mujeres en medio de las piernas?<br>  El Director no lo puede creer...<br>  Las rodillas, responde Jaimito al instante.<br>  ?Y qué tiene una mujer casada más ancha que una soltera?<br>  La cama.<br>  ?Qué palabra comienza con la letra C, termina con la letra O, es arrugado y todos lo tenemos atras?<br>  El director empieza a sudar frío...<br>  El codo, profesora.<br>  ?Y qué empieza con C tiene un hueco y yo se lo di a varias personas para que gozaran?<br>  El director se tapa la cara...<br>  Un CD.<br>  El director, ya mareado de la presión les interrumpe y le dice a la profesora... Mire, póngame al carajito ese en sexto grado...<br>  ???Yo mismo acabo de fallar todas las respuestas !!!<br>  **************************************...<br>  Una madre Gallega escribiéndole a su hijo...<br>  Querido hijo,<br>  Te pongo estas líneas para que sepas que estoy viva. <br>  Te escribo despacio porque sé que no puedes leer de prisa.<br>  Si recibes esta carta es porque te llegó, sino, avísame y te la mando de nuevo.<br>  Tu padre leyó que según las encuestas, la mayoría de los accidentes ocurren a 1 kilómetro de la casa, así que nos hemos mudado mucho más lejos; no vas a reconocer la casa, el lugar es lindo, tiene una lavadora que no estoy segura si funciona o no, ayer metí una ropita y tiré de la cadena, y no he vuelto a ver la ropa desde entonces.<br>  El clima no es tan malo; la semana pasada sólo llovió 2 veces, la primera vez por 3 días y la segunda por 4 días...<br>  Con respecto a la chaqueta que querías, tu tío Pepe dijo que si la mandábamos con los botones puestos, pesaría demasiado y el envío sería muy costoso, así que le quitamos los botones y los pusimos en el bolsillo...<br>  Al fin enterramos a tu abuelo; encontramos su cadáver con lo de la mudanza, estaba en el armario desde el día en que nos ganó jugando al escondite...<br>  Te cuento que el otro día hubo una explosión en la cocina a gas y tu padre y yo salimos disparados por el aire cayendo afuera de la casa; que emoción, era la primera vez que tu padre y yo salíamos juntos en muchos a?os...<br>  El médico vino a la casa y me puso un tubito de vidrio en la boca y me dijo que no la abriera por 10 minutos; tu padre ofreció comprarle el tubito...<br>  Sobre tu padre, que orgullo, te cuento que tiene un bonito trabajo, tiene cerca de 500 personas debajo de él. él es quien corta la hierba en el cementerio.<br>  Tu hermana Julia, la que se casó con su marido, parió, pero como todavía no sé de qué sexo es, no te sé decir si eres tío o tía. Si el bebé es una ni?a, tu hermana va a nombrarla como yo. Qué raro que quiera llamar a su hija "mamá".<br>  Tu padre le preguntó a tu hermana Pilar que si estaba embarazada, ella le dijo que sí, de 5 meses ya; pero ahí tu padre le preguntó que si ella estaba segura que era de ella. La Pilarcita dijo que sí, moza de hierro tu hermana Pilar, que orgullo, de tal palo tal astilla...<br>  Tu primo Paco se casó y resulta que le reza todas las noches a la esposa, porque es virgen...<br>  A quién nunca hemos visto más por acá es al tío Venancio, el que murió el a?o pasado...<br>  El que nos tiene preocupado es tu perro el Puky, se empe?a en perseguir a los coches que están parados...<br>  ?Recuerdas a tu amigo Clodomiro?, ya no está más en este mundo; su padre se murió hace 2 meses y pidió ser enterrado en el lago. Tu amigo murió cavando la fosa en el fondo del lago...<br>  Muérete, tu hermano Juancho cerró el coche y dejó las llaves adentro. Tuvo que ir hasta la casa por el duplicado para poder sacarnos a todos del auto...<br>  Bueno hijo, no te pongo mi dirección en la carta, porque no la sé. Resulta que la última familia de atlantes que vivió por aquí se llevó los números para no tener que cambiar de domicilio. si ves a do?a Remedios, dale saludos de mi parte; si no la ves, no le digas nada... <br>  Tu madre que te quiere,<br>  Josefa<br>  <br>  P.D. Te iba a mandar 100 pesetas, pero ya he cerrado el sobre. <br>  **************************************...<br>  Una pareja tenía dos ni?os peque?os, de 8 y 10 a?os de edad, quienes eran extremadamente traviesos. Siempre estaban metiéndose en problemas y sus padres sabían que si alguna travesura ocurría en su pueblo sus hijos estaban seguramente involucrados.<br>  La mamá de los ni?os escuchó que el sacerdote del pueblo había tenido mucho éxito disciplinando ni?os, así que le pidió que hablara con sus hijos. El sacerdote aceptó pero pidió verlos de forma separada, así que la mamá envió primero al ni?o más peque?o.<br>  El sacerdote era un hombre enorme con una voz muy profunda, sentó al ni?o frente a él y le preguntó gravemente:<br>  ?Dónde está Dios?<br>  El ni?o se quedó boquiabierto pero no respondió, sólo se quedó sentado con los ojos pelones.<br>  Así que el sacerdote repitió la pregunta en un tono todavía más grave:<br>  ?Dónde está Dios?<br>  De nuevo el ni?o no contestó.<br>  Entonces el sacerdote subió de tono su voz, aún más, agitó su dedo frente a la cara del ni?o, y gritó:<br>  ?Dónde está Dios?<br>  El ni?o salió gritando del cuarto, corrió hasta su casa y se escondió en el closet, azotando la puerta.<br>  Cuando su hermano lo encontró en el closet le preguntó:<br>  ?Qué pasó?<br>  El hermano peque?o sin aliento le contestó:<br>  ?Ahora si que estamos en graves problemas hermano, han secuestrado a Dios y creen que nosotros lo tenemos!|`|c2dc2bd79685630d38ddaf5e142a3f86aa	Estan buenos.<br>  <br>  <br>  1.

If one were able to dig down below the Earth's crust (without the tunnel collapsing on them) or somehow find a cave that led down below the Earth's surface, they would never reach the "center" of the Earth.

b71f8c569587469ad508a2a46bd12580aa	No es bueno hacerlo te cuento porque, en esta tabla invocas a esp′ritus que noo han llegado aun a su plano, es decir tienen temas pendientes, algunos de ellos han muerto por accidentes o sesinatos y aun no pueden acercarse a la luz. En el caso que invocaras a familiares los haces regresar de su plano y retroceden. Pero tambien, pueden entrar espíritus malos o maligno que mientes, por ende se pueden quedar en tu casa o por ahi rondando. Hace unos a?os la mama de mi compa?era de colegio hacia espiritismo en su casa con un grupo de personas que estudiaba cosas paranormales, un día terminada la sesión le llamron por telefono subio a contestar, era para una de las amigas de la reunion se encontraba llamandola en el descanso de la escalera y de pronto alguien la empujo por la baranda, en el segundo piso no se encontraba nadie<br>  y quedo casi parapléjica y en silla de ruedas, lo presencio todo el grupod e la sesión. Era un  espiritu maligno que se habia quedado ahi o que estuvo rondando llamado popr el Ouija. Ten mucho cuidado, esto parece gracioso hasta que te pasa a tí. Esto es real y sucedión en Cusco en la Urb.

Hubiera sido más interesante que "Marilyn Monroe" dijera algo sobre cosas o personas de las que ustedes no tuvieran forma de saber algo, y luego verificar si existía o no alguna relación entre lo dicho y la realidad.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, las predicciones de los espíritus parecen ser bastante ineficaces, ya que según sus palabras "dos de ellas casi se cumplen"; el adverbio conjuntivo "casi" invalida toda la profecía. (Es como decir "Casi gané la lotería, porque salió el 10.000 y yo tenía el 9.999"; en este caso no tengo derecho a usar el "casi" porque no gané la lotería en lo absoluto.)<br>  <br>  Supongo que en la Ouija (como en muchas otras cosas) algunos proyectan sus miedos más profundos; no digo que los escépticos no los tengamos, sino que tal vez los expresemos de otra manera. <br>  <br>  De cualquier modo, y más allá de la total imposibilidad de demostrar la existencia de un mundo espiritual, si usted cree que usar la Ouija es peligroso y no necesita hacerlo, conviene que la evite.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	I give the first guy credit for putting a name on the power though I think it is techo-telekenesis. he has the power to like Sylar see what is broke with something and unlike Sylar fix it with his mind. That is how he can make a phone call with an out of order pay phone and how he is able to get Jessica to become Nikki just by calling out mommy. he can fix her too but se doesn't know that. She only has her episodes when he is not in the area. When she was killing DL at the House, Micah called to her and DL was able to overcome her.

Les atrae toda la cultura del submundo y se identifican con objetos relacionados con la noche, y el propio arte gótico.<br>  Los emo creo que son los jóvenes que se expresan a través de su música, expresan lo que piensan y sus tristezas, supongo que los emos son en su mayoría adolescentes, y por eso surge esto de la expresión, la adolescencia es una edad conflictiva.<br>  Espero que te sirva, y aclaro que no se del tema, sólo dije lo que creía que eran, no tuve intención de ofender a nadie si algo que dije carece de veracidad o sentido entre los que conforman esos grupos.<br>  Saludos!

Con el desarrollo urbano, los campesinos llevaron consigo estos hábitos a las ciudades, propagándose este tipo de comida ligera, que al paso del tiempo se convirtió en el producto culinario preferido de todos.<br>  <br>  El principal elemento del taco es la tortilla que convertirse en taco, se complementa con variados guisos, aderezados con salsas, verduras y otros ingredientes.<br>  <br>  El fuerte consumo del taco en el país ha dado origen a infinidad de variedades:<br>  <br>  De carnitas de cerdo: Provienen de Michoacán y Jalisco, y generalmente son de: maciza, cuerito, buche, nana, nenepil, trompa, oreja, cachete, hígado, tripa, "libro", pulmón y cáscara.<br>  <br>  La salsas adecuadas para estos tacos es la de tomate rojo y el guacamole y encima cebolla y cilantro picados.<br>  <br>  De cabeza de res: Son del Bajío, se elaboran con cabeza hervida o al vapor de la especie, y pueden hacerse de: cachete o maciza, trompa, oreja, lengua, sesos, nervio, paladar con hueso blando y ojo. Se aderezan con cebolla y cilantro picados y salsa de tomate verde.<br>  <br>  De barbacoa: Originarios del centro del país (edo. de México, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo), se hacen con carne de borrego que se cuece envolviéndola en pencas de maguey e introduciéndola en un agujero en la tierra y se acitronan con salsa "borracha" hecha con chile pasilla y van acompa?ados de consomé bien caliente.<br>  <br>  De canasta o "sudados": Característicos de la capital del país. Se venden en canastas, se hacen con tortilla peque?a y no están enrollados, sino doblados. Se les rellena de mole verde, carne de cerdo en pipián, carne deshebrada, picadillo de res, papa con chorizo, chicharrón prensado y frijol.<br>  <br>  Al pastor: provienen de Grecia y Turquía, donde se hacen con tortillas de harina de trigo. Se trata de bisteces de cerdo adobados e insertados en una varilla que se coloca en un asador giratorio. Se aderezan con trozos de pi?a, cebolla y cilantro picados. Se acompa?an con salsa roja, que y verde.<br>  <br>  Indígenas: los hay de charales, gusanos de maguey,camarones de agua dulce, hueva de hormiga o escamoles y hasta de chapulines<br>  <br>  Yucatecos: Sin duda sobresalen los de cochinita pibil, relleno o "but" ***** y escabeche oriental. Pero también son tradicionales los papadzules y los codzitos, de chicharra y castacán, que se aderezan con verdura y naranja agria.<br>  <br>  De mariscos: los hay de camarones empanizados, de jaiba en mayonesa, de pescado frito y otros guisos de mariscos.<br>  <br>  El taco es la más democrática de las comidas mexicanas, por ser ligera, rápida de elaborar y apta para reuniones informales con amigos o fiestas. ?No deje de probarlos en cualquiera de sus variedades!|`|AA12116994	Pura publicidad...de lengua me echo 10|`|e611f0e5cbcc59d0ad410277d791408baa	Es una verdadera estupi des,  no es por menospreciar ese alimento, pero es la campa?a mas desesperada que he visto en la televisión, y peor aun con actores de tercera promoviéndolo,  pero en fin televisa produce televisión para idiotas.|`|082d218a91323055e7d453aa0f383ec3aa	PUES A MI ME PARECE BIEN OTRO DIA MAS DE FIESTA<br>  KE BIEN ""EL DIA DEL TACO""" YO ESTOY DE ACUERDO <br>  Y DEVERIAN DE INVENTAR MAS DIAS COMO EL DIA DE LA ENCHILADA DE LA ALBONDIGA, DEL MOLE <br>  ASI LA PASAREMOS MUCHO MEJOR<br>  POR LO PRONTO A ATRAGANTARNOS TODOS DE TACOS MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM|`|2f9e7dbb4cdbd043bb453f12e9484948aa	ni te sorprendas "telerisa" siempre saca tonterías para mantener cautivos en la mediocridad a sus innexigentes espectadores... <br>  al rato día del tamal y día del nopal!!!! ?? q vergüenza...<br>  NO LO APOYO|`|4206baa7f264d54534e2f220259702cfaa	Yo diario celebro al taco, así que me da igual.|`|563c03b3757d59c4bc40d29039ff78c9aa	Todo eso del Día del Taco es como dices un festejo irrelevante, ?los de Televisa creen que toda la gente es tonta o que?, cada vez la televisión mexicana va de mal en peor, sobre todo Televisa, no sabes ni que inventar para llamar la atención.<br>  Yo no apoyo ees día, se me hace tonto.|`|996dced192d7df4adb4e357451a80221aa	No lo apoyo para nada, se me hace de lo mas naco.<br>  Aparte lo festeja televisa y se va a hacer sus programas a Argentina, trae telenovelas colombianas.

Se sirven con una variedad de salsas que depende del establecimiento donde se adquieran. <br>  Tacos de canasta, tacos sudados o tacos al vapor: son tacos que se preparan con peque?as tortillas de maíz y se calientan con vapor utilizando una olla llamada "vaporera". Estos tacos se distinguen por ser aceitosos, sudados. Los guisos generalmente son de papa, frijoles, carne deshebrada de res y de chicharrón de puerco, papa, mole verde o tinga de pollo. Este tipo de tacos se consumen mucho en el Norte de México en la ma?ana o en alguna reunión en la noche. En la ciudad de México son vendidos por taqueros ambulantes en bicicleta, que llevan un gran frasco de salsa verde o roja (aproximadamente un galón); los tacos viajan en una canasta de mimbre (de ahí su nombre) que contiene alrededor de 200 tacos.

Platicando con un psicólogo, me comentó que buena parte de la depresión tiene que ver con los climas fríos y sin sol, ya que baja la producción de serotonina, sustancia que actúa como neurotransmisor del cerebro e influye en los estados de ánimo. Así que a mayor calor, más ganas de hacer las cosas y hacerlas bien.

Der Film hat mich dann aber ziemlich entt?uscht. Die Interviews mit den Engl?nderinnen zu Beginn und der Protestlauf mit dem Banner “Deutsche h?rt auf zu jammern” - das war noch originell, inspiriert und führte auch zu interessanten Ein- und Ansichten. Der Rest fand ich allerdings sehr fad (Gene, Meme…) bis einfach total mies (K?nig Ludwig, Barbarossa…). Auch die ganzen pers?nlichen Bezüge (die Eltern, die Freundin) tragen eigentlich wenig zum Thema bei und haben mich eher genervt als unterhalten. Da hatte ich mir mehr versprochen: Einen agressiveren, zynischeren und auch witzigeren Kommentar zur Jammerkultur.

Gracias a Dios los creadores coreanos hacen que ss novelas no duren más de 3 meses.  Al parecer es una industria boyante, por cuanto muchos de los artistas son los cantantes de los temas opertenecen a laas agrupaciones que los interpretan.  Son parte del fenómeno llamado K-Pop.  Es una forma inteligente de hacer novelas en realidad.  No hay necesidad de complicar demasiado la trama, con una historia principal donde hay un par de buenos y un par de villanos y 3 historias secundarias, hacen novelas que logran captar la atención y no son culebrones de un a?o o más.<br>  Deberían aprender de estos muchos latinoamericanos que escriben novelas.

The tower was supposedly going to be tall enough to reach heaven.  Everyone in Babel was made to speak a different language and therefore put a stop to the building of the tower and scattering the population into the world.  As you can see it seems to have worked.<br>  I guess the Babylonians attempt to enter heaven or even just the idea that they could build a tower that could get them there made it obvious that they were seriously lacking in the understanding of spirituality. This caused much disfavor and so they were punished.|`|AA10596647	good point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11150101	In the bible, the Babylonians were trying to reach heaven by building a tower.

It depends on the music to be played. <br>  Even it has been done, the tune will be incorrect after playing one music because the string is made of silk, easy to be untuned.<br>  You can also refer wikipedia of the term Shamisen.  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen#Playing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen#Pl...</a>

Aliás, há um ótimo texto que fala justamente sobre esta importante quest?o:<br>  <br>  O homem de bem<br>  O verdadeiro homem de bem é o que cumpre a lei de justi?a, de amor e de caridade, na sua maior pureza. Se ele interroga a consciência sobre seus próprios atos, a si mesmo perguntará se violou essa lei, se n?o praticou o mal, se fez todo o bem que podia, se desprezou voluntariamente alguma ocasi?o de ser útil, se ninguém tem qualquer queixa dele; enfim, se fez a outrem tudo o que desejara lhe fizessem.<br>  Deposita fé em Deus, na Sua bondade, na Sua justi?a e na Sua sabedoria. Sabe que sem a Sua permiss?o nada acontece e se Lhe submete à vontade em todas as coisas.<br>  Tem fé no futuro, raz?o por que coloca os bens espirituais acima dos bens temporais. <br>  Sabe que todas as vicissitudes da vida, todas as dores, todas as decep??es s?o provas ou expia??es e as aceita sem murmurar.<br>  Possuído do sentimento de caridade e de amor ao próximo, faz o bem pelo bem, sem esperar paga alguma; retribui o mal com o bem, toma a defesa do fraco contra o forte, e sacrifica sempre seus interesses à justi?a.<br>  Encontra satisfa??o nos benefícios que espalha, nos servi?os que presta, no fazer ditosos os outros, nas lágrimas que enxuga, nas consola??es que prodigaliza aos aflitos. Seu primeiro impulso é para pensar nos outros, antes de pensar em si, é para cuidar dos interesses dos outros antes do seu próprio interesse. O egoísta, ao contrário, calcula os proventos e as perdas decorrentes de toda a??o generosa.<br>  O homem de bem é bom, humano e benevolente para com todos, sem distin??o de ra?as, nem de cren?as, porque em todos os homens vê irm?os seus.<br>  Respeita nos outros todas as convic??es sinceras e n?o lan?a anátema aos que como ele n?o pensam.<br>  Em todas as circunstancias, toma por guia a caridade, tendo como certo que aquele que prejudica a outrem com palavras malévolas, que fere com o seu orgulho e o seu desprezo<br>  a suscetibilidade de alguém, que n?o recua à idéia de causar um sofrimento, uma contrariedade, ainda que ligeira, quando a pode evitar, falta ao dever de amar o próximo e n?o merece a clemência do Senhor.<br>  N?o alimenta ódio, nem rancor, nem desejo de vingan?a; a exemplo de Jesus, perdoa e esquece as ofensas e só dos benefícios se lembra, por saber que perdoado lhe será conforme<br>  houver perdoado.<br>  é indulgente para as fraquezas alheias, porque sabe que também necessita de indulgência e tem presente esta senten?a do Cristo: "Atire-lhe a primeira pedra aquele que se achar sem pecado."<br>  Nunca se compraz em rebuscar os defeitos alheios, nem, ainda, em evidenciá-los. Se a isso se vê obrigado, procura sempre o bem que possa atenuar o mal.<br>  Estuda suas próprias imperfei??es e trabalha incessantemente em combatê-las. Todos os esfor?os emprega para poder dizer, no dia seguinte, que alguma coisa traz em si de melhor do que na véspera.<br>  N?o procura dar valor ao seu espírito, nem aos seus talentos, a expensas de outrem; aproveita, ao revés, todas as ocasi?es para fazer ressaltar o que seja proveitoso aos outros.<br>  N?o se envaidece da sua riqueza, nem de suas vantagens pessoais, por saber que tudo o que lhe foi dado pode ser-lhe tirado.<br>  Usa, mas n?o abusa dos bens que lhe s?o concedidos, porque sabe que é um depósito de que terá de prestar contas e que o mais prejudicial emprego que lhe pode dar é o de aplicá-lo à satisfa??o de suas paix?es.<br>  Se a ordem social colocou sob o seu mando outros homens, trata-os com bondade e benevolência, porque s?o seus iguais perante Deus; usa da sua autoridade para lhes levantar o moral e n?o para os esmagar com o seu orgulho. Evita tudo quanto lhes possa tornar mais penosa a posi??o subalterna em que se encontram.<br>  O subordinado, de sua parte, compreende os deveres da posi??o que ocupa e se empenha em cumpri-los conscienciosamente. <br>  Finalmente, o homem de bem respeita todos os direitos que aos seus semelhantes d?o as leis da Natureza, como quer que sejam respeitados os seus.<br>  N?o ficam assim enumeradas todas as qualidades que distinguem o homem de bem; mas, aquele que se esforce por possuir as que acabamos de mencionar, no caminho se acha<br>  que a todas as demais conduz. <br>  <br>  Fonte:<br>  O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo, de Allan Kardec<br>  <a href="http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/</a>|`|ab32aa7e13685a228db29553130bb65caa	oq problema nao eh oq ns podemos fazer, mas sim o querer fazer.. pq todos podem fazer algo pra mudar, porem ninguem tem vontade..<br>  <br>  mas com certeza podemos fazer muitas coisas!|`|71aa09520131146424b23f256b771bb8aa	Com rela??o a que?|`|CUqAQImcaa	Ler ou escrever<br>  Comer ou beber<br>  Ir ou ficar<br>  Rir ou chorar<br>  Trabalhar ou vadiar<br>  Dar ou pedir|`|wJQDj6bNaa	Aonde está a segunda parte da pergunta?|`|387801839bc29ee94230a28a9f158df3aa	Depende do que, podemos fazer tantas coisas!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4883ee0c288340cf77066e82c17fed32aa	Depende!<br>   Bjs...|`|DUSVWTaJaa	podemos fazer alguma coisa para mudar....|`|DjkffEvvaa	eu acho que poderiamos pintar nossas caras no computador y sair pela puerta trasera... ninghem vai notar a diferencia...|`|LCE1UesYaa	tudo.....|`|LpCQ8k32aa	sua pergunta está levemente incompleta... hehe...|`|WFMCgKPEaa	Amar as pessoas como se n?o houve amanh?.<br>   Respeitar os limites de cada um.<br>   Ser gentil, e educado com as mulheres<br>   Respeitar os idosos.<br>   E parar de fazer perguntas idiotas.|`|jN7XGohWaa	acho que o pior que vc pode fazer e fazer algo.. <br>  mas se vc quizer pode visitar o site do DIEGO MEIO METRO, la pode jogar aos novos jogos e alem o ajuda ao diego a ganhar milimetros..<br>  bjs!|`|1FM1vko6aa	Sermos nós<br>  sermos felizes<br>  e muito mais

Es un poco tedioso hacer esto pero ayuda muchisimo, y si el problema es que son muy timidos pero normalmente eso ayuda ya que tu eres muy abierta y los puedes ense?ar a ser mas abiertos, sobre el que toca la guitarra me parece muy bien lo unico que tienes que ver es que no sea demasiado parecido a ti ya que eso haria monotona la relacion y tronarian rapido. La verdad yo te aconsejo lo de la lista y aparte ver si realmente a los dos les lates. Te mando muchos besos. Ciao|`|Xq8Js03Oaa	bno creo q si los 2 son tan timidos como dices lo q puedes hacer es pasar un poco de tiempo con cada uno y saber q es lo q le gusta y lo q le disgust asi sabras si tienen tanta kimik xq no mme parece q tengan kinica en tocar la guitarra justo los 2 bno io tmb toco guitarra y eso no kiere decir q tengamos kimik!!!!!!|`|nrPNbERjaa	te la pongo facil si tienes menos de 18 anos gosa la vida y si tienes chance entra con los dos que al fin y al cabo la juventud se hiso para disfrutarla y no estarce preocupando por otras cosas.<br>  <br>  Pero si eres mayor de 18 a?os ahi si tienes que escojer entre uno de los dos pero mejor espera a que las cosas pasen y si ninguno de los 2 te dice nada pues busca en otro lugarque hay otras personas que estan esperando para hacerte feliz.<br>  <br>  Saludos<br>  Eddibar

(en ruso "Тату") es un dúo de cantantes rusas, formado por Yulia Olegovna Volkova (Юля Олеговна Волкова) y Elena Sergeyevna Katina (Лена Cергеевна Катина). Su música podría encuadrarse dentro de las categorías dance, pop y rock, y su mayor éxito a nivel internacional fue la canción All The Things She Said (2002).<br>  <br>  Antes de formar t.A.T.u., ambas cantantes integraron Neposedi, un grupo infantil de cierta popularidad en Rusia.<br>  <br>  Tras el éxito originado en su país, lograron la atención internacional reversionando temas en inglés y llegando a grabar algunas placas en este idioma. Gran parte de su popularidad, tanto en Rusia como en el resto del mundo, se debió a que en sus actuaciones explotaban una cuestionada relación lésbica. El nombre del dúo es un juego de palabras en ruso та ту, que significa "una (sin verbo incluído) a la otra".<br>  <br>  La banda firmó con Universal Music Rusia el 16 de mayo de 2001 tras haberse dado a conocer en noviembre de 2000 en MTV Rusia con su polémico video Ya soshla s uma (He perdido la razón, la versión original en ruso de lo que luego sería "All The Things She Said") el cual mostraba a las dos chicas de 15 a?os besándose explícitamente bajo la lluvia ante una audiencia desaprobante y gris. El público ruso mantuvo la canción durante 2 meses en el Top 10 y por 3 meses en el Top 5. Su segundo video, Nas Ne Dogonyat (No nos alcanzarán, la versión original rusa de lo que luego sería "Not Gonna Get Us"), ingresó al primer lugar del Top 10 de MTV Rusia y al 7° del Top 20. Más tarde vendría el video de "30 minut (30 Minutes)" (30 minutos), la versión original en ruso de lo que luego sería "30 minutes", donde Yulia hace explotar el carrusel que menciona la letra en un mensaje de ira y destrucción por amor. En Dicciembre de 2002, t.A.T.u edita Media:200 km/h in the Wrong Lane, el debut en ingles logra vender 5 millones de copias alrededor del mundo.<br>  <br>  Participaron en la edición de Eurovisión en 2003 con la canción "Ne Ver, Ne Boysia, Ne Prosi" representando a su país y quedaron en tercera posición. De esta canción se filmó un video con extracciones de videos del grupo mezcladas con imágenes crueles de la guerra del golfo, contra la cual las chicas hicieron una explícita campa?a. Con respecto a su actitud lésbica ellas nunca confirmaron delante de cámaras ser lesbianas, sus besos y caricias que aparecen tantos en los videos como en los show en vivo son solo una expresión de felicidad y emoción incontrolable del momento; claro, cabe mencionar también que todo es una forma de marqueting organizado por Ivan Shapovalov productor en de t.A.T.u. en aquel entonces.<br>  <br>  Actualmente, han sacado un nuevo trabajo, con el nombre Люди Инвалиды (Lyudi Invalidi)(Gente inválida) para Rusia y Dangerous and Moving (Peligroso y en movimiento).<br>  <br>  Curiosidades<br>  <br>      * Durante un tiempo se pensó que Yulia habría cooperado con el grupo alemán Rammstein en el tema Moskau!, debido a que la voz que se escucha en el tema es muy semejante a la de Yulia, lo que fue desmentido poco después. Se dice que Rammstein habría ofrecido al grupo, la posibilidad de grabar un tema juntos, pero hasta el dia de hoy no han respondido.<br>  <br>      * Sin embargo, se han hecho varios mash-ups con temas de ambos grupos, incluso en el 2004 se lanzó un álbum de remixes llamado Pruzhinki, donde se pueden escuchar mezclas de ambos grupos en sus respectivos idiomas nativos.<br>  <br>      * El nombre de t.A.T.u. es un juego de palabras rusas que en espa?ol significan "esta ama a esa"<br>  <br>      * Yulia sufre desde 2003 un problema en las cuerdas vocales, por el que se ha visto bastante afectada a la hora de cantar en directo y también se vió obligada a tener que posponer la grabación del segundo álbum Dangerous and Moving (Peligroso y en movimiento).<br>  <br>      * Yulia tiene una hija de 2 a?os:Viktoria Pavlovna Volkova<br>  <br>  Discografía<br>  <br>      * 200 Po Vstrechnoy<br>      * 200 Km/h In The Wrong Lane<br>      * t.A.T.u.

En inglés, también se usa como adjetivo y adverbio.<br>  <br>  La primera vez que aparece el acrónimo O.K es el 23 de marzo de 1839 en el periódico "Boston Morning Post".<br>  <br>  La etimología de la palabra es muy discutida. Muchos creen que es una deformación de la expresión All Correct (por "Oll Korrect"), que quiere decir "todo está correcto", cuyo origen probablemente se remonta a la expresión Oll klor del bajo alemán. También se sostiene que proviene de okeh que en la lengua nativa americana Choctaw significaba "sí". Igualmente, algunos opinan que O.K. son las iniciales de la expresión griega Ola Kala, que significa "todo está bien". Otras teorías indican que okay puede tener un origen africano y que fue traída a Estados Unidos por los esclavos provenientes de aquel continente, o que se deriva de la forma de afirmación latina hoc ille o del occitano oc que significa "sí". Algunos dicen que puede proceder de la Guerra de Secesión, ya que, cuando no había ninguna baja en los campos de batalla, se anotaba 0 killed (ningún muerto) en una pizarra, que en su forma abreviada corresponde a 0K. Este mismo sistema supuestamente fue utilizado también durante la Guerra de Vietnam. Sin embargo, este origen es bastante dudoso, ya que la Guerra de Secesión ocurrió de 1861 a 1865, es decir, 22 a?os después de la primera aparición de este término, en 1839.|`|2e5564f331ba8ed4eba00c3f59e0bd15aa	No se de donde habrá salido, pero la primera vez que la escuché, fue en la película "Un detective suelto el Hollywood 3" donde Edie Murphy visita Wonderworld...

The mimic finished better than James but not as well as Derek.<br>         2. James is not the juggler.<br>         3. Mr. Wilkins did better than Mr. Marlow but not as well as Mr. Cudahy who didn't do as well as the magician.<br>         4. Milton's last name is not Wilkins or Donnelly.<br>         5. The violinist did not finish as well as Mr. Marlow who didn't do as well as Mr. Donnelly.<br>  <br>  With the correct info, the answers are:<br>  1st place Wendell Donnelly, magician<br>  2nd place Derek Cudahy, juggler<br>  3rd place Carl Wilkins, mimic<br>  4th place James Marlow, singer<br>  5th place Milton Jenkins, violinist|`|HIvDN7T0aa	The odd wording of #5 makes me think that there is some information missing.

0EaA6IACaa	i did martial arts for 11 years, and after becoming a second degree blackbelt they asked me to work there as a junior instructor. i was helping teach a junior blackbelt class and there was an uneven number of people in the class for sparring partners, so i partnered with this one guy who was 18 and like 6'2, i was only 16 at the time and 5'3, and he had forgotten his gloves. so i was talking to another junior instructor asking him if my partner ould borrow his gloves and the instuctor told them to start sparring so i turned around and he just decked me right in the eye. yea that was fun.|`|ACCIArkDaa	A black eye...I can't remember.

531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	The belief system in full use. Some believe in cusps, some don't. Either the sign completely exactly at a certain time. Or there is a period of time where both are mixed and no one can say how much. Sort of having 12 more signs. Anyway to test which is true? Seems like Catholic verses Protestants.<br>  <br>  Sure I never can be a believer. There are so many flaws with astrology but people that have "studied" it can not make things clearer. Apparently all flaws can be ignored. Everyone that has studied astrology has never found anything but good things. As an outsider looking in, why don't astrologers conduct a strict research project? Settle the matter once and for all. If they can believe the research.|`|A6agxakwaa	a cusp does exist, it means you will display qualities of each of the 2 signs you fall between. if you read many books that have been published and sold well they all talk about cusps, the book "the only astrology book you will ever need" talks about cusps. so i wouldnt make a whole judgment based on one persons opinion. cusps are a well known and accepted part of astrology|`|CEEQDSCFaa	differences are good, it only means were searching for the truth|`|SjD1aKT5aa	But you really can't have 2 signs, it just depends what time of day you born if your on the cusp of a month. My friend is born Oct 23rd Libra/Scorpio cusp but I didn't even have to ask what time she was born at, I can tell she's a Libra.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|PyAgEejnaa	I think you're technically either one sign or another, but because you're born around the time when a sign changes - you have the characteristics of both.|`|01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	I do believe that cusps exist.

poxjBwUZaa	Simply stated..I agree. Don't get me wrong Kanye is an innovator when it comes to his music production but as far as rhymes... give me a break and his singing well that goes wit out saying. I hear you on this one neo hippi|`|m2UUrurBaa	ashley simpson is trash and in the shadows of Jessica so that makes her Muy Basuro,  and milli vanilli were always suspected of lip syncing getting caught and only having 1 hit was the icing on the cake, kanye on the other hand Can produce his *** off, and he started off ILL, so if he does have a decline in the limelight (which i doubt) it'll take really longer than the other 2 counterparts.|`|jYqAtbOuaa	Theres a difference, although I dont know how much of a difference it is. Kanye used what is known as an autotone. So he was singing, but along side a computer.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	and remember what happened to Vanilla Ice?<br>  <br>  well Hip hop doesn't exist anymore....so they can do as they please|`|D1c8cRM4aa	lol, i don't think you can compare those three, i mean..before Kanye hit his head, lost all his sense and started using an autotone, he was a really good rapper and an even better producer, so...I think people take that into considerations..its not like Ashlee simpson can really sing, and she just felt like doing it..she had to because she sounds like trash..but idk...thats my opinion|`|gPuASwcWaa	He will come back because he has another talent, <br>  <br>  RAPPING!|`|C2olZsNiaa	Kanye is using his own voice but just has digital help.  Milli was using somebody else voice besides his own.  Big difference.|`|MSMem5qYaa	Auto-tune..............thats why......its not really him singing....maybe the other artists could sing, so when fans found out that they lip sinched they were left thinking "wtf?" But Kanye can't sing & most people know that...............except stupid people....|`|CqqH12I8aa	technically, he was singing, with backing, but since it was with autotune, it doesn't count.|`|rPaveCYraa	um... granted, the purpose of a performance is to see  the artist do their thing in person, but a you are REALLY comparing apples and oranges.<br>  <br>  Milli Vanilli was lip syncing songs SOMEONE ELSE sang passing it off as them. So finding out that these people on stage who are ULTRA famous, arent really singing... yeah, all bad.<br>  <br>  Ashlee Simpson... she is a singer... her WHOLE career was to be based on that.. for her to do a performance on Saturday Night LIVE... and not be singing LIVE.... that was just poor judgement on her part but in all honesty, she would have been chastized for syncing or sounding horrible if she didnt synce since she supposedly had problems with her throat that night.<br>  <br>  Kanye is a rapper... regardless of what his new music sounds like.. there are VERY different rules when it comes to a rap performance and a pop/r&b one. not to mention, Kanye has broke down in tear in like EVERY performance since his mother died... maybe he just used it as a lil insurance. but i do know, if i had paid to see him and he was lip syncing, i would be pissed.. i would feel like i could have just turned up his cd REALLY loud @ home for the same effect. but i dont think thats enough for his career to be ended.

0524b0e083af07df3d6efdd21f13d682aa	I respect your opinion, but I think Audioslave is far better than Soundgarden. They have different styles anyway.<br>  Regards!!|`|Vkff8N8Taa	Uhhh no. Soundgarden owns Audioslave.<br>  <br>  From best to worst: Soundgarden, RATM, Audioslave|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	Yeah, Audioslave is probably the most infamous marriage of rock music. Soundgarden I prefer over Audioslave.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I like Audioslave better...|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Soundgarden were better but Audioslave were ok too.|`|yS61H04haa	No, the only think Audioslave had going for them was Cornell's voice.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	I don't think so|`|K5zFPUhsaa	Urgh sick of people hating on audioslave only having heard their more rockier songs like cochise and thinking ratm did it better. Or listening to their softer ones but they of course don't like soft music and therefore start hating the band.<br>  <br>  Audioslave was great but Soundgarden was an essential part of the grunge movement and an extremely influential band. Audioslave's 2 last album's weren't that great although their first was genius. So soundgarden wins. But Audioslave is better than ratm in my opinion. Why? Because all ratm music starts becoming repetitive. Bulls on parade and Killing in the name are great I assure you. But the rest eventually just start to sound the same.<br>  <br>  Listen to Like a stone, Cochise, I am the highway, Out of exile and see their diverse range. But if you still have a doubt listen to The last remaining light. This song just blows you away.|`|bYJVqzlfaa	Y'know, I HATE saying "band a is 'better' than band b", 'cos 100% of the freakin' time y'know what?  They're not 'better' than the other, they're just different from each other.<br>  <br>  That said, while I love all three of these bands, I like listening to Soundgarden more than Audioslave, and I like listening to Rage for the MUSIC more than Audioslave.  I can't stand Zach Of The Roach, so I can't simply say I prefer listening to Rage over Audioslave.<br>  <br>  I also like Chris Cornell's solo albums, but again - they're totally DIFFERENT than what he's done in the other two bands, so it really comes down to what you feel like listening to at any given point in time.|`|CljWuePwaa	audioslave is terrible compared to soundgarden<br>  soundgarden is one of the greatest bands ever|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	No.They're ok though,but Tom Morello's guitar work was twice as good with Rage than it is with Audioslave.|`|r0ngxMWSaa	totally agree with ya|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	Well i have a lot of thoughts on that, but one sentence can sum it up<br>  <br>  'doesn't remind me'<br>  <br>  CHRIS!  WTF???|`|7sqjaYx6aa	no, but they're worth a listen|`|aOuRlpAPaa	To be completely honest, they are not.<br>  <br>  In theory they should be, considering they are formed of members of two of the most influential bands of the past decades...<br>  <br>  I honestly think the reason they are not as good as Soundgarden is because it seems like they were put together by the record label or just as a one off thing, although songs were good in the first album the second album is very similar to the first, and they did not have a unique sound...<br>  <br>  To me it seems as they did not have the chemistry that the two original bands had respectively.<br>  <br>  To sum up, i do not think that audioslave were as good as soundgarden.|`|tjxPEyCYaa	Soundgarden are better. I think Chris Cornell was better in Soundgarden. And Superunknown is one of my favourite albums. <br>  <br>  Audioslave are still good though.|`|C3ab0mHBaa	reckon you're right on the money there mate

Bzq291Uxaa	T Risp anke qui ma t aiuto un po' spiegandoti passo passo quello k dovresti fare x curare la tua voce visto k hai detto k vuoi una mano anke in questo!!!<br>  Sai conosco molte cantanti professionisti k frequentano il conservatorio e vedo cosa fanno x curare la propia voce!!!<br>  Naturalmente a te il canto nn t serve per intraprendere carriera nella lirica quindi sarà un tantino (e sottolineo un tantino) + facile!!! Innanzitutto devi fare esercizi respiratori imparando ad usare il diaframma...ricorda nn si suona e ne si canta mai cn i polmoni grossissimo errore!!! C vuole soltanto un po' d esercizio x imparare ad usare il diaframma...stenditi sul letto e premi (nn cn forza ovviamente) la tua mano o meglio se la mano d un altro sul tuo pancino. dopo d ke cerca d respirare cn la bocca facendo gonfiare solo la pancia e nn il petto (quindi i polmoni)!!! Una volta riuscita in questo semplice esercizio hai preso padronanza cn il diaframma!!! Ora + vuoi arrivare a cantare note alte e più kiaramente dovrai spingere su questo diaframma facendo gonfiare molto il tuo pancino...(molto senza esagerare xke ovviamente x le note alte c vuole + aria e+ forza ma questo dipende anke dalla durata della nota) e se invece dovrai fare note sempre + basse il pancino lo devi gonfiare  leggermente d meno!! Si dice spingere sul diaframma propio xkè nel momento k compi questa operazione t sentirai propio spingere il diaframma!!! Dopo d ke gli esercizi da fare sn accompagnati da una chiatarra o un pianoforte vocalizzi e arpeggi...cioè il tuo pianista ke sia farà dei semplici accordi arpeggi o scale k tu devi riprodurre cn la voce stando attenta all'intonazione...cioè stando attenti k il suono k riproduci nn sia ne calante (basso rispetto a quello del pianoforte) o crescente ( alto rispetto a quello del pianoforte)!!! C vuole buona volontà e molto esercizio e affinerai la tua voce diventando una vera CANTANTE!!!<br>  Spero k ancora una volta sia stato d aiuto...buona fortuna Ci@o!!!|`|CgKWwZzbaa	Beh sinceramente io qualcosa avrei studicchiato e immaginandole graficamente le note (ottave comprese) te le puoi "raggruppare" cosi': -Nota (prendiamo x esempio un do), qual'e' l'ultima nota che conosci? sicuramente un si, e contando sulle dita di una mano vedi che arrivando dal nostro DO al "si" hai gia' passato 7 note, ecco, la prossima, quella dopo il "si", qual'e'? Il Do ovviamente, solo un "OTTAVA" sopra (infatti se conti sono otto ihih).<br>  Le ottave possano essere sia superiori che inferiori, e comunque x risponderti a provare quale sia la nota + alta che riesci a fare potresti provare con uno strumento (CONSIGLIATO PIANOFORTE) e andando passo dopo passo provando assieme al proprio strumento le note che la tua voce riesce a fare...Spero di esserti stato di aiuto!! Ciao ciao|`|adf17ff48263569faff69cab90106387aa	Nn capisco nulla di musica..sorry..|`|5a7732fe64223dc3ade28cf36ae6c346aa	le ottave...nel pianoforte...x esempio sono tipo...<br>  suoni 2 note...dal do fino al re..ma nn il re subito a fianco al do ma il re + alto...<br>  così ci sono le none x esempio suoni il do...e il mi ma nn qll vicino al re ke sta vicino al do ma qll + alto:)|`|5HEFcu53aa	Per capire qual'è la nota più alta che puoi raggiungere mettiti davanti un pianoforte, inizia a suonare le note... L'ultima nota che riesci a raggiungere bene, senza sforzo, o cmq senza "strozzarla", è la nota più alta che riesci a raggiungere... Senza contare il falsetto ovviamente!

No recuerdo un solo día en el que no haya tenído ilusión por algo, o por alguien.<br>  Pero la mayor mala pasada que me ha jugado una ilusión, ha sido creer que en el matrimonio todo podía ser perfecto jajaja.<br>  Astarté|`|5ab58c48ca9fcbe0070f54562f5c75f9aa	Mmmm, yo diría más bien que las ilusiones tienen de herramienta a la imaginación, y esa es la que nos hace esperar más.|`|76b3c05d21399843723b82e12871f96faa	Siempre!!!! A veces parece q la vida o el destino conspiraran contra mi!!!|`|e7dfaca796ba7011cce2eb8eaf82dc4daa	DICEN QUE DE ILUSIONES TAMBIEN SE VIVE. Y YO TAMBIEN, COMO TODO SER HUMANO LAS HE TENIDO Y LAS TENGO. SI ME HAN JUGADO MALAS PASADAS? ALGUNA SI, PERO EN GENERAL, ME HAN DADO PLENAS SATISFACCIONES. POR ESO NO QUIERO NI DEBO PERDER LAS ILUSIONES, PUES ES UN INCENTIVO, PARA SEGUIR RECORRIENDO ESTE MARAVILLOSO CAMINO DE LA VIDA.|`|6099c199b1fcb80dc58694391db8b436aa	si yo tenia tanta ilusión de un bebe y no se diga mi novio estaba super feliz pero ahora me he enterado que mis hormonas están mal y tres meses ilusionada y todo se me ha derrumbado no se si deba decirle a mi novio que no estoy esperando bebe se va a sentir muy mal pero no puedo mentirle tengo miedo de perderlo el tenia tantas ilusiones ya se sentía papa me siento tan mal................|`|HPfTsg61aa	Si muy malas, sobre todo en cuestiones del corazon! saludos!!|`|pA6rWyGJaa	la verdad si, casi todo el tiempo|`|z3c8OuhVaa	Si, seguro y he aprendido a no hacerlo porque la desilusiones suelen ser frustrantes y en la mayoría de los casos dejan huella.

CjWjTTs9aa	lol.  I'd heard that before but forgot how it ended.  Ah, the beauty of old age.|`|v1A9lxuzaa	not bad. Did you know statistically 6 out of 7 dwarfs aren't happy.|`|8d03fcb2a7fe3a4e9c78ebd702581c44aa	quita te la vida|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	hahaha<br>  <br>  A dwarf gets on an elevator and pushes the button to go up, just before the door closes, a hand comes through and opens the door. In steps a very large black man. The dwarf stares and says "Youre the biggest man I have ever seen". The man nods his head, and replies " Im 6-9, weigh 259 lbs., and I have 16 inches, I`m Turner Brown. The dwarf faints! After coming too, the dwarf asks the man to repeat himself. So he does, "I said Im 6 - 9, 259 lbs., with 16 inches, my name is Turner Brown. The dwarf looked relieved and started laughing. For a minute there, I thought you said Turn Around.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	That would have been a heck of a lot easier to understand with some punctuation and capitalization.  See.....<br>  <br>  The 7 dwarfs visit the pope and Grumpy asks the pope if there are any dwarf nuns in Rome.  The pope thinks and says, "No, I dont think so".  Happy starts laughing, so Grumpy asks, "Are there any dwarf nuns in Europe?".  The pope thinks and says, "I don't think so".  So at this point Happy is laughing even more.  Grumpy asks "Are there any dwarf nuns in the world?".  The pope is about to speak when there's a loud laugh and Happy shouts, "Grumpy has been fxxkin penguins!".

yBTTPsbNaa	Yes, i agree that older bands put more feeling and meaning in their songs.

Since radio station deregulation, Queer Channel now has over 1200 stations across the US.

At8D5Xu2aa	In general Pisces and Gemini run into problems--Gemini winds up hurting Pisces' feelings, and Pisces winds up just misinterpreting Gemini's fun-loving comments.<br>  <br>  But who you match with is more a reflection of the rest of your chart.  I'm Gemini, and I've been drawn to many Pisces.  Some of them have driven me crazy (as I have driven them crazy).  But one of them is my best friend, and the other is one of the women I trust most in the world.  So you've got to look at the whole chart.<br>  <br>  In general, though, Pisces works very well with someone who will ground her.  Taurus is a good match, I would think.|`|AA11996502	no. prob. Taurus and Scorpio, but then it also depends on whether ure male or female. I tend to thinjk Scorp, Taurus and Cancer.|`|cd74dd0567e7410c78cea03b7d77a8b1aa	I think Scorpio and Cancer are good for a Pisces.  These are all the water signs.  I think maybe Taurus, too.|`|jrAIBJwPaa	Cancer or scorpio...They are both water signs...|`|FmLIiJzsaa	I am a pisces as well and speaking from experience and from experts I usually like scorpios.. They are the nicest and wittiest but they are not witty in a mean way.  They are extremely passionate about everything they decide to do. They are very sensitive.  So we are usally great with scorpios, My best friends have always been tauruses but they tend to not be as caring as some others but they are very loyal and fun to hang around.  However they are to grounded for me.  I have gotten close to going out with them but I always get too bored before I have a chance.  We are very good with tauruses and scorpios but personally I have a bad habit of always falling for sagittariuses and those relationships not only fail but for some reason all of sags are always really immature and rude too but it never stops for me anyways good luck and remember to find a mate you don't always have to listen to the stars listen to your heart as well.|`|p18K0RLhaa	Generally Pisces woman are best with other water signs like Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.

96fc2ca3737fa35736403df65294c9ccaa	Preferire le penombre, i tagli obliqui nelle inquadrature e i dettagli al posto dei totali, le velature in pellicola e l'uso accorto del grandangolo per definire sogni e incubi di taglio freudiano (citazioni espressioniste alla "Il bacio della pantera" di Tourneur, e "La scala a chiocciola" di Siodmak, entrambi con la stupefacente fotografia di Nicholas Musuraca). Evitare bidonate di sangue, preferendo la suspence allo splatter. Poche musiche, semplici, ripetitive fino allo spasimo (cantilene da bambini alla Argento, composizioni reiterate di poche note alla Carpenter), alternate a silenzi assoluti, a sottolineare i momenti di pathos o la follia assassina. Pedinamenti allucinatori della macchina da presa ("Shining" di Kubrick), carrelli, ora veloci, ora lentissimi, stacchi netti, pochissime dissolvenze incrociate ("Psycho" di Hitchcock), evitare i campi/controcampi (specialmente di quelli "classici", nella regola del 180°, così "consolatori" che spezzano irreparabilmente la suspence).<br>  Lunghi piani sequenza - anche in soggettiva - che trasportano lentamente lo spettatore dalla quiete ai momenti di maggior panico (scena iniziale di "Halloween" di Carpenter) o utilizzati per svelare un particolare o un'identità fino ad allora celata ("La fuga" di Delmer Daves).<br>  Ma, specialmente....smetterla una buona volta con il gruppetto di studenti in vacanza nella casa/baita/villa abitata da un pazzo tanto, ma tanto cattivo (ne han fatti 450 con 'sta trama...e bastaaaaa!!!)<br>  Personalmente, trovo che la famosa scena della piscina in "Il bacio della pantera" citato sopra, sia la quintessenza stessa della suspence d'autore, una scena in cui, in pratica, non si vede nulla, se non il gioco di ombre e le urla raccapriccianti della ragazza in acqua, a contrasto con il ringhiare sommesso del felino, su uno sfondo di silenzio assoluto, il tutto realizzato in un B/N con (infinite) sfumature da antologia Un capolavoro (molto imitato) ma ancora ineguagliato.<br>  :-)))|`|2fe0ae3be5d282a26587e7888857cb02aa	creare gradualmente la tensione; non mostrare l'elemento "orrorifico" ma farne avvertire gradualmente la presenza: pensa a "Lo squalo" per 3/4 di film non si vede; oppure a "Psycho" la madre si vede solo alla fine, prima si vede l'ombra, si sente la voce, si vede la forma sul letto ecc. oppure a "Profondo rosso" in cui vengono mostrati alcuni dettagli del killer. La musica adatta può far crescere la tensione ma a volte anche il silenzio. E poi, a un tratto, in un lampo, compare l'elemento "orrorifico" che fa saltare lo spettatore sulla sedia.|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	prima di tuutto k ci siano cose mostruose nel film k te la fai addosso, tipo fantasmi o esorcismi o assassini mascherati di facce da paura e poi attori convincenti|`|BGBU7NBcaa	Premetto che sono un patito del genere e ti dico che la colonna sonora e i momenti di silenzio cioè la cosiddetta quiete prima della tempesta sono fondamentali. <br>  Un altro fattore è la storia che deve essere ben articolata e non banale per dare ritmo alla vicenda.

MAYBE three decent records and thats IT.  it'll be great to reminisce about them though in ten years when vh1 does their "we love the 00's" specials, huh?<br>  <br>  oh and to "blulephentz_17"... you're just not looking hard enough if you can't find a whole s**tload of great bands here in the united states.  look at the scenes in chapel hill, nc... olympia, wa... omaha, ne... mephis, tn.  if you can't find awesome bands that suit you in one of those scenes, you're just being difficult!  oh and sorry that fall out boy can't respond to YOUR comments on myspace... sheesh there's only probably about 1,000 other people leaving them comments everyday, but they should stop everything and take time out to respond to YOUR earth-shattering comment.  gimmie a f**king break.  grow up.|`|Y989V3iIaa	there alright they've got potential, lmao to the chick who said americas got a good rock scene I'm sorry Fall out Boy are to busy to reply to your Comments on Myspace, Pete Wentzzz is busy having a *****-fit bc he ran out of eye-liner and not the girls wont think hes hot anymore...LMAO SUCK IT!!!|`|js8TTz3Zaa	klaxons are kool....but american bands don't suck.........we've got quite a rock scene buddy|`|UuOcUSSHaa	the klaxons are great! my favorite song of theirs is "isle of her"|`|eddjla1eaa	i've only heard golden skans but i like them, thats one amazing song.|`|rKGutaYHaa	basically, it all depends on how much hype the media gives them and since the media is really trying to make new rave popular, the klaxons probably do have alot of potential.
gDoKx2WIaa	I think possibly it's called My Boyfriend's Back. Was it an 80's movie?|`|qYAcvBtsaa	I think I know what movie your talking about but I can't think of the title, was the movie set in like the 50's?|`|AA11261749	SUZIE Q<br>  <br>  <br>  this has been asked 50 TIMES....use search for question next time!!!!|`|f6cd2d9859952be3ed3b4bbea60008c5aa	It's called "Susie Q"<br>  I used to watch that movie all the time when it was on the Disney Channel.

AA12360626	Oh geez Super Saiyan 5 Goku.Well Super Saiyan 1 and 2 Goku is the same except for longer ends of his hair.Super Saiyan 3 Goku had REALLY long hair and no eyebrows.Then we go to Super Saiyan 4 Goku where he looked like the Oozaru(the giant ape Saiyans used to turn into) and then Super Saiyan 5 it is hard to tell from the drastic changes between Super Saiyan 3 and 4.I think if I had a choice he would turn into something totally different like have long Bluish Gray hair like Super Saiyan 3 Goku but Bluish Gray.And have like you said Broly's built body but be much older.Since becoming older means your wiser you know?Also have to throw this in you know where Goku went Super Saiyan 3 in the Janemba movie Fusion Reborn?And when he went Super Saiyan 3 it was like you could see the different dimensions of space with the color shift?I think if he could change into Super Saiyan 5 it would be like that while he transforms but he could control the dimensions of space.Maybe I am overthinking it and maybe I am not I just love this question.|`|KonsYkrEaa	yeah MASTER-A!!! He will... and i'm sure he can go up to that level if the author wanna do that! I hope so...|`|1mZHUkJQaa	nope... i think he'd look like a super electrified half brolly's size with a huge energy wave surrounding him... with his hair brownish black of course.. have u seen SS4 goku joined with SS4 Vegeta form?? a bit like that just a tad more powerful...|`|m1T9r0ooaa	probably maybe a different hair color that would be cool like blue or red or white hed be awsome!!or he could look like a ssj4 but with yellow hair like a ssjssj4 that would be awsome!!!!
KonsYkrEaa	Goku ssj3 and Brolly ssj1 will beat those both foes!!! I'm sure cuz their power level (these two saiyans) are very strong if they fused together!!!!!!|`|bNAuPamJaa	I don't know to choose which one!|`|m1T9r0ooaa	kid buu would kick all there asses he was toying with goku when he was fighting him if was more seriouse he would have won!|`|AA12360626	Well Goku could beat Perfect Cell in one hit in Super Saiyan 3 form just like Gohan beat Frieza in the one movie.Goku could also have beaten Kid Buu also in his Super Saiyan 3 form but he held back letting Vegeta fight Kid Buu and he wasted his energy.So Super Saiyan 3 Goku can beat them both by himself.Throwing Broly in the mix with Super Saiyan 3 Goku there is no stopping them at all.

Homer è divertentissimo, perché muore migliaia di volte, altrettante volte si ferisce, cade dai posti più assurdi....e non si fa mai nulla!!!! La cosa fa un sacco ridere, ma se lo facesse un vero attore, non mi farebbe altrettanto ridere. Anche Bart è divertente sotto forma di cartoni animato,non ce lo vedo un bambino vero, interpretarlo alla perfezione!<br>  Non so, io credo che un film con i Simpson i carne e ossa, non mi piacerebbe!<br>  Ciaoooo!|`|1e83ca29233943c90f4a753c61cc035caa	Ciao matematico triestino, è da un po' che non ti vedevo....<br>  no, preferisco i cartoni, per i motivi gia spiegati da altri... non ce li vedo bene gli attori, non renderebbero bene la comicità assurda tipica dei Simpson|`|H3YXX7NXaa	a me piace di più in cartoni.....se facessero un film con degli attori vorreii che la loro pelle venisse pitturata di gialla perchè se no che simpson sono??bellissimi i simpson!!!!!!!!!|`|SnRsCStfaa	Sarebbe un sacrilegio!!i Simpson sono cartoni animati e tali devono restare, il film esce cmq il 27 Luglio non a Settembre|`|WjNb9ZmMaa	certo ma gli attori virtuali costano quasi niente mentere quelli veri una cifra.|`|j34XyfeYaa	noo, perchè? i simpson sono un cartone, quindi il fim deve essere un cartone.. si perderebbe gran parte della bellezza dei simpson con attori...|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	meglio con i cartoni xk è piu divertente|`|9fc2cccafdfda83b517f96a762212349aa	No, io lo preferisco di animazione perchè i veri simpson sono cartoni animati.... con gli attori non sarebbe la stessa cosa!!|`|DsJ9m3N6aa	scusami, matematico triestino, però, non sono d' accordo. secondo me, i simpson, sono in simpson.... sarebbe impossibile impersonarli con attori veri, perché diventerebbe una parodia.... stile premiata teleditta.... che così, può far ridere... ma non nel caso della riproduzione verosimile del cartone.... secondo me, cadrebbero nel ridicolo. immagini attori con i capelli sparati, con colorito giallo.... e gli occhi a palla? no, dai.... sembrerebbero mostri.... loro, sono belli così.... originali.... e secondo me.... ci faranno morire dal ridere, perché fedeli al cartone che siamo abituati a vedere! io, la penso così.... poi, per carità... ognuno ha i suoi gusti, e soprattutto la sua immaginazione.... magari, tu, li immagini più belli veri, ed io no.... comunque, ti auguro una splendida giornata. ciao!<br>  <br>  <br>  si, infatti, ho detto che fatta da loro, mi fà ridere... però.... il film, lo preferisco fedele all' originale... tutto qui... il 20 non l' ho  visto, perchè ho il televisore imballato, sto' ristrutturando casa. ti ringrazio, comunque.... ciao, ciao!|`|Ou3pLyLNaa	Assolutamente no, pensa che buffonata, verrebbe fuori una cosa tipo il film delle tartarughe ninja...

Spruzzerebbero del ketchup tutto intorno???|`|f0MHet4saa	sarebbe un po una cavolata perché perderebbero il loro valore!!!!<br>  <br>  questa mi fa sempre ridere di gusto:<br>  dialogo tra homer e il suo cervello!!:<br>  Homer: [frugando sotto il divano] Oh! 20 dollari! Ma io volevo una nocciolina!<br>  Cervello: Con 20 dollari si possono comprare molte noccioline!<br>  Homer: Spiega come...<br>  Cervello: I soldi possono essere dati in cambio di beni o servizi!<br>  Homer: Mitico!!<br>  <br>  eventualmente sarebbe bello farli tipo space jame, o chi ha incastrato roger rabbit, metà cartone meta realtà!!!! sarebbe bellissimo|`|jD0SFpM5aa	Di giallo?

98f258f1f39654c1248187f77712add9aa	In my opinion, Studio Ghibli is the best.  I have enjoyed ALOT of series from different studios (N.G. Evangelion, the Ghost in the Shell franchise, Hellsing, just to name a few). And I look forward to all of the other greats series they will produce.<br>  <br>  But Studio Ghibli is in a league of their own. Studio Ghibli produces truly outstanding movies. The animation is literally the best in the business, wonderful sound tracks and truly engaging storylines (drama, comedy, romance, fantasy...sometimes all in one movie!).  It isn't hard to figure out why Miyazaki Hayao (founder of Studio Ghibli) is considered an unofficial natural treasure of Japan!<br>  <br>  Take the drama and sadness of Grave of the Fireflies...a true tearjerker. Sure it was animation but it didn't play like one and wasn't a fantasy. Then you have Howl's Moving Castle....a fantasy with a little drama and laughs. And a little romance between Sophie and Howl, too!  I could go on and on but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  The range and quality of the movies Studio Ghibli produces is wonderful. And why I think Studio Ghibli is the best!|`|FpDyfW8Oaa	Im not sure about company but DBZ is the most watched anime of all time... Toai or something like that makes it. SO i would suggest that!|`|63efe5f565270c5b1244482a81c9a54faa	Hmm, I'm not really a fan of American animation companies, so I can't really remember what's gone to what.<br>  I think FUNimation, while still doing a fairly terrible job, isn't as terrible as some other companies, and on the occassion has some solid releases. They at least have the knack for being able to pull some fairly popular shows and staying somewhat true to the series. For "popular" shown on television cable they do a fair job.<br>  <br>  However, my favourite has to be between Geneon and Bandai, they just do the best job in the end. Pioneer is pretty good too. :)<br>  <br>  And I'm not sure if I'm beginning to confuse American companies with Japaense, somebody correct me if I'm wrong.<br>  <br>  EDIT: But if you are talking about Japanese companies who produce the anime... I think I'm a big fan of Mad House animations. They do some fantastic things. Studio Pierrot is pretty good too.|`|Ml5kL6ZDaa	If you're talking about import companies (which I hope to work for one day!) I've got to say Viz and Media Blasters are the names I see on most of my titles. "Manga", which ironically enough refers to print media, also has produced a few titles I do love.|`|b0267dd2230bb636d70b384b783fac9daa	I second Studio Ghibli - they have all of Miyazaki's films which are the best of the best imho.|`|fCkY7xCYaa	huh? wat r u people saying? classics= DBZ and sailor moon?! no way. a classic is sumthing u cud always go back n watch or recomend 2 sum1 hu just started watching anime.

Non ascolto mai la radio, non guardo mtv/all music, non seguo i vari chart. Per me la musica vera non si trova li. Quella musica mi fa soltanto star male.

"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ('massacro nel Texas a colpi di motosega') fu auto-finanziato da un gruppo di amici e diretto da Tobe Hooper, che mai seppe ripetere quell'exploit nel resto della sua carriera. <br>  A trent'anni di distanza, quella storia torna sui nostri schermi così come ce la racconta il videoclipparo Marcus Nispel con l'aiuto di Michael Bay e dello stesso direttore della fotografia dell'originale, ossia in maniera molto diversa da come l'aveva narrata Hooper. <br>  <br>  TRAMA<br>  <br>  19 Agosto 1973. Cinque ragazzi stanno attraversando il Texas per andare a Dallas a sentire un concerto. In una stradina di provincia si imbattono in una ragazza che cammina a fatica, sporca di sangue ed in stato confusionale. Decidono di prenderla a bordo e portarla in città, ma la giovane inizia a farfugliare qualcosa a proposito di qualcuno che ha cercato di ucciderla poi tira fuori una pistola e si spara un colpo in bocca. Alla prima stazione di servizio, i cinque si fermano e telefonano allo sceriffo, che chiede loro di raggiungerlo al mulino degli Hewitt. Poco contenti, i cinque ripartono ed arrivano al mulino prima dello sceriffo. Qui incontrano però il piccolo Jedidiah, e mentre lo sceriffo Hoit arriva al mulino e impacchetta il cadavere, uno dei ragazzi si imbatte in Thomas Hewitt, 'Faccia-di-cuoio', che in quattro e quattr'otto ne fa carne da macello... <br>  <br>  Pur ripresentando lo stesso soggetto ed una sequenza di eventi molto simile (d'altra parte è una storia vera, no?), la versione 2003 di "Non aprite quella porta" è un film completamente diverso dal prototipo. Dove la pellicola di Hooper era violenta ma non cruda, questa ci vomita addosso litri di sangue; dove la versione originale era angosciante più che spaventosa, questa si affida ai colpi classici del cinema orrorifico. Dire, come ha scritto qualcuno negli Stati Uniti, che Nispel ha reinventato il film è francamente esagerato vista la chiara non autorialità del progetto, ma ne ha comunque saputo fare un efficace remake in linea con le regole moderne del cinema di genere. <br>  <br>  Nonostante qualche lungaggine di sceneggiatura (fosse durato venti minuti meno non sarebbe cambiato nulla) ed una sostanziale prevedibilità di fondo (più sei un attore famoso più tardi ti troverai in pericolo di vita), il film appassiona e spaventa, pur non riuscendo mai ad esaltare. Qualche tocco di ironia (la testa del nostro 'collega' di "Ain't It Cool News" su un piatto d'argento) ed una strizzata d'occhio ai B-Movies anni '70-'80 (maglietta bianca, tanta acqua, tette grosse...) non fanno altro che aggiungere una dimensione ad un film dedicato esclusivamente ai cultori del genere, decisamente valido ma certo non meritevole di raggiungere lo status di cult-movie. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Percorsi tematici<br>  <br>  Non aprite quella porta - L'inizio - di Jonathan Liebesman; con Jordana Brewster, R.

In mid-1999, Kelis was singing alongside rap troublemaker Ol' Dirty Bastard on his cut "Got Your Money," and her signature Technicolor spiraled Afro sparked critics' interests. Kelis captured feminist desires on her debut, Kaleidoscope, released in December 1999. Two years later, she teamed up with the Neptunes once again for Wanderland. The sophomore effort was only released in Europe — due to political reworkings within the U.S. wing of Virgin — which compelled Kelis to leave for Arista. 2003's Tasty followed and yielded the Top Ten hit "Milkshake," another Neptunes production. In 2006, her fourth album, Kelis Was Here, was released through Jive, led by the duly assertive "Bossy." <br>   <br>  Lyrics below:<br>  <br>  <br>  My Milkshake<br>  <br>  [Repeat x2]<br>  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,<br>  And their like<br>  It's better than yours,<br>  Damn right it's better than yours,<br>  I can teach you, <br>  But I have to charge<br>  <br>  I know you want it, <br>  The thing that makes me, <br>  What the guys go crazy for.<br>  They lose their minds, <br>  The way I wind,<br>  I think its time<br>  <br>  [Chorus x2]<br>  La la-la la la,<br>  Warm it up.<br>  Lala-lalala,<br>  The boys are waiting<br>  <br>  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,<br>  And their like<br>  It's better than yours,<br>  Damn right it's better than yours, <br>  I can teach you, <br>  But I have to charge<br>  <br>  I can see youre on it,<br>  You want me to teach thee<br>  Techniques that freaks these boys,<br>  It can't be bought,<br>  Just know, thieves get caught,<br>  Watch if your smart,<br>  <br>  [Chorus x2]<br>  La la-la la la,<br>  Warm it up,<br>  La la-la la la,<br>  The boys are waiting,<br>  <br>  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,<br>  And their like<br>  It's better than yours,<br>  Damn right it's better than yours, <br>  I can teach you, <br>  But I have to charge<br>  <br>  Oh, once you get involved,<br>  Everyone will look this way-so,<br>  You must maintain your charm,<br>  Same time maintain your halo,<br>  Just get the perfect blend,<br>  Plus what you have within,<br>  Then next his eyes are squint,<br>  Then he's picked up your scent,<br>  <br>  [Chorus x2]<br>  Lala-lalala,<br>  Warm it up,<br>  Lala-lalala,<br>  The boys are waiting,<br>  <br>  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,<br>  And their like<br>  It's better than yours,<br>  Damn right it's better than yours, <br>  I can teach you, <br>  But I have to charge|`|t7ZUrUeLaa	Kelis.

7ce32b2b014e6f482b2fed989240b947aa	Je pense que c'est un film à voir mais à ne pas à mettre entre les mains des plus jeunes car si j'étais tombée dessus il y a quelques années je pense que j'aurai été très choquée.<br>  J'ai apprécié le film car effectivement il faut le prendre au 15e degré. Mais j'avoue quand même que certaines scènes ont été difficiles notamment le petit Grégory et celle du viol (peut être aussi parce que je suis une femme).<br>  Pour ma part je ne pense pas qu'aujourd'hui un tel film pourrait être refait. Dailleurs à sa sortie y avait-il une interdiction particulière?|`|3vBxPqBcaa	génial, normal c'est du belge|`|6e577caceb4b0aa180d4f07f75406e58aa	J'ai bien aimé. Je pense qu'il serait possible aujourd'hui de refaire ce film, au contraire, l'époque joue beaucoup et je pense qu'avec les années, nous avons tendance à nous dérider et accepter plus de choses en matière d'humour. La blague sur le petit Gregory passe sans souci mais je pense que c'est surtout grace au jeu de Poelvoorde (et puis ce n'est pas la premiere fois qu'on fait allusion au petit Gregory... il n'y a qu'à écouter "Plouf" des Wriggles...).<br>  Il y a une scène qui m'a dérangée: celle du viol. Peut etre que je suis tout simplement vieux jeu mais sans pouvoir expliquer pourquoi, elle m'a genée.|`|de9b4a07452d793dc3ca2c1466c09e46aa	Je pense que c'est un film à propos duquel on ne peut pas rester insensible : on aime ou on déteste.<br>  <br>  Personnellement, j'ai beaucoup aimé même si certaines scènes étaient particulièrement choquantes (pour moi, c'était la scène du viol qui a surtout été pénible).<br>  <br>  C'est aussi un film que je ne pourrais pas voir, et dont je ne pourrais pas rire avec n'importe qui.C'est effectivement à prendre au 36ème degré.|`|e23338900a1cc9631e9e3d58d44b1751aa	film qu'on n'oublie pas et qui fait flipper cOmme il fait rire, je me suis souvent aussi demandée si ca ne serait pas compliqué à faire sortir au cinema aujourd'hui un film comme ca quand on pense à tout le bruit qu'a fait la sdortie d'Irréversible....|`|fsHXMH9maa	C est le principe du film : politiquement incorrect !<br>  <br>  Comment un assassin peut-être touchant ... cela reste une fiction assez divertissante qu'il faut prendre au 99 eme degré. En tant qu'amateur d'humour noir j apprécie.|`|lM16eA4Xaa	l'humour sadique et décalé ?a fait du bien aussi.<br>  <br>  J'ai adoré la scéne quand il est chez la vieille cardiaque !!!|`|4f2dc39ae2cc820d0e8bc8fcf4c46585aa	Tu ne te permets rien du tout, tu vas me soigner cette vilaine peau d'abord.<br>  <br>  C'est vrai que la scène du viol pour moi ne passe pas mais le film est globalement excellent. <br>  <br>  Je pense que ce film, depuis la marche blanche et Dutroux, ne peux plus être fait, du moins plus en Belgique.|`|aa8320f3ec4479d8ae69f07ed1ce1d01aa	C'est du Poelvorde...à regarder au 36ème degré sinon t'explose ton écran.<br>  Humour décalé et qui te prend aux tripes...J'aime parce que cela force à prendre une grande inspiration avant.<br>  <br>  Merci Benoit|`|440d52dc71f85f36f67c68ab43c4dd25aa	j'ai adoré et je l'ai vu quatre fois!!|`|PxmcBENxaa	J'ai adoré ce film, la pire scène pour moi, est celle ou il cours dans les bois après le gamin... le ton qu'il utilise pour l'appeler me fait froid dans le dos...<br>  Il fallait oser à l'époque et encore aujourd'hui, peu de gens pourraient le faire...|`|U55l93Jiaa	Film culte pour moi aussi. <br>  Si ce film sortait maintenant et non en 1992, c est vrai que ca poserait pas mal de problèmes.|`|qjD9kmmZaa	c'est un de mes films culte!!!! mais a prendre a partir du troisieme degres voyons!!!<br>  <br>  Cineeemmaaaaa, cinneeemmmaaaaa!!!!<br>  <br>  Malou, nichon!!!!!!!!!!

ohsIulsEaa	the sharpener wasn't connected.<br>  i did not see the others answers|`|nptdlUUqaa	Well the only possible answer is the electric sharper wasn't plugged in!

y2pErbI2aa	Marvel came out with an "Ultimate" Universe back in 2000; it was to use existing characters but introduce them to a new audience without 40 years of continuity to weigh the audience down.<br>  <br>  Naturally, a lot of changes were made. One of these was to model Ultimate Nick Fury after Samuel L. Jackson, who gave Marvel permission to use his likeness. They thought Jackson was a total bad-*** and he would be perfect as Nick Fury for a new generation of comics readers|`|J62umtpDaa	It may have been before, but i believe he became black in the Ultimates (new marvel universe, not sure which Earth number), where his appearance was actually based on Samuel L Jackson's.

Whatever bad stuff he has done, I still think that he is cool. I like him. <br>  <br>  Freddie should be with Effy so that him and Cook will be friends again.

(ti avviso che il titolo nn c'entra un tubo... si basa solo sulla storia)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fantascienza.com/magazine/rubriche/6509" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantascienza.com/magazine/rub...</a>|`|t7YdnyMCaa	A quale finale ti riferisci? <br>  Quello in cui Magneto sembra spostare una pedina degli scacchi con i suoi poteri sopravvissuti, o quello in cui la personalità di Xavier sembra essersi trasferita nel corpo di un altro uomo?<br>  <br>  Entrambi sembrano comunque suggerire che per i mutanti non è affatto giunta la fine, ma credo purtroppo che nessuno sia in vena di girare un quarto capitolo legato ai tre precedenti.<br>  Tempo fa ho sentito parlare dei uno spin-off su Wolverine, ma ho come il sospetto che Hugh Jackman abbia altri programmi.|`|vshAoDtdaa	Secondo me no, anche perché nel terzo episodio sono morti in tanti! Nel secondo, sono riusciti a far resuscitare Jean Gray, ma dubito che riescano a far tornare in vita il Professor Xavier (è diventato coriandoli).<br>  Mi auguro che finiscano qui i film di XM anche se devo dire che mi piacciono tanto questo genere di film.|`|FuLax1rgaa	puo darsi|`|KoRZ6UoSaa	Io l'ho visto e mi è piaciuto molto, ma visto come finiva non credo che ne faranno un quarto, almeno non sullo stesso filone visto che alcuni dei personaggi principali sono scomparsi. I primi tre episodi erano cmq collegati.

While they may not be beyond Kaioken or so, they have many instantaneous powers that could beat a dbz char before they had a chance to power up.<br>  <br>  <br>  and finally you have two extreme badasses of Yusuke Yurameshi from YU YU HAKUSHO and Inuyasha.|`|7ZlIdsdpaa	I don't know any other anime with characters that can destroy the world with a click of their fingers....but there are games that the characters can destroy humanity, Shadow Hearts for example, the characters equipped with...a dagger that can slice the planet in two, or ability to morph to a monster that can end the world with a single thought......|`|AA10208911	First off I think this question was asked to resolve something, not to start an argument between the "DBZ Fan Club" and the average anime fan. On average a real anime fan will probably always hold a special place in their heart for DBZ or at least for Dragon Ball for the simple reason that Anime in the US would not exist if it had not been aired on TV. Anime in the US was almost totaly due to Akira Toriamas extreamly original creation, one that in a strange way bridged the gap in culture with something compleatly new.<br>  Now with that said... Dragon Ball Z is a "Fight Anime", (unlike the original Dragon Ball series: a "Quest Anime") there is little plot and much of it is comprised of fights that last hours and span accross episodes.<br>  You can not accuratly say that any one person or group of characters from one "Fight Anime" is stronger than anothers. <br>  The problem falls in how the characters "Power Up" and/or what forms of Fighting styles are used, or if they are intending the destruction to take place at all.<br>  How about Devil Lady? She was basicaly the incarnation of the Devil for the world in the series, she acctualy kept the earth from being destroyed by an angel (Yeah I know :| Weird but true). Or maybe The Aragmi from Blue Seed?<br>  If you are not limiting your search for characters more powerfull than Goku, to "Fight Animes" (and "Quest animes") then of course there are characters more powerfull than those in DBZ... <br>  Have you seen "Those who Hunt elves"? if so you have to put into consideration that Celsias magic WAS powerfull enough to destroy the world! She just did it by accedent, and it was happaning slowly, that doesn't mean that that same streangth of magic could not be used to do it a lot faster. <br>  Think about it... <br>  Okay enough ranting! What I am acctualy saying is that no Characters from the world of one anime should really be compaired in strength to another Character in some other Anime world! The whole point to the Strength and abilities of the character depend on the situation, and what must be done during that anime to have a begining middle and end that at least holds your interest.<br>  <br>  It's that simple!|`|aDqEnmYnaa	I don't think anyone from bleach or naruto  has characters that are stonger than dbz characters.... but saint seiya has a couple.....

5c2fd5e6c3ab0fef78b0c6e2612ff810aa	mi piacerebbe aiutarti, ma è un po' poco.....<br>  <br>  ciao.<br>  <br>  ti ringrazio per le parole di apprezzamento. Nel tentativo di aiutarti mi sono informato un po' su Canale Italia, ma su un forum dicono che sapere i titoli dei film in programmazione su questa emittente è come andare su Saturno, praticamente impossibile. Non c'è una programmazione affidabile, i film vengono sparati a caso ed i titoli, a volte, manco li fanno vedere, come i titoli di testa e di coda....<br>  Sembra però che i film vengano replicati spesso (anche 2 volte in 10 giorni); un film che hanno mandato in onda in quel periodo sono riuscito a scoprire che è stato "The specialist" un film ambientato nel mondo degli stunt-man e delle folli corse in macchina; accostando l'immagine a quella del tipo che "sterrava" il bosco, chissà, magari è la classica botta di c.ulo che stavamo aspettando ! Prova.

Another good place for bands and musicians to connect is at local music stores, places like Guitar Center and Sam Ash allow them to post on a bulletin board.<br>    <br>  Almost certainly once you find some people interested in the same music and you all get together one of them will have a location for you to practice.  Possibly one will have an extra instrument for you to use but you will need to buy your own to practice when not with the band.  Practicing on your own is more important if you don't already have proficiency with the instrument.|`|hJGdTasXaa	Try talking to some of your friends or family to see if they know anyone who would be interested in a band or i'm sure you could find people on myspace.

If you want to get volumes 15-37 translated, you can download it at www.narutocentral.com after registering for free under the manga section on the left of the page.  They have up to chapter 352, which is the current chapter, chapter 353 is to be released this Thursday.  The quickest way to buy them is at book stores such as Borders(they almost always have a buy two get one free sale) and Barnes and Nobles.  The cheapest I've seen them for sale is on www.ebay.com.  I've seen volumes 1-14 for $24.95 one time!  That's a savings!  You save a lot on ebay, just make sure they're not ripping you off by making shipping too high.  Much luck!|`|603fgfP9aa	352 chapters no idea how many volumes probably 28.|`|AA11093915	37 volumes with 352 chapters|`|j5uRwAsGaa	There are 37 volumes and 352 chapters in all. 14 volumes have been released in the U.S. so far though. From September-December this year, they're going to release 3 volumes each month. Of course, there's a chance that there will be more volumes that Kishimoto-sensei will continue writing and drawing more. A good place to get them is at Barnes and Nobles, Borders, or the Internet.
AA11025918	8th season. Well, the gang reunites for New Year's Eve. And Eric comes home and has an emotional talk with Donna.|`|AA12315431	Eric comes home and he and Donna have a talk but you never really get the impression if they stay broken up or get back together. I miss that show!|`|dVn3GRfGaa	I have the full series box set and this is the synopsis it gives<br>  on the episode guide:<br>  <br>  It's New Years Eve, and the gang's all here, ready to bid farewell<br>  to the '70s and party like is, well 1979.<br>  <br>  As for my synopsis, everybody is basically reminicing about all the<br>  good times they had over the years. And later in the night, Eric<br>  comes home from Africa after missing his original flight. He and Donna<br>  are talking and they kiss and according to the that 70s show character<br>  timelines, Eric and Donna get back together. <br>  It all ends at the countdown which, then, cuts to the licence plate<br>  reading " That 70's Show" and the year is '80.<br>  <br>  this episode made me very sad at the fact that, that 70s show is done.

Rihanna is beaten badly!<br>      * Supposedly someone text Chris's phone saying how they wanted to hook up with the R&B singer. The two began arguing when Chris punched Rihanna in the face with both of his fists.<br>      * Because she gave him an STD.<br>      * Yes it is true - Chris brown beat up Rhianna and she deserved it cuz she could have told him she had herpes.<br>      * They got in a argument because Rihanna thought he was hooking up with a girl because some girl had text him about want to hook up. Neither Chris brown nor Rihanna have herpes.<br>      * Chris Brown beat up Rihanna because he got a call from this girl and Rihanna was right there so she got mad and told him to take her home and then faked a phone call to one of her friends telling them that she was coming home and to make sure that the cops were there so Chris Brown got mad and said, ''you're really f***** up you know that'' and they started arguing so Rihanna smacked him and Chris Brown got even more mad and started punching her and biting her and all that. <br>  <br>  Actually no one knows why he did it; that information wont be released until they cleared up in court. The only people that know right now are the people involved|`|9ouxBeNqaa	3 Theories, 2 don't make any sense, therefore it must be the other.<br>  <br>  1) Rihanna figured out Chris was cheating got upset and hit him.<br>  <br>  2) Rihanna Gave Chris Brown Herpes.<br>  <br>  3) Rihanna broke up with Chris.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind they are now back together (<a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20090228/ten-uk-rihanna-3334b85.html).">http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20090228/ten...</a><br>  If you are caught cheating why would you beat up the other person if you still want to be with them, surely you make excuses ect.<br>  The only theory that makes sense is that she cheated on him, if someone beats you that badly you wouldn't go back to them unless you could slightly understand why they did it.<br>  <br>  If she gave him herpes what did she expect. Herpes NEVER goes, its not like other STIs that can be cured. I think she got off lightly and knows it, hence their reconciliation.|`|pgmszEyTaa	because she's pregnant with his kid and he doesnt want to be a father<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starmagazine.com/rihanna_pregnant/news/15273" rel="nofollow">http://www.starmagazine.com/rihanna_preg...</a>|`|HWkflLpzaa	its because <br>  1. she might of gave him herpes<br>                        or <br>  2. she is pregnant|`|D1KvUs0Waa	she gave him std i think

uahXvRSmaa	I agree that most contemporary music (as in music written in the last 75 years) probably wouldn't be great. There might be some minimalism that would work. Some modern composers write a lot of "bright" "happy" music. Here are some examples of that kind of music.<br>  <br>  Michael Torke- Bright Blue Music (sorry, don't have a link, but you should be able to find an excerpt)<br>  <br>  Philip Glass- Dance IX from "In the Upper Room"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywTXvF_Ll4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywTXvF_L...</a><br>  <br>  There's probably some other minimalist music you can use to set a mood. Philip Glass wrote a lot of other catchy stuff. His more recent stuff is a bit less bouncy.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I can think of any modern opera that would work, but definitely consider "Make Our Garden Grow" from Leonard Bernstein's Candide (which is sometimes considered an opera). It's a beautiful song, and perfect for a wedding.<br>  <br>  Here's an instrumental version for brass quintet, though I'm sure arrangements of it are available for any instrument or ensemble.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37d7eVlrHYY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37d7eVlrH...</a><br>  <br>  There is some 20th (or very late 19th century) classical music that would be cool to use however. A lot of it sounds very modern.<br>  <br>  I just posted this suggestion in response to another question about music to use at weddings. It's a bit different from the wedding march by Mendelssohn or Pachabel's canon, but it's cool. It definitely sounds modern. It's called L'Catedral Engloutie (The Sunken Cathedral). It was composed for piano by Claude Debussy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geejD5Dksk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geejD5Dk...</a><br>  <br>  There's also version for full orchestra arranged by Leopold Stokowski, and I'm sure there's an arrangement for pipe organ if you'll have an organ available. <br>  <br>  Well those are a few suggestions. Best of luck with the wedding preparations!|`|sNI3xD7Taa	I agree that most contemporary music that is written for operas or orchestras tends to be very dissonant or atonal, but that doesn't mean you can't find something.  Listen to some compositions by Samuel Barber, he was a popular 20th century composer and has some gorgeous melodies, but I don't think you'll find any "different" kinds of instruments used.  <br>  <br>  If you decide to go with just traditional music, check out the list on the wedding goddess website.|`|qvyI35r8aa	contemporary classical people are terrible for weddings. Compositions either suck (Yiruma) or incredibly atonal (dissonant)<br>  <br>  The romantic style is your best guess. If you can find an orchestra for it, Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers would make a great wedding piece. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK3ELt0zPLg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK3ELt0zP...</a>|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Contemporary with whom?

2bQrzolfaa	Indeed it is, though a title is unknown and whatnot.<br>  <br>  "The new film, currently existing as a treatment by the Wachoskis, follows Portman's character Evey travelling to the United States which has collapsed due to civil war. No loglines have yet been released though its been said Portman's character will essentially act as V did in this one, a mentor to others of why a little revolution now and then can be a good thing. The film's anatagonist will be an emerging new American government that will 'quite closely' resemble the current Bush administration.<br>  <br>  No word yet on whether the Wachowskis, Director James McTiegue or star Natalie Portman will be back in their original capacities though talks are apparently underway and all have expressed interest. A title exists but is being kept secret for now, though a likely candidate has been found online."|`|25b27e33300b1477b4e5fe0d575aae9eaa	I havent heard anything about a second movie coming out for that one!|`|kJ0ykhpLaa	No, there is only one graphic novel, at least by the original writter, and so theoritically no.|`|qQti7Uvxaa	They're thinking about it.|`|vDTwKm6Iaa	It would be good to get another one, so I will finally get the idea.|`|ea2f4ace3bd3183f3fc411792f0db2f0aa	I would doubt it.

En realidad necesitan personas más fuertes a su lado, la dependencia puede presidir esta frágil relación. Aunque se encari?en descubrirán que no son el uno para el otro. Existen intereses comunes y por suerte logran ponerse de acuerdo. Se llevan bien, pero no acaban de cuajar como pareja, les falta filing y alegría en su relación. Las inseguridades les frenan, carecen de decisión para afrontar los imprevistos. La actitud de VIRGO es de criticar y eso a CáNCER le pesa demasiado, porque CáNCER toma las cosas emocionales y tiende a pensar con el corazón. VIRGO es mas realista y piensa con la cabeza. En el plano sentimental y sexual lo mas importante es que compaginen algunos aspectos, principalmente la comunicación y ser mas tiernos, para no criticar ni molestarse. VIRGO es un poco mas sexual que CáNCER así que por ese lado no se preocupen, arreglaran sus diferencias en la cama.|`|qgkiLjHYaa	Es una tradición mundial: el virgo da cancer. Combátelo.

umMyGgKJaa	I don't know of any specific web sites, but if there are "adult entertainment" services in your area, they can, at the very least, hook you up with someone who can dress as a cop and bring handcuffs and so forth.  Usually, these types of places are in the business of providing strippers for parties, but I have "heard" that they also do these dress-up fantasy kind of things.<br>  <br>  Now the police car with lights and siren might be more troublesome.  Do you know any cops?|`|LxP9HIqQaa	I DON'T THINK SO THAT THERE'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT.|`|328134962af14790685874a9ce55f54aaa	Eh no.

Ptnk9Zbsaa	ehehehe... scusami ma io l' ho visto parekkio tempo fa qndi sn 1 pò arruginito... credo ke sia molto carino ma difficile da capire.... se nn sbaglio tt ciò ke succede nel film è un sogno, giusto??? Scusami.... potresti ri-raccontarmi la fine??? Se nn sbaglio m ricordo d lui alla festa cn la sua tipa e poi l' esplosione della casa.... dopodikè lui si alza dal letto cm fosse un sogno.... se m rix forse m s riattiva la lampadina e saprò risponderti!! <br>  ************************<br>  AH no, ho riletto la trama da wikipedia, ed ho trovato qlkosa di interessante.... la trama è lunghissima, ma queste 2 righe molto esplicative: <<Donnie Darko è, in realtà, morto nel mondo reale il 2 ottobre del 1988, ma tutte le persone coinvolte con lui in quei 28 giorni hanno ora come un'inconscia consapevolezza di quei giorni vissuti in un "universo tangente">> e poi queste 2 righette:<br>  <<(Per capire alcuni concetti del film occorre conoscere i principi di base che stanno alla moderna fisica, in particolare i concetti di Spazio-tempo e dei Wormhole. Per capire bene il film è necessario trovare e leggere su internet il libro di R. Sparrow: "La filosofia dei viaggi nel tempo".)|`|9PmJbxfnaa	lho visto pure io! film bellissimo e difficile da capire!! bisogna vederselo si e no5 volte!!! la trama è il viaggio nel tempo o meglio il ritorno nel passato... tutto si basa su qst e su come una persona influenza se viva molte scelte d altre persone.. donnie da vivo ha creato un casino (è morta la fidanzata, è andato in carcere qllo là e altro) ma da morto ha lasciato tutto alla normalità...|`|HAYrRZXwaa	guarda... anche io ero in qsta stessa situazione, allora mi sono confrontata con una mia amica e avevamo dedotto insieme che tutto il film fosse basato su una specie di sogno che lui fa, non mi ricordo se prima o dopo l'impatto con l'aereo.. e qsto è quello che lui crede di vivere! assemblando i rumori che sente all'esterno con quello che già conosce e vive! cmq e lo scopri fammelo sapere!|`|6e561b5a9a12c3992c10bdf1f851c397aa	ho interpretato che il regista ci ha preso per il c u l o a tutti|`|a695e853906417dc715709211db371d0aa	Io l'ho interpretato così.<br>  DD è un ragazzo sonnambulo, disturbato e teppista. Un giorno tenta un colpo in casa di Nonna Morte ma gli va male e la sua Gretchen muore, mentre lui per fuggire deve addirittura uccidere Frank. Sconvolto dai rimorsi si reca presso un burrone per suicidarsi, ma per caso proprio lì si sta aprendo un Wormhole e lui ci finisce dentro, riapparendo nel passato, confuso più di prima. Ripercorre la sua esistenza ma ripete gli stessi errori e ricade nel Wormhole. Tuttavia ogni volta riesce a recuperare frammenti della sua memoria (che gli appaiono sotto forna di Frank-coniglio e dei vermoni trasparenti delle persone, che infatti saltano fuori solo nei momenti importanti, quando lui DEVE trovare la pistola, DEVE baciare Gretchen, DEVE allagare la scuola, DEVE incendiare la casa del guru pedofilo, DEVE entrare nella cantina di Roberta Sparrow/Nonna Morte, ecc. perchè sono eventi incancellabili della sua vita), sicchè l'ultima "volta" (quella che ci viene mostrata appunto nel film) trova la forza di capire dove si trova e di compiere una scelta coraggiosa: interrompere il Loop temporale (eterna ripetizione - una chiara metafora dei giorni tutti uguali dell'adolescenza di provincia) lasciandosi schiacciare dal reattore. Reattore il quale essendo di peso diverso da DD è finito, pur risucchiato dallo stesso Wormhole, più...vicino indietro nel tempo rispetto a lui (infatti entrambi vengono risucchiati lo stesso giorno, ma DD ricompare l'1/10, il reattore la notte dopo).<br>  Attenzione, però: se cerchi bene puoi trovare qualcosa come altri 9 possibili significati. Per questo è considerato così importante fra i film contemporanei: per la sua polivalenza.|`|0xMI5Hh7aa	t accendo una stellina...sn nella tua stessa situazione!!! e il bello è...ke mi è piaciuto!! ma alla fine, il coniglio gigante era il tizio a cui spara alla fine ma poi...xke lui muore dal crollo d un motore aereo sopra la sua stanza? e xke nessuno s ricorda d lui...?!?!?|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	a me personalmente nn mi è piacuito xk nn si capisce un tubo della trama e poi ci sono personaggi k sn inutili, e poi dalla trama mi aspettavo di piu..... voto 3|`|504a0029498ac7f0492cd466dff8ef93aa	Anch'io ammetto di non esser riuscita a capirlo e ad esser sincera non ho finito neanche di vederlo...ora mi state incuriosendo, magari ci riproverò a vederlo...cmq stellina x la domanda! :o)|`|b31b52ce83f6bc2dd5ea7f8b4d8d9531aa	quando c'è la caduta dell'aeroplano all'inizio lui non è in camera e si salva perche il coniglio che immagina l'aveva chiamato ma cosi non salva la ragazza(non ricordo bene che succede).<br>  per evitare questo preferisce morire tornando indietro nel tempo e non andando dal coniglio cosi lui morirà.<br>  non è difficile da capire.Certo è un film fantastico non dovete essere razionali ma è molto romantico.<br>  Un film simile e ancora piu bello è THE bUTTERFLY eFFECT.<br>  io adoro questo tipo di film perche nella loro fantasia c'è un collegamento alla realta ,ai sentimenti e ti lasciano qualcosa se li capisci..
gTR0i9weaa	What songs are you searching for, and how are you searching? Sometimes when you narrow it down (type the artist in the artist section, and the title in the title section) it helps. Also, sometimes you can type the artist in the title section to search.<br>  <br>  But most-likely, if you've exhausted all of your search options, then people just don't have that song in their files.<br>  <br>  I also recommend ditching Limewire for Frostwire. Same software, by the same creators, only BETTER. Less trash, and more legitimate files. ^___^<br>  <br>  But... yeah. When it comes to any P2P program (like Limewire), it can be hit or miss at different times, because if somebody has a song in their file, but they do not have Limewire open, then that file cannot be shared. Or sometimes, people will simply not have the file at all.<br>  <br>  Hope that made sense and helped somewhat! ^^|`|n18o3U3Yaa	it means you an't find any sources who has that particular song

Una fomra de cortarla e impedir que se siga haciendo (algo coimo Dragfon ball y Dragon Ball GT. la primera es genial, la última es muy mala). Y no porque sea malo, sino por darle un buen final a la serie y personajes.<br>  <br>  Ejemplo: Seiya de Pegaso muere. A mí s eme hace un final grandioso para un tipo que se pasó la mayor parte de su vida entrenando y peleando por Saorinútil... Su sacrificio fue heroico y aunque le hubiera dado otros matices, la muerte que tuvo fue buena, porque muere joven y se inmortaliza.<br>  <br>  recuerda que los grandes genios mueren jóvenes XD<br>  <br>  Ok, los finales felices son chidos, pero de vez en vez hace falta un final inesperado o algo que salga de lo común, para saber ap`reciar más una serie (la polémica es muy buena en estos casos) y hacer de un anime cualquiera, un anime de culto... ve Evangelion o X 1999.

3SQ5RNIPaa	nn è un gran ke nn ti consiglio di vederlo...senti a me...ciao|`|LORfizhWaa	molto molto bello...il regista è Tony Scott (fratello del mitico Ridley Scott) e devo dire che è riuscito molto bene come film, anche se lui è un pò soffocato dell'ombra del fratello...Domino Harvey è esistita veraemente, un ex modella figlia di un attore (Lawrence Harvey) divenuta cacciatrice di taglie e morta nel 2005 per un overdose, poco prima che uscisse il film...<br>  il film è abbastanza controverso, splatter e perverso, tanto che Quentin Tarantino l'ha definito il miglior film del 2005...<br>  un cast molto buono..Keira Knightley (che dimostra di essere un'attrice molto brava per la sua giovane età), Mikey Rourke (John di 9 settimane e mezzo),  Lucy Liu, Chistopher Walken, Mena Suvari (indementicabile la scena di "American Beuty" di lei nuda sulle rose coperta nelle parti intime dai petali) e Macy Gray...non ti anticipo niente sulla trama, devi vederlo te...alla fine del film si vede la vera Domino Harvey, con i capelli corti e vestita in modo maschile alla Annie Lenox, sorridente che saluta...la cacciatrice di taglie non vedrà mai il film dedicato a lei perchè morirà prima a 35 anni per un overdose di barbiturici...|`|6e2a64594546464b3adab4a7a8844e1eaa	E' la prima volta che non so dare una mia opinione.<br>  L'ho visto. All'inizio ero entusiasta, solitamente non mi piace Keira, non trovo in lei tutto quello che le si attribuisce, mettendo in ombra attrici ASSAI migliori! Ha sempre avuto la fortuna di trovarsi in cast ECCEZIONALI, con attori colmi di esperienza. Cmq.. A primo impatto mi è piaciuto, anche il modo in cui recita lei, diverso (anche se la mania di sporgere il labbro, alla Spears,  da ragazza sexy non le passerà mai -_- bhà..) dal solito. Fa la dura. Alla fine mi ha lasciato la sensazione di aver speso soldi per la solita americanata: poca trama, troppo di tutto il resto. <br>  Non so se mi sono spiegata.. E' tutto perfetto, inquadrature e fotografia particolari, ma alla fine ti lascia .. come posso dire? Nulla, non ti lascia nulla!<br>  Preferisco semplice, ma forte, che complicato e frivolo.. <br>  Poi.... de gustibus.<br>  Molto bello con Keira è "The jacket" con il divino Adrien Brody.<br>  <br>  Fammi sapere cosa ne pensi di Domino!<br>  Bacio_<br>  Zoe89|`|96fc2ca3737fa35736403df65294c9ccaa	Il film è comunque interessante.... specie nella regia di Tony Scott (anche se a tratti sconfina un po' in alcune trovate tipiche alla Tarantino). Molto carina la trovata di mettere Ian Ziering e Brian Austin Green (quelli dei telefilm culto Beverly Hills), che, ormai cresciutelli, fanno il verso di se stessi, come attorucoli ormai semi-dimenticati e senza scritture. Interessante anche le citazioni dai film in B/N interpretati da Lawrence Harvey (che è il  vero padre di Domino Harvey, appunto, visto che la storia della sua vita ripresa nel film è vera), specie nel frammento di film "Va e uccidi- The Manchurian Candidate" del 1962, ottimo spy-film di Frankenheimer.<br>  Come spesso accade nel suo cinema, Tony Scott usa a manetta il sistema di flash-back multipli per rievocare le vicende (il film infatti comincia praticamente dal finale...) con un discreto uso di solarizzazione (altra sua nota caratteristica), ossia la sovraesposizione di luce nelle riprese (che appaiono così "sparate", iperrealiste e vagamente allucinatorie). <br>  Ti consiglio comunque di vederlo per farti un'idea (magari anche solo della bella tecnica di ripresa). La Knightley è bravina e molto "sbucciata" (nel senso di ammaccature varie!!) e attorniata da bravi comprimari.<br>  Buona visione!! :-)))|`|dZiUVfJ5aa	Carino però vedilo perchè vale la pena perdere solo 2 ore di vita|`|geaWHxdKaa	mi piacerebbe vederlo ancora ancora|`|mQks7Iytaa	Io l'ho visto...abbastanza carino...!!

Il primo è per via del cast...nn ci sarebbero tutti gli attori (mi riferisco a Keira e Orlando)e io mi sono affezionata ai loro personaggi e quindi il film nn sarebbe lo stesso per me senza la dolce e sfortunata coppia per nn parlare del calo artistico che il film subirebbe senza qst due attori.<br>  inoltre credo che appunto poichè è una bella trilogia deve rimanere tale, un altro film appesantirebbe troppo la saga, anche perchè ormai tt i nemcii sono stati scoffitti e crearne dei nuovi spezzerebbe la continuità della storia.<br>  infine, come risposta alla tua domanda, io scrivo un bel SI..ma rimedio a ciò guardando ogni sera il primo film  e ogni fine settimana alterno il secondo con il terzo.....<br>  ciao....|`|mMcsdA1Aaa	sinceramente un pò mi mancano...soprattutto Jack Sparrow!...xD<br>  ma io spero ke non ne facciano più di film,se no si rischia di rovinare quella ke è stata un bella trilogia....dopo gli attori si fissano troppo su quel personaggio!!!<br>  come finale,va bene quello del terzo!<br>  perkè andare a complicarsi la vita?? baci.

vyWFjSoCaa	francamente di questa storia non so niente. però ho sentito molte volte alcune persone parlare di esorcismo etc etc..e dicono che sia vero! per esempio mi hanno raccontato di una signora (che abita nel mio paese) che un giorno cominciò a sentirsi male ma dopo migliaia di cure o analisi non riuscivano a capire cosa avesse. per esempio le prendevano degli attacchi di pazzia e si buttava dal terrazzo(5° piano) e quando atterrava non si faceva niente. io ti dico che mi sembra un pò paradossale...io se non vedo non credo quindi francamente per me non esesitono gli esorcimi o altre cose affini. però ne sento parlare spesso anche perchè mia cognata e mia suocera frequentano parecchio il mondo della chiesa!!|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	si è vera x informazioni vai qui wikipedia.it scrivi sulla barra di ricerca l'esorcismo di emily rose e ti racconta la storia vera....ciao|`|z2WPUwSwaa	l'ho visto anch'io un bel pò di tempo fa, penso di si, dicono sia una storia veramente accaduta.

Riguardo al film, prefererei che non venisse fatto, perchè ultimamente i film tratti dai libri vengono stravolti e adattati a piacimento del regista.

AA11522010	wait a sec...here:<br>   Nicholas Jonas was born on September 16, 1992, in Dallas, Texas. <br>  <br>  He has been singing ever since he was little and has starred in several Broadway musicals.<br>   Some of them include Beauty and the Beast and A Christmas Carol. <br>  <br>  His band, the Jonas Brothers, include two of his brothers, Kevin and Joe. The band actually started as a solo Nick is Christian.<br>  <br>  According to Kevin, Nick can't stand it if someone wears his socks, he flips out and its "funny". <br>  <br>  Faith is very important to his entire family. <br>  <br>  Nick's purity ring has 'Poned' inscribed on it which means 'to be let down or disappointed'. <br>  <br>  He was discovered in a barbershop while getting his haircut. <br>  <br>  Once lost his purity ring and got a new one made at Disney World. <br>  <br>  His nickname is Nick J.<br>  <br>  Some people say "Nick J is off the chain." <br>  <br>  His favorite drink is 7-11's Slurpees. <br>  <br>  His favorite sandwich is an Italian Hero.<br>  <br>  His favorite fast food restaurant is McDonald's. <br>  <br>  His favorite movie is Finding Neverland.<br>  <br>  His favorite song is "Superstition" by Stevie Wonder. <br>  <br>  Nick has an iPod Nano. <br>  <br>  He hates it when a girl is afraid to eat in front of him. <br>  <br>  He loves Red Bull (an energy drink). <br>  <br>  His most prized possession is his golf set.<br>  <br>  He can breakdance.<br>  <br>  When Nick was in the Broadway play Beauty and The Beast, he played Chip. <br>  <br>  He had a sidekick (cellphone) and he got it decorated but he recently got an Iphone.<br>  <br>  Nick can juggle.<br>  <br>  Nick's cologne is Abercrombie. <br>  <br>  Nick wrote the song "SOS" based on a past experience. <br>  <br>  Like Kevin and Joe [Jonas], Nick wears a purity ring. <br>  <br>  Nick's favorite song to play in concert is "Year 3000." <br>  <br>  He once missed a family vacation to be in a Broadway play. <br>  <br>  Nick was originally going to have a solo album but when the record company heard about his brothers (Joe and Kevin's) musical talent they formed the band "the Jonas Brothers". <br>  <br>  His Chinese horoscope sign is the monkey. <br>  <br>  His favorite ice cream is cotton candy. <br>  <br>  His favorite actors are Matt Long and Keri Lynn Pratt from Jack and Bobby. <br>  <br>  His favorite sport is baseball. <br>  <br>  Nick's favorite baseball team is the New York Yankees. <br>  <br>  He and his brothers (The Jonas Brothers) are spokespeople for "Baby Bottle Pops". <br>  <br>  Nick keeps his closet surprisingly clean. <br>  <br>  Nick loves Green Tea Frappuccinos. <br>  <br>  Nick's favorite candy is Sweet Tarts and gummy worms.<br>  <br>  If he were a crayon he says he would be the color, Royal Blue. <br>  <br>  His favorite cereal is Cheerios. <br>  <br>  His favorite singer is Stevie Wonder and his favorite band is Switchfoot. <br>  <br>  His most ticklish spot is his feet. <br>  <br>  His favorite food is steak. <br>  <br>  Nick has brown hair and brown eyes. <br>  <br>  He is the youngest member of his band, The Jonas Brothers. <br>  Nick wrote the song Please Be Mine. This was when the idea of Kevin and Joe [Jonas] joining Nick with his record deal came up. <br>  <br>  Nick plays the guitar, drums and keyboard. <br>  <br>  Some of his hobbies includes playing baseball, collecting baseball cards, tennis, songwriting and music <br>  <br>  Nick enjoys watching Lost and the Sports Center on ESPN. <br>  <br>  Nick's favorite color is blue. <br>  <br>  Nick has three brothers, Kevin, Joe and Frankie. <br>  <br>  Nick has Type 1 Diabetes. He was diaganosed in 2005 while he was out on tour. <br>  <br>  Nick's most prized possession is an Olympic Gold Medal. <br>  <br>  Nick's celebrity crush is Miley Cyrus, and once dated her in summer of 2006. <br>  <br>  His hidden talent is playing the drums. <br>  <br>  The first thing Nick notices in a girl is her eyes. <br>  <br>  As of 2007, Nick is 5'6" (1.68 m).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|GG6ivBuRaa	last year, I think|`|SxM6xMBEaa	I Luv Disneyland is wrong he didn't go out with AJ his brother Joe did. Nick has went out with Miley Cyrus though, but their not together anymore.

f03911640379bc53300069e9f0904a83aa	qualcosina di film horror ci capisco .......... permettetemi:<br>  vanno benissimo le citazioni per cio' che concerne gli zombie italiani L' aldila' di Fulci,Virus - l' inferno dei morti viventi di Mattei,Zombi horror - Notti di terrore di Bianchi sono dei veri e propri film Culto (anche Incubo nella citta' contaminata di Lenzi e' una buona chicca, anche se non si tratta proprio di zombi),e per cio' che concerne gli zombie tedeschi:Zombi 90 di Schnaas(forse meno),Premutos di Ittenbach e Redneck zombie sono validi dal punto di vista visivo........ qui pero' siamo proprio nel trash puro.<br>  Diciamo che mi avete sorpreso piacevolmente.<br>  Ancora qualcosina da aggiungere ci sarebbe.Secondo me,un film molto carino e' DIMENSIONE TERRORE - Night of creeps,l' ho rivisto da poco e mi sono divertito molto.<br>  Tra l' altro ho notato numerose similitudini con il recente SLITHER di James Gunn(2006) che anch'esso merita di essere citato.Come dimenticare poi Re - Animator di Stuart Gordon.Questi 3 tra i titoli americani piu' commerciali sono da vedere, oltre ai gia' citati Bad taste e Splatters gli schizzacervelli del neozelandese Jackson.Volendo anche Non si deve profanare il sonno dei morti si fa guardare.<br>  Altri che ho sentito nominare tipo Demoni 3,Plaga zombie,Ater death,Killing birds,Zombie nosh ...... beh a dire la verita' non li consiglierei neppure al mio peggior nemico,a mio parere non sono ne' carne ne' pesce,non meritano dal punto di vista splatter e non mi divertono(penso siano queste le 2 prerogative principali se uno vuole godersi un film di questo genere).<br>  Se invece entriamo nell' underground,forse non mi fermo piu'.<br>  Ce ne sono di molto belli e di molto splatter.Tra quelli che potresti reperire piu' facilmente posso indicarti:<br>  -The dead hate the living di Dave Parker<br>  -Bad karma di Alex Chandon.Questo un vero appassionato di zombie movie non puo' non citarlo.<br>  -L' occhio nel triangolo,interessante, la tensione conta piu' degli effetti speciali quasi inesistenti.<br>  -I padroni della terra - Death run.Non ho mai visto nulla di piu' trash in vita mia(anzi forse Bride of Frank,ma non trattasi di film zombi)IMPERDIBILE.<br>  -Bone sickness di Brian Paulin<br>  -The dead next door di Bookwalter.<br>  Questi sono tutti film low budget,diciamo che non passeranno alla storia come capolavori ma di sicuro ti diverti.<br>  Ciao.|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	maial zombie<br>  l'alba dei morti viventi <br>  la terra dei morti viventi<br>  l'alba dei morti dementi<br>  resident evil 1-2-3<br>  the invasion(uscita a settembre al cinema)<br>  slither|`|HrdylPxVaa	guardati maial zombie hauhau|`|ijh9tcN8aa	maial zombie!!!!<br>  parla di zombie arra.pati, fa morire dal ridere!|`|22A4O6Slaa	"zombi 2" di lucio fulci, "brain dead" di peter jackson, "redneck zombies" della troma movies, "paura nella città dei morti viventi" sempre di lucio fulci, "zombi holocaust" di marino girolami (o con lo pseudonimo frank martin), "zombi horror" di andrea bianchi( o andrew white), "le notti erotiche dei morti viventi" di joe d'amato, "l'aldilà.... e tu vivrai nel terrore" ancora il grande lucio fulci, "virus" di bruno mattei/vincent dawn, "incubo sulla città contaminata" di umberto lenzi, "zeder" di pupi avati, "after death" di claudio fragasso/clyde anderson, "killing birds" di joe d'amato e claudio lattanzi, demoni 3 di umberto lenzi (il film non ha niente a che fare con i precedenti film demoni e demoni 2 di lamberto bava). Questi solo i film italiani, ti consiglio comunque di cercare nel vasto archivio della troma movies.|`|Uf15TX6Qaa	Il film migliore che ti posso consigliare è Splatters-Gli SchizzaCervelli, (in titolo originale BrianDead), è qualcosa di spettacolare, un film Splatters al contempo ironico, l'apoteosi della carne lacerata, fiumi di sangue...divertimento assicurato. Personaggi ottimali, il mio film favorito, sotto ogni punto di vista.<br>  Poi Plaga Zombie Zona Mutante, te lo consiglio vivamente, è un'ottimo Splatters, anch'esso demenziale!<br>  Premutos, film a livello amatoriale per quanto riguarda il Budget con qui è stato realizzato è un Trasher/Splatter valevole, si nota il Trash presente in Bad Taste, trama abbastanza suggestiva e il regista è appassionato oltretutto di Film Italiano ed ammira il grande maestro Lucio Fulci.<br>  Parlando di Fulci come non citare i vari Zombie?!<br>  Zombie Holocaust un film ad alto contenuto di Splatters, come sceneggiatura abbastanza mediocre, ma se ti interessa il sangue il successo è garantito.<br>  Zombie 90, capolavoro del Trash e Splatter a non finire...anch'esso però pecca un pò di sceneggiatura e qualità globale. Comunque è un Cult per quanto concerne il genere "Zombie".<br>  Infine ti posso consigliare Zombie Nosh, lo Splatter sempre abbastanza presente, un film che non amo particolarmente, comunque sempre consigliabile per tale genere.<br>  Buona visione.|`|8daa804268362808a252c8debed58f28aa	l'alba dei morti viventi  , è del 2004|`|gxBx59QOaa	paura nella citta dei morti viventi

17nxWnFqaa	No se si es buena o es mala. Creo que lo mejor es la alternancia, un período de contacto con el mundo para nutrirse, escuchar, sentir la música y los temas que produce el mundo, y luego un período de aislamiento para poder volcarlo en la composición. Para mejorar la interpretación, si es el caso, conviene tener un buen rato de soledad para practicar tranquilo.<br>  Otros músicos suelen "retirarse" por un tiempo en busca de un sonido propio, alejado de lo que se escucha. Así hizo Joao Gilberto cuando creó la bossa nova.<br>  En fin, a cada uno con sus recetas y con lo que mejor le resulte.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Si, por que se concentra mas en lo que esta haciendo,aparte de que disfruta con mas intensidad la música de su inspiración|`|1yZEGsRxaa	no te olvides que el musico es persona tambien.. y ningun extremo le sienta bien a nadie.. a veces esta bueno estar acompa?ado pero tambien se necesitan momentos de soledad, mas que nada para practicar.. y si estas en pareja siempre una sea musico o no necesita su espacio.|`|384e4fac90fec4cffafaac324d336a98aa	Definitivamente sí. Un verdadero músico crea, innova y ejecuta sólo por el placer que el arte conlleva. Su música es válida per se, independientemente de la valoración subjetiva que otros le asignen. En el diálogo y encuentro consigo mismo en procura de trasladar a los sonidos las vivencias y sentimientos al lenguaje del sonido, la soledad se vuelve el marco perfecto. Pero cuidado, estamos hablando de "soledad" y no de "desolación", pues esta última es fatal|`|636f31ea5be4d0dec508ce7164dd9f17aa	depende a veces es buena.... algunas buenas canciones han nacido de momentos en que el autor sintió una gran depresión y la canalizó en forma creativa... en particular a veces en soledad puedes experimentar otras emociones y la música fluye... te salen variaciones inesperadas, licks que no tenías idea que podías hacer.... música muy blues, pero no me tomes en cuenta a veces soy depresivo...saludos|`|qUA0i7qDaa	Mira yo creo que es mejor estar acompa?ado por la persona que tu mas quieras para inspirarte mejor. Pero todo depende de las personas algunos músicos se concentran mejor si están solos hay otros que necesitan de algún tipo de compa?ía.

Preceduto da un trailer davvero epico e convincente il film si prometteva vincente. Come si può non essere attratti da una pellicola che promette di prendere in giro assieme personaggi come Harry Potter, Jack Sparrow, gli X-men e Borat? Purtroppo, invece, a dispetto dell'ottima mossa commerciale il risultato è davvero ai minimi storici. Il film parte discretamente per poi perdersi in scene prive di idee e fantasia. I protagonisti inscenano così scazzottate tra loro prive di qualsiasi logica (e risata), i personaggi di contorno più che condire il film con apparizioni esilaranti si improvvisano rockstar ed incominciano a cantare come se fossero in un musical (peraltro canzoni orrende). Meno presente è anche la volgarità tipica di queste saghe (che nei primi 20 minuti di film, i migliori, fa da padrona). Insomma, dopo un buon inizio divertente la narrazione dei fatti "epici" comincia inesorabilmente a prender luogo ed il film comincia a scadere. Sono, sì, presenti diverse scene molto divertenti, ma il loro numero è sopraffatto da quello delle sequenze monotone ed assolutamente noiose. Sarebbe una delusione totale se non per alcuni tocchi di classe che comunque non salvano certo l'impietosa pellicola.<br>  Epic movie poteva essere un'ottima trovata...è stato una delusione epica.|`|voMCSjb5aa	tre metri sopra il cielo e ho voglia di te

Che poi sarebbero un "prequel"), perche` non si poteva comprimere tutta la storia in un film unico, e i 3 (finora) di Indiana Jones, che comunque uno puo` vedere anche in ordine... sparso.|`|5c2fd5e6c3ab0fef78b0c6e2612ff810aa	Io sono per le storie che iniziano e si concludono, senza prolungarsi troppo; pur essendo un amante di certe "serie" (Rocky, Rambo, Evil Dead, Nightmare, Venerdì 13, ecc...) è bello vedere un film che sai che ha un suo finale, una sua morale, insomma, un giusto epilogo.<br>  Una cosa a cui sono assolutamente contrario sono i sequel dei classici Disney: dopo che mi hai fatto vedere - che so - le origini del mito di Tarzan è inutile e soporifero andare a farmi vedere le avventure cn Jane e le altre scimmie.<br>  Come è inutile farmi vedere la vita da principessa viziata ma legata alle sue "radici" di Cenerentola....<br>  Per questo aspetto tremando il sequel di Biancaneve e i sette nani, il mio classico preferito.<br>  <br>  ciao.|`|2JGscqAHaa	...senza...di solito i sequel sono una delusione, non sono mai all'altezza del primo...|`|2u900iFeaa	Dipende dal tipo di film!! cmq generalmente preferisco i film senza sequel perchè spesso i sequel rovinano tutto!!! <br>  ad esempio non sopporto i sequel dei cartoni della disney!!! trovatemi un solo cartone che ha un bel seque!!! <br>  non mi piacciono i sequel soprattutto per i film a lieto fine!|`|3SQ5RNIPaa	meglio cn i sequel sn piu belli come ad esempio la maledizione del forziere fantasma,shrek 2....film fantastici|`|C8CzAZsfaa	dipende ma in generale si deve fermare al secondo perché le trilogia non sono forze buono (american pie 1 2 3)

ZSIn7RAyaa	i think she agrees with the President on backing the one China policy because she currently gets all of her fan paraphernalia made in Taiwan and she likes that it's part of China because they make really great toys for cheap but not the lead paint kind and she is a good American that likes the current administration's import policies for China and also like Chinese food and the super colorful shiny purses that they make for her to buy but i don't think she likes egg drop soup because it smells like pool water from the YMCA although she supports the young Christian men who like to swim and take showers there and i doubt that you take showers at all i swear to god and i love her.|`|RzTFYdPUaa	she think it is a crime that The US even does business with China because terrible human rights violations and stuff.|`|fc7a39ffdb63d4d0cbf91560d1f43fb4aa	Hannah Montana is a child disco singer who has a show on Disney's cable channel. Who cares what she thinks about China? She's a spoiled child who says and does what Disney tells her.|`|jsbHNurgaa	I can't believe I'm wasting the time on this question just to get the extra point. Are you serious? Hannah Montana is a ditzy blond from the Disney channel. You honestly care about her opinion of world issues? I'm sure she's more worried about what brand of lip gloss she wants to wear to the MTV VMA's rather than our nation's policy on China. Holy goodness, grow up.|`|v6dH5tf8aa	whyy do you care???|`|wV8RH4U0aa	Her thoughts are quite ambiguous on this policy.

E' molto più originale rispetto al 2 e3. anche se il 2 non è affatto male.ciao|`|gTyhZK1Saa	Bellissima.|`|ho9IBpajaa	Geniale. In genere non seguo il cinema horror, ma questa serie (di cui ho visto solo i primi 2) mischia humor e horror in maniera ottima.

Leggiamo e scriviamo poesie perché apparteniamo alla razza umana. E la razza umana è piena di passione. La medicina, il diritto, l'economia e l'ingegneria sono nobili occupazioni, necessarie alla sopravvivenza.
