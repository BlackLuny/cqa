gBVCPcNSaa	I am 24 right now and i was once plagued with the same issue of not possessing good drawing skills.  I went to the art institute of chicago's traning session which lasted 2 weeks.  It was basically outlining and giving you an idea of what the entire 3 year program would be like.  I too had good literary skills and computer skills.  I found that there are different aspects of the game creation industry.  Much of the good game design artists are Extremely gifted artists.  The Art Institutes does have a very good program that allows for beginners to get trained on how to draw, but in the long run i did not go through with it because. of all the great artists that i was surrounded by (there would have been no way i could compete.)  If you really want to do this then i would recommend going to one of their training sessions for prospective students and see for yourself if you are still interested.  <br>  <br>  Check out my blog on new trends and technolgies in the gaming industry:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gaming-deals.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://gaming-deals.blogspot.com</a>|`|RjGtp41Zaa	VideoGame art is very detailed.

bS5wpKvOaa	yeah.  Once your account is stolen, without recovery questions its gone.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to do about it, cause it is your fault.  Runescape makes plenty of warnings, constantly to never use your password outside of a Jagex site.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pretty much, your account is safe unless you use your password somewhere other than a Jagex site.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your account is lost.|`|s09BnJuXaa	Well, this problem does happen to a lot of people these days.  First of all WHY DIDN'T YOU SET RECOVERY QUESTIONS?!?!  This was your first mistake.  You should ALWAYS set recovery questions in case this may happen.  Next, you should have a very hard password that no one would every guess (ex: 12345pass12345).  Now then, for your account I would suggest putting a ban appeal again and explain everything in exact detail.  The only email address available is for billing support.  This may apply if your problem has something to do with the card that you got.  The email address is:  billingsupport@Jagex.com<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the Jagex contact page: <a href="http://jagex.com/corporate/Contact/contact.ws" rel="nofollow">http://jagex.com/corporate/Contact/conta...</a>|`|rJ79B2xAaa	First of all, your first responsibility is RECOVERY QUESTIONS. It is highly recommended and Jagex will bug you if you didn't put it. Second, you should have been to the Stronghold of Security. It'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting your account. PLus some cool rewards if you do put Recovery Questions. Seriously...<br>  why put your pass word in a website you don't even know while Jagex only says to put your Jagex Passes at <a href="http://funorb.com" rel="nofollow">http://funorb.com</a> or <a href="http://runescape.com." rel="nofollow">http://runescape.com.</a> Jagex won't really care about your account anymore because you didn't follow the rules.|`|nv1NCh14aa	Hmmm I think there might be hope..<br>  Same thing happened to me once..as long as you have had more than 2 passwords in your runescape life and you remember them you can try to get it back by recovering lost account and giving your previous passwords. Also don't give up, Try this several times. If you have another account get on that one and add yourself, see if anyone is playing on it.|`|DwJQSUwQaa	1. No.<br>  2. Yes.<br>  3.

63da1f2c586ef9e69acfa98f679534e2aa	RROD stands for the 'Red Ring of Death' - it's the pattern of lights the Xbox shows to indicate a hardware failure.  The original (launch) Xbox 360s had a defect that affected many consoles, mostly due to heat.  New chips being used in recently made consoles have improved that - you don't have to worry as much now.<br>  <br>  Here's what the RROD looks like: <a href="http://kotaku.com/assets/resources/2008/02/xbox_360_kapot_rrod.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kotaku.com/assets/resources/2008/...</a>|`|Yp9oJpuGaa	rrod- red rings of death, if this occurs , just put it as your xbox is broken, when they first created xbox a hardware problem occured and it is unable to be fixed so far, red rings happened to me like 4 times, and i have no idea y the break down so much, its probably cuz microsoft did sumtin to it or accidently did sumtin to it i dunno hope this helps|`|D1fC7f48aa	Red Ring of Death<br>  <br>  System malfunction... typically associated with improper cooling (overheating) of the GPU and the CPU causing the motherboard to seize the system from starting.  The RRoD is the sign for this error.  There are a series of inputs when you start your 360 to discover the actual error. (I believe it is hold CD eject button while turning on your system)  There will be blink codes on the internet to tell you what they mean.<br>  <br>  Microsoft has to mass produce thousands of system monthly.  Some company's tend to cut corners on quality of their products to save costs.  <br>  <br>  (To me, it works as designed.

AA12042448	A general rule-of-thumb for pricing handmade items is to charge three times the cost of the supplies.  This is just a general guideline.  If you get your supplies at a hefty discount, you may want to charge three times what they would cost at a retail shop.  That may make your price too high or too low.  Adjust accordingly.  <br>  <br>  For example, I buy my sterling silver wire and my beads at wholesale prices and so can make a pair of lovely earrings for about a dollar.  (Honest -- and I share sources, too.)  When I charged anything under $5.- per pair, folks did not believe me that it was real sterling.  I now charge $5.- or $6.- per pair, and folks think they are getting a steal of a deal.  However, one of my other items (beaded watch) would cost too much to be practical if I did the "supplies times three," so I charge "supplies times two" for those -- and make up the difference on the earrings and bracelets I sell. <br>  <br>  These days, you want to keep your prices as reasonable as you possibly can.  Charging "what the market will bear" is neither kind nor wise in these times.  We need to show folks that the "extras" are still affordable.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I have scrapbooked for years. Never have seen a 10x10 album. <br>  <br>  but,,, I just don't think it is worth doing, from the artists point of view. The materials alone cost quite a bit and I would want to be paid at least $10 an hour for my work, and you can put in hours of work in a 10 page book. <br>  Layouts at scrapbook conventions (without photos) can go for $15 for a two page layout. I don't think you would be able to charge what you would need to, to cover your costs and time. If you are a professional, then you have taken many classes on scrapbooking and learning new techniques and have had years of experience doing it. To be paid $2/3 an hour for my work wouldn't be worth it. <br>  I charge $18.00 an hour when I sew. <br>  <br>  check out Ebay for finished scrapbooking pages and see what they are going for there|`|ZAvStJUFaa	Idk.

3d94d2ac9b3bcf2d4041b973bc58ed9caa	I have read it and I think it's a fairly decent jumping-off point for considering designing and marketing a game.  The overall information is solid, though perhaps a bit dated --- actually, I stand corrected on that, because it appears he has a new edition out November 2008.  At any rate, worthwhile to get if you are interested in designing and selling games.  Additionally, I would encourage you to check out the Board Game Designers Forum (www.bgdf.com).

0aWGJYKFaa	I agree many of the down loadable content should be free.  These downloads are way to expensive|`|3yFvfR4Vaa	I agree with downloads as it adds extra depth for the game however 20 dollars is too over priced considered Ive just bought the game they should defiantly lower the price. Also they need to bring out more free content.
X8w8vc25aa	You can let your friend download the game, but unless he/she has the cd it won't start up. I think it's only for verification that you didn't download it illigally. I used the same CD on 4 computers and mine is fine, so it should be okay :)|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	as long as they don't scratch the cd why would lending someone a game mess it up.|`|MHPyshrCaa	yeah you can.|`|J4v5xNg2aa	Should be fine since you need the Pets CD to play.

The memory for all  computer games are stored in your computer not on the game itself...

It should be fine but make sure he gives it back. There are few games where you can play without the disk. ie, Casino Empire. Either way yes.|`|kgKUV95Oaa	The memory isn't stored on the disc, it's on the hard drive.

3yFvfR4Vaa	You cant get it by downloading it yet and its not in the game. I don't think they will be bringing it out on psn store, if they do it will cost you.

aCGOqj4Gaa	it wont be easy,  after you enter mt. coronet (north) from either route 211, 113 find the stairs that go down now you will find a under ground lake there are only 4 different spots on the lake to get a feebas these spots are different each day and in vary in every different copy of the game. (these spots are not necessarily along the shore) note: even in the right spot of catching feebas the chance is only %50.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Just like any other Pokemon....you throw a pokeball at it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please be more specific.It is located on the second floor in the lake of Mt.Coronet.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Feebas is both very hard and very easy to catch.<br>  <br>  There is only 1 or 2 places to catch it. And in the lake there are about 4 randomly changing tiles where it is located, in Mt Coronet.  But, once you catch it from a certain tile in the lake, you can catch as many times as you have pokeballs.|`|HDgdxtesaa	Go into the northern part of Mt. Coronet by Snowpoint. In there you'll find a couple of spots of water. Fish in their with a Super Rod. I suggest you do it when you have a lot of free time. Using a Master Ball or Ultra Ball couldn't hurt you're chances of getting it either. It's a very hard Pokemon to find. It's super rare, even though it only an upgraded version of Magikarp (Or as I call it, MagiKRAP). I think you'd have better luck if you traded for it on Wifi.|`|5GnLCvXnaa	you gotta get a sledge hammer, place the game cartridge on something hard, like a stone floor, take the hammer up really high in ur arms, and give the game one BIG hit! that  shud get u a feeba ;) hope this helps, i'm sure it will|`|spjSBVALaa	try to make a trade in the gts or with a friend|`|DFJCO6TXaa	wats up yo!!!!heres the answer :.

2Q2ltt1Saa	The disks just contain the WoW client; you can install them on any computer.  Everything is controlled through the account; each account requires its own key (you won't be able to use your friend's key, but can buy just the key from Blizzard).<br>  <br>  The best way, IMO, to pick a class is to read up on them (the WoWWiki page at <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Classes" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Classes</a> has a good summary) and figure out which one fits your play style.  Hybrids are a nice place to start, so you get a mix of more than one type of class (e.g., druid can be warrior, thief, or priest, depending on spec/gear).<br>  <br>  Each class has a specific set of skills at each level, and these are supplemented with talents that can unlcok more abilities or enhance existing ones (or both).  The links on WoWWiki will include more detailed information about each class, to see what skills they have/will get and what they do.

B1rUWfy1aa	No, all female sims can get pregnant. If your sim isn't getting pregnant it's probably that the relationship isn't high enough.|`|VpGfonpqaa	Its not possible, every sim is fertile (even the male can get pregnant through alien abduction). Though when your female sims get within 5 days of becoming an elder they cannot get pregnant. Also, a number of hacks can make it so your sim can never get pregnant unless you select try for baby.|`|9fo0WANhaa	Nope. Abortion and condoms are not legal in Sim world. lol|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	There are players that think this when their sim has tried and failed at getting pregnant.

If you're enough of a hardcore fan your could also go for Minish Cap, though it was kind of mediocre. <br>  <br>  There's also an adapter that you can buy so that you can play N64 games on the Wii, but it's expensive. Another word of advice, to play the GC games you have to have a GC controller. <br>  <br>  TP itself is played with the Wiimote and the Nunchuck, and costs around fifty dollars CDN. <br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question.|`|MqJYhuQ3aa	Yeah they do. It's called Zelda: Twilight Princess, and if you want to play an original N64 Zelda then they have Ocarina of Time on the Wii Shop channel.|`|HvnxG0V8aa	Yes, The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess, a good game|`|ugaIZSjuaa	yea they have zelda for the wii i dont know how you couldnt find that out on your own though you could have just went to gamestop.com|`|g9zWr3draa	Zelda: Twilight Princess<br>  i had it and its great. i miss it<br>  sold it all for xbox 360|`|XiJYw03aaa	not yet but its is coming out with a whole knew look in may of 2010!

RjGtp41Zaa	Well it matters. I personnaly like Guitar Hero better than RB cuz it came out first and the gameplay mechanics seem better to me. I also think that GH has better songs and the Hammer-ons/Pull-offs are easier to hit (a little advanced). GH is also more competetive and I think RB is more for parties and big families. So since ur an only child, ill reccomend GH:WT for the XBox 360.|`|Dq1T89nOaa	guitar hero is  better 1st of all cause its a better 1 player game knowing that u r the only child and it has better songs.  Get it 4 the 360 cause it has more options of games do u can get other good games besides guitar hero or rock band|`|O0pb1F3gaa	guitar hero world tour because its like rock band and the notes are faster so it makes it more fun and challenging and for XBOX 360 because its hd (if you have an hd tv)!!!!|`|nhD8JXEhaa	Probally rock band because it has different things to play. Also it doesnt matter which one you play it on. Your using the same stuff|`|tkhlRVn4aa	guitar world tour because it has a lot more known songs|`|SjGpbohiaa	Don't know never played either of them.|`|YRew3i8Gaa	Rock Band 2, On the xbox 360, cause its really fun, with all the drums e.t.c

kW4LbLMkaa	Namine is Kairi's Nobody, but she's an unusual one; she was born from Kairi's heart and Sora's body.<br>  Because Kairi's heart held no darkness, when it left her body and fled into Sora's, her body never vanished from the realm of light; it ended up somewhere else within the realm.  Therefore, in order for her to have a Nobody, her heart would have to be separated from the body of a person whose heart does contain some amount of darkness (in this case, Sora), resulting in two Nobodies from one body, but from different hearts.<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep: a prequel taking place 10 years prior to Kingdom Hearts, focusing on three Keyblade-weilders searching for a Keyblade Master who's gone missing with his apprentice.<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days: focuses on Roxas' time in Organization XIII and what went on while Sora was sleeping<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts coded: fills in the gaps in the story (such as where Pluto's been, what Riku was doing during the first Kingdom Hearts, etc.) while playing as a Sora synthesized in a world composed of all the data in Jiminy's Journal to solve a mysterious message. Takes place right after KH2|`|MIeLuqUCaa	There will not be another game about sora riku or kairi. Birth by sleep is 10 years before kh1. Though riku and sora will be featured in birth by sleep just not the way u think. Birth by sleep will be realeased in japan by December 31 and 6 months after that it will be here|`|9Hon0mHKaa	Regarding your first question: Yes, Kairi did lose her heart in the first game. Riku was trying to get it back by working on the wrong side.<br>  <br>  Regarding your second question: No, none of them focus on Sora and the rest of the characters except for Kingdom Hearts Coded. Kingdom Hearts Coded is just the very first game of Kingdom Hearts for the cell phone. (That's it.) Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days comes out February 2009 in Japan from what I've heard so we should be expecting it sometime in August 2009. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days actually starts immediately when Sora turned into a heartless. Roxas was turned into the organization and from there the story goes until the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II for the PS2. (The beginning of Kingdom Hearts II is supposed to be the end of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days. Why do you think the last battle is Roxas vs. Axel?) (No offense intended)<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep actually takes place 10 years before the very first Kingdom Hearts and happens when Sora is 4, and Riku is 5 years old. The characters that this game focuses on are: Terra (Secret boss from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix only sold in Japan), Venn (Looks like Roxas and is Terra's friend), and Aqua (One of the 3 keyblade choosers 10 years ago. Could she possibly have something to do with Xion in 358/2 days? Could the 14th member of the organization (Xion) be Aqua's nobody?) That should be revealed in 358/2 days I think. This is towards my knowledge, but just for Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days, you will not understand the title unless you play the game.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	1. Naminé was born when Sora stabbed himself with Ansem's artificial Keyblade in order to restore Kairi near the end of Kingdom Hearts. This made Naminé a very odd Nobody, born from Kairi's heart and Sora's body and soul. Kairi's own body never became a Nobody because her heart lacked darkness (since she was one of the Princesses of Heart), so her body and soul were never able to leave the Realm of Light and thus made it seem like Kairi was in a comatose state until she regained her heart. However, this means that Naminé was also born without Kairi's memories, only furthering her status as an unusual entity, and she and Kairi are incomplete without each other. And because of the fact that Naminé is formed from Sora's body, she has the power to manipulate his memories as well as the memories of those who are connected to him, prompting several others, even herself, to call her a "witch". She came into being at Castle Oblivion, found by the Organization XIII. Ansem the Wise has stated in Report 9 of the Secret Ansem Reports that Naminé is not a true Nobody. It is unknown if this was his opinion (as Nobodies generally remember their past life) or a fact. <br>  <br>  2. The story that continues our 3 heroes story is not yet confirmed because Square-Enix is busy with the 3 new Kingdom Hearts games and Final Fantasy games. However, its a big chance that it will be out, we just don't know when.|`|hXwyVSxIaa	To answer your first question yes it is more probable that Namine was created after Kairi's heart left her.<br>  <br>  and for your second question birth by sleep is a prequel to the KH series and no sequels have been announced as of yet. But it is likely one of the new KH games will include a secret ending that might hint at KH3

AA11850311	The Nvidia GeForce GO cards are all graphics for laptops, the Nvidia GeForce are dedicated graphics for desktops.<br>  That said, I used to play Sims2 on a laptop with a Nvidia Geforce 6150 GO graphics card, and similar specs to your laptop.  As long as I had the graphics settings turned down almost all the way, did not play any large or elaborate houses, and tolerated a lot of lagging, I could play.  If this is the only computer that you have available to you to play Sims3, I would not even try it.
LrGZcI6yaa	Yes, it froze because of that. It's happened to me. The xbox 360 has been having problems with some games. It will scratch your games in a circle, just like that, and the game won't work. The way to prevent this is to:<br>  <br>  keep the xbox 360 laying down (not standing up), and don't carry the system with a game in it.<br>  <br>  Some times this can happen from other reasons to, but that's most common.<br>  <br>  As for your game, it is kind of broken, and there isn't too much to do about it, sorry! You can go to any game, or cd store, and most of them have these machines that will fix it for you. They are really cheep to fix, only one dollar, or under.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why xbox's do that. Sorry, but that's the only way you can fix it, or you could buy a new game. Also, you can try some things at home to fix it. Check youtube for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry about this, but I hope it works out!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: you could have also nudged it. The xbox games will get these scratches for a bunch of crazy things, such as bumping into it, a simple nudge, knocking it over, standing it up, and other things. My games had that happen a bunch of times, and I was furious, so I took all the games to "Gamestop", and they fixed them all up, and it cost me one dollar for all of them!<br>  <br>  This may be expensive, but if you go on E-bay, or I've seen them in Walmart, you can purchase this machine, that cleans your games for you. It will take a layer of the game off that isn't needed, and fills in scratched, and it does work. I have one, and it was 79.99, but it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  So yea, many options to to, but it's up to you. Good luck!|`|LdEVL5Bcaa	yeah i own the game and just wanna say its THE BEST<br>  so im guessing the game froze because of the ring around the cd you mentioned<br>  another reason is the system itself--i play on the ps3 and it never freezes but game reviewers have noted freezes time and again on the xbox 360 version <br>  <br>  so either of those|`|mko359wNaa	This happened to me. It is when you nudge or bump your xbox while its running, the laser gets knocked out of line slighty and burns the disc. The game may not work properly again until you get it re surfaced|`|A9tR1Bjjaa	that sucks your game is toast you could try to put toothpast on it just leave it there and than just wrince it off and than blow dry it or use a soft towl|`|asbPP2psaa	Its either you accidently moved you xbox or your disc is unreadable.|`|q1vcRgDRaa	Hey I was talking to a guy in a Gamestop about the same thing happening to him ,accept along with it freezing it wont play all together, it turns out the only reason  he found after hunting for one off any one with a brain in the 360 area .Was that the 360 was moved this explains the complete circle scratch<br>  but he doesn't remember moving it any who bring it into a Game they have a sealant or cleaner that apparently works but I'm sure they would have that in any gamestore|`|qS3oqFleaa	yes loads of times but if i was u and u was me i'd go and buy a new game|`|awskuSGBaa	Your xbox fell over while it was playing right?<br>  <br>  Take it to the vid game store and they will fix it for $$<br>  <br>  Yes, it happened to me, another game though.

vraDYAPdaa	Well, auto clicking can be reportable by a player. Although, it can be detected by Jagex's "anti auto bot/auto clickers detectors". Any type of program that is used will be a bann! Meaning you will get banned. To tell if someone is auto clicking, there clicking the same thing at the same pace.

The story is that the humans have been in a long war with the covenant which are an alien species that threatens to blow up the entire universe with the "halo" which is a circular shaped object kind of like a planet.  You play as Master Chief who is an highly trained human spartan with incredible attributes that enable him to take out entire armies.  Sadly he is either THE last or ONE of the last Spartans left in existence. Pretty much you've gone through a couple encounters with them in the past two games and are still in the middle of fighting them along with whats called "The Flood" which is a race of creatures that are like parasites that takeover bodies.  You also fight a race called the "Brutes" which is a race of apes that are starting to take the higher ranked positions in the covenant army.<br>  <br>  Happy playing :D

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	The 1903 $20 gold piece (double eagle) is not a rare coin and it depends on it's condition (grade). In circulated condition it tends to sell for the gold value, but in higher mint state grades it has a much higher value, for it is scarce in high grades. Gold has dropped as well as coin in general so this is a time to buy not sell. I would say they sell for $1,200 and up but dealers pay at least 40% less. This is a ballpark figure do to the up and down gold market. When you say walking Liberty silver dollars I take it you mean the silver bullion coins called American Silver Eagles minted from 1986 to date in uncirculated as well as proof. They values differ as per date and if they are proofs or uncirculated pieces. Visit at least 2 or 3 dealers and see what each one offers. Most coin dealers who have been in one place a good many years is usually a good one. Do not go to an antique dealer or a pawn shop. Hope this helps, I would need to know the dates of the silver eagles.|`|dgXs1Y2faa	It depends on the grade. If you go to this website it will help you find the price. www.pcgs.com/prices.

D1wH6SYxaa	I used to play RuneScape before upgrading to XBOX 360. A berserker pure is player in runescape with the defence of 45 who's main focus is to use the berserker helm obtained from the fremmenik trials quest for the added strength bonus while pking or pvp combat. The Berserker pure usually ranges from level 80-115 and more than likely favors the use of an abyssal whip or dragon scimitar with the combo of a dds or ddp++ (dragon dagger super poison). They focus all thier attention on attack and strength skill after getting 45 def.

FCDEg9j8aa	Team Slayer. It is the easiest playlist to rank up to a 50. Everyone says Team Doubles is but i highly doubt it because EVERYONE plays it. EVERYONE is trying to get their 50 so you will be going up against the best. Team Slayer is pretty much very common. Good and Bad players play it so it will make a fair in a sense. I suggest you get really good before playing it. Play Social Slayer and when you get better play some Team slayer. I suggest you bring a friend in who is good as well. Do NOT bring  3 or a Full party in team slayer otherwise you get matched up with other premade groups which are probably good. Its very easy to rank up with 2 players in Team Slayer. If your still having trouble i suggest you get boosted with another player. If your still having trouble can just msg me on my gt: II ex legend II... Ill help you out by making you a better player by playing some customs.|`|RO0nhgPpaa	Well trying Team Slayer with lower level people could show useful because fighting easier people is always fun.

z2LGqY0Gaa	This sometimes depends on the game content.  I know that any games from livearcade that I have downloaded will work as the full games on any gamertag that is on my system.  But if I go onto my friend's system and play, say geometry wars, it will be the full version for me, but as soon as my friend logs in it will only be the trial version.  But if my friend gets on my console, he can play the full version.  I also have a Bioshock addon that will work with any profile, but this is also free.  So it will depend on how rockstar sets up the addon content.  Most addon content can be used on different gamertags, such as the Halo 3 legendary map packs that you have to pay for.  I can use these maps on his console but not on mine.  I bet you can, but there is a small chance only one gamertag can use it.

Hard to know. You'd have to sort out with them how they're sending it seeing as they only mention the states.|`|fc496lPuaa	Well looking through their feedback they have sold several copies of the Collector's Edition and might be good. I usually don't buy from anyone under 100 feedback (they have 16) or if they don't have an Ebay Store. But since all 16 are 100% and 4 of them are from WOTLK CE copies you might be able to trust them. Also if you don't want to wait for the shipping ask them to email you the cd key. (course thats if you don't want all the special stuff in the box).

z2LGqY0Gaa	I made a teeny tiny lot once, built a really tall skinny house with multiple levels and then packed as many family members onto the lot that was aloud.  Then I just fast forwarded and watched them go crazy.  They hated this chair that got in the way of getting to the fridge, they hated the toilet, they complained about some of the ugly stuff in the house, they kept stealing each others beds and getting mad.  Then they died from various reasons, and I started deconstructing the house and building a cemetery for their headstones.  So far I've killed off 5 families on this lot.  Most of the time I just trap them in a room, and then connect the room to a gated hallway leading to a pool and when they get in the pool I remove the ladders.  I'm evil to my sims... :(|`|4vGvabOUaa	Haha, yeah I'm usually nice to my sims but when I was trying out the Legacy challenge (<a href="http://www.legacychallenge.com/lcnewrules.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.legacychallenge.com/lcnewrule...</a> at the part when you get points for how many different ways you kill a sim... that was fun.

YSmYkc5Yaa	Rank progression is based on consistency and the rank of your opponents. That is, if you always lose to higher level opponents, and win most but still lose some to equal level opponents, you won't go up that match. <br>  <br>  If you lose to someone lower level than you, your rank is going to suffer more. Winning against lower level players is expected, and will not assist you in going up.<br>  <br>  I cannot say this enough - just winning more than you lose isn't going to get you rank. It is but one requirement. As I said, if you're not beating higher leveled players consistently, you don't go up a level because you haven't earned it. <br>  <br>  Rank will initially change often, but once you get to a certain point, the system becomes statistically certain about your level in a playlist, and just playing games and winning is no longer enough to go up - you have to consistently win against higher leveled players and not lose to lower level players.<br>  <br>  Experience has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with ranking up. I have over 4000 experience and went from a 43 to a 46 in no time because I played 50's and won tons of games in a row.|`|i0J7K5Txaa	Sadly there is no easy way to do it unless you exploit.  It took my brother months to reach 40-50.  He would actually win games and LOSE rank.  It's all on if you play people higher rank and win, playing people your rank or lower slows you down dramaticly.  Sadly I refuse to tell people how to exploit the ladder system, I think you will be fine if you keep on pushing it.

vtJDHJDYaa	Welcome to one of the most frustrating Boss Fights in the game! When the battle starts out, you have forty seconds to destroy fifty of his water creations. In order to do this effectively, you should probably just hit Triangle and X as much as possible. The Wild Dance reaction command will devastate Demyx's water army in no time. Contrary to what I said before, Explosion really isn't that effective (especially if you have a bunch of combo boosts equipped). You're better off relying on Wild Dance. Once you've defeated all fifty, Demyx will attack. Note that if you fail to defeat all fifty forms, you will lose the battle.<br>  <br>  Demyx is quite prone to combos, so if you can get him stuck in a pattern where you can pull off most of a ground combo, knock him in the air, and pull off an aerial combo, you can take good chunks of health away. Unfortunately, Demyx has his own attack pattern that you can get caught in. He tends to dart across the screen a lot, with a trail of geysers that follow in his wake. He follows this attack up with a circle of geysers around himself. If you end up right next to him before this attack, try to break him out of the pattern before you get hit yourself.<br>  <br>  He also controls very fast moving water bubbles. If you see him walking while sort of dancing, he's about to either shoot bubbles at you from a distance, or have bubbles rain down around him.<br>  <br>  At times, Demyx will say, "Dance, water, dance!" at which point the screen will turn dark and you will have ten seconds to kill ten more of his water creations. At this point, you'll need to be very very quick on your feet. Run in close, slam the Triangle and X buttons, and pray you don't have to start over.<br>  <br>  Using Drive forms in this battle usually isn't a good idea for a couple reasons. During this battle, Sora seems to turn into Anti-Sora a lot (if you haven't experienced this already, it's not a good form to turn into; it happens at random times, and often at inopportune times; while Anti-Sora's attack speed is a lot faster, you won't be doing quite as much damage, and you can't heal at all while in this form, or revert without just letting the drive gauge run out, which actually does empty faster if you attack). The other reason is because of Demyx's occasional ten second challenge noted above. While in a different form, it may be harder to get rid of the creations within ten seconds due to the flair of Sora's attacks. You may want to use a Drive form though when Demyx has little HP left.<br>  <br>  Once Demyx loses about half his health, he will start actually attacking Sora with his sitar. Breaking free from one of Demyx's combos can be tough, but the Retaliating Slash ability can help deal damage to Demyx while he mercilessly hits you. Also at this time, Demyx will walk around with a wall of geysers that spray up in front of him every second or so. Reaching him at this point is tough, so it's best to run from him for a few seconds until he changes his mind and starts attacking physically. Try to get behind him now and hit him. To top it all off, he now has a line of homing geysers that are quite difficult to dodge.<br>  <br>  Every once in a while, Demyx will say, "Ain't it a blast?" and come dancing at you. Quickly use the Show Stealer reaction command to distract Demyx while he's playing and damage him for a large amount. Failure to press the Triangle button will result in the same thing happening, only Demyx notices and whacks Sora. This isn't good, and will even result in death if you have low-ish HP.<br>  <br>  If you can survive the brutal second half of the battle, you're ready for anything the game will throw at you from here on out.|`|xQnDEJKHaa	level up more then try i did it on the first try at lvl 48
i0J7K5Txaa	Well you can't fix it, you can't send it back because that voided half of the warrenty, and you can't return it to where you purchased it.<br>  <br>  Best bet would be to take it to gamestop or eb games and trade it in as defective and pay the difference on a used DS, then never let your friend touch any of your costly possessions ever again.|`|j8LymeCoaa	why did u do that 2 ur ds? anyway, I'd either buy a new one or send to nintendo for repair (if they cant fix it, they will send u a new ds 4 free)|`|BiMeb75Gaa	You can't!

wyHkdDqIaa	you cant unlock him i filled all the character slots and seth is not there i check for codes if  you could unlock him but i geuss you cant.
BwsTfgWaaa	It will be insanley hard to get nothing special with bots because they will, and i mean will get him by a special. I've mentioned this before, but use the dashboard glitch to skip all the way to the end of the level.<br>  And yes, a boomers vomit only counts as a hit if a zombie hits you while your glowing, just like multiplayer.|`|9fKnub6eaa	I found that doing Death Toll on easy with Zoey, Bill, and Frances as the computers is the easiest way. Louis in my opinion is a easy target for the Special Infected. I've made it all the way to the end without anyone taking any damage from any of the Special Infected. Just stay away from witches when you're trying to get this achievement, and run from tanks...let the computers take care of them. Boomer bile counts against you. Remember that in versus, the boomer assists for the kill so it does still count against you. Another thing...let the computers kill all Special Infected, especially the boomers. Other then that you should have no problems. Just keep your eyes and ears out for the smokers and hunters and it should be smooth sailing.
BwsTfgWaaa	Its hard to play with bots because they're dumbasses and lower your chances of not getting hit by the boomer. If you can't get 3 other people to play with you, use the dashboard glitch. For more information on it go to xbox360achievements.org|`|z2LGqY0Gaa	I'd say the best map to do this on is the no mercy campaign.  The best thing about this map is that for the most part it is easy to see where the boomer is coming from as you are in a buildings most of the time and he is either in front of you or behind you.  This way he usually is some distance away from you when you first see him or he cannot readily vomit on you.  Bots are ok but you are really taking a risk when you play with them because sometimes the bots will kill the boomer close to the survivors and everyone will get bile on them (this counts as being vomitted on for some reason).  It is ok to play with up to two bots if you have another human, as they can always be behind the group.  It is good to have bots on your team if you aren't the greatest at spotting boomers however cause they seem to be able to kill them fast when they are far away.  When you go for this achievement the best things to do would be: Make sure you are going through the areas carefully so you don't run into a boomer, the person in front should know the map really well and be able to look into rooms as they are going to spot a boomer, the person in the back is the door closer and must shut every door they see every time since boomers can spawn in any room, the humans in front and back must keep an eye on each other so that if one goes down, let the bots help them up and the other human keep an eye out for the boomer, and for any humans playing, you must know how to shove a boomer and run away so he doesn't get you.  These are probably the best things you can do, plus play on easy since there are less special infected per level.  Good luck!

z2LGqY0Gaa	How much you get will depend on where you go to trade the system in.  Most games stores will trade in systems at most for half of their brand new value.  So at most you are looking at a $200 in store credit for the system, which will have to include at least the controller and the hdd with the system.  Some stores give even less, I know when I was upgrading to an elite, gamestop offered $70 for my premium system and hastings was giving $160.  Now if you have games that you are planning on trading in as well, it will increase your store credit but you won't get a ton for the games.  Check out gamestop.com they have almost the lowest prices for trade in value and if they happen to have a higher trade value than the store you want to trade with, they will usually match their competitor's prices.  Make sure that you also check ebay for some games, you may get more money selling them yourself.  So if you are looking at getting the 160 gig ps3 bundle, then the least you would be looking at before game trades would be around $300, since this bundle is $500.  Luckily you won't have to spend money to get a wireless adapter, rechargeable batteries for the controllers or other accessories right away as the ps3 includes many of these.  The best thing to do is to check prices, and if you really need to get more money for the console, your best bet will be ebay.  Look around at your local gamestores and talk to them about your plans to buy a new system cause chances are they will work with you on your trade in to help you buy from them.  Another tip, don't go for cash cause they usually penalize you 30-50% on consoles.  Craigslist is another option, but be ready for people to give you ridiculous offers (someone offered me 50 bucks for my 360) and it may take you a little longer to sell.|`|7MjUUae4aa	Depends on condition.<br>  Good condition and on Ebay.<br>  Bad condition con gamestop and work a little.

4Dihbisjaa	Sorry, I don't think it is possible to transfer them between computers. Also, if they are the same games on both computers and you registered so u could get them on parents comp, u wouldn't be able to get them anyway because you need to be registered on your computer. :(|`|dTKzemhYaa	I can help you. Tell me anything you want downloaded and i will download it for you. I just wouldn't know how to get it to you. I am understanding that they are on your parents computer? try then buying a USB connection to both computers cable. That might help you. You can go to a library, download it and save it to your disk. If i knew who you are, I would email you and tell you a special way. It is kind of private so that's why I can't say that here. The only thing I would need to know if that do you have Dial-up or any kind of internet. So this is the best i can answer for you so bye! :)|`|QW0HfpYZaa	I had this same exact problem till I got internet on my computer,someone told me that you could download Sim 2 stuff put it on to a disk&transfer the disk into your computer.But it doesn't work!<br>  There really is no way to do it.Sucks I know ):

I like the wind in my hair, the wide open spaces! How can such beauty be unknown to the common world? My favorite word of all time is, "Play." the four most wonderous letters in the alphabet into one word that speaks numerous joys out to the crys of youth and childhood. Oh, did i mention my names Hildegard Alexandra Robusk? I was voted most likely to die alone in the year 2008. And let me just say, I have not died. And I... am alone. I am the complete OPPOSITE of the word platitudinous. I've had a crush on Bill Nye ever since I first saw him on my 2nd grade video. I wish to marry that young lad. I have 4 cats, all named after my grand ancestors. One named Bertha, Jilusephit, Gredle, and Sniffles. Sniffles was my great great great great great grandma and since they couldn't speak fluent sentences, her name was Sniffles.<br>  Ive recently painted all the walls in my house gray, to match my exuberant personality!<br>  And in conclusion- the game is Hp pavillion.
i0J7K5Txaa	Take it back, Gamestop is usually pretty cool about these things.<br>  <br>  Have your receipt on hand, if you do not have it then the TIME and DATE you purchased it, atleast the date, they can look it up.  If they say other wise then get the district managers number.  I worked at Gamestop for years, that's them being lazy.

6Vw5kgGgaa	I hate too say this, but your probably going too have too mail it in to XBOX.<br>  Next time You play anything for a long period of time. Download your game to the hard drive. Through games library, and play from hard drive, that way your system won't take all of the heavy wear and tear. <br>  <br>  Once you do that after the first time your game will auto start from the hard drive you can tell cause you will hear that your system is quieter  than it usually is, once the disc starts playing.<br>  Don't know why they don't tell people that, I learned that the hard way now I play everything on my hard drive.<br>  <br>  One Game will probably take about 5 or 6 gigs so if you have a twenty Gig hard drive you should be able to hold Call of Duty.

AA10102633	You got 1 one of the 3 downloadable content. The legendary map pack is the only one that costs money and points. look for the Heroic Map Pack, it's FREE. Also, get the Cold Storage map, it also FREE. with all these you can play any game.|`|n3rHM1tcaa	There are the Heroic map packs, which I believe to be free right now. But that will only open up a few of the playlist, to get the others to work you will need to shell out the 600 points and possibly another 800 when the new mythic maps come out. Unless you win a free offer on Bungie.net then there isn't very much chance of getting a free alternative.|`|4E6qkYJxaa	Sorry to say there IS NOT a replacement for those maps.  Another point that won't be welcoming is the fact that they were announced to NEVER be free either.  The best thing you can hope for is to magically find a 20 underneath your pillow in the morning :D.

RXI8ImdIaa	Ok let me see if I can remember this. I remember more about the skirmish, which is different, so bear with me. I did this with no elites, by the way.<br>  <br>  (Edit: there may be a few inaccuracies here, about the specifics of where thigns are because it's totally from memory. But the basic idea of what I'm telling you should work.)<br>  <br>  Of course deploy Largo, Rosie and Alicia.  Besides that, give yourself one Engineer to fix the tank, two engineers if you tend to kill them off, and the rest Scouts and Troopers.<br>  <br>  Start by running a few scouts across the bridge to that train. Toss grenades at the Trooper there, and finish him off with rifles. Send your best scout for a train ride and turn on the elevator on the other side. Put a demolition order (3 cp) on that scout, walk that scout down toward the edge of that cliff overlooking the enemy camp and take out the tank below with a hit to the radiator. Back the scout up out of sight, all the way to the top of the elevator if you have enough AP. <br>  <br>  Run your other scouts AND and Engineer down the twisty path and take out the Lancer down there. Make sure you end your turns with them out of sight from the train and the Northern enemy camp, don't leave them with really low HP, and leave them in 2 clusters so they will crossfire on anything moving south towards the lower bridge, but not a single clump so you can't get taken out by a grenade toss. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you should also be sending a Trooper from your base camp to ride the closest train over to that ledge to the west (?) where the enemy snipers are hiding. Use a CP or two each turn, when you can, to advance that Trooper North along the ledge, taking out enemies as you go. I think they are all snipers up there, I could be wrong about that, but one trooper can handle the whole thing. DO NOT leave that trooper exposed at the end of a turn, or the snipers will instantly kill him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok one of your scouts is still above the fray at the elevator. You have your choice of coming down and trying to scout-rush that camp to the north with your little group, or you could send that scout back on the train, and send a sniper from home base back to that spot to pick off enemies from the camp. It takes a lot of CP to get a sniper that far so I'd try to storm it with Scouts if you can manage it. <br>  <br>  Ok with that first enemy camp cleared, you can cross the lower bridge and take out the tank over there. You need to give an evasion order, defense order, and demolition order to an expendable scout, and have him/her just run right up to the tank and shoot it in the radiator. You're going to ned more than one CP to run that far, so your scout can use a Ragnite between turns. After blowing up the tank, end the turn FAST because that scout will be nearly dead.<br>  <br>  With the tank gone, your other scouts/engineer can easily storm that sandbagged area, beware of enemies around the corners. Get the elevator turned on, and move your Edelweiss down there along with your Troopers and Largo. <br>  <br>  There is a train ride from this area over to a spot with an enemy ace sniper. If you'd like to kill him, send a scout and engineer to blow him up with grenades. You probably won't be able to land any shots on him, so just toss grenades, it will take 2 or 3.<br>  Now the fun begins.<br>  <br>  Keep advancing your lone Trooper down that ledge toward the final bridge, it will take him a while to get down that far. <br>  <br>  Here's where my memory gets shaky because it's different from the skirmish. You need to advance past those spotlights. Watch their patterns closely. Your footsoldiers can get by no problem by hiding among the barracks. The Edelweiss is harder, but it can be done - I remember sticking it in a space between barrack buildings, with a hairs breadth of room left and the spotlight didn't see me. There are enemies hiding in those buildings but I don't remember them posing a real challenge. <br>  <br>  Up at the next bridge there are some mines to disarm and a tank to take out, as well as some tricky spotlight maneuvering. That is hard, but, it's pretty self-explanatory. You can do this without getting the Edelweiss sighted.<br>  <br>  On the other side of the bridge you are greeted by Lancers and Snipers, maybe others, I don't remember. It's not totally necessary to break through these because you are almost at your goal. If you are stretched thin, send a scout or two on a nearby train (sorry I forget where it starts) and up to the high ledge. They can make it down that ledge and to the goal. Beware of an enemy Ace (a scout, I think?) hiding just past the buildings, he is deadly and will evade your gunshots, you'll need grenades to kill him.<br>  <br>  At this point, the goal is very close, you can seize it however you'd like.<br>  <br>  This is a really tough mission, be prepared to try it several times to hone your strategy. Good luck!

Dso7k3sjaa	When I first read your question, I thought you were saying that you were trying to install The Sims 2 Double Deluxe on a computer that already had the original game, just called The Sims 2 as well as all the expansion packs.<br>  <br>  Do you mean that you are trying to install The Sims 2 Double Deluxe onto your laptop which doesn't have any sims 2 games already installed and you are encountering that error?  If so, then try updating the drivers for whatever type of video card or chip that you have on your laptop to see if doing so will get rid of that message.  If not, then you may not be able to play sims 2 games on that laptop.  Many laptops have a type of video card that simply isn't capable of playing sims 2 games.  That's actually why EA made The Sims Life Stories, The Sims Pet Stories and The Sims Castaways -- so people who are trying to use a laptop can still play a "type" of sims game that is similar to The Sims 2.|`|AA11850311	that is odd that you would get a DirectX error.  Updating the drivers for your video card may correct that error.  I would have expected you to get an error about "Please un-install Sims2 expansions, before installing Sims2"<br>  If you have any Sims2 games on your computer, you must un-install them all before installing Sims2 Double Deluxe, as Double Deluxe includes the base game.

6nzRPn1Haa	I had major problems with this trial too. I just set all of the face buttons to heavy kick and started pressing them all at different speeds and I accidentally did it after a couple of minutes. Hope this works for you!|`|tVupC1Iaaa	it is easiest to set a face button on your controller as heavy kick. Once you do this you should hit the button 2times as fast as you can. Hopefully it will cancel out. I found advice from another source that said to jump in with heavy kick and keep beating the crap out of the button  from the time you leave the ground until the time you land again and it will end up canceling the kick this usually works out about 90% of the time or at least im told this. I did it and it worked on my third try.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|rxIT0os1aa	tap HK with two fingers one after another like you would do on a desk, i use my fore and middle fingers, that should make it easy for you.

Just tap on B while he's spinning.|`|kisgowXcaa	Alright, let's do this in steps.  Before you start, you should know that the move is technically referred to as the Luigi Cyclone.  To execute it, you press B+down (on the control stick).  In order to hover a bit off the ground, press B repeatedly and QUICKLY!  In fact, you must press B a lot faster than was required in Melee or the original Super Smash Bros., yet he doesn't even rise as far.  If you are already falling, you probably won't rise at all; you'll simply cancel your descent for a while.  The Luigi Cyclone is a nice move because it can glide at high speeds horizontally across the stage, sucking in opponents while loading damage on them, then spitting them out in every direction.  In addition, it basically protects your body from every direction, except for above you, in case you miss.  However, unless you're trying to catch someone who's standing above you by surprise, rising during its execution won't really help you out that much, not even in recovery back to the stage.|`|pR0TwTAuaa	i think u press b <br>  or you motion your sensor stick upwards.

0mT4Rinraa	Sounds like your internet connection is the problem. Your firewall might be limiting TF2's connection to the internet, or your internet might just be too slow. Or, it could be that your computer has a virus, malware, spyware, or any other kind of ware. Also, make sure there are no other programs running when you play, as they'll suck up your RAM and cpu.<br>  Edit: Oh, and just because your computer has the minimum specs does NOT mean you'll be able to run it well.

2Qr8vcAfaa	With being F2P there are only two ways to make a reasonable amount of money; other methods don't make as much, and take too long.<br>  <br>  Fishing, although able to make money, takes too long due to the large amounts of tedious bank trips needed. Anyone who says this method is good for making money is refering to P2P, where it's a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Combat will never make a lot of money in F2P, it's just the way things are. The best drops are things like Rune Meds and Scimitars. These are "rare" drops, so you'll probably spend more money on food than you'd make. Again, those saying combat are probably thinking about P2P, since even low level monsters drop reasonable items. <br>  <br>  The next one is a toss-up; mining. Many will say this is a great way to make money in F2P. I, however, disagree. Coal is probably the best ore to make money on - it's usually around the 175 price (granted, it might be higher when you check this, and it might be lower). <br>  <br>  You might think that 175 is alright, and it is. Why don't I think it's good money then? It's too slow compared to other methods, such as woodcutting. With mining you're constantly clicking, and there's probably going to be someone who will steal your ore. That's just the way it is...<br>  <br>  Now for the bit you've been wanting to know: what makes money? Simple, woodcutting and smithing.<br>  <br>  First off, let's talk about woodcutting. To make large amounts of money you need at least 70 woodcutting, maybe even 80 these days. You can cut yews at 60, but they're slow; very slow. With 70-80 woodcutting you're able to get a reasonable amount of yews a day, thus making good money.<br>  <br>  Here's where it gets "interesting" - how does smithing make money? Well technically it doesn't; smelting does though. With a bit of money (say 100K, you might need more or you might not need as much) you're able to make large amounts of GP. Buy your ores; mining them takes too long. You need 2 coal and 1 iron - simply make the steel bar and sell that back to the G.E. <br>  <br>  Using that method I was able to make 10M, as well as getting 80 smithing (okay, I did spend some of the profits on power levelling smithing). If you do decide to use this method, I advise you not to buy too many ores at once - going into your bank and finding over 10K iron bars waiting for you is daunting. Keep it low, buy around 1K supplies a time. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck with making money, and whatever method you use just remember to have fun. Talk to people when you're doing whatever you do, it makes the time fly. :)|`|lc51V6EAaa	wow i haven't played runescape in like forever, i remember that i would sell swamp tar, it was like 200 dollars a piece|`|rm2kykQEaa	The problem with alot of money making guides, is that it requires time, and alot of training.<br>  I suggest -<br>  . Getting around 50 - 60 fishing, then fishing lobs in Karamja, then banking in Draynor, or Falador.<br>  . Next, would be to mine Rune ess.<br>  .

z2LGqY0Gaa	Well I worked in a game store that gave a lot better trade values than gamestop and we definitely didn't give a whole lot for anything on this list.  We wouldn't even take trades on sports games older than 06.  Based on what gamestop's website says they sell these for, and about what they give trade in, I would say you'd get around the following:<br>  ps2-$15-25<br>  ncaa-not listed as an item they carry<br>  mlb 2k6-$1-2<br>  backyard basebal-1-3<br>  mlb 2006-not at all or .50-1<br>  mlb 2k8-2-5<br>  nfs-1-3<br>  nba live 08-3-4<br>  backyard base 09-3-5<br>  ncaa gamebreaker-not listed as an item they carry<br>  harry potter-not at all or .50-1<br>  mx v atv-1-2<br>  nba 09 the inside-4-7<br>  ncaa football 09-4-6<br>  ncaa basket 09-3-5<br>  blue controller-not at all<br>  black controller-2-3 depends if this is the system's controller cause they wont take the system without a controller<br>  wireless controller-4-6 <br>  <br>  So with all this considered you're looking at $45-78 with 78 being the max but very unlikely.  My suggestion to you would go to their website and find a coupon that you can use for more trade credit, it might not help a whole lot but can get you closer to your goal.  Good luck!|`|hwzPFyZTaa	Ehhhhh I'd say MAYBE 50-80 dollars....but who knows they maybe feeling generous.|`|D8OzQwXKaa	30 bucks top, they rip you off<br>  <br>  edit: maybe 40 but not 80.... but i bet they will sell that for around 100 bucks.|`|40ObXE0caa	$30 to $600.

AA10595247	If I want really good quality pictures, what I usually do is play the Sims 2 in windowed mode, then I use a screen capture program like Gadwin Printscreen and do a screen capture of my subject. I then open up my graphics program (photoshop, paint shop pro, or whatever) and make desired additions or corrections, and voila! I have a great photo.<br>  <br>  You can always take the photos with the in game camera, but I find the photos turn out better with the method described above because you get photos with a higher resolution.<br>  <br>  To play in windowed mode, all you have to do is right click on the Sims 2 icon located on your desktop, and select properties. At the very end of the target path, all you have to do add a space after the quotes and then type -w; then click ok. If you don't want to play in windowed mode all the time, all you have to do is follow the same procedure to remove the -w or just make a copy of the icon; one for full mode and the other for windowed mode.|`|aVBCBBWjaa	i have no idea, but could you help me on installing my sims 2? for the computer|`|zjbzzmamaa	You can click on the options and change low, medium, or high detail when you take pictures.
z2LGqY0Gaa	I know that the new 360's come with an insert saying that you must pay for 2 years of warranty service and it only comes with 3 months free of factory warranty.  So it'll depend on when you bought your 360.  the 2 years is $60.  The insert also states that after the 2 years is up you can pay an additional $60 to renew it.  But if you are like me, I have one from almost 2 years ago, my warranty is up in july and the three ring warranty continues for one more year.  I'm sure that you can call microsoft and request to extend your warranty and pay the fee.  It's a pretty good deal if you have an older system too, mine has broken 5 times.  Again this all depends when you bought your 360, but the best thing to do would be to call microsoft and ask them because any 3rd party warranties could mess up and void your microsoft warranty cause microsoft only wants you to go through them.  Places like Best Buy will simply give you a new xbox, but you lose all your data as you must give back the entire system and I don't know if microsoft will recognize the date that you receive a new system as a valid proof of purchase date.  So figure out what situation you fit in, then try to see what warranty options you have from microsoft or the place you bought it at.  Hope this helped any|`|Yakd4JUGaa	If u bought it with argos u can get 1 year warranty for 70 quid i think

1prbFoD7aa	New 360 w/hard drive $299.99 (you want a hard drive). <br>  New PS3 $399.99.<br>  <br>  Popular Problems:<br>  360: 3 rings of death<br>  PS3: System burning out<br>  (these problems have been fixed for the most part so don't worry. 360 has 3 years warranty, PS3 1 year)<br>  <br>  it depends on what kind of games you like to play. 360 has an awesome controller for 'First-Person Shooters' while PS3 has a good 'Arcade/Fighter' controller (like Street Fighter etc.). Also consider that you don't have to pay to go online on the PS3 but you do have to pay to go online on the 360 (personally I think the online experience is worth paying). Another thing is that the 360 has way more games than the PS3 (like 3:1), but you can play PS2 games on the PS3 (PS2 has more games than all the systems combined, and a lot of cool games; God of war 1 & 2, Kingdom hearts 1 & 2, Final Fantasy, Prince of Persia etc.). PS3 has a Blu ray player 360 doesn't, but 360 has Netflix and tons of other features online that PS3 may not have. You also have to remember that 90% of PS3 Games are also on the 360, so it comes down to what 'exclusive' do you want more; god of war 3 or Fable 2, little big planet or halo 3, etc. (these games are not necessarily listed next to each other in order of how good they are). Quick comparison, You choose!<br>  <br>  P.S. 360 does have slightly better graphics but you can only tell with an HD tv and HDMI cables. one of the reasons is that alot of PS3 games only go up to 720p/i and alot of 360 games go up to 1080p/i. but PS3 has true HD because of the bluray (ps3 disk ar scrach resistance, you have to skateboard with the disk in order to scrach it)|`|dOSKS7zqaa	To be honest I'll say the xbox but the playstation isn't that far behind, xbox 360 has better games and waaay better online play, but the ps3 has blu ray player and yeah...|`|YYSfBZfoaa	Definitely PS3 but its 500 bucks and the Xbox 360 is 200 used but the PS3 they have better graphics and better games plus you have more fun :)|`|LfqvlxSBaa	I have both systems. Got the 360 about 6 months ago, purchased a 160gb ps3 recently. I was one of those ps3 haters, convinced the system was dead end with hardly any choice and more expensive. What I found in comparison is it makes Xbox 360 look like a joke (and it pains me to say that because Im a big fan of the original Xbox). It took me 2 hours to confgure my 360 for live using wi-fi. With my ps3, it took me 10 minutes ! Everything is so much better designed & organised.<br>  <br>  The online service for ps3 is every bit as good as Xbox live I've experienced no problems on multiplayer whatsoever and its FREE. The system is sleeker, it’s quiet with many many more features. The only thing I don’t like about the ps3 are the slower loading & downloading times & the controllers which are the only things inferior to Xbox imo. Ps3 is the better console I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  ed- Hmm yahhh..downrate the totally non biased answer ...<br>  <br>  (idiots)|`|Mboh3eVCaa	This video on CNET does a pretty good comparison, should help you make your own decision: <a href="http://cnettv.cnet.com/2001-1_53-50005279.html?tag=smallCarouselArea.0" rel="nofollow">http://cnettv.cnet.com/2001-1_53-5000527...</a><br>  <br>  I have both and I play the 360 probably 75% of the time, but the Blu-ray player in the PS3 is nice.  The PS3 exclusives can sometimes look better than 360 games, but most multi-platform games tend to look better on the 360 (probably because most games are made for the 360, then ported to the PS3).  And Xbox Live is more than worth the money that you pay for it, PSN has a lot of catching up to do.|`|RYFPpRbYaa	there is a comparison on www.gamespot.com <br>  go and see it then choose by your self !<br>  in my opinion Xbox 360 is better than PS3|`|Dq1T89nOaa	It depends on wat u are looking 4.  Ps3 has bettr graphics but 360 has all the better games and better online playing.|`|1CRbzkABaa	If you are into online gaming against other players is your main use of system then go for xbox 360 and get Halo 3 or COD 4. But if your not gonna play online a lot and prefer better graphics and a wonderful blu-ray player that comes with the system the PS3 is definitely the way to go. I find I only use my xbox for Halo and COD online and everything else I use my PS3 I love the graphics PS3 has a better and more intuitive controller games are funner and the blu-ray movies on a HDTV are breath taking if I had to pick one id go with PS3. But consider you gaming when making the decision.|`|lOGhNHc7aa	Xbox360:<br>  Good things: Cheaper, Competitive Graphics, better online gaming<br>  Bad things: Same games as computer have, can't play blu-ray<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Good things: Best graphics, blu-ray player<br>  Bad things: Expensive<br>  <br>  Note: 60GB model (The very first one) are backward compatible and those 40GB, 80GB models are not. Check if it has 4 USB port in the FRONT, if it does then it should be the 60GB model. (Backward compatible has been taken off and that makes the price drop).<br>  <br>  If you use the console for gaming only, then it doesn't really matter unless you like Final Fantasy which unique for PS3 or Halo3 unique for Xbox360.|`|O0pb1F3gaa	PS3 because the XBOX360  has the 3 rings of death and the hard drive for the PS3 is alot better if you get a PS3 get a 60 gig because it can play all PS2 games and if you get an XBOX360 get a white one because the black ones hard drive is better but it gets the 3 rings of death alot faster and when it over heats thats when it gets the 3 rings of death so dont keep it on very long probably 3 hours MAX.|`|YRew3i8Gaa	PS3 Owns The Xbox, Xbox has red rings of death, PS3 is damage proof, you should get the PS3, cause i have both and i play my PS3 Alot More then the xbox 360|`|0471b807c6c293908f57270e42be8cccaa	This is a tough question as they both have their strong points. Xbox: bigger and better games library (so far). PS3: More powerful meaning that it will be more future proof, blu ray player, and free online playing. All in all I'd say ps3.|`|2muepVGRaa	None, dont waste your money or time on stupid video games<br>  <br>  you will regret it.|`|7MjUUae4aa	PS3 hands down.|`|b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	xbox is far better online.|`|g5hgPDc2aa	Okay...here is all I have to say...and it is alot.<br>  <br>  Xbox has always been, and always will be a very lopsided devise, full of false hopes and dreams. Sure it is a powerful system, but it has limits to it's graphic output and speed of gameplay. Also there was alot of extra materials that weren't included in the early year after releasing the 360.<br>  Gears of War and Halo 3 are what made the Xbox look appealing...that...and the fact it was released 1 year earlier then the ps3.<br>  <br>  Going into the ps3...if both systems were released on the same day or closer to eachother by a week or two...the Playstation would have sold hands down. The fact the Xbox came out early shows they weren't concerned about the quality of their product...but the profit it brought.<br>  Xbox 360 & Ps3 were unveiled both in May 2005...showing how closely the two were in the designing process.<br>  <br>  Xbox had a emmense leap on the Ps3...but...it goes to show that the Ps3 is steadily making a climb up towards the Xbox...not in quality...but in productivity.<br>  <br>  Quality of the games shall be passed as of February 27, 2009...With the release of Killzone 2. A brand new experience in the graphical field that is more then proclaimed to show the full force behind the blue-ray resting inside the Ps3.<br>  The wireless ability shown in the Ps3 is something anyone would desire. The quality of HD is beyond expectation behind a gaming console...and the many backing supports to the Playstation is a strong indicator to its creativity.<br>  Also the fact that the Sony company relies on its own flow of cash and not the backing of Bill Gates is a strong note to Sony's success.<br>  <br>  All eyes on the Ps3, the games that range from racing, adventure, strategy, action, and shooters are all great if you look for the right quality. The features run from video, web, music, pictures, and any other desired addition in terms of technology. The games are flowing from Xbox over to Ps3 already...so the only thing I see holding people back from a Ps3...is Halo...and Gears.<br>  <br>  Other then that...the performance of the Ps3 is going to eventually outmatch the Xbox sooner or later...and that is why I feel it is better to just convert now before you regret it.<br>  Xbox had a great run...it's time to look to the future of gaming...and only a Ps3 can give you that.<br>  <br>  "This is for all the bashing against the Ps3 that Halo junkies give."|`|U8RNyi22aa	ps3 all the way xxx|`|waSQ2So0aa	ps3 all the way man

i0J7K5Txaa	A little bit of both.  I do not know what the company used to make it exactly.  The best suggestion to find out what programs to use to make or remake video game music is to go to www.ocremix.org they have many people who spend a lot of time to recreate the sounds of video games for others to enjoy for free. They usually list their programs, so learn from them.
nhD8JXEhaa	You should find a exit and find tenpenny tower. There you can find the chief guy and tell him that you can help kill the ghouls. You would have to go back into the metro because the guy you killed was one of the guys you needed to kill. Find the other ghouls. Kill them go back to Tenpenny tower and get reward. You can also do it the other way where you go and let ghouls into Tenpenny tower but I recommend you just kill them|`|ItleV9qeaa	go to ur pipboy there are two sets of maps local map for a map of the area and world for...well the world just set a destination in the world map and follow ur compass out of there

If so.. find an earlier save and tell the guy [he's not a scientist if you're in the metro station.. or is he?  hm...] and tell him the truth.. tenpenny sent you to kill them.. but tell him to relax it's just a friendly reminder and he should tell you to go see Roy.  You should see a gate before going up the escalator to meet that ghoul that was protecting the metro.. Go thru it.. travel down the right tunnel.. you will eventually come across a bunch of barriers stop moving.. look to your right there should be a door.. go thru it and follow the doors and halls down down until you come into a storage like room.. roy and some ghoul chick should be there.. possibly sleeping or walking around.  Tell Roy the same thing you told the other ghoul.. tenpenny sent you to kill them... at this point.. you can kill them all [because that ghoul guard eventually makes his way down to the room. or help the out..

OiXy3zaeaa	This is the most effective technique. You should first complete the thrasher missions. At the end of the thrasher missions you will unlock the SV dam. Go to the dam and place a session marker. Next go down the path to the end of the end of the dam where there are some picnic tables. Take them down to the bottom of the dam by simply pushing them over the edge. Put them in a place where you think you'll fall on them. Then add them to marker. Now go to your session marker and carry on jumping off the dam wall and try and hit the picnic table. If you keep missing, move the tables to a place where you will hit them.

While he is on your farm you can talk to him every 30 game minutes to regain some stamina, and get closer to unlocking more purple team members.<br>  2.  Unlock another purple team member by drinking 50 drinks at the bar (which cannot be water).<br>  3.4.5. Pig out on colored grasses 30, 80, and 150 eaten pieces each gets you a sprite.<br>  6.  Fill your watering can 30 times.  Just stand next to a water source and keep using the can.  <br>  7.8.9.10.  Try to fish in the hotsprings, your duck pond, and the watering hole.<br>  11. Purchase the shipping basket and put something into it.<br>  12.  Find your horse and put something in his saddle bag like you would the shipping bin.<br>  13.14.15.  Ship a Cabbage, Pineapple or Green pepper.  These can be bought by from the Harvest Sprite Casino.<br>  16.17.18. Destroy 15 stumps, 5 large stones, and 50 large stones with your tools.  It requires at least Copper level to do this.<br>  19.  Buy 6 records form the sprites.<br>  20.  Get the three casino sprites, by talking to the well, fountain and stove around town.<br>  21.  Try to leave the valley through the trail on the right most screen.  This unlocks a sprite.  Do note however, that your work is never done and you cannot leave the valley.<br>  22.  Carry your cat into town and talk to Muffy 100 times while carrying it.<br>  <br>  Pick up all the weeds around and ship them.  This counts for several shipping requirements.  Also hire the fishing team.  The fish they catch and ship count towards unlocking the next memebers.  Make sure you give them flower everyday to make them better fishermen so they do their work faster.  You have to catch the qualifing fish yourself, so you will need to fish every once and a while.<br>  <br>  Other than that, most of the other sprites are unlocked by going about your farm business.  Watering, wood gathering, shipping, and taking care of your animals all unlock sprites.
4flomCyJaa	The only way to bring back dead sims is by using the resurrect-o-nomitron. It's the career reward for the paranormal career track. Once your sim unlocks the resurrect-o-nomitron, you can use it to call the grim reaper and bring your sim back to life - he asks for a fee though, so don't be stingy or your sim will be resurrected as a zombie!|`|qTPgH3v5aa	You can't do that. You must have university in order to bring back a sim or get a zombie. In career rewards there is a telephone where you can call the grim reaper and if you don't pay enough he will turn them into a zombie.|`|D1l5pR6Raa	And you need University EP to get the Paranormal Career track to get the resurecter thingy!!! Otherwise, you can't bring them back to life!<br>  <br>  <br>  If you DID have University, you can use the cheat<br>  <br>  unlockCareerRewards<br>  <br>  to get the resurecty thingy without waiting to un-lock it by reaching the top of the paranormal career!|`|1k1TX9jTaa	first obtain sims 2 university and use the cheat code unlockcareerrewards and obtain the resurrect-o-nomitron, call the grim reaper, pick your sim and at least offer 8000-9000 simoleans because if it is too low he will either take your money or turn your sims into a zombie|`|wqZHlXgEaa	I don't think that you can bring them back to life.  If I ever accidentally kill my sim, then I just go back to the neighborhood and don't save my game.  good luck!
PTovC2Dqaa	No, you have to obtain the Shared ability Mermaid Kick from the first time you defeated Ursula and Flotsam & Jetsam. Without this ability, you can't continue on in the story because you must fight Ursula a second time.<br>  <br>  After the battle with Ursula and Flotsam & Jetsam, you have to go through a very strong current and into a cave which is marked "???". In that cave you battle Ursula for the second and last time.<br>  <br>  The current is too powerful to swim through without Mermaid Kick and without it you can't go through the current at all. So equip the ability and you'll be able to swim through easily and face Ursula in a very difficult battle.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	No, with the strong current before the battle area, you must have Mermaid Kick to kick your way into the current and into the battlefield. Besides that, Mermaid Kick will make your second battle with Ursula a wee bit easier.

y02PZj22aa	Watch out--sock knitting can be addictive!<br>  <br>  Suggestion:  Start with a pair of kids' socks.  They use the exact same techniques but they finish much faster.  And nearly everyone is going to need a baby gift at some time in the near future.  This pattern from Plymouth Yarns uses worsted-weight Encore yarn and large (US size 5) needles, so they work up especially quickly:  <a href="http://www.plymouthyarn.com/index.php?nav=cPatterns.freePatterns&pattern_id=000021." rel="nofollow">http://www.plymouthyarn.com/index.php?na...</a>  <br>  <br>  Then you can join Knitting Daily and get 5 free sock patterns that have been published in Interweave Knits--at least two of them are easy.  [You do have to give an email address, to which Sandi Wiseheart will send a daily blog entry and notice when a new free pattern goes up.  I've been "enrolled" since it started, and I'm just a happy "customer," NAYY.]  Then look through the Free Patterns for other socks to knit.<br>  <br>  Or you might find something you like at Knitty.com (<a href="http://www.knitty.com/archiveFEET.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.knitty.com/archiveFEET.php</a> ), which has a wide selection of socks, including these:  <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEsummer06/PATTwiddershins.html" rel="nofollow">http://knitty.com/ISSUEsummer06/PATTwidd...</a> , which are worked toe-up on US size 0 needles.<br>  <br>  P.S. I've knit more socks on 4 or 5 needles than I care to remember, and now I use one very long circular needle to knit a pair at a time.  It's the best way I've found to prevent "second sock syndrome" (when you're "finished" with the first one, there's still that second one to knit).  They both get finished at the same time.  Some people prefer to use two circular needles to knit two socks at a time.  When you're ready, come on back and someone will tell you how to find instructions, videos, and so on.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Socks are very easy to knit.  Nothing to them!  I love doing them.  I do them toe-up or cuff down, and it's all the same.  They are quite fun to do!<br>  <br>  I would suggest starting with a hat.  It's on larger needles and thicker yarn, so you won't get as lost that easily.  There is no difference between using straight needles, double points, or circular... you only can work with two points and one stitch at a time.  It's all the same, really.<br>  <br>  Socks and hats are easier to do, because you just knit round and round, no purling (unless you want to).  Try the roll brim hat: www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/2005/06/e...<br>  www.knittingonthenet.com/patterns/hatr...<br>  <br>  The tricky part is joining your stitches into a round.  What I have done is knit three or five rows back and forth, and then join to knit in the round.  It seems it helps to have something on the needles before working them in the round.  And after that, just knit away!  Nothing to it.<br>  <br>  You are making it much harder than it really is.  That is the biggest stumbling block we have -- our own minds.<br>  <br>  See the Socknitters site for detailed instructions:<br>  <a href="http://www.socknitters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.socknitters.com/</a>|`|cxnJtmJraa	the easiest sock patterns I know of are generally those that don't involve a heel turn.  These are generally done in a spiraling rib pattern.  the only thing about these is that they aren't always the most comfortable to wear with shoes.<br>  <br>  Like the pattern on this site (It's about halfway down the page):<br>  <a href="http://www.vintagepurls.net.nz/womenspatterns.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vintagepurls.net.nz/womenspat...</a><br>  <br>  Sorry, that's a vintage pattern, and it involves some rather archaic and non USA knitting language, it's just the one that I knew the name of.  But I looked up "Spiral Bed Sock" on Yahoo to find it and found some other patterns as well.  If you do want to use that one, I think if you used a fingering weight yarn and size ones you'd get a sock to fit something like a 7-9 size woman's foot.|`|AA12042448	Double-pointed needles (DPs) only look intimidating.  It looks like an angry porcupine ate your knitting, yes, but they really aren't hard to use.  I have sets of 5 per size, where you have the stitches on four needles and work with the fifth.  I prefer using four (stitches on three and work with the fourth) so I leave one in its case when using them.<br>  <br>  I would suggest checking out www.coatsandclark.com and www.lionbrand.com and using their in-site search to look for a "beginner sock knitting pattern." These two are yarn manufacturers' sites, so they have tons of helps and patterns and all that to keep us happily knitting away -- and buying more yarn, of course.  The sites are free, no matter which yarn you actually buy.|`|DupjQKvraa	I suggest the generic sock pattern from Kate Gilbert.<br>  You can find it here : <a href="http://www.kategilbert.com/freepatterns/sockworksheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kategilbert.com/freepatterns/...</a><br>  <br>  I just finished my first pair of socks and they look fabulous.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

AA10595247	Take out those downloaded files and try to run the game again. It is possible you just got a bad/corrupt download or what you downloaded isn't compatible. It is possible to get a bad file from any site, including the Sims 2 official site, so that has nothing to do with it. <br>  <br>  Also try deleting the groups.cache file from the Sims 2 folder (the game regenerates a new one).|`|cf8yLQw3aa	Have you downloaded some files that are linked to the crash-proofing parties?<br>  If not, contact EA.|`|r3f3FAR8aa	Where did you get the downloaded files from?<br>  Was it from a official sims site because i go on www.sims2.com and download hair clothes ect and its never caused any problems for me you might have to try installing it again if this doesnt work try getting rid of anything you have downloaded and starting the sims again and only go on sims site that are official :)<br>  <br>  Hope i helped xx

PTovC2Dqaa	This is an ability called the Scan ability and you can only receive it when you level up. Try leveling up more until you obtain this ability and you will be able to keep track of your opponent's HP when in battle.<br>  <br>  You should get the Scan ability from a low level, so if you don't have it now then you can level up just a little more. If you already had the ability and you can't see the your opponent's HP bar on your screen, then you probably unequipped it on the ability menu by accident or there is maybe a glitch with the game.

TQVbiXtFaa	It doubles the effort values of a Pokemon holding it, but it halves the speed. Different EVs are obtained by battling different Pokemon, causing your pokemon to have different stat gains while leveling. For instance, battling only Zigzagoon would produce a Pokemon with a much higher Speed stat in the long run, as each Zigzagoon KO'd yields 1 Speed effort point (and holding the Macho Brace would give you two per Zigzagoon).<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a list of the EV yield of every Pokemon as of the 4th gen games: <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_effort_value_yield" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/L...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  It has never had anything to do with EXP, I'm afraid x:|`|K3gbmyCpaa	In Emerald, the macho brace cuts the speed of the pokemon holding it, but increases the experience gained. it is useful if you want to level up a pokemon quickly. you could also use an exp share.

KKX9T6LYaa	fist of guthix<br>  its free...|`|Y1gCexLEaa	If i were you I would train on barbarians or almost anything in the stronghold of security.|`|zvcAhxUzaa	I would say that the Fist of Guthix is the best way for someone to train their magic. There you have free runes and you won't loose anything (other than status in the guthix) if you were to die. also try attacking the prisoner in the castle i varrock- he can't touch you, but you sure can put some hurt on him ( and he onl takes about 1min. to respawn).Or if you want to Waste your own runes, go to the Wizzards tower and attack the lesser demon there. you be wasting runes, but he can't attack you. And once you learn tele-grab, you can get the items the lesser demon drops.  <br>    Hopes this helps you enough- ;)|`|SJ95U0IKaa	i think u should just go ahead and go to the fist of guthix. its just north of varrock, as soon as u cross the wildy boundary line, but there's not much risk. the reason i suggest this is because the runes are free and also u get tokens no matter what. now is a good time to start , beacause everything is free.i did this and im lvl 70 with i think 59 mage, and only 57 att and def, 58 str.<br>  <br>  im hapy ur training mage, its costly but worth it, its high attack power. in guthix most people will be meleeing u, and maging is good for that. some people will try maging u, and maging doesnt do bad against other mages.

43zXRpLYaa	I usually eat lunch and dinner. A meal is at minimum $8 and as much as $30 per person depending on where you eat. I have a family of four so we spend around $100 on food and I don't buy anything else. There's also parking and that is $12. Tickets are $69 or $94 depending on whether you want a single park ticket or a park hopper.<br>  <br>  If you go on your birthday it's free to get in.|`|CwpCyFzvaa	It really depends on how much you will buy/eat. it is best to take small bills because mostly everything can be used by a credit card, if you have one, if not like the first one said around that much will do because everything is really expensive. <br>  To save money I would bring a backpack of some sort and fill it with stuff you need the most, like water, a small snack, camera, extra film(If not digital). Also pack extra stuff like a t-shirt, or shorts if you get wet and decide you really want to get dry.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your stay at Disneyland.|`|gfGsXVc3aa	When we go we always take $30.00 per person/ per day for food we rarely spend that but we take it just in case, we always save money by sharing our meals or at least we will share lunch or dinner, we found places that have great food a big portions and then share like at Rancho del Zocalo which is Mexican food they have big portions plus since it is considered a counter service we get one fountain drink and they allow two refills and we share the drink and then, that way we don't have to be carrying around a soda, also Cafe Orleans has big portions but they charge for splitting it, it is $4.00 but that is still cheaper then another meal, PCH Grill in Paradise Pier Hotel also has big portions for dinner, they don't serve lunch and the breakfast is a character meal so it is a fixed price per plate. There are more that have big portions but that is the number one saver of money for us, plus we still end up full. Another way to save money is to bring your own breakfast and snacks, we bring cereal, or oatmeal, fruits and granola bars it will save you money plus if you are a coffee or tea drinker most hotels have these in the hotel rooms which will also save you money. Also bring a water bottle and some of those drink mixes that way you will stay hydrated and it will taste good, as I'm not a fan of the water from the fountains but by adding the flavoring I don't notice. <br>  Here is a website so you can look at all the menus for Disneyland Resort it will help you in planning how much money you think you will need.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.ht...</a><br>  <br>  For souvenirs we bring about $75.00 per person it will allow you to get something you really wont we usually will just get a shirt or sweater and not spend the rest, cheaper things you can do that we used to do was we would get a postcard for each day we were there and then write down what we did in that day and send it from inside Disneyland it will have a Disneyland Postmark on it of course you will have to provide the stamps but when you get home you will have Disneyland in your mailbox. <br>  Also if you are celebrating something special take advantage of the free buttons at City Hall they have them for Anniversary, Engagements, weddings, Birthdays, First Visits and the new I'm Celebrating buttons it is a free souvenir that you will always enjoy !<br>  <br>  Anyway hope this helps you and enjoy ! *Jena|`|KAw7yVCbaa	the thing about disneyland is if you eat inside the park be prepared to pay twice as much as every where else. a good idea is too eat at one of the restaurants located in downtown disney or one of the local fast food restaurants like McDonald's or taco bell which r both just a quick walk outside the parks. If you wanna buy souvenirs there are plenty of choices that aren't to expensive, like the disney pin collections or a simple picture frame or a pair of mickey ears.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	All depends on what YOU want to spend!  Eating there is very expensive.  Snacks are expensive! drinks are expensive!  but you can take food in there yourselves  Eat before you get there.  Pack a lunch! and Then go and enjoy a nice dinner inside the park!  That should save u a pretty penny!|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	i took $200 and only spent in the big parks like Epcot that is how to save money and came home with $100

a7AatQcEaa	Halo 3 is pretty fun. COD5 is wicked awesome almost the same as COD4 which I like better. But COD5 has a more cruel vicious aspect of war in it. Ligaments tearing off, POW, executions, the storyline is really cool as well. So i suggest you get COD5. Or if you really want to both.<br>  COD4: 10/10<br>  COD5: 9/10<br>  HALO3: 7/10|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I like Halo 3 since it's not as hard to move around, and pwning the little kids is always fun.<br>  :]|`|iib1RKOzaa	Personally I think halo as cod waw is fun to start off with but gets boring  after a while as it's no challenge to kill someone whereas halo is better because it's not as frustrating as you take longer to die so it is mostly about skill so you get less noobs killing you. unlike cod where the only skill you need is aim and spray|`|Bm3qCZTQaa	IMO they are about the same but COD4 owns them both|`|AA11058090	cod5 and because it is.

And if you ever get a 360 you can always use xbox live to update any old xbox games to play on your 360 its a no brainer. Ps2 you are stuck with the games if you get a Ps3.<br>  Xbox:9/10....old but still great with great games<br>  Ps3:5/10.....cannot play old ps2 games or add memory<br>  Ps2:7/10.........?<br>  Xbox360:10/10-expandable hardrives|`|gB5ATj7aaa	ps2.

The ps2 is still good because blood is still pumpin in it and games are still being released for it like cod:waw and quantum of solace, its a bit more expensive though. I think you should get a 360 arcade though because its only 200 dollars and its pretty close to the last gen systems in cost now.|`|A6ZQQp4caa	Get a PS2 Slim because the slim PS2s are newer and better looking than Original PS2. PS2s also have games still has games being released. Last Xbox games was probably released in 2006 or so. but PS2 has a bigger game library and still has games being released for it. So I would recommend a PS2|`|pTERJdzQaa	If I were you then I would choose the PS2.<br>  <br>  It has better graphics and sound than the Xbox.<br>  <br>  The PS2 also has an Internet Browser which is something that the Xbox doesnt have.|`|f0c1edc7368ad650ec43a2b4feb3a7cdaa	A lot of it depends on which genre of games you enjoy.<br>  PS is the best system if you want RPGs. Obviously it has the Final Fantasy series, but it also got most of the other good RPGs.<br>  XBOX is better if you want shooters. Definitely the system for FPS players; PS2 isn't terrible for shooters, but XBOX's market is basically based around the shooter. Halo is XBOX-exclusive, and most people agree that the multi-platform shooters like Medal of Honor and whatnot are better on XBOX.|`|lXQWyNiwaa	I would get a PS2, they are still creating games for the system, where as xbox is not.|`|4c1nn6hAaa	both

FCDEg9j8aa	When you first begin i suggest your try your hands at squad battle. Its 5vs5 and you can play around in that. The good thing about it is that the starting weapons is A battle Rifle. The battle rifle is the primary weapon in the whole game. If you become good with that, your a good player already. DO NOT DUAL WIELD OR USE ANY ONE HAND WEAPON, unless the game is not Team BR. Dual wielding is garbage and you wont be very good in the game. The Br is the main weapon, always use that for medium to long range. For short range use your assault rifle. Just dont use it for long range. Next weapon is The sniper rifle. non noob weapon that's probably one of the best in the game. If your good with Br and Sniper then u got the best combo in the game. For equipment it doesnt really matter, just dont use the ones that make u stick out such as the big damn helmets. For sensitivity stick at 3 and when u get better go to 4. You will be a powerhouse.|`|RaxiQJoLaa	its tough. i've been out of the game for awhile but<br>  <br>   aim for the head.  dual wield.  throw grenades at body then start shooting. try to find good weapons or combos that you like.  pistol whip when up close.  i always get flustered when i see more than one person but when you see one finish him off before going to next.  <br>  do some team training, team slayer, and isnt there like a basic training or is that just in cod4? <br>  <br>  oh and play with a friend.  load up two gamertags on one xbox and go have fun!|`|nb9Ky2Draa	dont bother|`|AE3lv4pRaa	Here you can get the tips for halo 3 multiplayer:-<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://videoonlinegames.suite101.com/article.cfm/halo_3_multiplayer_tips" rel="nofollow">http://videoonlinegames.suite101.com/art...</a>

1JsWMX0daa	High, this is Lyle G. I custom build the best PCs. allthough gaming pushes most computers to the max, any gaming pc with a 512MB video card of 6800 or more will be good for a game such as W-of-W. especially if paired with faster performance RAM, which costs little more than regular RAM. and as for operating RAM, 2GB (DDR2) of RAM is more than enough to run a game smoothly. however, if you want to multitask, or run more than one program at a time, you will need more. If you would like to run a music player while you buck shots or make tackles or cast spells or whatever than you should get 4GB.<br>    Be Careful with big name brands because you will NOT get a decent desktop PC with most of them unless you spend $2,000 or more.  (and that's desktop only, i am assuming you are looking just for the desktop PC; no monitor, hardware, etc.)  That Is because they will put alot of money on a great and (sometimes not even fully utilized) video graphics card. than they skimp on other parts and usually big time on the motherboard.  but of course it will run W of W just fine. <br>   If you get someone you know to build you one,  you can put together a compatable PC for between $500-$600. If you dump a grand into a custom built PC you will get one compatable to a $4,000 Alienware, Dell, cybertron, or other such gaming PC (again, tower only)<br>  actually ; i could put 2gether a PC with a 512MB ddr3 9600 video graphics card and quality name brand parts with an AMD Athlon 64x2 Dual Core 3.0 Ghz Processor, a 200 GB HD, optical CD/DVD reader/writer drive, and 2 GB DDR2 RAM @ 800Mhz for about $600 including software/OS (windows vista).<br>       actually- for less than a grand, i could add a second kick *** video tuner card, 2 more GB DDR2 RAM & a larger HD. AND for another few hundred dollars i could put a pioneer blu-ray/DVD/CD reader/writer drive and windows vista ultimate on it too!<br>   i could hook u up if u want, let me know if u need anything else or holla at me if you are in usa or even canada/etc. and i'll hook u up! I can guarantee you an<br>  <br>  AMD Athlon 64x2 dual core 3.0 Ghz, 4 GB DDR2 RAM @ 800Mhz, Hitachi 250GB HD @7200, LG DVD/CD reader/writer optical disk drive, 512 MB HD 9600 DDR3 video graphics card, wireless 10/100 ethernet card, and a name brand motherboard with both cool & quiet technology & on board surround sound digital audio, windows vista OS, and a bangin case & powersupply for $1000. <br>  i can do better than the above specs, but i cannot guarantee exactly what because wholesaler and distributors have promos and programs that allways come & go. so i can guarantee the above specks at least, but of course if i can get a better part for same price or even a little more i will. i build all of my gaming & multimedia PCs as if for myself.

I'd suggest looking at Newegg; you can generally get some pretty nice stuff there at a nice price. Quick search gives me this:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229063" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  Might be a starting point.<br>  <br>  RAM is important, and can often make up for a slightly weak graphics card. Good graphics card can help ease up requirements on your CPU. Dual-graphics aren't that important, in my opinion. Your RAM and graphics card should be able to handle it without two graphics cards. Basically, I would look for a good CPU and RAM (4 gb should be a good amount). A graphics card follows those in importance, but make sure it's decent, at least.|`|g159oiTQaa	Alienware is overpriced and the few people I've known to splurge on that crap have been extremely disappointed -- and both of their rigs stopped working within a year; just Newegg/TigerDirect the parts you need.  WoW isn't that graphic-intensive so you will be fine for under 1k, but that's because it's a 4-year old game.  To run anything coming out more recently at the top settings will require a rig that will cost $1.5k+.<br>  <br>  Honestly since WoW is on what's probably its last leg, you might as well just save the extra money and buy a rig that will last you the next few years and through the next life-consuming MMO.<br>  <br>  In this case, it really will save you hundreds of dollars to research what you need.  It sucks if you don't really already know much about hardware, but if you want to be taken seriously, you won't opt for the Alienware or the Gateway with parts swapped out.|`|iF6ThEw8aa	GO with gateway and get a p705u. It costs 1,150 but it should cost alot more. Alienware is overpriced garbage. I'm telling you this on my p705u right now, and I play world of warcraft and it gets 60fps on maxed settings|`|TWm5Smlaaa	If I can't decide between two really great options, I pick the one that's either cheaper, looks cooler, or sound better.<br>  <br>  get the area51! It sounds and looks sickkkkkkk.

P6lYtjMIaa	im 14 and my top 5 favorite games are....<br>  1. Assassins creed-why? becuz the game s a strategic game that brings you back to the crusades in jerusalem, the grafics are amazing, its fun to sluaghter the evil templars and guards.<br>  2. rainbow six vegas 2 and 1- why? becuz the game is also strategic. with two soldiers helping you you have to carefully and quietlly kill all the terrorists with stealth. very exilerhating and extremly fun<br>  3.halo 1 and 2-why? amazing. thats all i have to say. heavily addicting fun of driving a warthog and running over the other guyz in multiplayer. awesome when u get a headshot with a sniper.<br>  4. call of duty 4- why? so many peepl. live chat with them while u kill eachother and plant bombs.!!!! fun!!!<br>  5. grand theft auto!!!!!!!!!!!! 4 life!- DA BEST GAME IN DA WORLD-SHOOTING IN  THE GANG LIFE AND CHILLING IN DA HOOD, JACKING CARS OMG FUN!<br>  <br>  overall most guyz love war games....!|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I like the action/adventure genre. It's so wide, it can be really enjoyable.<br>  Age: 15.|`|ECMtjGf5aa	Armored Core 4<br>  Madden 09<br>  Pokemon<br>  <br>  15 years.|`|9Hon0mHKaa	My favorite games have always been Mario. I know they are only for little kids, but you can never beat the classics! I am actually 17 years old and to those people who say that Mario sucks and is for kids...Think about it this way...WITHOUT MARIO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THE CRAZY FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS THAT ARE OUT TODAY! If you don't have the classic games, how do you expect to own something like Halo when video games have had no development over years?|`|X6ABZvqAaa	The type of game boys like to play? I'd suggest looking into Call of Duty 4, i know alot of people play it and i guess most of them are boys.

tpE0pWSfaa	Well thats why its called a back in time GLITCH ... glitches like these tend to make your game crash. My advice: Dont leave the screen to far and dont do anything ridiculous like skipping dungeons and going straight to gannondorf or something ... i dont know if thats possible cus i havent tryed going to gannondorfs castle with back in time glitch but you get what i mean (right?)|`|DgalPu0Iaa	Why would you use the back in time glitch if it would end up crashing? I don't even play this game.
BwsTfgWaaa	They probably did in japan, but in american i don't think it'd do well. First it wouldn't appeal to many people and it would be more of a story than a game being told without much action. Just walking around and talking to people and collecting items.

dcNT65mTaa	Beacuase the network is much better than PS3, and you only need to pay if you're planning on playing against other people online. they used to just charge u for getting online period so they're getting better. With the PS Network getting better, Live will possibly go free of charge as did Windows Live. If u can do something good, never do it for free. Microsoft's xbox live has millions of members and excellent match making so they really don't have any reasons not to keep charging cause they're still growing.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Because Microsoft wants it to cost money.|`|a7AatQcEaa	Xbox Live: 7.99/ 1month.....19.99/ 3 months..best deal: 49.99 for a year plus one bonus.<br>  <br>  Ps3 has free internet ..yay free..no bad. Xbox live is way better more people play, better games not that expensive anyway to begin with. P23 has crud games.|`|VyzDoETuaa	Xbox live is a lot better than Ps3's live.  Plus Ps3 cost more.|`|gB5ATj7aaa	because that makes it worth their while to ensure the service is actually good.|`|FKP9rHIHaa	could it be the ps3 costs more i dont know. Or the guy above is right bill gates ripping us off.|`|qjUljdZ0aa	I'll tell you why because xbox 360 has more online crap like taalking to people in other games and stuff like that ps3 just lets you play online, talk to people, and send messages, with the exception of downloading game demos and stuff like that. but i have both and xbox 360 is worth paying for live but i like both the same anyways.|`|4Kgn7bxbaa	Well the difference in cost between xbox and ps3 is a few hundred dollars. when you pay for the ps3 you pay for the multiplayer at the same time. but since the xbox is now less you have to pay 50 bucks for it for 13 month|`|iib1RKOzaa	Because microsoft want to give the best servers they can to out do the opposition but need money to upgrade and service these servers whereas the ps3 is free to compete with the xbox's better servers by appealing to people who don't want to spend money|`|sUQj5JaVaa	Xbox live was worth it but now PSN is basically copying everything XBL is doing for free. There are rumors that the price for XBL will go down.<br>  <br>  Xbox live still has more movies, arcade games and DLC though|`|Ogn3GD4gaa	Its just how its marketed.  <br>  PS3 is more expensive so it comes with free online play and isn't region coded.  There really is no reason, it's just how they market these things.|`|hOz91EO9aa	Because MS. Does not have enough cash as it is..

4flomCyJaa	You can either take the potion out of the sim's inventory, put it on the floor (or some other surface) and direct the sim to drink it, or you can click directly on the sim and choose the "drink love potion" option that pops up.|`|9Ws3sy6uaa	i agree with that person :)|`|sE2RH0A7aa	Take it out of their inventory and put it on the floor..

MdJLVVBCaa	One that I can suggest is Scions of Fate, that's 3D, Fantasy and Free and fairly addicting- although your character selection is down to 4 classes, it gives you enough variety on how to build your classes. <br>  <br>  Flyff is another following your requirements. Trust me, doing a search will help. <br>  <br>  Perfect World you may enjoy since with all races, you can fly in some shape or form.

PTovC2Dqaa	So far there isn't even going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3 because it hasn't even been announced that it has even started in production. But I'm almost 100% sure they will make one but it wont be released until two or three years from now (2011 or 2012). But on the up side there are going to be three more new Kingdom Hearts side games which still haven't been released yet and have already started in development and production.<br>  <br>  The new side games are Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Nintendo DS), Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep (PlayStation Portable), and Kingdom Hearts Coded (Cell Phones). Here's more information on the games:<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Nintendo DS):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep (PlayStation Portable):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Coded (Cell Phones):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a>|`|BwsTfgWaaa	Kingdom hearts three is a project that will be happening in the future, but not the near future. For starters, they have the three portable kingdom hearts games comming out, birthby sleep for the psp, 356/2 for the ds and coded for mobile. Now after that they also have the final fantasy games to do, 13 and 13 versus. So as you can see, square enix has their hands full right now and probably won't touch kingdom hearts three for a while.|`|TQVbiXtFaa	Yes. Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep is slated for release Summer 09 in Japan for the PSP. It's a prequel to the first.|`|MIeLuqUCaa	As u should no there will be birth by sleep,coded, and 358/2 days so expect only those
AkU8gr3Uaa	1- Stick ice down your pants (its harder than u think, its COLD)<br>  2- Grab the closest object to you and make out with it<br>  3- Sing a song as loud as you can<br>  4- Kiss  (the person being kissed decides where)<br>  5- you give the other player a dare back<br>  6- take off 1 piece of clothing (bundle up, its kinda fun)
e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Just tell your mom it's nothing worse than things you'd see in movies or [hell even] on TV, seriously.<br>  <br>  There's loose references.. er.. if you help the guy in bigtowns little clinic.. you could mention another girl claiming to have dated him. . . than he'll be shocked saying "how long was I out" than "Well. . . that would explain those dreams" erm.. ya.. kinda creepy.<br>  <br>  Pretty much if you get the lady killer or black widow perk you'll sometimes get a special option in dialogue with someone of the opposite sex and it'll usually be a sexually suggestive dialogue option [so funny to watch the reactions. . . Ronald in Girdershade anyone?]<br>  <br>  But that's usually it.. depending on your characters sex they may get hit on but nothing happens. You can pose dead body if you're talented [or have alot of time on your hands like me] and put them in suggestive poses.<br>  <br>  There's just alot of swearing.. but again nothing you won't hear on tv or in movies. Actually it sounds like my life this way -> lots of swearing from anyone and everyone. Makes the game more real for me.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	There are a couple hookers placed throughout, but it's what they say that could be considered "sexual" since you don't actually see the act of sex being committed.|`|AQ9JxT5xaa	The game actually shows nothing sexual.  It just talks about it.  There is a prostitute in one of the hotels that invites you to a night in a room, and even though this is a sexual theme, it doesn't show anything or have any noises.  There are drugs in there that enhance your abilities, like less damage and more damage.  It does not have real drugs like meth or weed in there.  All the drugs that you take in-game are just for status boosts.  However, you can get addicted to them in-game.  That's like the only realistic theme of drug use.  And yeah, there is bad language in there that you can't turn off, but you can turn subtitles in there to look ahead to see what that certain character will say.  That way you can press the "A" button to skip the verbal word use.|`|4ckE80mvaa	theres a hooker named Nova... but she dosent do anything from what i heard...    i didnt even bother with her... supposedly she takes you up to a room and falls asleep...  for 200 caps i think...   if you do get the game just buy a gun for 200 caps... its a waste of money|`|wPnJekdqaa	There's quite a few hookers/sex slaves in the game and there's a character that implies he's going to rape one of the slaves you get for him.|`|2AqrmZqsaa	there isnt really any, a few "hookers" at one point,<br>  but you dont seen anything and its 1 or twice<br>  <br>  its an M cause of the shooting part :)|`|N4dzsyRqaa	Nothing bad or even semi bad. In the game when you go to sleep the screen goes black until the timer runs out. In Fallout 3, the bar in Megaton has a prostitute (or hooker) which you can pay her for her services. She goes upstairs and lays on the bed with all her clothes on. You go and point your cursor at the bed and select sleep. The screen goes black and there are NO sounds or images or ANYTHING. When you wake up she lays beside you, with her clothes still on. That's it. Hope you can get the game it rocks!|`|3nWbgulEaa	Im guessing no one did the extra side quest and finished the game.<br>  <br>  In the end, if you where nice to the overseer and amata, you do it with Amata at the end before the vault is sealed.

I found a page with many useful "Action Replay Codes", and I try them in my No$GBA emulator and they all work. Here you have the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/DS/castlevania_ds/action_replay.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/...</a><br>  <br>  By the way, this codes work only in the USA version of the rom.<br>  <br>  Now, how to add this codes in the emulator? It's very simple<br>  <br>  1. First, open the "Utility" option and then pick "Cheats".<br>  <br>  2. Once you have done that, choose "Add new" and then make sure you have the "Action Replay DS" option on.<br>  <br>  3. Now, copy any code you want from the page and paste it.<br>  <br>  4. Put a description of the code. For example: "Infinite Health". Press "OK".<br>  <br>  5. Now, you should see your new code on the list. Click twice over your code to active and then "OK".<br>  <br>  And that's it. If you did it right, in this example, you will have an undying Soma (je, je).<br>  <br>  Well, if you have any doubt, contact me through my profile in Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  See ya!
4Vw9An50aa	I would say out of all 3 of the guild wars, prophecies is the most boring. Trust me, buy Nightfall or Factions. They are a lot more fun. Prophecies is far to long and it is pretty boring but it does get better at the end and when you finish it is pretty rewarding.|`|NPQ17XfHaa	Ahhh, you are still in Pre-Searing. It's basically the tutorial of Guild Wars. don't worry, once you do the first mission, it gets better. For a complete newbie, Pre-searing can take a few hours (it can be done in less than an hour if you are in a rush). After that, you get to the real game, and it gets much more fun.|`|A1AbiT3Iaa	I've been playing Guild Wars for over 3 years.  I still play it because it plays beautifully and there's so many skills, It's more about how you use your character than what level they are.<br>  <br>  Prophecies is still my favourite map, and bear in mind that the first map you load onto a new character with is a small training map before you go to the main map.<br>  <br>  Guild wars is meant to be played with friends, so try joining in with some guys and doing some missions or quests.  More fun that way.<br>  <br>  In my view it's still the best mmorpg out there.  but if it's not for you, it's not for you and that's that.  I'd suggest giving it more time though, you may grow to enjoy it!<br>  <br>  In the off chance that we both online, just add me to your friend list [N] as Lunatic Epitaph.  Who knows we may end up joining forces.<br>  <br>  Another thing about guild wars is that it's far more story centered than most games of its type.  You are in fact playing through a specific story line as you do missions and primary quests.  You don't need to follow the story line, but it's there waiting at any time.|`|speJXeIhaa	I've played Guild Wars for a couple of years now and have all 4 maps - Prophecies,Factions,Nightfall and Eye of The North.Prophs is seen as the training campaign above all others, i actually like it as its slow and peaceful but once you actually get past pre-searing it does get better,though it's best not to go through until you're about a lvl 7.Enjoy it - it is worth it as when you beat a campaign you get such a good feeling.Try making friends though as you really will need real live players at some point in the game to help you on missions.Good luck =) <br>  <br>  Email me if you need to know anything else.|`|z9c8VsRfaa	Prophecies has a rough start, but once you get going in it, you will find that it becomes very enjoyable. So just hang in there.

ysiE6IDjaa	Normally I would say remove your Downloads folder to the desktop so the game can't read it and then see if the problem still exists with no custom content. And also patch your game.<br>  <br>  But this problem happened to me just this week with a new house I downloaded and after removing my custom content I found the custom content wasn't the problem. (My game is fully patched too)<br>  What caused the jump bug in my game seemed to be something, most probably the cheats, the builder had used to make the house. I basically had to replace all the walls, stairs, interior foundations etc and remove all the quirky little split levels and stuff without using any cheats and that fully got rid of the jump bug. <br>  (The builder also used the lot adjuster from modthesims2 but I have downloaded many houses built using the lot adjuster and have never previously had a problem- it is known to sometimes cause this issue though)<br>  <br>  Anyway sorry for my rambling answer...in a nutshell I would still patch, then test without custom content, then if the problem still exists redo what you did with the cheats turned on with the cheats turned OFF.

FBorQAq3aa	Yes, that would be the DSi. I am strongly thinking about getting it. It has two cameras. Similar to the Wii, it has a DS shop channel(comes with 1000 free points if registered by March 2010), and I am almost positive the pictochat is in different colors. One down to it though, is that it only comes with so much memory, but it is expandable. I also want to think that there is a software you can download and make animations.(It is free.) This comes out in the United States on April 5, 2009 in blue and black.(If you don't like the color, there will be more eventually.) It also works as an MP3 player. The original DS and the DS lite do not have near as many features.<br>  <br>  By the way, the release price in the U.S. is $169.99.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|4FvK8XaJaa	Here's a preview of the new Nintendo DSi:|`|HvnxG0V8aa	Here's a vid about it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSKjZXWdMA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSKjZXWd...</a>|`|d1wYHWK1aa	Click this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.game.co.uk/lowdown.aspx?lid=10696&cm_sp=dsi-_-topnav-_-features" rel="nofollow">http://www.game.co.uk/lowdown.aspx?lid=1...</a>

xIyt4usUaa	Maybe you sent the wrong message to the animals, they can be very picky with what you write and how you write it.<br>  <br>  I answered this in a previous question a few days ago so I'll re-post the answer i gave here.<br>  <br>  Here is a description of how to get foreign fruit on Animal Crossing City Folk without having to travel to a different town:<br>  <br>  1. Write a letter to any animal in your town.<br>  <br>  2. In the first line of the letter write: Hello there friend.<br>  Nothing else but those 3 words and a period at the end.<br>  <br>  3. Attach a shell from your beach to the letter. It doesn't matter what kind of shell it is.<br>  <br>  4. Then send then letter.<br>  <br>  Do this with a few different animals and wait for them to mail you something back. The mail they send you back will either have clothes or foreign fruit in it. So make sure to send multiple letters out in case some send you clothes. It shouldn't take too long. I got all of the foreign fruit this way.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck! =D|`|Wzws8v8daa	if you send your neighbors a letter with a present attached (like a piece of fruit) they will send you a gift back, sometimes another peice of fruit.  i had to do it every couple days for a few weeks but i finally ended up getting peaches, cherries, oranges, and pears. <br>  the only other way is to get someone you know that has the game and add their friend code and then you can go visit their town and get their fruit|`|TQVbiXtFaa	If you mail fruit to the animals in town, they will sometimes reply with different fruit. Also, pay attention to your shore, as coconuts will wash up. This must be planted within ten blocks of shore, but not on the sand or in the water.<br>  <br>  I believe you'll need a contact in another country for foreign fruit, though, as each region's release has different fruits and holidays.|`|y4ZB492oaa	You need to find a friend that has animal crossing. Then go to there town, shake a tree and collect the fruit. Go back to your town and dig a hole. Bury the fruit. In a couple of days the fruit will grow.

mK3XsYEIaa	I would say Regigigas because Heatran is a fire-steel pokemon and you already have Dialga which is a dragon-steel pokemon. Although Heatran does learn some really strong moves such as Magma Storm which has a power of 120, Stone Edge which has a power of 100, and Heat Wave which has a power of 100. It can also learn Giga Impact which has a power of 150. But having two Steel types leaves you vulnerable to fighting types, and Heatran is extremely vulnerable to ground types.|`|CYiLmtjgaa	first of all your question. i would put neither in because they both suck like hell.<br>  <br>  and dude why do you have a whole team of legends.

y02PZj22aa	The pattern is for a throw that's 864 square inches.  You want one that's 1836 square inches, or 972 additional square inches.  It will take a bit more than twice as much yarn (approximately 20 balls)--and the throw will weigh about 5 pounds, which you will be holding in your lap.  <br>  <br>  If you want to tackle the larger version, just cast on 90 stitches and follow the pattern until you have the length you want.  Yes, you will need a circular needle at least 29" long, and longer if you can find one.  You will knit back and forth on the circular needle, but you'll need the extra length to accommodate the width of the project.<br>  <br>  You could also make 3 strips each 30 stitches wide and join the strips when you're finished.  That would accomplish two things:  The strips  would be lighter in weight and you could use straight needles 14" long.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	you would cast on 85 stitches and work in garter stitch, which is knit every stitch, every row until you have 54 inches in length.<br>  <br>  Since the blanket is using two strands of a worsted weight yarn which is a bulky weight yarn, it will be easier to use a circular needle.  circular needles are for working not only in the round but you can work back and forth, and its a great way to hold all of those stitches and yet have room to work.|`|AA12042448	I would suggest 48" x 54" or 58" for a throw, myself.  It would be easiest, since you're a beginner, to simply double the width of the pattern.  Cast on 120 stitches instead of 24.  That way, your throw will be 48" wide instead of 24" wide.  If you really want it 34" wide, please use 36" instead.  Why?  Because the math is easier!  Since 36 is 1.5 x 24, you can figure your casting-on stitches as 1.5 x 60, which is 90.<br>  <br>  Knitting two strands together is fun.  I do it all the time.  Keep a close eye on your work, and make sure you get both strands into every stitch.  After a few rows, you'll get a feel for it.  It will feel odd if you miss one strand.  Pay attention to that feeling and check it out before you knit too far away from it.<br>  <br>  This is not knit on circular needles.  It is done in garter stitch (knit all the way across and knit all the way back) which is easiest on straight needles.  If all you have is circular needles, email me for instructions on how to do this on them.
XBTyopIMaa	ANY counting method (there are many... Revere, Uston, Red 7, etc.) will, at the end of a deck, always come out to zero, providing that the number of cards that you give a value of -1 to, equals the number of cards that you give a value of +1 to.|`|y822j5h5aa	Yup. It  has to as long as you counted correctly. And this makes a good way to practice and check to see if you have correctly counted the cards.
m0V5wSKBaa	Hi I think you have a strong build. It just needs some cards to go with the current Meta.   I would like to suggest 3 Skill Drains too.<br>  If you decide to go Skill Drain Beatdown.

6N3yjlXhaa	Lift the presser foot and re-thread the machine.<br>  <br>  Make sure the bobbin is inserted into the bobbin case so the thread is feeding off the spool in the correct direction and through the proper guides.<br>  <br>  Use bobbin thread for machine embroidery.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Yep something is wrong. You shouldn't see the bobbin thread at all. Are you using embroidery thread on top and embroidery bobbin thread in the bottom. An embroidery needle? and try more stabilizer too.|`|Ube5sgLkaa	The exact same thing happened to me and Im also new to embroidery. I was making two mistakes. 1) I was putting the bobbin incorrectly 2) and most important the upper threading. I had to do it a few times and honestly i didn't do anything different but apparently something wasn't in its place. I had asked an experienced person and told me it wasn't the tension and to keep it between 4 and 5.|`|TsE6VVDVaa	You're tension could be wrong. Make sure your tension is about 2. You must have the embroidery thread (top thread) coming through the back a little bit. Also slow your machine right down if you can.<br>  I usually use bobbin fill in the bobbin,white for light coloured embroidery and black if you are using black embroidery thread. If this doesn't work, try using a matching colour in your bobbin.Check out the home page of my web site for instructions to get the best results.

It really comes in handy when you need your Phone, money, or water bottle at a certain time. If your going in the summer, you should wear shorts, a tank top, and if there is water rides, wear a bathing suit under your clothes to cool off with flip flops. hope this helps =)|`|H2qEN27daa	I would look for a casual bag (at like Mandee's, Forever 21 or even Claires) that you really dont care about. LOL. I would suggest buying one that closes with a zipper, this way if you have to bring it on certain rides, you can wear it on your shoulder and not be worried about things spilling out. When my cousin and I went to Disney's California Adventure, we went on a rollercoaster (that had 1 loop) and there werent lockers to put your bag, so we squeezed mine into hers and zipped it up. She held it on the ride and we had no probs :)|`|lin0jVvXaa	Something big enough to carry your stuff but not too big so you can take it on the rides or leave it in a locker. It doesnt matter if its daggy :p<br>  No ones gunna care! Id suggest an over the shoulder bag as they arent too bad and are quite easy to carry around. Just make sure you take only what you need.

It will be either a female or male, and it will have different natures. But if you give the female salamence a everstone, theres a chance the egg will hatch into a bagon with the same nature as the salamence. If you evolve the magikarp into a gyarados and lvl it up until it learns hydro pump, and then you breed it, the bagon will have hydro pump as one of its moves.
AA11436163	It's a glitch.  Sometimes if you move the sim out of the house it will go away.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Have you tried actually making her pregnant.  That might work.  My guess is, you'll probably have to play the sim the way she is or delete her.  I've had sims like that in the past.  Most often, I ended up deleting them.|`|cXc8lujaaa	how about you try to get her pregnant.That may help.

Click the option for "Spawn" and look in the spawn menu until you see "Wishing Well".<br>  <br>  Voila. You have a wishing well.|`|8IcRWQmDaa	You can join the Garden Club but using boolprop testingCheatsenabled true was the only way that I got the wishing well. There are two reasons you need to be careful with this cheat. Boolprop cheats have been known to cause damage in the games so be careful. If there is an error message ALWAYS press cancel. Next is make sure all of your needs are full before wishing in the well or a bag of change may land on your sim and kill them. Such a fun game isn't it!  :)|`|wqsih7MUaa	Become a member of the garden club.<br>  kthanx.

It just got into the console wars a couple years ago. It also hasn't been working to design portable systems; you might note the XBOX had a reputation for being quite large for a console. <br>  Also, the portable system market isn't as good of an opportunity as the console market was. It's a smaller market, and Nintendo dominates it pretty heavily. The NGAGE and such failed to even take hold at all, and even the PSP is struggling. It's basically held its own by being a portable movie player and the like more than a game system. This makes the market even worse for a new player to join in.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Microsoft might be relying on the success of the 360 to bring in the money.<br>  In my opinion, a Microsoft handheld would be gimmicky, used only to rake in the profits.

Z0odTlyQaa	They basically all require you to sign up for one thing or another (newsletters, etc) at some point, and that could be considered spam (just crap coming into your email box).<br>  <br>  I have been using this site mypoints for several years now. They give you points for doing surveys or signing up for newsletters, or Netflix and things like that. They don't give you cash but there are other good rewards to choose from. So far I have got a $10 Overstock.com gift card and a $10 Barnes and Noble gift card. There are a lot of rewards to choose from.<br>  I also made a new email address JUST for mypoints, so all their newsletters don't get mixed into my important emails.<br>  The site is mypoints.com|`|3e7d0f0ca0c5e4a75794f78820eabdd6aa	Yes there are some great paying surveys sites online! To avoid the spam, I use a separate email address for my surveys. I just check every now and then for a confirmation email (tell me that I made money)!   Anyway I have included a few links in the source that I have found from a search here!|`|4z4rOfTnaa	try quizfarm.com|`|mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.
T644csEIaa	u dont need halo 1 and 2 to play 3-the story is too convoluted to follow anyway-btw there's just blood and a little language in this, so explain it doesnt really deserve an M rating<br>  <br>  tell your parents the good side of video games<br>  Gears teaches teamwork, loyalty, tactics, and defending your people and remind that you are ready to see a little gore, and that there's nothing in those games that's out of place on prime time tv<br>  <br>  and for fable? explain how every choice you make in it has a consequence<br>  and how to learn from those decisions|`|X92FdfPeaa	1. Yes the xbox 360 is really worth it if u can buy the right games.<br>  <br>  2. NO that is stupid, you cant just turn off swearing and gore, that would ruin the game.<br>  <br>  3. Yes i am 13 and i play GTA 4 which is for over 18 and my parents bought it for me.<br>  <br>  4. I only played halo 3 and i got the story, ditch the last 2, their not so good.|`|xW5KJEpnaa	Yeah, I'm pretty sure in Gears, you can turn off the blood and gore, language, etc. But, I'm not exactly sure of all those other games. Probably Oblivion and Fable include the parental control options, but Halo, not so much. You should probably play Halo and Halo 2 before playing Halo 3, unless you don't give a **** about the story. Just tell your parents there are parental controls regardless. They'll probably get it for you then.|`|o7wAsSUCaa	i was 11 when i had these games so idk y u cant get em but anyway...Gears of war u can turn off the gore and stuff but i dont think u can for the other games....for halo i say skip the first 2 and go to the third or u can just not buy them (i hate them cuz it's not real life stuff) and just get call of duty|`|cXX8iDDNaa	Gears of War does have an option to turn off extreme content<br>  Halo 3 doesn't need one as the gore is very minimal.<br>  <br>  as for playing the other two halo games.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  Try this product...Sonic Scrubber.  I sent you the link to check out all of the different options/pricing.  I know several people who use it with great success.<br>  <br>  Mary
wTBjLstZaa	Well... a couple things...where to start?<br>  <br>  first, i assume this is for competitive, right? for in game its fine<br>  <br>  I give your team a 2-3/10. It just isn't competitive material.<br>  <br>  step 1. you NEED (NO EXCEPTIONS) at least 2 walls if not a 3rd or a tank to supplement them. Salemence, roserade, houndoom and steelix are all OHKO material. i know most pokemon noobs (sorry) want to just get in there and go for power, but as annoying as it is, if you dont have high defences you WILL lose. constantly. My favorite stallers are (shock) cresselia and blissey. they come in on a pokemon theyre good against and when they switch out, thunderwave or toxic for some nasty crippling. then switch to something else to absorb the new attack and they're crippled. <br>  HOWEVER: i sometimes (only if there are 2 other reliable walls) like to play nasty with blissey by giving it max def and Hp and giving it counter. OHKO on anything except a ghost. unfortunately it usually means death to Blissey too by the switch in or stealth rock (2/3 times)<br>  <br>  Step 2. Get some support moves! there are only two basicly good types of teams. those with supporters and those that take out all opposition in order to set up a late game sweep (ie curselax)<br>  <br>  ratings: steelix: 2/10<br>  roserade(9/10) i dont like this poke, but its preference<br>  Salamence: 8.5/10<br>  Houndoom: 7/10 not a great poke. PREDICTABLE<br>  Kingdra: 6/10 only because its not a rain dance team<br>  Dusknoir: 9/10. its fine<br>  <br>  Dusknoir makes a good tank. he is set up fine, but my preference is to give him low HP and max defense and Sp. Def because it makes pain split that much more effective.<br>  <br>  If not for Steelix's typing, it would be an amazing pokemon. it is weak to fighting, water, fire, and ground. probably the 4 most commonly used types in the game. It is also much too slow to pull off anything else. the only useful steelix ive ever seen was on a baton pass team with lots of upgrades. i suggest switching to...metagross (although he is much to OU) <br>  <br>  Kingdra's swift swim is only good on rain dance team, rain will cripple salamence and houndoom.<br>  <br>  you have a little bit of work to do. but don't worry! i studied competetive pokemon for a YEAR before i started winning on any smogon tournaments. unfortunately the only way to get good is by losing a lot, learning from opponents, trial and error, and (sorry but its true) studying smogon movesets. usually they are the best, but i always take 2-3 of my pokemon and stick suprise moves on them (eg. my abomasnow starter has focus sash and brick break/focus blast + ice shard with max sp. attk and attk to suprise weaviles and tyranitars)<br>  <br>  good luck! the key to pokemon is to study the established OU sets while giving it creative twists.|`|Pw1y449Daa	Steelix + Sturdy + Leftovers + Impish:<br>  EV: Max Defense + Max Attack<br>  Earthquake<br>  Thunder Fang<br>  Crunch/Gyro Ball<br>  Stone Edge<br>  <br>  Dusknoir + Pressure + Leftovers + Impish/Timid/Calm/Careful:<br>  EV: Max Defense + Max Special Defense<br>  Pain Split<br>  Toxic<br>  Double Team<br>  Night Shade<br>  <br>  Kingdra + Swift Swim + Petaya Berry + Modest:<br>  EV: Max Special Attack + Max Defense/Max Special Defense<br>  Dragon Pulse<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Surf/Hydro Pump<br>  Hyper Beam/Flash Cannon<br>  <br>  Houndoom + Early Bird + Petaya Berry + Modest:<br>  EV: Max Special Attack + Max Speed<br>  Flamethrower/Overheat/Fire Blast<br>  Dark Pulse<br>  Solarbeam/Hidden Power (Grass)<br>  Nasty Plot<br>  <br>  Salamence + Intimidate + Expert Belt + Adamant:<br>  EV: Max Attack + Max Speed<br>  Dragon Claw<br>  Earthquake<br>  Stone Edge<br>  Zen Headbutt/Crunch/Fly/Aerial Ace/Brick Break<br>  <br>  Roserade + Poison Point + Expert Belt + Modest:<br>  EV: Max Special Attack + Max Special Defense<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Leaf Storm<br>  Extrasensory<br>  Hidden Power (Rock)<br>  <br>  If you change all of that, then its guaranteed 10/10.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|QJwaagGWaa	Ok, lets see:<br>  1. Steelix, ok you have its Defense and Hp maxed out, but this pokemon is not exactly classified as a Wall pokemon, it is one of those that can take a lot of damage and recover and all that. Also, Steelix has too many weaknesses that you will Mostly encounter, Fire, Water, Fighting, Grass, and he also has another disadvantage, he is too slow..... the moves are great, but...  8/10<br>  2. Roserade, hmm.. yeah, a good grass pokemon to have, she has maxed speed and special attack, ok., but I will prefer if she was holding a different item.. 9/10<br>  3. Dusknoir, well if I were you, I would have given him a Fighting move like Brick Break, just in case a dark or Normal pokemon shows up........ 8/10<br>  4. Kingdra, yeah, Damp rock + Rain Dance is a good combo, there is not much I can say to her face, so....... 10/10<br>  5. houndoom, well if you like him, I understand, but there are better fire pokemon than them...... the only problem you will face is if you are going against A rock and/or ground pokemon... but he's good, 8/10<br>  6. Salamence yeah, I like this guy, just be careful with that Focus Sash item......... 10/10<br>  <br>  Overall, a good team, a few changes in attacks can really make this team better! 8.5/10|`|zcUDPUC8aa	10/10 very good but not as good as mine lol|`|c1WIEwMMaa	9/10 good!|`|fcSlOQCNaa	8/10. add a gardevior or gallade to make it 10/10..!!!!!!|`|GGSpgre7aa	I don't know about two dragon types, but that is your problem<br>  <br>  Steelix:8<br>  I suggest a more powerful steel type attack, like Iron Tail or Flash Cannon<br>  Dusknoir:10<br>  Can't say anything bad<br>  Kingdra:10<br>  Nice, but maybe you should teach it Outrage for more damage<br>  Houndoom:7<br>  Only one of its types are covered so maybe a better variety like<br>  Flamethrower, Dark Pulse, Hidden Power, and Ice Fang<br>  Salamence:10<br>  Awesome, Salamence is awesome<br>  Roserade:8<br>  I don't know what Sleep Powder is for, but maybe you need to teach pokemon Dream Eater or Nightmare|`|k8h2kAd1aa	2/10 you should catch aggron,breloom,tyranitar and dragonite.<br>  ps thats my team.|`|9oALw1ogaa	1. Steelix-9-it is a well rounded wall<br>  <br>  2.Dusknoir-5-its a better wall/staller. Ice punch would be better than thunder punch, i have a dusknoir with ice punch and it comes in handy more than thunder punch<br>  <br>  3.Kingdra-7- rain dance does mot help anyone else on your team just kingdra replace with another move like substitute which would make kingdra lethal<br>  <br>  4.Houndoom-7-im not to big on houndoom theres to many good fire types put there<br>  <br>  5.Salamence-8-great pokemon! theres not much else to say.<br>  <br>  6.Roseerade-8-another great pokemon. it balances your team well<br>  overall i rate it a 7.5 it has room for improvement. if you want a real team rating check out this site<br>  <a href="http://rayquaza.forum-motion.com/forum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rayquaza.forum-motion.com/forum.h...</a>

So; upgrade to a sata 500 hard drive. this way you will not have to ask about  this problem for some time. Or you can get an external hard drive and transfer your personal files and any important stuff to it. this will give you more space on your currant hard drive.just remember when you go away for any length of time to secure the external hard drive in a safe place.A memory card will not do you much good because they are limited to their size. and a lot of games keep expanding as you play.Personally; if I were you I'd use an external harddrive memory, plug in and use is easier than changing the hard drive over to a bigger one.|`|M6ciLlNWaa	I BELIVE YOU DO NEED ONE BECAUSE A MEMORY CARD CAN HOLD ONLY A LIMIT AMOUNT OF DATA.

New games for the Xbox 360 console (always) sell for $59.99 ~ 63.99 w/ tax. The used games are in the 20-40 dollar range and are much more reasonable. As for the shooter, its all really personal preference. Call of Duty 4 is great if you love modern warefare with the classic COD feeling. Call of Duty: World at War (which is what im assuming you mean by 'cod 5') is great if you love the classic WWII feel of the series with a bunch of cool new perks and what not thrown in ***i highly reccomend Call of Duty: World at War to any avid fan of the series, trust me its worth the 60 bucks for a new copy***<br>  <br>  Well, hope I helped<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|Z0odTlyQaa	Call of Duty 4 is much better than the new one. Games can be really expensive, so we just have a Gamefly account. They send games right to our mailbox, we get our achievements and send it back. We only buy the games we know we are going to play again and again.<br>  Another thing we do is buy games on eBay, you can usually find them pretty cheap.. Right now I have a copy of Assassin's Creed on there listed for about $6 including shipping.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like we like the same games, but I would recommend Gears of War 2, CoD4, Grand theft auto 4, Rainbow Six Vegas 2.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit* - Ooh yeah Bioshock was great too, I recommend that too. (A rental though maybe, not a purchase). Also Left 4 dead (rent it though)|`|01hrZfBoaa	I picked up Burnout Paradise for 20 bucks at Future Shop and I'm pretty sure that's the asking price for it everywhere now. It's well worth the 20 dollars and it's a really fun racing game. <br>  <br>  Along with that: Assassin's Creed and The Simpsons game are cheap and good.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Madden 09|`|O5nggjddaa	All good games except Banjo Kazooie but thats just my opinion but so far Street fighter is good if you liked the old school feel like the previous street fighters. I love call of duty and to me it determines your liking cause cod 4 is better but its starting to get laggers and cod 5 is fun and you free fire more with submachines but there will be a lot of camping but I would say get cod 5 because there are new maps coming out in march and so alot of people will return to cod 5 for that
ow1x7fHTaa	no, they are harmless. you dont wanna shoot them at anyone because they do hurt a little, but not that much. they spark a little if you shoot at metal but they dont catch fire. i had one when i was seven. you can get one at walmart or target or, they have cheap ones at most dollar stores. they  also sell at cvs, rite aid,walgreens, and most pharmacies.
SkpRC2Nmaa	The game is cool but not really much
lRq81lu7aa	A size 2 crochet hook is quite small.<br>  <br>  Try a bigger size, like a 10, which would be a letter J hook, until you get more experienced.  A 10 is bigger and you can see your stitches better.  The smaller the hook, the smaller the stitches and the harder they are to see.  <br>  <br>   Also when you buy yarn, on the label they usually recommend a size crochet hook for that type of yarn.  When I started crocheting I used a bigger hook and yarn to see my stitches, then I could make corrections better and it saves time in the long run.  Have patience and practice!  Once you get it, it is a really great hobby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|hVICguqGaa	yea its fine... but as a beginner i would go with something a bit bigger like a 5 or 6 (or bigger) cause then you will be able to see everything and know if you mess up or how its supposed to look. plus its easier to everything loose with a bigger hook when you are beginning .

2Q2ltt1Saa	Each game uses a varied amount of data; it's not like "blocks" like with the PS1 and some other earlier systems.  (Well, technically it is, but we're talking about 8 million blocks instead of 15.)   You can see how much space by loading up the system w/o a disc, choosing the memory card, and exploring it.<br>  <br>  Corrupted doesn't mean it's out of space; it means something didnt' save properly, either due to a bug in the game, turning it off while it was writing data, or some other problem.  You would instead get an "out of memory" error if there wasn't enough space to write the information.|`|070af3f15b926093c69b44f51816ba38aa	depends on the size of the games|`|bRJRKBn1aa	on the 16 MB u can save many games data. the data probably corrupted because probably u turn of the system when its saving. that happens only if u reset the system turn it off while its saving.

L2bJ63GSaa	I'm gonna be very simple about this. It's a big decision and right out of the blue I'm gonna say the Playstation 3. Why? Well.........<br>  <br>  1.)Obviously I'm gonna say it has a built in Blu-Ray player. Even though you might think that Blu-Ray players are cheap right now (about $300 for a decent one) the best reason for this is the games. A Blu-Ray disc holds about 50GB of HD memory. A regular dvd holds roughly 5GB. Think about the possibility that will some with 10 times more memory. Once the game developers take advantage of Blu-Ray technology games could be absolutely amazing. The Blu-Ray technology is just barely tapped by games right now and it will become huge in little time.<br>  <br>  2.)The hardware is plainly better. Although this isn't extremely noticeable, it could help out throughout the long run. 550MHz compared to the 500MHz in the Xbox 360. What that means is that the graphics processor for the PS3 is faster, and that's better graphics with less loading time.<br>  <br>  3.)Let's talk about games. Obviously this is one of the biggest things between the console war. The Xbox 360 has an impressive line up of games wih much variety. I am not biased so I will say the winner of this is absolutely hair-thin close. Now a lot of people will say the Xbox 360 has a better selection, and I agree somewhat. I believe for every blockbuster on the 360, there's one to back it up on the PS3. What that means is every console has it's fair share of great games. Most people say you can't compare with Halo 3, well no action game compares with Metal Gear Solid 4. Also, there is Resistance 2 on the PS3, and there is Gears of War 2 for the 360. Halo Wars is coming out for the 360, while God of War III is coming out for the PS3. Also I think you could find some triple A title to compete with Little Big Planet. I do believe that games will turn to the PS3 once Blu-ray technology has really been developed into games.<br>  <br>  4.)Now we are going to discuss online play. Xbox live is better than Playstation network. Now I will say this, it is not 60 dollars a year better. Playstation network is absolutely free. Plus it has a built in Wi-Fi antenna, which Microsoft sells for $100. All together if you plan on using a wireless source for online play, you could be paying up to $160 more for Xbox Live. Now to me it just isn't worth it. Playstation network is improving and personally I can't really say anymore that Xbox Live is so much better than Playstation network. Usually that is just a thing said by Xbox fanboys which there are more of.<br>  <br>  5.)Finally the price. Microsoft sells their main Xbox for $299 which doesn't include Xbox Live price, Wireless antenna, or a Blu-ray player. PS3 includes all 3 and sells for $399. When you think about it it really isn't that much more. You definately get more for what you pay for with the PS3.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion take this advice. You won't be disappointed with a PS3. It is to me a better selection of the two and I hope you make an educated choice.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Neither of them.They all suck..especially the wii.|`|S8rldtsgaa	i think wii because its revolutionary ;)|`|O928WT4Taa	Get a ps3 if you have the money, get the xbox if your on a budget.

You're going to have so much fun with it.<br>  <br>  I also like the Xbox 360..it's pretty nice.|`|Qwh3GImraa	It depends what you like.<br>  If you like great graphics and awesome FPS games with awesome online play, then get a 360.<br>  If you like interactive games for the family, get a Wii.<br>  If you like lots of music and Blue ray, then get a PS#.<br>  I would get a 360 if I was you.|`|GIidNcv7aa	Choose either a PS3 or a 360.<br>  The Wii is just plain awful.|`|bRJRKBn1aa	ps3 man ps3. ps3 has HD graphics. it has free interent.|`|iQZcCqwfaa	Get a wii, it is very fun to play.

k32sOHLgaa	Yes. There is a game that allows you to play a virtual ocarina. It is called "Daigasso! Band Brothers DX". It has a game mode (in which you play a rhythm game and have the ability to use alot of musical tools) but it also has a free play mode in which you can play the instrument however you like without time limitation or predetermined purpose.

z2LGqY0Gaa	Gamestop and other big chains don't carry older stuff.  Look into ABU games or Play N Trade franchises near you, pawn shops also take old game systems.  Craigslist will get someone that is local to you.  There are a lot more small franchise stores out there and they are the ones that are more likely to have what you are looking for.  Don't pay more than $20 for one though, that's about all they are worth in stores.|`|hwzPFyZTaa	I would go to gamestop but I havent seen one of those in a very long time there.|`|bRJRKBn1aa	go to gamestop. they have all the old systems and old games.|`|RYFPpRbYaa	try buying it from amazon or best buy !|`|6qPFNkyDaa	i have seen some old systems at gamestop. they also have lots of the nintendo 64 games.|`|HbIWPH4gaa	Gamestop no longer carries N64's or N64 games, so your best bet would be to try local classified ads, pawn shops, and thrift stores.

ZnMnZbSLaa	I personally would put it on the easiest setting first. When you do this he can not perform ultra's. Also when you beat him with Ryu, you will unlock Shakura. By placing the difficulty on easy, you will in sure that you unlock all the other characters. Then I would jump online and play to sharpen your skills with the world's best and come back and lay the smackdown on SETH.

Then just try to block and repeat the above. Stay away from him, don't get too close. If you do, attack then back away asap.<br>  Good luck bro|`|LKr92NT7aa	Seth is a really cheap character and there is no easy way to beat him, my advice is that you just practice many times and i found that leaning away from special moves in favor of the usual attacks works better, for example:<br>  Abel has a good knock-up attack, crouch + HP which can be lead neatly into a heavy kick, this is good for doing lots of damage easily.<br>  You should also be jumping around a lot and blocking a large portion of the time

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	Buying them is one thing but you can get out the old magnifier and go through rolls of coins from your bank, but be a good guy and take them back to another bank when you are done looking. Error coins such as doubled dies are out there as well as the wide and narrow AM coins. I am not a fan of error coins, but have found some in rolls. I go for the old stuff, my eyes are not what they used to be.|`|dgXs1Y2faa	The best place to get error coins is to buy them from a local coin dealer or off a website such as littletoncoin.com or coinland.com. If you buy them from there you will just get an error coin. If you buy bags and rolls you might not get error coin so you might pay extra for some coins you don't want. So I would buy them specifically as error coins.

k60TmtZ4aa	I've found that most strategy games are more or less the same. You need to establish a camp, build an army, and launch attacks. Most of the units are the same, which means that you could go from playing Age of Empires to Starcraft after figuring out what the different buildings represent.
u0ydx14Yaa	its way to easy|`|2PGIoNUHaa	For starters, it gets boring if you keep playing on normal/advanced.<br>  <br>  Play it on expert, with some friends. Try different tactics every game/map/section. If you play the same way all the time, it gets boring. Example:<br>  <br>  No mercy, level 2 subway:<br>  <br>  "Hey guys! Start the horde! Let's all go into a corner and just spam melee!!!"<br>  <br>  Yeah. Try other tactics. Covering someone on a mini gun, 2 in this corner, 2 over there, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  On versus, try playing competitively. Look for people online, (Maybe gamebattles) and do some skirmishes with them.<br>  <br>  <br>  When I first got the game, I played about 4-5 days playing time on it, then got bored. I'm talking about like within 1 week, 4-5 days playing time on the game lol. I think I got a little more than 2 weeks worth of gameplay now.<br>  <br>  Don't worry though, new maps/versus mode maps are coming out soon.|`|3kyJzANIaa	cause they make too many games like it.|`|hR1hsdthaa	Because you suck at it|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Cuz there is no matchmaking and most of the time the enemies always block off exits.

4lO7CSn0aa	You absolutely do not have to use Citadel Paints.  There are about a dozen other ranges out there that have the pigment content to be perfectly adequate for painting miniature soldiers:<br>  <br>  Tamiya, Vallejo, Rackham and Coat d'Arms are just a few of the better known.  "Army Painter" - a dipping product designed for painting large numbers of models very quickly, is also worth checking out and gaining increasing credibility with hobbyists.<br>  <br>  But note that conventional artist's acrylics are not suitable.  These are designed for painting on paper and have a pigment content only a fraction of paints designed for miniature soldiers.<br>  <br>  Citadel do do a few things better than almost anyone.  Their Foundation range has the highest pigment content of any range of paints, making them ideal for painting over black undercoats (although they also cake and blob much more quickly, so the use of plenty of water as a thinner is essential).  Their new washes range aren't unique, but they are one of the best small-area wash sets on the market: only very slightly shiny in finish, with brilliant coverage and a surface tension so low the damn stuff almost leaps off your brush!<br>  <br>  Citadel priming sprays are also good quality, although they are rather over-priced and equivalent products can be found (funnily enough, car body primers from Halfords are particularly good for half the price).|`|kIqq7yIAaa	use whatever paints are best suited for your mini's<br>  best suggestion for priming them is neutral gray as it <br>  won't affect the overlying colors much<br>  black primer will darken overlying paints<br>  white will lighten it|`|elY5vkVyaa	Rackham, P3, Coat D'Arms, Vallejo.. take your pick, they are all acrylic paints made for both metal and plastic miniatures.

9KeaTUh6aa	Since it seems like you're playing Legacy/casual with this deck, I'll give you some hints based on that. First, Reya, Dawnbringer is a better choice than, say, Bogardan Hellkite. While she isn't as powerful, the effect saves you from paying life, a point of power, or having your opponent getting back a creature.<br>  <br>  Rather than Brainstorm, use Mental Note. It's cantrip power is reduced, but it is a smart choice for filling your graveyard. While you're at it, scrap 2 reanimation spells for the other two card drawing spells.<br>  <br>  This deck has very little removal. I personally play a Reanimator variant using 0 and 1-cost spells with Tidespout Tyrant and a full suite of Darkblasts to fuel reanimation.<br>  <br>  Two problems are inherent in playing Reanimator: Speed and protecting your valuable fatties. Your spells require discard, the creature AND a means of returning it to play, usually 2 or 3 cards. So if they Tormod's Crypt you, you're S.O.L. Blue and black suck at artifact and enchant removal, so you basically have to counter those spells. Annul is a great sideboard choice. Or you could put some green in and have Naturalize, as well as the powerful Ground Seal. I recommend going this way and using dual lands and mana fixers.<br>  <br>  Overall, my suggestions for you are:<br>  -1 Exhume<br>  -1 Buried Alive<br>  -2 Brainstorm<br>  +4 Mental Note<br>  -1 Bogardan Hellkite<br>  -1 Razia, Boros Archangel<br>  -1 Garza Zol, Plague Queen<br>  -1 Akroma, Angel of Wrath<br>  +3 Reya, Dawnbringer<br>  +1 Sutured Ghoul<br>  -2 Last Rites<br>  +2 Damnation (or another mass removal effect if these are too expensive for your budget)<br>  -2 Swamp<br>  +2 Dragon Breath<br>  <br>  Sample Sideboard<br>  4 Natualize/Annul<br>  4 Ground Seal/Divert<br>  4 Engineered Plague<br>  2 Damnation<br>  1 Haunting Echoes
cMHTVMpMaa	This may fall under illegal activity, but since you already own a copy of the game what I may advise should be no problem: Just download a copy of CoD 4, but use YOUR cd key when the installer prompts you to. The problem with why it can't read the disc properly may be due to the possibility of the cd lens needing cleaning, or just an old(er) optical drive in general.<br>  I have 2 disc drives and after 2 failed installs of Assassin's Creed on my master drive, it installed successfully on the slave drive (my burner drive).|`|ihLg9kz3aa	the above answer is right. I recently had lost my COD4 install disc and had to set my computer back to factory settings. So before I did that i copied my CD key and then reset my computer. After the reset i downloaded this torrent <a href="http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/28744168/CALL+OF+DUTY+4?tab=summary" rel="nofollow">http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/28744...</a> and use either utorrent, vuze, or bitlord to download. It will take anywhere from a couple hours to a couple days to finish. After its finished downloading you will have a folder with an .iso file in it. Now go and download Poweriso and once that has been installed on your computer go and right click on the .iso file and select poweriso--mount image to " ' " media. Now go to your computer and right click on the virtual drive and hit explore and then run the setup file and when prompted enter your cd key from your original disc. And there you go. Now you do have to manually update the game to version 1.7 but it only took me like 1 hour to update the game it all works online and singleplayer.

Most trainers come with a .NFO or a ReadMe containing detailed information on how to run it properly (cheathappens, etc) but there are a few that have the info written into them.<br>  <br>  You also need to match the trainer version with the game version.|`|BivFdHV5aa	if by the trainer you mean a replay video then you have to move the folder to the red alert 3 video folder and watch you as a replay in the game
ddCndJzBaa	You cannot because gameguard detects itself as a hacking attempt, they only made that message so  you dont get confused. You might be able to do server emulation on cabal, except you have to isolate the detection string and modify it which is a huge pain not to mention impossible (unless someone has already done it as a bypass method, then you can leech). btw, you'll probably lag. Not sure of ur specs though, but probably.|`|JNPWtr3jaa	if its activated by a file in the game or part of the game's programming delete the file or programming (very stupid dont do it) that activates gameguard for 1 or both games<br>  if the game activates a process, go to task manager and end the process (dont know what its called)<br>  i have no idea whether either of these methods work or exist but i would suggest not even trying to get them running at the same time<br>  wouldnt you think theres a good reason why you cant?
dbKj55akaa	I know you have to have bon voyage and he is in the mountain place, you will need to dig or go on tours until you find a map to his place.|`|qUDas0R4aa	i know on gta san andreas pc you find bigfoot after you download an expansion, maybe thats it
T3wenJ8daa	this site provides a guide on how to repair your ps2.<br>  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/guides/2003/11/ps2-repair-guide.ars" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/guides/200...</a><br>  but my advice is save up for a new playstation.|`|JNPWtr3jaa	it could be due to the scanning lens whatzitcalled being scratched<br>  even if thats not the problem, i would suggest taking it to a game store
QcMr2cpNaa	Depending on your situation...<br>  <br>  If it says exp OR highest skill...<br>  go into a ranked playlist and raise your skill to that number.<br>  <br>  If it says exp...<br>  i suggest 2x exp weekend...but any social playlist will work. Also...<br>  DO NOT raise your skill if it says the above, you will make it harder to rank up in the future.|`|6cZZvRMzaa	Meessa tink so, but it also be known bah you dat you may have to play da greeaat ranked games, but meessa no sure. By da way, da quickest way to da naboo is through da planet core.
JNPWtr3jaa	if you mean hacking items, i suggest not trying since it probably will mess up your wii<br>  if you mean changing the town itself (new neighbors, new store locations, etc.) you have to destroy the town and start over<br>  if you do that i suggest giving a friend everything you have then once you make your new town get the stuff back from him/her|`|rjbmPrwPaa	You can hack by putting building "seeds" in your town.  The seeds are basically different buildings that can be put where ever you want, depending on which spot your character is standing.  I'm not 100% sure it works in AC:CF but it does work in AC:WW.  <br>  It is a little difficult to completely mod your town, however.  I wouldn't suggest it.
MFAVIW1waa	It's called strength and depends which pokemon game you have.<br>  <br>  Firered/Leafgreen: Go to the safari zone and find some gold teeth(near the house with the guy that gives you HM surf). Give it to the warden in the house with the mailbox in fuschia city and he'll give you HM Strength.<br>  <br>  Forgot where to get it in emerald/ruby/sapphire<br>  <br>  Pearl/Diamond: Go to solaceon town and walk down and enter the tower (called the lost tower) and go up to the top floor and talk to both of the women. One will give you HM Strength and the other will give you a soothe bell (which increases the friendship level of the pokemon holding it)|`|FoJlzQB4aa	It's called Strength not Rock Push
