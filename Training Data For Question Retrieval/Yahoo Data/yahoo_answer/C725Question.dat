20061222004547AAmv8nY	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	I'm just wondering, for my own personal knowledge, how many of you are like this?	When making a sandwich, how many of you think like I do? That condiments (mustard, mayonnaise, etc.) should not ever touch the cheese...condiments should rest soley on the meat side of the sandwich.  Furthermore, do you agree that mustard should be used for ham and roast beef whereas mayonnaise should be reserved for turkey and chicken?  I know it's odd, but my friend and I were discussing this the other day and we discovered that we have the same odd proclivities regarding sandwiches.  I was just curious what other people thought.  And yes, I know it's weird to be concerned about where the condiments are on a sandwich, but I am.  Thank you for your time.
