Whenever we go to the mall or something, she's usually wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt, with her hair tied back, wearing no makeup. Me, on the other hand, usually does my hair nice, my makeup nice, and tries to make myself look presentable. The thing is, whenever we're together ALL the guys that see her (even strangers) either stare at her or check her out or hit on her or say hi. Also, I'm 5' 1" (i know, im short) and shes like 5' 8". ah it just makes me so mad, i dont know what to do. also, she gets asked out like every day by a different guy each time, and i have never even had a real boyfriend! i reallly hate looking like the little ten year old, when strangers think i am and think shes 27. we're both 15. AH. can someone give me some advice on... anything?   thanks

20090307112240AAg8nYB	Beauty & Style;Hair	What do you think of this hairstyle idea?	I have dark brown hair which reaches half way down my back. It is side-parted and layered, with a side fringe.       For the summer I was considering getting either bright purple or bright blue highlights at the bottom of my hair, starting to fade in  at about two-thirds down my hair. In my school we are only allowed subtle hair colour so by the end of the 3 month summer holidays it would have to have grown down enough that I could get it cut out.       I know that hair dye can damage your hair, but I don't think this will because:   a) it's only once and only for the summer, and    b) the dye won't be anywhere near the root.       So what I want to know is,   - what do you think? Do you like it?   - do you think it would still damage my hair?   - would it be expensive?   - is it actually possible? Have you ever heard of anyone having this done before?

20090307112623AA0f55i	Beauty & Style;Hair	Will my froey hair calm down if it's longer?	My mother is biracial (black/white) and she passed her hair down to me. My hair is thick, curly, and wavy. It's mostly thick and curly, but these nappy squiggly sections jolt out sporadically. The longest I've ever grown my hair is about 5". I always cut it because it's just too big and I always either put on a hat or let it be crazy.       But I was wondering... if I grow it, will it fall and look like... say, Eddie Vedder or Jim Morrison, or would it look more like Buzz from The Melvins?      I mean, will the weight of my hair pull it down? I've never had long hair so I don't know the physics of it I guess. I don't know if the people I mentioned use(d) products or not either.      (PS: If you don't know who any of the people I mentioned are, do a google search before saying, "I don't even know who that is")

And this issue is..-drumroll- People won't keep their grubby hands out of my hair. I know this might not seem like a big deal but it gets irritating everyday. Having black people ( I'm one of the four naturals) in my school asking me if my hair is real. And white people just putting their hands in my hair and patting my 6 inch fro to a 2-inch twa. ( yes it's that bad!)      Now I'm not a violent woman... but I'm thinking about busting some caps. I've calmly(and loudly) told people to stop touching but no avail. What could I do to deflect their hands?(besides cutting them off)      It really makes me almost irate(and I'm a calm person) because I spend sooo much time perfecting my hair. I need your two cents!

20090307131832AAjAM4i	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to get my curls good and curly?	Hi!  This is for the girls with curly hair.  How much time do you spend styling your curly hair each morning?  And what is your daily styling routine?  My hair is just above my shoulders.  It's pretty thin from being on birth control pills for many years.  It's curly, but it's so difficult to get the curls to hang nicely and each be separated.  It's come to the point where I don't even try anymore.  I just put it up in a barrette and forget about it.  But I want to be able to leave it down and love how it falls.  Does anyone have any great mousse or other hair products to recommend to get the curls good and curly?  I've tried all kinds of brands and nothing seems to be that Miracle Cure yet!  What is your technique?  Thanks!!

20090227090541AAxsL4h	Beauty & Style;Hair	Can someone talk me out of it or should I do it?	Every year around this time, when winter is almost over and it's starting to look like spring, I'm really tempted to color my hair blonde. My hair is naturally medium ash brown, but it's a really bright red right now:  http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k65/Le...    The thing is, I change my hair all the time. I've had so many different colors. I want to find one that I really like and stick with it but I can't seem to and I don't know why. I just don't want it natural and I don't want to make it darker. I don't look good with dark hair. I really like blonde but I have a hard time making it the blonde I want without killing my color treated hair, and I like red but ... I don't know, I want to change it but I don't 'cause my hair is finally healthy(er). So should I add a bunch of blonde highlights and slowly make it like a medium blonde, or should I leave it this red ... or what do you think I should do? All I know is I want a change, even if it is a slight one. Thanks so much!

If not, can you suggest some other short hairstyles for curly hair?

20090227085904AARSLIl	Beauty & Style;Hair	I know she wears weave and wigs but how Long is Beyonce's real hair?	I've know she has worn weave and wigs, especially when her hair is down to her butt. but there are times when I thinks she is actually natural. For instance in the Deja Vu video she has this long fake ponytail also it super long and at the end, when she was in the black dress. But the other parts of the video, her hair was only about a little past her shoulders ... And the time I really noticed was in Upgrade u, when she was dancing around to Jay-Z. her hair was really short compared to how it was, when she had that huge braided ponytail.I know it's stupid to even care about this but it really annoys me when people hate on her and call her fake!!! I THINK SHE IS THE BEST NO MATTER WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE!!!!!!

Hi,      Well, I have a non-uniform day next two weeks and I was wondering if March is still considered to be a Winter month for England...      I was thinking of wearing long (just a few inches below knee) brown boots with heels on them with skinny jeans tucked in and a pea coat over my top. Would I still be able to pull it off? Or shall I go for something a bit more casual and less Winter(y)? What do you think?       Also, I am 13 years old, 5ft 7inches and 109lbs if that helps to judge about clothing.      And if you think that its not a good choice of clothes for this cold March then can you suggest something else?       Best answer=10 points.      Thanks x

20090307165121AAITsYU	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Please help me with fashion?	Okay I am going to a horse camp in the summer and I have been there once before, and I am not sure what to bring for myself for clothing. They have rules on cloths you can't wear they are: No holes in your cloths ( Unless they are really small), no tube tops, or tang tops the show your bra ( Im a girl just to let you know). And no flip flops or open toe shoes.      I really want to look good this year because last year I was way to focused on my horse then my self ( not that focusing on my horse is bad or anything ). I ride western so I need boots.   And I need to wear pants to ride ( no shorts). And it is some times cold at night. And I like pretty much anything cute and stylus. So any help you can give me I will appreciate. Oh and I am 14      Just please give me link or any advice at all. thanks :

I've gotten mystic and just naturally tanned in the sun but I need to go tanning before I go on my trip so I don't burn and they think I'm pale. (I live in Minnesota, so it's cold, there's snow and we're pale.) I'm going to start going to the tanning beds and I'm willing to invest money if it'llo be worth it. I heard that high pressure beds work faster and are more quality which is why the price is so high but I was wondering if I could use a HIGH pressure bed with having this be my first time tanning. I'm not doing low pressure because I heard they barely work and work slowly. So I'm looking at the Medium and High pressure beds. Please no lectures, I'm well aware of the effects which is why I'm almost 17 and haven't been in the beds yet. This is a one time thing and then I'll naturally tan over the summer. Please and thank you :)!

20090307165504AALGgLW	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Should I shave, pluck or wax?	There's all pro's and con's for this.      Shave:      Pro:   No pain.   Really quick.   Smooth within the first 24 hours.      Cons:   Grows really fast on right armpit (my mom gave me her weird armpit hair genetic)   Makes my skin dark.   Prickly and painful when starts growing. (i dont shave every single day, constantly like most girls)      Wax:      Pro:    Hair is gone, and for a a longer time.      Con:      I heard risk of bleeding.   Cost if done at salon.      Pluck:      Pro:   Same as wax.      Con:   Chicken skin.   Takes a longer time.   (idc for the pain cos who said being beautiful would be painless?)         So which would be more appropriate for me?

20090307163720AAwbLiR	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Why do people say that?	I'm getting a single line from a poem tattooed on the upper part of my left shoulder on my back and three lines from another poem on my right side above my hip. Both are going to be in beautiful feminine script writing and fairly small and both have substantial emotional meaning to me. No one will see them unless I choose to show them. I'm young and in shape and I think they will both look very good. However I never understood why people say, "Oh don't get a tattoo it will look old and wrinkly on your skin when in 40 years!" Who the hell cares? Your skin is gonna look like wrinkly crap in 40 years with or without a tattoo on it. And honestly when I'm an old woman, I'm pretty sure two small tattoos that I got when I was young will be the least of my concerns. I say get it while you have the body to show it and it's like a snapshot and remembrance of youth and freedom. Why do people want to hate on that?

Today I was out in town with a friend, shopping when I was approached by a woman around the age of 25 asking me if i'd like to model.

I am in my teens and Have heard of modeling scams before where you end up paying alot of money and you never receive any more information no matter how much you try. Anyway - I turned her down and walked away with my friend. But what I wanted to say, has she approached me because I have the look to be a model? I'm only in my early teens but I'm 5 foot 8 and I am just the right weight. Alot of people comment on the fact that I should try modeling. Should I try modeling by going to castings And doing it properly? I'm not scared of rejection or anything, that doesn't bother me because I'm quite thick skinned. Should i give this a go, or am I being stupid and vulnerable to flattery?

We know a good tattoo parlor to get it done at and everything.      The only problem is that my dad is a little.. haha old fashioned, i'll say.   He thinks i'll end up with a face full of piercings.

My dad didn't say no but he didn't say yes yet.   My dad values his opinion so i was thinking of having my brother talk to him.      Any ideas on convincing him?

I have to do an english project called the American Portfolio that entails researching how a specific subject has significantly influenced America (or is still affecting America).   My topic is the modeling industry and i am examining the positive and negative sides of the industry...the positive being that it inspires young girls to be fit and have confidence, and it aids the American economy.   The negative side is that it causes health disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and low self esteem because of the "perfect woman" image ideal.      For a specific part of the project, I need to create original artwork that portrays my subject. I can make anything I want, it just has to be original and I have to make it within a day.      Does anyone have any ideas for what I can make?   Thanks to everyone who answers!
