QoVL5cDHaa	Once your earnings go over the tax-free allowance of 6035, you are liable to tax. The end liability is on your total income, not how many jobs you have. Once you have passed your 6035, you pay 20% tax on the next 34800. So you would need to earn over 40835 in the year to pay Higher Rate tax.|`|2uPEty21aa	You pay a higher rate of tax when your income reaches a certain level.  It is not dependent on the amount of jobs you have.|`|AA12019574	no|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Assuming that you are in the UK, you will pay more tax on a second job. Every tax payer in the UK is entitled to some tax free earnings which is what your tax code relates to. Since this allowance is made when the tax on your first job is calculated, any tax on a second job will be for the full amount of tax applicable to your total income because you will already have had your tax free allowance on your first job. In other words, you only get the tax free allowance once, for your first job.    Hope that makes sense.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	The higher tax rate does not relate to the number of jobs you may do . It is all about how much you actually earn in one job or three or more jobs . As you say you can earn 6030 as a single person before paying any income tax , then you pay 20p in the  for the next 30,000 or so . You need to be earning in excess of 40,000 per tax year before the higher rate kicks in .  There will be complications with more than one job as you will get your tax allowance on job no 1 and on job no 2 you will pay tax on all your earnings|`|b8tgCAQJaa	You pay income tax according to your total earnings as an individual, not the number of jobs you have.    As for higher rate tax: For the 2008-09 tax year, you pay no tax on the first 6,035 of your earnings, basic rate of 20% on your next 34,800 of earnings, and higher rate of 40% on anything above this amount.    So you'd have to be earning over 40,835 in this tax year to be paying any higher rate tax at all.|`|AA11837575	im not sure sorry wish i could help.|`|PNiaCdOraa	depends where u live but probably u will|`|DjMAhvpvaa	It all realy depends on how much you make. If you make a lot of money, you get taxed up the rear end. But if you don't make much at all, then you don't get taxed a whole lot.|`|062e3d9a81db388a3f81f6b094af8340aa	On your second job you will be taxed @ 20% on everything (unless you earn more than 36,000 a year in your other job).  This is because most people can earn 6000 a year without paying any tax, but as your second employer is unable to know how much you have earned on your other job they presume you have used up all your free allowance, and tax everything @ 20%.  If you earn less than 6,000 for the entire year in both your jobs you will still be taxed 20% on your second earnings, but you will be able to submit a claim at the end of the tax year for overpaid taxes.

It's impossible to give you an exact figure as I do not know where you live, the number or ages of participants, what limit you're looking for or what security/first aid facilities there are, however generally it can run between $1,000 and $4,000 per year.
b8tgCAQJaa	The current minimum wage for 18-21 year olds is 4.77 per hour.    You don't state hours, but let's assume a 40 hour working week.    So that's 4.77 x 40 = 190.80 per week.    There are 52 weeks in a year, and 12 months in a year. So to get the monthly amount:    190.80 x 52 / 12 = 826.80 per month (for one person) before tax    Now of course you have to take off tax and national insurance. Using the SalaryCalculator.co.uk site, tax on the above earnings is 64.78 a month and national insurance is 40.90.    So that gives an after-tax total of:    826.80 - 40.90 - 64.78 = 721.12 per month (for one person) after tax    But of course there are two people, so we need to multiply by two.    This gives total monthly earnings of 1653.60 before tax, and 1442.24 after tax.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	roughly about 600 between you after tax|`|Omixzxe9aa	you will earn for 40 hours 170 age 18and at age 21 208 that is 378 x4 = 1512 before deductions after deductions of approx 25%probably about 1200

y8LVlmlJaa	I think there are a lot of opportunities in counseling or therapy for people with a master's. You can work in clinics, group practices, or even private practice, and of course there are several subspecialties; for counseling you could do for example family counseling, substance abuse, marriage counseling, social work, etc. and for therapy there is occupational therapy (which requires a specific OT degree), autism therapy (usually ABA), etc.  I think it would be easier to find a job in either urban or suburban areas, but pretty much anywhere there are people... and there is some demand. You should be able to make a decent salary, you won't be rich but it should be around or above the national average salary (~50,000$)    hope this helps!
s4yAAxAZaa	To me, all the fundamentals say that gold shouldn't hit $1000, but then again, the fundamentals said that it shouldn't get to $900 either, but it has. Gold has a bit of the same feeling that oil did last summer, where the fundamentals said that it shouldn't keep going up, but it did. So although I don't like gold on the fundamentals, I still own a little bit, just to be on the safe side. For me it's more of a hedge than an actual investment.

It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.    * Debt collectors love to create a false sense of urgency...If theyve waited months/years for your payment, they can wait one or two weeks for any payment or settlement agreement from you. Any deadline like 5PM to get any payment to them is bogus.   *  By themselves, debt collectors have absolutely NO legal power over you., they cannot garnish your wages or freeze checking accounts...only a court can authorize this and theyd have to go through the court system to do this.  * Debt collectors have NO power whatsover to have you arrested/sent to jail for not paying them.   * Debt collectors really LOVE to scare people with bogus legal threats.

You click the link and it looks like your bank's web site, but it's not.  Then you enter your login and password and you've actually given it to the crooks.    However this can happen to non online bank customers.  It just happens when people call you and say they are from the bank and ask you to give up your info over the phone.    The safest approach is to ignore all emails (from any company) asking you to click a link and login to the site.

AA11284831	Most of the issues with TurboTax were caused by an error in un-patched  early release versions that caused e-filed tax returns be be rejected by the IRS.  Updating TT solved this issue.    Many folks have made errors in entering the amount of their stimulus rebate when using tax software to prepare their returns.  If they entered the incorrect amount of the rebate that they received last year this causes the processing of their return and the release of any refund to be delayed while the IRS manually reviews their return.  That error is independent of the tax software that you use.

Also, include a "skills" section, and list all of the skills you have. Are you good at any Microsoft Office products? List that under skills. The guide can help you come up with some other ideas.|`|3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!

iAXnTZAmaa	I always purchase the downloadable version of TaxAct Deluxe and have been very happy for the past 6 years.  Seems very thorough to me and I've read where a lot of people get higher refunds with TaxAct.  I think it is $19.95 with state.  E-files available for both fed and state.    Not sure if it will import your info from last years return though.  I know it offers to do it at the beginning, but don't know if it is available for someone who used a different vendor.

It has been used openly for generations by many immigrant groups to provide each participant startup capital for his or her business ventures (although each participant is free to use it as he or she sees fit when received).  In Korean American communities it is know as "kye" and is a major source of startup capital for Korean Americans to open up the many "mom and pop" shops that one finds accross the United States.|`|AA10469473	No, it isn't a pyramid scheme.

You put in $10,000 ($1,000 for each time someone draws, so $1,000 x 10), and get $10,000 out of it - no gain. I suppose it's legal...

yO5tm6e1aa	I have several accounts like this.  They just keep accumulating money via interest payments to you.  It's even better if you move the money into CD's.  If your balances are high enough, this interest payment each month may actually exceed your monthly paycheck (from your employer - if you're still employed).    If you're a person with very little money in it (e.g. under $500), some banks will charge your a small monthly fee (e.g. $2.00) until all your funds are gone.  This is often the case for only an interest checking account; and rarely the case for a savings account.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	You have to close it, if you do not have money in the account then they will close it because of inactivity, right now it may be inactive but you have to go and take the money out yourself.|`|AA12219135	Service charges can be applied month after month|`|47HQJcgYaa	if its closed the sec of state gets the money...that is how they have those lists of money that people are owed that are always on the news

lLm5uIuDaa	Inspections are paid for by the potential buyer after their offer has been accepted by the seller.  Should problems arise the sellers are not willing or unable to repair the potential buyer has the right to either cancel their offer or re-negotiate the offer.  You certainly don't want to be paying for inspections on every home you have an interest in.  This is only done when your initial offer has been accepted.|`|sV4knlUfaa	You would normally get a survey done before you hand over any cash. Making an offer is only that, an offer, don't hand any cash over until a full survey is done by a professional. In this climate (when no-one is buying) you have the luxury of doing it at your leisure. Also, go to the planning authority and do a search of any developments that are proposed in the area. Also, speak to neighbours if you can. Spend a lot of time on making sure and have no regrets...big move in your life, get it right.|`|MgKzo2YTaa	you should get a survey done before, because depending on the good/bad results it wil affect the price you offer!!

Now you will receive a 1099 on the $$$ that you actually got out of it.    It sucks I know, it is kind of like winning the lottery in a sense that you pay taxes on the winnings and then pay taxes on what you receive after the taxes.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	If you paid all of your penalties last year, then no, you don't owe anymore.

Good luck.|`|820d554e7094763dac38ae760d9a7286aa	I will guess from your scanty description that you applied for a Refund Anticipation Loan and were denied.    The IRS releases refunds on Fridays only.  Your refund will go to the bank that will withhold your fees, then release the rest to you in the form of a check.  Since the bank only gets the refunds on Friday, they need a little time to send out the information to create your check.  Saturday and Sunday are not banking days.  Tax preparation firms know when these funds will be released by the bank.  If they told you Tuesday Feb. 10, that is when it will be, unless the IRS does not release your refund for some reason.|`|0M9UmULDaa	Hopefully it will come on Friday the 6th|`|7a4Go4yfaa	I am also in the same position.

Who owns the house (who is on the title)?  2.  Who is on the mortgage loan?    A divorce decree does not get you off the loan, nor does a quit claim deed.  It has to be paid off by sale or refi to do that.
DorePwVOaa	When employers ask that question in an interview, they're not really asking that question. What they're really asking is "whyare you looking for a job *here*" Tell them all the good things you've heard about their company, and why you think it would be a good place for you to work. Employers just want to see if you've done your homework about their company.|`|yO5tm6e1aa	Be honest, but use different words.    I'm looking because I believe my current company cannot withstand the economic situation without doing some downsizing; and that the department I'm in is certainly at risk for this.  So, I'm looking out for my best interest by seeking a job in a growth industry rather than trying to hang on to a sinking ship.  Then.... feed them a bunch of stuff about how great their company is and why you should be there too.|`|46uiaxPUaa	It's a bad idea to say that, say something like I'm looking to be employed by a company where there is room for advancement.

You might also want to check out Game Design (although few schools offer it as a college major), and Film and Animation.

57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	The first thing to remember in a short sale is to be patient, not only are you a first time buyer you have engaged in a tedious process of a short sale, in a short sale the lender holds all the cards, the seller in these situations is immaterial since they will gladly take any sell over a foreclosure    The lender will compare your offer to the appraisal if close then you have a deal, if far off, the lender may elect to foreclose and take the pmi insurance, in that case nothing you can do but look for another place    But in this market patients pays, its not a deal if you are not willing to walk away,|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	First, both the seller and his lender have to accept your offer.  Then escrow opens.  Then you have to survive appraisal, title search and home inspection.  The process can take 4-8 weeks after a contract to sell is signed by both parties.

AA11284831	No, even if you are operating a business, you don't report the sales of goods on Form 1099-MISC.

cs4n4Fgzaa	You need to answer these questions honestly and in your own words, since the questions ask what YOU would do in those situations. Asking someone else to provide answers and then using them on the application is deceitful. If you are lucky to get the job and you're unable to express yourself in writing, they will quickly suspect that you were dishonest during the application process.  Just sit down and write something realistic and simple. Don't worry about using big words or business jargon, just be honest about your real experiences.|`|gqpSsPsfaa	For the first question - Just think about a time when you helped a customer beyond what you were supposed to do. Something extra because you wanted to be nice or something about that person made you want to do a little more for them.    For the second question- Just describe when you were in a group. Everyone had a task to do and maybe you did more than what was expected. Helped one of your teammates on their responsibility. Then share how it was successful in the end.    Make it plain and don't worry. If you put in into your own words you wont forget it when your in the interview or if they ask you about it later.     Hope This Helps.....

It could be the way you present yourself, maybe you are too shy or too bold.  Keep in mind that everyone has little quirks, and most people are completely unaware of how others perceive them.  The BEST thing for you to do would be to go to your college career center.  Most schools have them, even community colleges.  They generally offer mock interviews and resume guidance.  My college videotapes mock interviews, then you view the tape with a career adviser and discuss how you can improve your interview.  It only takes about an hour tops for the entire process.  I'm sure your college offers some kind of program similar to this, and it would be very helpful for you to get an honest and objective opinion from someone who knows a lot about communication.  Best of luck!|`|Asm4AKOOaa	it might not be you , new hampshire might be a tough job market at this time of year . especially if your in a more seasonal area of the state , there might not be alot around at this time of year . or not as many job as your used to .|`|d0525b94426d4bd748667496efd4e474aa	Are there other campus jobs that aren't part of the work-study program?  At the very least you could maybe work in a dining hall?  Maybe a cashier?    Also focus on the 'transferable skills' that you can use from your experience at Barnes & Noble to use in another job. Customer service? Attention to detail? Inventory or cashier skills? Library skills? Management?  If you did a good job you should be able to detail what you accomplished, why you were successful, and what value you could bring to your next employer, whether it's McDonald's or Walgreens or IBM.  Make sure you play that up in your resume and cover letters, too.    In addition to checking your college or alumni careers center, check with your local city or town for a career resources center. That might help.  Also network -- sit down with your fiance and strategize about your contacts, how you can nurture them and make some new ones.
ec43934173ad5427d59f2e37d17eaff9aa	Hi I've been a hotelier for 9 years and in restaurants 7 Years before that. Currently Exec Sous Chef in Las vegas. If you plan to stay in hotels and want more for yourself then the concierge gig will have to end sooner or later. There are many avenues that can be taken in the hotel industry. So if 9-5 is not your thing then perhaps look for other alternatives, but those will certainly be in operations (i.e. F&B, housekeeping, front desk) I feel that you should not base your decision on comfort-ability, if you want to succeed you will have to make a leap and take a chance but make sure you take that leap in a direction that is best suited to maximise your potential (what you think you would be happy doing).|`|qPwKSysbaa	In this economy you better go with a guaranteed pay rate, I would stay.

It is considered  okay to leave you places youve worked out on a resume, the only thing to be concerned with is if this makes a "Gap" in your work history. Gaps would be like over a year without working. This could cause the employer not to call you for an interview or ask you why you had a gap on your interview.

CCf6Y7DIaa	as a manager, you are a mediator between those interests which keep the business running (labor) and the interests of the owners (ceo, stockholders).    if i have to choose between those two, i'd say a manager has more in common with the labor resource since the manager's chief role is to direct efforts to keep the business alive. of course, being in a leadership position, a manager is in great position to suggest shifts in company direction and operation, but his most important role in business is to keep things moving along smoothly. it is this role which distinguishes entrepreneurs from managers.

However on MFS returns each spouse is liable only for their own tax liability.  <br>  <br>  There are a few cases where MFS works out better, such as if one spouse has relatively low income compared to the other but has high medical expenses since medical expenses are subject to a 7.5% AGI floor.

($2000 or better).  If you don't have that, try the DRIP programs that many individual stocks have. (Dividend Re Investment Programs).  After that and attending some of the seminars on investing, try 888options.com, take their seminars, read some books on the investment strategies they will discuss, and then try some investing on paper.  Once you are successful, you have a chance.  Without the education, it will cost a lot to get the experience.  I have invested in GGRN and think that is a good long term investment, not to be watched or touched for a year or more. (OTC - Pink Sheet) I invest in other things and with other strategies on the big board.  If you want more do some research and make educated decisions.|`|s4yAAxAZaa	I suggest that you actually go and read the stimulus plan. You'll be very disappointed. Very little money is actually going to infrastructure. Best estimate is that only 12% is actually going to infrastructure. That's roads and bridges, electrical grid, building upgrades, water systems, and a lot of small pork projects around the country. As the stimulus plan has gotten clearer, the infrastructure stocks have actually been pulling back, as people realize that too little money is being spent on infrastructure, to actually make much of a difference to these companies bottom line. If you wanted to play the bounce in the infrastructure stocks, you're too late.     If you want to invest in stocks, you have to learn to get ahead of the crowd. You can't start investing in infrastructure stocks, months after the plan is first announced. It's old news, and it turns out, that it's not really good news. Nobody's gonna get rich on infrastructure stocks.|`|5WzklgiBaa	If you are serious to invest, you can consider HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent profits.

coXB7vf1aa	A lot of them are legitimate, but their definition of data entry is very broad.  What I mean is that they take a bunch of already available opportunities out there, repackage them together and then sell them as "data entry" programs.<br>  <br>  For example, the most common one is the "For just $40 one-time fee, you will have access to Fortune 500 companies and can make up to $400 a day by simply filling out little advertisement forms."<br>  <br>  Well, that's a very broad way of saying "We'll teach you how to do affiliate marketing." <br>  <br>  Another one is "get paid to write content opportunities", so when you sign up with them, you find out it's a site like MyLot which you could have just joined that on your own for free.<br>  <br>  Data entry programs manage to be successful only because they distinguish themselves from all that massive competition by calling themselves a term that normal people would likely understand: Data Entry.  Most newbies looking to make money online don't know what SEO or affiliate marketing or an MLM is at first.<br>  <br>  It's a clever ploy to get customers, but really, it's all the same as every other opportunity on the internet, just with a different name. <br>  <br>  Some data entry programs actually go out of their way to train people and charge a monthly fee for it.  Some people like it and have made money from these programs.  Some don't like it at all.  You can never tell what you're going to get from the salespage.  It's way, way too vague--like a lot of online programs for that matter.  But Data Entry takes vague to a whole new level.<br>  <br>  Its equally vague twin sister "rebate processing" is data entry affiliate marketing programs which has you giving back a part of your commission to the customer, hence the "rebate".  In my opinion, that's just a whole new level of  low-class trickery.<br>  <br>  It's up to you if you want to join a data entry program.  Just keep in mind it could be anything and everything.  It's better to shop around first and know what you're getting into.  <br>  <br>  My recommendation is to go with affiliate marketing.|`|NpPv9wWKaa	yes, they are all scam.   nowadays there is no easy money.|`|lEXTHOZPaa	There are lot of scams.

aUQ1ridmaa	Yes, you should file a tax return. You became your own employer, congratulations! Being self-employed can be rewarding, but it can also be fun at tax time.    Since you used your credit card for buying items, that will help on your federal taxes. You should be able to look up all your expenses (especially if you usually bought supplies at a specific store) to calculate your expenses. The tax that you paid when you bought items is counted as part of the cost of the supplies.     You would of course need to also figure out how much money you took in selling your jewelry. The fact that you did not charge tax will not help or hurt on your federal tax return.    However there may be more information needed based on the state you live in. I would suggest talking with a tax professional about the type of expenses you had, the money you took in, and what type of record keeping you should be keeping.    I hope this helps some!

LOrFtSCHaa	I lived in Sac for 5 years, and the housing marked is super good overthere.  You can start by going on www.craigslist.org and looking for the already established neighborhoods.  You do qualify for a house, you should go online and find a mortgage calculator and enter the data to have an idea of what homes to look for.      A piece of advice before you call a real estate agent make sure to have been prequalifed for a home.  Also, you do not have to pay a real estate agent for them to show homes.  Look also in www.realtor.com.    Stay away from interest only loans, you want a conventional loan, or FHA so be prepared to have at least $5k for downpayment and $3-5K for closing costs, for FHA loan, for conventional you will need 20% downpayment.

AA11345086	Speaking from experience.....with a ch 13 you can keep your house and car but include all the rest of your debt. If you have any type of past due taxes like state, federal or property you will have to do the ch 13 because you can not include those in a ch 7. The best thing is to talk to an attorney so they can help you determine what to file. We filed a ch 13 in the summer of 2006. Have been making payments on it every month since Oct of 2006, we pay until Oct 2010. Our credit is getting better each month and we are currently in the process of buying a home.

As long as you lived with them for more than half of the year and they provided more than half of your support, you are their dependent.  You might not be a "qualifying child" but you are a qualifying relative.  Please see chapter 3 of IRS Publication 17 if you need documentation.    Also, as they are eligible to claim you as their dependent, you cannot take your own exemption regardless of whether or not they do claim you.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Did you have income in 2008?

DAMZKbpDaa	You should file your income (on Sch-C) with any business deductions you may have. Even if you cannot pay the $175 right away, you should pay what you can and pay the rest when you can.    This will reduce penalties and interest, and avoid a non-filing penalty.|`|6n527pAYaa	I'm not sure why you owe any tax on $2500 of income.  Your personal exemption ought to cover this amount and more.|`|AA11132354	You are REQUIRED to file a tax return.

You are supposed to be paying quarterly estimated taxes as you go along.|`|AA11284831	You can deduct any business expenses that you had on Schedule C.  That will reduce the self-employment tax that you will have to pay.  But if the net profit is $400 or more you will owe something in self-employment tax.  There's no way around that.  Sorry.    You don't need to make quarterly estimated tax payments unless your projected tax liability is more than $1,000.  That's not the case you your situation.|`|AA10469473	You should go ahead an file, even if you don't have the money right now to pay it.  If you can't, the IRS will set up a payment plan for you, but that will cost you, so it might be worthwhile to try to find a way to come up with the money.
AA10469473	It's possible to do an amendment yourself, but if you didn't feel able to do your original return and so you paid Block to do it, then the amended form could be pretty tricky for you.Take a look at form 1040X, and see if you want to try it.    There is another option, not really recommended but you won't get in trouble if you do it that way. Do nothing now. Eventually, and it could take over a year or maybe as much as 2, you'll get a letter from the IRS telling you that you left this out, and that you owe a certain amount for it - just send them what you owe then. They will add interest and penalties, but it's probably cheaper than paying $100-150 to fix it now.

5Gxll9Hkaa	Both are bad for your credit score.  But often clients who must file bankruptcy actually see their credit score RISE following bankruptcy.  The reason is, most people who file bankruptcy have credit scores that are pretty much in the toilet to begin with (or soon will, due to judgments, collections, etc.).  The bankruptcy will count as a negative against your credit score (and can be reported for 10 years) but the fact that your debts are discharged, giving you $0 of indebtedness after you receive your discharge is also figured into the score, and this is a positive.  So many debtors see a modest net rise in their credit scores after filing bankruptcy.    That said, most bankruptcy attorneys will tell you that your credit score is NOT what should be the determining factor in whether to file bankruptcy.  The determining factor is: can you repay your debts or not?  If not, bankruptcy is often the only solution.  If so, then repaying them is better than not repaying them.    Most bankruptcy attorneys offer one free or very low cost appointment to review your financial situation and advise you whether bankruptcy looks like a reasonable solution for you.  Make an appointment with one or several bankruptcy attorneys and discuss.  You are under no obligation to file bankruptcy (or to hire any particular bankruptcy attorney to file bankruptcy) just because you've seen an attorney for a free consultation.

rV1uAtt3aa	Good question. I was going to say a store at the mall, but since you're 14 you'll find that challenging (most stores won't hire before 16, and some go up to 18 because of insurance issues.)<br>  <br>  You could try working at a day care center or camp.

Kids can be challenging, though, if you don't have a lot of patience for them.<br>  <br>  You could try your local library (you might have to volunteer for a while until a page job opens.)  You could also volunteer at local charities that do things you believe in.  Over time, they might give you a paying job if you do well. <br>  <br>  You could try your local radio station(s.)  Small stations in local markets don't have much money, and they don't attract a lot of interns, so they might have stuff you could do (possibly you'd have to start as an intern, there, too.)<br>  <br>  Maybe you could get together with some friends and start a blog site on fashion and/or food?

Ns6I7MmBaa	Banks would love you to pay more points up front, because paying points is paying interest in advance to make you think you are getting a lower interest rate (an illusion).<br>  <br>  The total cost of the loan over the full term is probably the same either way, points plus lower interest rate vs. more down payment and higher interest rate for a smaller loan.  So over the long run points do not help you unless it gives you a tax advantage.

The tax year ends on 5th April, and code numbers are not issued in March, as a lot of employers have run the final payroll for the year. The emergency code deducts approximately the right amount of tax. You would only get a refund if you had been unemployed for a while, and had an unused backlog of tax allowances.<br>  On the current annual tax-free rate of ￡6035 a year, ￡116 a week, you would pay tax on ￡164 a week. The rate is 20%, or 1/5, so your tax would be ￡32.80 a week.<br>  If you can't get it settled soon, send form P60 when you get it to tax office, together with complete details of employment history from 6th April last.|`|2v5mKUqgaa	you pay emergency rate tax after you have completed a P46 stating that this is your only or your main job, assuming of course, that this is your only or your main job.<br>  <br>  Then you would pay the same amount of tax as everyone else would, what it doesn't do is take into account any previous earnings and tax you have paid in the tax year to date and any periods when you may have not been earning, so it may be that you do end up paying more tax than you should be if you have been out of work for a while.<br>  <br>  If you just haven't had your P45 from your previous employer yet, chase them for it and as long as you are able to get it to your new employer before the final payroll submission of this tax year, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Failing that, as soon as you get your final payslip for the tax year, get in touch with the tax office and go through your earnings and they'll be able to sort it out for you - they're not a bad as everyone says!|`|DHyV6SG2aa	The emergency tax code is 603L week1/month1 - If you earnt ￡280 per week, your first ￡115 each week is not taxed on. You will pay 22% tax on the other ￡165, which means you will pay ￡36 a week tax.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/emergency-code.htm#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/emergen...</a>|`|Dp1dN2HLaa	You can claim it back at the end of the tax year;  round about April 3rd.<br>  <br>  Just right to HMRC, give them your NI Number and they will send you a cheque 3 weeks later.|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	You ask your employer for a p46 the quicker you fill of those the quicker you stop paying emergency tax. you would pay about ￡60 -￡80 tax on emergency.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	You will get the tax back eventually so if you want to keep your job it is worth working.
AA12360299	Switch credit card companies.  If your current company won't up your limit, then move on to someone else who will.  If your credit is good, you shouldn't have any trouble.
y4SUDnpaaa	Yes you can. You can also  print a pie chart that shows you the percentage of your salary your spent as well as and on what. If you don't have quicken to track your expenses you could could keep a record of every penny you spend for a month. Then figure out for yourself where your money is going  Categorize them and see where you you are spending your money and what percentage of your income is represented by each category. Wonderful way to see what you can cut out.
f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	If you do not make at least the minimum required payment you are considered in default.  So you will be hit with a late fee and most likely a rise in your interest rate.  If this causes your balance to go over the limit you will also be hit with an over the limit fee.  If you go past 30 days it will be reported as a negative item on your credit report.<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble the best thing to do is call them BEFORE your payment is due.  Depending on the situation they may be able to give you extra time or accept a lower amount.|`|1HLPznZhaa	You will destroy your credit rating real fast..also they can increase your interest rate to the max. allowed by law..suggest you call them and make sure you get the date , time and name of the person you speak with..Explain your circumstances to them.. as bad as our economy is now most companies will work with you ..

KdFXk0ajaa	The balance transfer offers are generally good for the entire promotional period. The real reason they give you a few checks is the average debtor owes more than one company. A lot of credit card companies now charge like 2% of the amount transferred so they make something off of you anyway. They hope you have to extend your payments past the promotional period. I get them all the time and simply if it costs more to transfer than to keep it on one of my 8% cards I keep it where it is, if not I pay the 2% and go from there.<br>  The other answerer is correct as things are changing but I seriously doubt the company will say no. They want your business and with the present economy any customer is a good customer.|`|f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Call them.<br>  <br>  It's the only way to find out.

nmozvlGPaa	Zillow isn't an appraisal.  They are notorious for being inaccurate.  Forget what you read there.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe there is any help for people like you (and millions like you) and to be quite honest I don't think there should be.  <br>  <br>  Your option is to keep paying as agreed or be subject to foreclosure and repossession.  There is no stimulus or help for someone's whose house has decreased in value but who can still afford the payments.  <br>  <br>  Here's the situation.  You agreed to purchase a property for a certain dollar amount. You agreed to repay that money when you signed your loan documents and you even agreed to the payment amount. You didn't agree to pay if and only if the property stayed at the current value or increased, did you? No, you agreed to pay. If you could sell for $100,000 more than you bought it for, would you give the bank that loaned you money an extra $50,000 when you sold? You wouldn't? Why are you asking them to take a loss? yeesh.<br>  <br>  No, refinancing at the current home value would require someone (a bank) to take a loss.  Probably a very large loss.  This would extend, prolong, exacerbate, make worse, etc., the current financial crisis.  <br>  <br>  No one guaranteed that your house value wouldn't decrease.  It is like any other investment.  You bought it and you are responsible whether it goes up or down in value.  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Of course not.  Why should the lender swallow a $64,000 loss just because your home value decreased?  That you are struggling to pay the mortgage has no bearing on the current value of the property.  Were the property still worth $340K, you would STILL be struggling to make the payments.<br>  <br>  As well, you might consider that Zillow can be anywhere from very accurate to 40% off on home values.  The only way to know what your house is worth is to have it professionally appraised at current market value.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	The information you've been offered so far is sound.<br>  <br>  The down side of buying during a boom is exactly what you are experiencing. You can try to refinance---which might lower your interest payment, but otherwise, the loan company is not bound to assist you. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you pay down extra on the principal, and try to ride out the market. You won't be able to sell for a while, with the glut of homes on the market, so your best position is to sit tight, and wait for things to level off.<br>  <br>  I know its tough---but real estate is one of those things that is a long term proposition...and "flipping" will prove too costly to be worth the effort. <br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|23SkYEw5aa	"HOW DO I GET MIND . . .<br>  <br>  Zillow is crap.  <br>  <br>  2nd, what should be done?  Really?  You purchased a house.  You knew what the payments would be - so pay what you promised.<br>  <br>  If the property was worth more then you purchased, would you work harder to pay your bills?  Sure!  And would you want to give some of the equity to the government?<br>  <br>  The government is not in the business to promise that you make good decisions or bail you out when you didn't.
92a1746f913197cd94d15ffe1736b2bfaa	I think it may have to do with the fact that these were people's names.  when you used to go to meijer or what ever you call it, you went to Fred Meijer's store|`|3tuwWidiaa	In the old days, when you named a store after a person, it was "Smith's Grocery" or "Johnson's Auto."<br>  <br>  In the old days, Mr. Kroger DID own the store.  It's only when it because a corporation did the ownership end and the "'s" dropped.<br>  <br>  Yet, people still think back to when it was actually owned by an individual person.|`|WLbNdcYUaa	Because some people feel a need to pluralize or add possession to unnecessary things.

qhENBYAHaa	You did not say if the teacher has a contract or is a member of a union.  Without a contract or union contract the teacher would be an 'at will' employee and as such could be terminated at any time for any reason except what has been legally determined to be Discrimination Bases --  see www.eeoc.gov<br>  <br>  If the teacher is under a standard teaching contract that contract will have a clause that allows the school district to terminate the teacher for a serious offense or cause.  Here the serious offense is two-fold 1. the teacher was told by his superiors NOT to separate teams by race.  He did not follow the orders of his superiors and therefore could be terminated for "Insubordination".<br>  <br>  2. Both Federal and state government take the issue of discrimination by race very seriously.  The Federal government has issued several laws such as Title VII to prevent racism -- again see www.eeoc.gov  Employers are required by Federal and most state laws to, at a minimum, investigate any allegation of racism.  Any action which could be construed as racism should be stopped.  This is not only to follow the spirit of TItle VII but to prevent violence that can erupt when one racial group is oppressed.  <br>  <br>  The school, as a state owned entity must follow all state anti-racism rules.  As such anything that hints at the potential of being illegal must be stopped before those actions (here potential racism) is impuned upon the state.<br>  <br>  So the school district is legally in the right to terminate an employee who does not follow orders of his supervisor and who continues actions which could potentially be viewed as racist.<br>  <br>  As for the teacher who sues because "he was unfairly fired, publicly humiliated, and made a public spectacle" that sounds like his suit is defamation of character WHICH a state employee may not be able to bring against a state agency (the school district).<br>  <br>  In the real world of employment law he would not get to a superior court.  There is no cause of action called Unfair Firing.  In most states an employee can not sue an employer for defamation.  The employee would probably go after the newspaper, which would be dismissed.  AND if the school reinstated him within 6 months he would be fired again this time for an iron-clad reason.

Most evictions take a couple weeks.  I would start with the Clerk of the Courts office (where evictions are filed) in your county and determine if eviction has been filed.  In many counties the Clerk has a website and you can get this information on line.  It sounds like your rental agency hasn't filed eviction.  If eviction has been filed you need to find out what's delaying the final judgment and your writ of possession.  Google landlord tenant laws in MD.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor
UAW1U3Uoaa	Most employers do reward length of service but in conjunction with some form of appraisal i.e. satisfactory service. There is however no obligation to pay more simply because you have been there the longest. Legally an employer must pay people doing the same job or same grade of job the same wage, there is however lee-way to this as I mentioned above to reward length of service/good performance. <br>  <br>  Sadly it seems your employer does not really value you that highly, perhaps you should approach them and highlight all the extra responsibilites you have taken on and that you have been a loyal employee and that perhaps you feel this should be rewarded in some way.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	You get paid according to either.

Look what its doing to you now. There is no need to understand why, it could be a relative, it could be they have now started paying new employees more, it could be a payroll budget increase for a certain period of time to hurry and get employees. Any discussion of disatisfaction makes you a problem at work, and if you let this new person find this out, heaven help you, they will feel you are not competant and they are the bomb at work and run right over you to promotions and future raises. <br>  How did you find this out? I would go to HR and tell them that someone is duscussing thier pay and it is making people feel uncomforatble about it. I would cite only you and say I willl let others come forward to complain on thier own, this is a pressure I did not need or ask to know about its very unprofessonal and its affecting the office, IF at all you want to say anyhing.

That's the truth.<br>  If you don't wish to do that and go through a bit of learning curve, it would be better for you to do something outside the house (maybe a cleaning job, bar, etc) that gives you instant income (you get paid per hour). I personally find it more interesting to work for myself but it depends of the person really.<br>  I am currently working online with my better half but -by all means- it does not make us a fortune. It compliments my full time job and at the moment it only pays the mortgage (I have worked long and hard, but getting easier now :) but we feel happy.<br>  However it might not be for you. I would also recommend you to stay away from illegal piramid schemes, surveys (they never pay, trust me), stuffing envelopes or gifting schemes. If you look in the resource box, I include the website that gives you more info (don't be put off by the title, lol). It is genuine, but it requires real effort. whoever tells you you can be rich overnight is full of BS*** (excuse my language)<br>  Hope it helps Munni :)|`|55NQgpERaa	I'm a certified marketing consultant, and I deal with online marketing companies and issues involved daily.

J2gBU0NDaa	I called the FBI and they gave me an email address to send my scam emails.  I get the ones you mentioned.  Usually it is a girl of 24-29yrs old who is a art dealer, or a model.  And not to long into the chat, she mentions she is stuck in Nigeria, France, or another country.  And their employer, or someone paid them with American money orders, and they can not be cashed in a foreign country. They ask if they sent me the money orders, would I cash them , and them send them the money so they can come home.  Or they ask if I would lend them 385.00 to 750.00 so they can get home.  Of course they say sexy things, and how wonderful  time we will have when they get back in town. The last few I have been getting is labeled FBI.  It tells me the FBI has found these scams and they want my help to catch them.  The scams say I am a beneficiaries of a dead person in a foreign country and all I have to do is send 485 dollars to have the money transferred into my account.  Of course they also want my name, address, phone number, Bank namee account.  I do not remember the email but just call your local FBI.  And tell everyone you know about the scams. Never send money, or give out your personal info, online, or on the phone.

Also you have to subtract any property tax paid by previous owner at closing before you can deduct any.<br>  <br>  It depends when taxes are due in your state.  In some states taxes are paid for current year.  In my state, taxes are paid in following year.

If he turns the vehicle in it will hurt his credit for a long time to come and if he goes bankrupt he will also lose all credit. Unless you are his accountant the best advice I can give you is look for another job. If he is this far down the road then I do not see him coming back right away. As a contractor he has to have good credit with out it he will not make it today. He might let the business bankrupt and then open a business very similar to it but with a different name and different principals. my advice to you is seek another job. Sorry
YovbCD9paa	Your stimulus check money is NOT taxable.  If you use software or a tax pro to prepare your taxes they should ask what you received (you can verify your stimulus check amount @ irs.gov ) and report it on a RRC worksheet for your tax return.  If you had changes in your household status or your annual income (for example) after your filed your tax return last year, you may be entitled to an add'l refundable credit on your 2008 return - in other words a lower tax due or a greater refund, whichever is applicable to you. So you should account for it on your 2008 return.<br>  <br>  I have had more than a few clients who were eligible for add'l monies through the RRC (Refundable Rebate Credit).  If you are uncertain how to proceed on your return, you can elect to allow/ask the IRS the calculate the credit for you.  Btw, I have read of many instances on yahoo answers where software (not tax preparers) made the refund estimate more confusing, so if you have any questions, ask a tax pro to calculate your RRC for you or ask the IRS to do it...simple. :)|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	You do not report the stimulus rebate you received in 2008 on your 2008 tax return.

Review the tax return filing instructions including the recovery rebate credit worksheet. You need to know the amount of the payment you received in 2008, which can be found on your Economic Stimulus Payment Notice (Notice 1378). <br>  <br>  Two online tools on IRS.gov are available — the Recovery Rebate Credit Calculator will help taxpayers figure the amount they should claim on their 2008 tax return, and How Much Was My 2008 Stimulus Payment?

Or you can call 1-866-234-2492 and provide your filing status, social security number and number of exemptions<br>  <br>  If you are using paper return, use related worksheet to calculate your credit.

You don't have to give any back if you got too much.<br>  <br>  But some tax preparers make it look like it is taxable because they factor it into a hypothetical refund before they ask you the questions to see if you already got it, or qualify for any additional (you don't unless you had a baby in 2008).|`|in6RETZ0aa	It is not taxable.<br>  <br>  If you got it, you do nothing with it.  07 is done.|`|PnjJ2Yv1aa	NO .

NwkZ5OmCaa	No.  Your 1040 reflects your entire income for the entire year.<br>  <br>  Your problem is that you only had taxes withheld on *some* of the income and then had to use some of that to cover the tax on the job that had nothing withheld.<br>  <br>  You also blew it and believed the software when it said you had a $500  refund before you had entered all of your income.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You broke even and didn't loan the government any money interest free.|`|NzKaYTiQaa	no, that sounds about right.  If you have multiple jobs you need to have additional federal withholding taken out of your check each week.  When they calculate how much to take out each week they don't factor in any other income and just make the assumption that this is your only source of income.  So, if you did only have the $4000 workstudy job then you would've gotten that back.  Fill out a new W4 for the jobs.|`|AA11555162	It makes sense. You had a job where you made 4k and only 13 was withheld. It should have been more than that if you wanted a refund. You are actually in a good spot because you spent your money yourself instead of giving an interest free loan to the govt.

We can then import all of our production back to the states creating more jobs for the citizens and boosting our economy. and get rid of illegal alliens that are taking up our welfare medicare and jobs from actual citizens who need them. then we can make all people on goverment assistance take drug tests and if they pop positive then they will be banned for life from any goverment assistance. we could also stop trying to make BIO-Diesel and start farming food crops again to help out with the food crisis plafuing our country.

Never works as you can see.  And since it is not tied to anything in particular, the government can print as much as it wants.  This becomes, in effect, an invisible additional tax on all of us as it evaporates our money's value.   <br>  <br>  I think it was a terrible mistake to abandon the gold standard.  However, I don't think that loaning more than a bank had in reserve is that bad of an idea.  Without that option, I think credit would be in much shorter supply and more expensive.  Further, I suspect we would occasionally have huge credit crunches and difficulty in consumer spending.   it all gets complicated and now I have a headache from thinking too much.
Ki0uUdwOaa	Call the bank that you have a card with....the number is usually on the back of the card.  Ask them about liability with your purchases online,  and dont buy into the whole credit protection insurance bullcrap...legally you are protected anyway from someone stealing your identity, paying someone 15 bucks a month isnt doing anything to help you if it actually happens.<br>  <br>  Also with the insurance on in case you lose your job.....nix that as well, you would have to be at least 90 days unemployed and still current on your payments for that to even take effect in most cases, and then intrest still adds up the whole time.....all that extra bull crap is just to make free money off of ignorant people so dont fall for it!

0Jm8LJP1aa	Since you already have TIN, you don't have to apply for a new one. But you have to register that new business of your together with you TIN.<br>  And I think from it they will just add a digit to make it's TIN a little unique than what you originally have.<br>  <br>  I don't really know much about taxes but I know one thing for sure, a Taxpayer is not allowed to have more than "ONE" TIN, that's against the law.

They have them, they just don't like to make it public knowledge that these programs are available.  Last July I ended up in the E.R. with a gallbladder attack and in November my hubby had to have some tests done in the hospital.  The bills were about $6,000, and they reduced them by 83% because we qualified.|`|nOrbuan2aa	I was struggling to take care of myself a few years ago. I had an emergency hospital bill for myself. I had no money left after paying my bills. The hopital completely wrote the hospital bill off . I had to fill out paper work to prove my bills, and income. I ask them who paid my hospital bill, they said the hospital absorbed it. Man what a relief. So apply at the hospital and see if they can help you  Don't  ignore this bill when you may be able to get help, and not have to bankrupt.|`|AA11662950	Don't jump into bankrupcy just yet.

JFHSSzpKaa	Nearly every coin shop has gold coins of various types in stock. Premium over spot gold varies with the type and size of coin - 1 Troy once coins sell for 3-5% over spot, and 0.1 Troy ounce coins sell for 10 - 15% over spot. American Eagles and Canadian Maple Leafs sell for a bit more over spot than Krugerrands. Older US and foreign coins have additional collector value. <br>  All of them are very easy to sell - There are hundreds of gold coins for sale on eBay at any given time.<br>  Check your local coin shop for more information.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	You can buy American Eagle gold coins from the US Mint.  You can buy other country's gold coins thru local coin dealers. YOu might pay $40 over the gold price as their profit.  They would re-buy it from you at $40 under the current gold price.<br>  That is what makes it a losing investment.|`|EXZh0t5Eaa	Here's the truth about buying gold coins. You can either buy what we call Numismatic Grade Coins, that's coins that have a value greater than there intrinsic (melt value) value. This can range from modern day coinage such as the newly released Ultra High Relief from the US Mint to Ancient Roman Coins. Or you can buy what is referred to as Bullion Gold. This comes in forms ranging from 1 gram bars to 1,000 oz bars. The most popular are one 1 Ounce (31.1 gram) Bars or Rounds. Brand Bars/Rounds are American Gold Eagle, S Afrika Krugerrand, Canadian Maple Leaf, China Panda, Pamp Suisse Credit Bar, Austria Philharmonic, just to name a few. When buying these you can expect to pay a premium above spot. Lets take for example the American Gold Eagle. The Eagle is sold through the US Mint to Authorized Purchases, they then resell them to coin dealers. Currently the AP's are charging the dealers around 5.75% over the spot price of gold. Therefore, you can expect to pay above that. One of the best dealers you could deal with is Chucks Coin in California. I do know they make a two way market daily. Yesterday they were paying spot + $48.00 for Eagles and selling them at spot + $58.00.
RZzMse3Haa	I'm sorry but if neither of you have good credit then nobody is going to rent to you.  You might find someone to give you a chance if you pay a bigger deposit and or get a co-signer.<br>  <br>  It is standard for landlords to refuse to rent to people with bad credit.|`|PxoKseAiaa	It will affect you if the landlord or management places a high value on your past payment history.  <br>  <br>  Yes, they may very well turn you down if you have bad credit, or not enough income to qualify.|`|c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	I do not recommend having your name on the bill if you do not have the income to pay it. If he decides to leave you or not pay the bills, what are you going to do? Or if he or one of his friends damage something? The fact that his credit is bad says he has had trouble paying bills.<br>  <br>  If he is going to be making tons of money then wait a little bit to move so you guys can save up enough money to put down a really good deposit.<br>  <br>  What kind of committment has he made to you that you would be willing to jeopordize your financial future (if you are stuck with the bills)? How many relationships have you had that you thought were going to last? How many has he had? So many relationships do not work out, so getting an apartment is not the most important thing. Being able to survive the worst is. You do not want to have your credit worse AND be responsible for his debts.<br>  <br>  And you do not want to be stuck with him if you decide he is not right for you. If you are financially dependant on him, you will feel stuck. You will be financially dependant on him if the lease is in your name and you need him to bring the money in.<br>  <br>  If it is cheaper to stay where you are then I recommend doing that while you guys build your finances. If it is the same price then just go apply to apartments, but if it is in your name then you need to at least be capable of paying for it and willing to stay the length of your lease.<br>  <br>  One of the main things the landlord will want to see is evidence of steady income. You need to have enough income if your name is on the lease, and it has to be steady. If you change jobs every 3 months then that will not look good because the landlord is going to wonder where you are going to get the money. If you say you expect your boyfriend to pay then the landlord is going to want both of you to sign the lease, each responsible for 100% if the other doesn't pay.<br>  <br>  If neither of you have had steady income or employment then you will probably not find a very good place. If you are living at home why not stay living there, and take little vacations together that don't cost much while you improve your financial condition. You can borrow equipment to go camping, go to sports games, go iceskating, or other fun stuff. It is a way of being together without dealing with fighting over whose should take the trash out and clean the bathroom. And when you are ready to make a committment he may have saved up enough money for a down payment on a house.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It takes a long time (years) to improve your credit. If you have bad credit, it speaks to your ability to pay your bills. A landlord may not want to rent to you because you may not be able to pay the rent.|`|ST4DDXexaa	Really apartment owners care about you being a good person that pays your bill ontime, so addition security may be needed or a prefarance from a previous landlord|`|AWSmknxLaa	very much so

If there are only two survivors, you are probably getting the full 75% each.  Therefore, if benefits end for one, the other does not increase. <br>  <br>  Sometimes when there are 3 or more survivors, each person gets less than the 75% because of the family maximum.  In that case as benefits end for one, the benefits do increase for the others receiving.

Paying them will show a current - paid collection for 2009 and could lower your score.  I would use simple credit repair to bump these and other negatives off your report.  This would give you a much bigger increase than paying off some old debts.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I don't know much about how to improve your credit score except to pay your bills on time.<br>  <br>  You can call your medical providers and the hospital to see if they will work out a financial payment plan.

If you could, the government would be paying you for your labor.<br>  <br>  You didn't give anything away so I doubt that you can use it as a tax deduction. If you were allowed to use it as a tax deduction as well as the people that donated money to the the bank account, then a double deduction would occur.<br>  <br>  Comment:<br>  <br>  If it is income, then it should be reported as income when you file taxes.
