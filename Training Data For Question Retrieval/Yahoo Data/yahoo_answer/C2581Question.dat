20081017222115AAr5ygN	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	2004 Chevrolet Tahoe vs. 2006 Acura TL for single guy?	I know this might seem dumb since the cars are so different, but I can't decide between these two vehicles. The tahoe only has 12,000 miles on it, the TL about 40,000.      They are both pretty well equipped, the TL has leather while the tahoe has cloth seats.  The interior on the tahoe is in sightly worse condition since it was used by it's previous owner to haul plants from time to time, but both are quite good.      I drive about 350 miles per week, mostly highway. I like the way both vehicles drive, but I'm in a band and really enjoy the equipment hauling capabilities of the tahoe. On the other hand the TL is about 25% more fuel effecient, but the cost difference between the two just about negates that. They are both in great shape.      I can get the tahoe for $10,000 and the TL for $15,000. They are both hand me downs from family members, hence the good prices.      Which would you prefer? I'm a 25 year old single man if that matters

It seemed too good to be true, but I sent a e-mail anyway and the person said she is going through a divorce and needs to sell the car cheap. However, she said it was a 2004 this time and when I asked about the year she said it was a 2008 and it was her mistake. She wants to do the transaction on ebay for the protection program. I then asked if I could see the car in person and she said she lives in Europe and that is her motive. I think its a scam because its too good to be true.

It was cutting out on the motorway due to "carburettor icing" on one particular day when it was raining. Also, it had sometimes been cutting out in in London due to probs with the carb causing it to judder (I was told the carb needed gunk to be cleaned out of it).      I am thinking about changing the carburettor, but am wondering if this could make any difference to the general performance of the car. For example going up a steep hill it is very weak and I have to put in in 3rd gear even upto 45mph. Would that be down to the carb as well or can I just assume it is an old engine and is weak?

My question is, that i want to buy a car that is mature, comfy for long trips, and a balance of everything. I dont want to mod anything, i just want a nice comfortable car because i often take trips to Canada from Chicago. The Eclipse did not fair well in that, but its a good looking car. I want the car also to be nice! when people see it, its a nice car, not a piece of crap. My other car is a BMW 5 series. so please let me know which i should buy.      One thing though is that the Accords transmissions go bad about every 60k. However everything else is extremely reliable.      I have owned the following cars   2003 Eclipse GTS   2001 Acura 3.2 CL Type S   1999 BMW 5 series      The acura is close to the accord, but the accord is more comfy.

20090305055040AAYwhpm	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Body kit performance on focus?	I want to install a body kit on my focus to give it a bit more flair, it's nothing dramatic, adding a new front bumper that is only 2 inches or so lower than the original one, a new rear bumper, and new side skirts, all only a bit lower than the stock stuff.      I know this will hurt the aerodynamics of the car without question, but how bad will it?       I don't plan on putting on a spoiler because i know that will destroy my performance because i don't have a wind tunnel or dyno to test this.

The first time I put gas in it, i put regular. I wouldn't say it sounded bad, but it did sound a little louder. But then I saw on my gauges where it read, "Premium Fuel Only."  after the first fill up. So from there i put premium in it. Is this really true?      My grandpa says it dont matter. But my older brother has a VW GTI and it takes Premium also. He says it does matter because it will screw up your engine.       i don't know but i did an experiment. I put regular fuel in it for the second time. I measured the MPG. i will tell you i didn't get good gas milage at all. I had to fill it back up around 250miles and it is a 15.9 gallon tank. But when i put premium fuel back in it, and i got better MPG.      SO will putting regular fuel in it ruin the engine???

20090305064913AAFhb5n	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	2008 F-250 Diesel air filter clogging?	I saw the string about a month ago regarding what air filter is best for their same truck. I also saw the answers regarding using the original one. My problem is my filter gets full of snow and ice at least once per month. The first time I had a problem I took it to the dealer where I was told it was a design flaw and they replaced it also giving me the old one back to dry out and use as a spare. I live in Northern Michigan and this is getting old. It doesn't seem right that I would have to continually change the filter. I was told by the delaer that another customer replaced theirs with a K&N filter and have not had a problem since.       I am just looking for advice on the problem and if there is another fix or should I just drop the money and change it. I bought the truck used but only had 18K miles and this is my first winter with it. I am just frustrated by it.      Sorry so long but felt some history was needed as a simialr question had already been asked.      Scott

It is a 2007Suzuki GS500F and I purchased it new June 2008. I live in PA so the weather gets kind of cold in the winter.

20090305074250AAg9TEA	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	I'm deciding between 2 cars, 2009 Nissan Skyline GT-R or 2008 Dodge Challenger?	Okay I know a lot about vehicles, engines, and that kinda bull, but i want to hear some guys or gals, that have EXPERIENCE in the field of cars, I'm looking for power, comfortableness, control, and stick shift. I'm not to big on the price, shouldn't be a problem for anything under 150k. Here is what I know The Nissan GT-R has a kick *** VR38DETT engine, a 3,799 cc DOHC V6. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries turbochargers provide forced induction. off the factory line this engine outputs 480 bhp at 6400 rpm and 434 lb·ft at 3200-5200 rpm. The Dodge Challenger also has a kick ***,  6.1-liter SRT hemi V8, 425 horses, and 420 LB/FT. What do you guys think. REMEMBER EXPERIENCE REQUIRED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, NO FRICKEN 12 YEAR OLDS!

20090305080037AARrUFs	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What to do with an old Jeep?	Long story short; I have a 98 Jeep Cherokee Sport with about 200,000 miles on it.  I've kept it in factory condition as far as looks; interior and exterior. I've added black american racing wheels, AFE cold air, and a flowmaster w/ tip.  Now, I've redone the trim and kept it as clean as I could for the past 11 years (wow odd to type).  The problem with it is that the only way to start it is with a wire to the fuse box under the hood.  I know where the problem is and how to fix it but its just soo old and would cost a great deal of time and money to actually do it.  I was hoping to sell it I just don't know where to put it or what to do. Anyone have any ideas? I was thinking 800?
