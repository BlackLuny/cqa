SDv9wB2Qaa	Split ends are a concern for me too as I have curly hair that tends to be dry.<br>  <br>  1.  get regular trims<br>  2.  skip a shampoo on a weekly or biweekly basis<br>  3.  use a gentle shampoo<br>  4.  deep condition with Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose formula<br>  see link below<br>  Aubrey uses plant-based moisturizers (organic) rather than cheap inorganic moisturizers that are petroleum-based.  Because of the cost-effectiveness, petro-based moisturizers such as propelene glycol are used as a moisturizing agent in many conditioners.  <br>  The molecules of inorganic substances are too large to be absorbed by your hair and only coat the shaft resulting in a temporary fix.  Petro-based moisturizers also seal out nourishing ingredients in conditioner such as panthenol and vitamin E-rendering them ineffective.<br>  <br>  I color and highlight my hair regularly and Aubrey's Honeysuckle Rose conditioner keeps it healthy along with a good diet and a hair, skin and nails supplement.  I buy Whole Food's store brand.<br>  <br>  What works best for me is to draw a nice hot bath, wash my hair, then apply Aubrey's conditioner.  I clip up my hair and allow the formula to penetrate with the help of the heat from the water.  When I am ready to leave the tub, I rinse my hair.  I give the conditioner about 10-20 minutes to work its magic.<br>  ps<br>  I also deep cleanse my face then apply Aubrey's Vegecol soothing mask for the duration of my bath; treating my hair and face at the same time.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	The only way you can actually get rid of split ends is (unfortunately) by cutting them off.<br>  <br>  Any other way doesn't actually get rid of them. They only hide them or make them less noticeable. If you really don't want to get a trim then you can use shampoos & conditioners that disguise split ends. Pantene has a really good one that works well. Along with that you can use a serum on the ends up your hair to keep them hydrated at looking healthy. Also, once a week or once every two weeks, depending on how much damage you have, you can combine mayonnaise, a raw egg, & a little bit of olive oil & saturate your hair with it. Comb it through with a wide toothed comb & let it sit for 15 minutes with a shower cap over. Then rinse it all out really well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <3|`|igiCJuF9aa	just get 1 tiny bit cut off, like 1/4 of an inch (lets say this much -----)<br>  it will make a difference.  I really do like sunsilk hydra tlc leave in conditioner ( i think its called 24-7 creme) its in a pink bottle and you can buy it pretty much anywhere. it makes my hair look healthy, smell great and helps split ends look much better. you can also flat iron your hair (use a protectant spray first) the jagged end look can be in and if you make your hair super straight it will look like you were going for that look. like the split ends were on purpose. but my real advise is to have a hairdresser cut off what ever is spilt then promise youself to be good to your hair after that. (comb and brush carefuly) use lots of conditioner and also never tie your hair back too tight, baby it!|`|vPI1hVGUaa	Try Alberto VO5 hot oil hair treatment. Works miracles<br>  <br>  Take a small section of your hair and carefully twist it gently in a downward motion. When you do this, the split ends will automatically stick out.

I once took out my nose stud for maybe half a day because I was ill and then I couldn't get it back in. It wasn't because the hole had closed though, it just seemed to have shrunk because I could fit a normal sized earring in to it. <br>  <br>  1 1/2 months isn't long enough for a piercing like that to fully heal, though. When piercings aren't fully healed they will begin closing at the first opportunity. But you could try reopening it, just ensure the needles or whatever you plan on using has been disinfected.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Don't try and shove it in their yourself if it just won't go.

They dont usually charge for this and it will be more sterile than doing it yourself. Hope this helps!|`|QULdCByIaa	i think you should try putting it back in again. keep trying but don't hurt yourself! if you cant get it back in then go get it checked out by the person who pierced it and get them to replace it. by doing the hole again! after that you should be fine<br>  i hope you get the job! :D|`|BYzFWtfoaa	Monkey see Monkey do, why people like to look as slave"?putting in their Tong,in the nose,in their teats, ..BE yourself and that's it"

Hair is also there to keep homeostasis. A brief definition of that would be keeping things in your body the same. For example, when it is cold our hair on our arms naturally stands up. This doesnt have that big of an affect on us but for animals with fur it traps the heat inside and keeps your body warm. Now if it is hot outside then our hair lays down to keep us cool, and we sweat a lot to cool us down.

4Ef8yCbfaa	I have been using the sensitive formula Jolen cream bleach to lighten dark hair on my upper lip and 'snail trail' (belly area) for at least six months; so far I have been very pleased with my experiences. It's very embarrassing to have to do such a thing, however I think it's worth it. For the past month or so I have also been using it as a gentler way to bleach my 'down there' hair - which has been surprisingly successful!<br>  <br>  - Some Tips -<br>  <br>  Inside the box is everything you'll need to get started: a mixing tray, spatula, creme bleach pot and accelerator powder. The instructions are clear enough - you should follow these carefully otherwise you can get into some messy situations!<br>  Sometimes, I have found, the bleach can become itchy and painful after about ten minutes. As well as this, the mixture raises from the skin (sometimes it even falls off and lands on the bathroom floor!) If this happens, I usually pat it down with the spatula provided. This usually happens if too much accelerator is added. Or I haven't mixed the ingredients together fully - you should make sure that the mixture is thoroughly mixed together to form a consistency not unlike whippy ice cream.<br>  Do not mix all of the ingredients at once and leave them in the pot - the bleach becomes unusable after a short period of time. Only bleach as much as you need and don't waste money!|`|SpcYCBndaa	i think Nair has one<br>  <br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks

HvbIE03saa	There can be problems if the lingual artery gets pierced...a person can bleed out quickly if it is punctured.<br>  <br>  Generally, the person piercing with check the underside of the tongue to see where the lingual artery runs and then will place the piercing a little to the right or left (they generally can't be placed dead center because of the vein). <br>  <br>  Your risk of infection is low as long as you clean your mouth...usually bactene will get it done. Be careful with something like listerine though, because that can really burn on a new piercing.<br>  <br>  And to the smarty that said the bacteria in your mouth will help FIGHT infection, you're an idiot. The bacteria in your mouth is what will help CAUSE the infection.<br>  <br>  As long as you go to a reputable place that uses sterilized equipment you should be fine. Typically it takes a few hours to swell and it'll be that way for a few days, but if you drink plenty of ice water and slushees it helps.

TjPwxbuJaa	I like both, actually. I have large stretched ears myself, and love them and have had them for many years. However, the stretched ears are more permanent and may well not return to "normal" should you ever choose to not wear them anymore. Getting stretched ears isn't terribly painful, though. The initial piercing is nearly painless, and the gradual stretching process isn't very painful at all.<br>  I have heard that the industrial piercing can be quite painful, but if you ever decide to remove it, the remaining scars/holes won't be very noticeable.<br>  I personally prefer the look of stretched ears, but there are many who don't. Stretching your ears can be addictive, and before you know it, you may end up stretching them larger than an inch (25mm).|`|VsLSJ65Paa	People say industrials hurt a lot because they pierce the two holes at once.

If you want you could always by all three and test them for comfort and volume etc. and then return the ones you do not like<br>  <br>  The first bag : this bag is nice but i think the butterflies at the top look a bit girlish.

hek0QWlFaa	They're called whiteheads and your skin sounds just like mine. Don't put makeup on them if you can help it, they are technically closed comedones. This is what happens when a pore gets clogged and the opening closes. Oxygen cannot reach it, so it just sits instead of oxidizing like an open comedone (blackhead). The annoying thing about it is that whiteheads are twice as hard to get rid of, since the pore has sealed up. Mine have finally gone away after using a regimen of Clinique's salicylic acid foaming cleanser only on those spots, Bliss fabulous foaming face wash 2 in 1 cleanser and exfoliator all over, the Clinique salicylic toner on whiteheads, mild toner all over, and benzoyl peroxide spot treatment. I know it sounds annoyingly long, but it worked. Don't forget to put an oil free lotion on all over, or else your skin will start producing too much oil.<br>  As to why they formed, try a few things:<br>  Wash your pillow case every week,<br>  Never forget to take off ANY makeup, not just foundation,<br>  If you mess with them, no good will come of it, and it can leave bad scars, so don't touch them more than you have to.|`|IheAOYlDaa	Liquid makeup clogs your pores, even if the manufacturer claims it not to. Use a powder foundation, like Bare Mineral powder foundation if you use makeup. Ever since I started using it the clogged pores have practically disappeared. Keep your skin as clean as possible and drink lots of water. Steaming your face over a boiling pot of water or with a facial steamer helps. I use St. Ives clay mask to draw out impurities. Products like stridex, clearasil wash, proactiv help keep your skin clear. The biggest thing that helped was to quit using anything but powder foundation.|`|GQkPI93naa	Oxy pads may actually worsen your skin since it could just lead to it getting dried out, which can make skin more oily. But you can still give it a try since no one's skin works the same!<br>  and are they white then? I get milia under my eye and it's just a bunch of small white bumps that look like whiteheads. if they are blackish then it's a blackhead. <br>  If the bumps are the same colour as your skin itself, then it could be soemthing else, and I can't remember the name.. but I recall using dandruff shampoo (yes, sounds ridiculous) helps make them go away. I suggest searching on the acne.org forum boards to see if you can find an answer!|`|djOQhDG3aa	Salicylic acid will melt the sebum in your pores being clogged, but it has to be a high concentration perhaps 20 percent or more. It takes time for this to work. I would suggest going to a aesthetician or better yet a dermatologist if this concerns you. If not purchase some salicylic acid at the percentage that i recommended.|`|zz9ULAwraa	shes right! i have used oxy for years now and havent gotten one piple in 3 years, and i am not joking.<br>  <br>  1st. i use oxy cleansing pads.

154dzJ1Faa	Oh no --- you don't put hair spray on the hair!!  Teasing is done by having the right haircut first.  If you have a lot of varying lengths of hair, teasing will be much easier to do.  What you are doing, in effect, is pushing all the short hairs down to the scalp, tangling them slightly, which holds the rest of the hair up.  You start near the scalp, and slowly work up in sections pushing more of the hair down.  You can use a comb (back-combing) or a brush (back-brushing).  It is also called teasing or ratting the hair.<br>  <br>  But if you don't have the right haircut, and if your hair is in too good condition, you are going to have a harder time, but it's not impossible.  Hairspray only glues the hair together, and makes the hair dirty.  Use it as little as possible.|`|STd3geMxaa	spray it after it's teased, while you're still holding the hair up.|`|o5LS7vS2aa	You can do that but the best way is to get an actual teasing brush they sell them at beauty supply stores like sally's|`|LCiY2u30aa	i use sculpting gel from garnier fructis <br>  then I tease it <br>  it also helps your hair from<br>  getting damaged|`|AKKDXZxZaa	no u either put it on the hair before u tease it or after<br>  if u have soft hair its better to put the hairspray b4 and after because if ur hair's 2 soft it wont stand up as much|`|tISJYHJNaa	um.. i use a straightner xD|`|MYedpoHcaa	lift your hair up. pull tight and comb back towards your scalp. you don't need hairspray until after. i find k=combs better than brushes

I've seen kids with gray hair because they were born with it and the doctor calls it a birth mark. But, if you're stressing slow down, stress always brings on gray hair. NEVER pull them from the root!!! Always clip them out. Pulling brings back 2 in its place. Clipping removes it for a while.|`|AKKDXZxZaa	yes<br>  theres this 7th grader at my sschool who has a LOT i mean LOTS and LOTS of gray hair<br>  if ur parents got gray hair early ull most likely get it<br>  it also occurs wen u stress 2 much<br>  or wen  sleep with ur hair wet or its in a ponytail and its wet

LwS75xPPaa	There is no way to make your hair grow faster with shampoos, conditioners or shaving.  Shaving does not make your hair grow faster or thicker.  The length of the growth cycle and diameter of each strand stays the same.  If you're really desperate for longer hair in general, you could try pre-natal vitamins.  These give you a mega dose of nutrients and the excess is excreted in your waste.  That's the only bet.  I wouldn't recommend putting chemicals on your face such as the hair growth stuff that's marketed for people's heads.  Good luck.|`|5ebbb110e2d43b24f35e86cee78ba094aa	Yea, go muff diving.|`|FZGh5JSEaa	yes I agree. Shaving will help it grow faster. When I say shaving, not with a machine, but with actual razor blades. Genetics also play a role. Make sure you don't injure yourself with razor blades, and get good ones like Mach 3, they are worth the price.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11373993	Actually shaving will make your hair grow back quicker and thicker.
MpoQljzOaa	get a inner sole to stop ur feet movin or slipping inside the shoe|`|e70lDiEPaa	It really depends on the style, the make and the materials the shoes are made of. <br>  <br>  If you could give a quick description that would be wonderful, and I could check your question later to give you an answer.<br>  <br>  Genuinely the answers are pretty correct so far, socks are always a good one. However, if you can see the socks, then your really nice shoes will perhaps not look so nice at all.<br>  If you are going to wear socks, be careful not to wear too thick a pair/s, for this could stretch the shoe even more. Same goes for lambs wool etc. <br>  <br>  If they are flat material shoes (like converse) you can put them in a separate medium-cold wash and they will shrink. <br>  All the best, and enjoy wearing them :)|`|7ip5nUrcaa	Ok<br>  The easiest option would be to wear 2 pairs of socks, a thin pair underneath and a thicker pair over the top.<br>  You could also sew a strap over the top, if they are pumps.

I learned long ago from a black friend of mine it doesn't matter what you do to it, it will never be like a white girls.  The texture is different.  The same hair cut would look different on both of us.  That is just the way it is.  Like boys and girls they are the same but different.  Just find a hair style that you like and stick with it.  Just be sure to go to a hairdresser that knows what they are doing.|`|V20PTwMmaa	Iron it|`|aOjMf5SPaa	You always want what you can't have. I'd love hair like yours.

Anyway, you can't. Not even a relaxer will give this to you. Most whites have wave/curly hair anyway and straighten it. The texture is completely different. Asians have the strongest hair type and blacks have the most fragile of all the races. There isn't anything that can be changed about that.

And when refering to "white girls" the correct term would be caucasion.  You may need to relax it.

P.S. doing this too much might result in chemically damaged hair so make sure it grows out again before u get ur next perm. but honestly i haven't gotten a perm in a while and i like my hair nappy! =)|`|eziYOLJNaa	A weave? Relaxed? I really don't know.|`|7oujNWUvaa	Chemically straighten it or Use GHD Straightners    ?|`|5vBpKmNcaa	I would like to answer with the timeless creed of Ms. India Arie... " I am not my hair" and tell you that you are not your hair, but I still want to answer your question. I have sisters that have what you would call "nappy" hair. However, my wife does not have nappy hair and I noticed a significant difference in what they do in their routines. My wife wraps her hair EVERY SINGLE NIGHT... EVERY SINGLE NIGHT without exception before she sleeps. If she does miss one night... her hair will become coarse. She also washes her hair once a week and does not apply any oils in her hair. She uses a ceramic hair STRAIGHTENER nearly everyday before she leaves the house. I pretty sure this works because my wife had it rough when she was young as I can see in her pictures... Hope this helps. By the way... a lot of white women have hair problems of their own just not the same... you want to create your own beauty and style... so don't set the bar for the white girl hair... be yourself.|`|AjsJ30zcaa	depends on what nappy means....
PoOhPuE3aa	Blue eyes look good with bronzes, burgandys, purples, and if you want to go there red.    I would do a bronze on the lid, with a burgandy color, or a darker bronze in the crease, and a light cream color for highlight. As for eyeliner a nice black brown would be cute, you can go for black, but browns look better for blue eyes, and for mascara go black, I don't think brown would look nice since theres already so much brown in the eyes, but if you wanted a black brown mascara, you could do a black eyeliner instead of the brown.    TIP: Don't bring black eyeliner too far into the inner corner, it makes the eye look smaller, and also don't use all shimmer eyeshadow, it just kills it.    Also if you have small eyes white eyeliner in the waterlione opens them up.    Hope this helps! If you have more questions e-mail me!|`|SS87lbOCaa	You are very young but if you want to wear makeup then go ahead. I would suggest something simple like mascara and eyeliner and a pink lip gloss|`|WLZFuBVBaa	neutral makeup.. lipgloss. eyeliner and mascara...|`|o1irBbeNaa	too young to be worrying about makeup, the earlier you start wearing make up the worse your skin is going to be|`|maQTi6Aeaa	Hmm...for eyeshadow, I think a very natural, very light brown, bronze color would look good with your colorings, and for eyeliner, a medium-dark brown shade. For mascara, I would also go with brown or brown/black. My sister has auburn hair and she looks great with a subtle bronze shadow and actually a very deep purple eyeliner that she applies very lightly. And then she tops it off with mascara. Just go light, and remember to try to enhance and compliment your appearance rather then go crazy and not be able to see the real you! =) Have fun!|`|Xi5Jno6haa	You are too young for makeup...shouldn't you still be playing with dolls?|`|0M6xfurGaa	You are quite young, so you don't need to go over the top with your make up. I think when I was 12 my first choice of make up was a little bit of lipgloss, and maybe mascara too if it's a special occasion, which will bring out your eyes.. don't try and make yourself look too old and embrace your youth :) x
7Rk5aUcvaa	I think your hair looks the best in the first picture; a few inches past your shoulders, layered, and straight. I also like the darker color on you. I think with your skin tone and eye color, a medium dark brunette with a little bit of red lowlights looks the best.    PS: That baby is ADORABLE. :)
AA11049477	consider fine gothic, as it's german it would be apt.  It's your body & your money, if you want a tattoo you go for it.  As long as you're old enough & it's done by a reputable tattooist.    ;-)|`|YIplumj8aa	I assume by scripture you mean font????  Go into the tattoo shop you plan to get tattooed at.  They should have a book full of different kinds of fonts, look through it and pick one you like.  If none of those are doing it for  you, you can ask the tattoo artist to draw something up himself.  A lot of times tattoo artists will have their own personal way of drawing letters.
v3krM4tXaa	No.. i don't think you shouldn't use that because its still hair spray and what hair spray does is holds it for you and when its saying ultra fine it means that its finer then the other hair spray but it will make your hair hard and not natural because i have natural curly hair and i use hair spray and moose and that really holds it down from frizzing but when i straiten my hair i just put tresemme hair shine stuff in it and it makes it soft and non-frizz.. but all you do is spray it in you HAIR BRUSH and then brush your hair... that should work for you...  because it does for me and its good!

It's not a trend, it's just a style.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	My mom knows what they are, and she's like older than the dinosaurs. Kidding. Her age starts with a 4 but every time she has a birthday, there's one less candle on the cake--I smell a rat.    Anyway, side bangs mean there's pieces of hair that frame your face, and they're usually about an inch or two shorter than the rest of your hair, which makes them bangs. You won't find them on long hair styles, just short and medium.|`|rNdun1V7aa	you have them on your avatar. "side swept" is what they mean.|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	Oh my god. There are people of all ages with "side bangs". You don't need to be under twenty five or an "emo/teenybopper"|`|0zbqIGV4aa	Uhmm  No people over the age of 25 have heard of them pretty much everyone has just not you I guess thats okay though haha they are just bangs swooped over to the side     http://www.hrbangs.com/jessica-alba-side...|`|pXhoYvzkaa	http://hairbrained.files.wordpress.com/2...  hope this helps|`|ssiqDLKsaa	its bangs where they cover part of your eye|`|5KEHK4rjaa	http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/uploa...|`|wUaMEwSsaa	there just bangs swept off to the side|`|lwoUQddCaa	They're the same thing as side fringe. =]|`|ovVZs8y5aa	its like when bangs are from one side swept over to the other side, also sometimes used as side swept bangs, kind of like your avatar and kind of like fringe.|`|NtdlK51haa	They look just like your avatar. They are bangs that are cut at an angle so they cover part of your forehead and literally get styled to the side, as opposed to blunt bangs that cover your entire forehead by hanging straight down. Its not just a teen trend, they can be flattering on just about anyone depending how you get them cut.|`|BO28Mn8haa	you have them hun, on your avatar    http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...    also known as side-swept bangs|`|aH4mU2Xcaa	the hairstyle in your Yahoo avatar kinda has side bangs....they look kinda like that =)|`|iOyegoFmaa	it like the hair on you avater. covers the side of your face.
28522d76fdc2bf2d2e1ebcafa38469dcaa	Go to a craft store, like Michael's or JoAnn's.  They should have what your'e looking for.|`|2ign8dXkaa	Are you looking for just the bell itself? <br>  'Cause then you can just find them at a fabric store or an art supply store.<br>  <br>  But if you're looking for a cat bell as in a collar/choker (I'm assuming it's for you to wear since you said it's for a costume...) you might try searching Lokisa. <br>  I've provided a link to the collar section: <br>  (<a href="https://www.lolita-kisama.com/shop/index.php?cPath=134_341)" rel="nofollow">https://www.lolita-kisama.com/shop/index...</a><br>  You might also want to visit a costume shop near you.

d93b20cad427cd67a81034903e021cd7aa	Dont dye it yet.<br>  In order to get your hair to be light enough, you have to bleach it 2 or 3 times. And dont forget to tone it every time after you do it.<br>  <br>  THEN you can dye it light blonde. It will turn out really reddish and dark if you do it before bleaching + toning it more.|`|jez0O0bXaa	You need to bleach it again to get it past the red stage. Make sure if you use a toner or a dye after you bleach it's not an ash /green base.
SefEbX6aaa	possibly if you could prove to them that your nose was having a detrimental affect on you psychological health i.e if your being bullied or hate looking at yourself due to it etc etc
BZEN8QXbaa	Most likely but don't complain when you get jerks making comments and staring....|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	I think only women that don't have big wobbly asses can get away with wearing bikinis like that. If you have a nice tight *** go for it but if it is like the girl in the picture I would suggest wearing a normal bikini.<br>  <br>  EDIT- looking at your picture you are obviously pregnant.

ivir0mjFaa	You can get it from literally anywhere!<br>  <br>  Sainsbury's, Tesco's, Boots...<br>  <br>  I personally like the Sally Hansen products:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sallyhansen.co.uk/products/nail-colour/base-top-coats/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallyhansen.co.uk/products/na...</a><br>  <br>  In my opinion they are the best as some can be used as base and top coats and also when using black nail polish like i do, it comes off really easily.

They're a pretty high quality nail polish.. I love their products. It's ￡3-5 for a small bottle, but it's worth it.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Why not ask the salon?  I'm sure they wouldn't mind telling you what brand(s) they use and where to buy them.|`|wH9EdF7naa	most drugstores and beauty supplies will carry basecoats :)|`|k2vvT6glaa	try boots or any other chemist, if you can't find any there you could try asking someone at the salon|`|3WTCGWLMaa	go to your local pharmacy they'll have loads of base coats.they can be clear with minerals and vitamins but they can also be other colours like light pink,green,or blue,but that doesnt matter because the colour wont show through the nail varnish thatts on top.<br>  sally hansen are good but kinda expensive.you can also just use a clear top coat varnish for the base coat!|`|Az0zqz0raa	You can get it in Boots, Superdrug, Sally Hansen's, <br>  any chemists really.

They have a product called Double Duty .  This product can be used as a base coat & topcoat.<br>  <br>  If you are in the UK , try Boots , Rimmel , Bourjois.|`|pib7qBtFaa	You'll probably be able to get it from boots.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that both base-coats and top-coats usually come together with manicure sets, or sets where you get a French White nail polish.

Run DMC is a classic group who obtained much respect with their style of clothing and music!!  If these two were your idols go with RUN DMC.      If you have a pair of old school glasses (i.e. CAZAL), Adidas track suit, shell toe gym shoes, blazer (velour), striped pants, etc you could pull this together.  Google the styles of that era for more inspiration.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Vanilla Ice was a joke, so I'm not even going to comment on his cheap clothes.    Run DMC always wore Adidas (remember the song?) and typically wore Kangol caps just like L.L. Cool J.    I can't imagine anyone wearing tight shirts.  Ew.
n5wXTZFGaa	Eye Shadow:  You'll look best in pale pink, light to medium pinkish-brown and medium purple shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows. These colors will make your eyes surely POP!!!!!!!    Mascara:  Apply one coat of clear or black mascara.    Lip Color:  Your best lip look is clear gloss or a very sheer, pale gloss in a baby pink or peachey shade.    Special Occasions:  A glittery pink eye shadow all over lids combined with one to two coats of black mascara will look gorgeous for special evenings. Keep lips sheer and light with glittery clear or beige gloss.    Hope I helped! ;) Good luck!|`|rHKW1CJJaa	face the world in your true skin and go bare|`|WLZFuBVBaa	neutral eyeshadows with dark eyeliner and mascara...  for you lips:nude neutral pink or peach, blush:peach.|`|kOkrwUmgaa	natural or nothing but lipgloss. light brown eyeshadow if any. it'll look great with your eyes.|`|yQqbULPLaa	blackish mascara with baby pink lips and a mahogany liner on top lashes.
a7iuLw4Kaa	side bangs would look cute|`|l5zJ1bldaa	go for the bedhead or "scene" look.  ask for alot of choppy/razored layers, just messy and fun.  get bangs that will cover your forehead more.  then when your styling it, straighten, tease it a little and hairspray it up!|`|WuEcETAlaa	lots of short choppy layes and side bangs :) xx|`|HRNll2bfaa	Where do you live if you live in Omaha I know a girl that is so good at hair everyone I know that goes to her including me say that we like our hair better than anytime in our lives so let me know and I will forward her to you if you'd like my sisters go to her and many others I really love|`|BO28Mn8haa	hard to see but try dying it a new color. choppy bangs|`|GX1hvK8Yaa	With a hammer|`|tM0qJY4aaa	ask them to make it a little messy and add a little bit of layers .

nTSjPOYQaa	Oh definitely! I'd love to have an artist do their thing, even better let them free hand it! Once you find you're favorite artist, having a one of a kind piece would be a great surprise. Artists don't get to do what they want very often, so imagine all of the amazing ideas they have just waiting to be put on skin.|`|slppTZi1aa	Absolutely! Go for it. I would love love love to do that if I had the money, and if you trust this artist and everything then do it, if there is anything you specifically do not want let him know and go crazy, as soon as i can im getting a whole back pieced based off of nothing other than loving my artist and his work, ill tell him what i sort of want and what i do not want and let him go bananas in pajamas.|`|eQQWdk0uaa	I wouldn't just because I love someone's work, but if someone I knew personally were this artist, then maybe I would.  Then they know you and your taste so I would trust them to give me something they know I would appreciate.  I'm also a little obsessive and can't stand to give up control to anyone else though!  Sounds like fun for a go with the flow type person!|`|Cavz3kAPaa	To the person who said tattoos are for dummies -- why are you here exactly?<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish I had the guts. Especially if I found an incredible artist, but I'm just too much of a wimp. I love the two tattoos I have, but I'm still afraid I'm going to hate them eventually. Lol.|`|MWEn7fcwaa	I am actually going to do this! I've got a few Americana style tattoos and got talking to one guy about getting more, he mentioned he's always wanted to do a gypsy head tattoo... like this one sort of:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/2689065114_7fcc756c07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/2689...</a><br>  <br>  So he's going to draw something up for me. We'll work out where it goes later!|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	I have a great artist and for both of my sleeves I gave him just a general idea of what I wanted, basically a style idea and told him to draw up what he would want tattooed on his own body, something that could showcase his talent, something he wanted to do.  Both sleeves came out spectacular.  The artwork for both pieces came out better than I had imagined in my mind.  I can't draw to save my life, so rather than try, I just let the artist do his job.  However, to answer your question, I would still like to have a bit of control over what goes on my body, so no, I wouldnt just sit down and say, tattoo whatever onto me.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	I have had the guts,my tattooist has done all my tattoos and i had him do a cover up on a homemade tattoo (stupid i know) I said do what you can,and it is still in the works but it looks great he just drew it on my skin and did the outline and some coloring in..Its a bio-mechanical piece that cover over half of my lower leg...I just love it and him :D|`|50O5yGWDaa	If money was no object I would definitely go to my tattooist and say 'go for gold!' I have alot of respect for him, he knows what style of tattoo I like, and his work is just amazing! I know I would come out with something that I would love.|`|UcezPQcjaa	i dont, i sadly dont have the guts|`|rjac15O0aa	I don't think its so much as having the guts to do it, but being able to let go of the control.  I don't like not knowing...  I know it sucks, but I like to think that I can go to my artist with an idea and let he be creative from there.  I feel that if I go in there with my exact drawing and have it tattooed that exact way, I am taking something from him.  He is like ok I just get to trace the picture.  But if I have an idea and let him elaborate and invest his emotions, it becomes something more for me and him.  So not exactly letting him go wild, but still getting his style and personal touch.
M3CsxF2jaa	yeah your imagination!
jez0O0bXaa	When you flat iron you close down the hair cuticle and it just looks thinner. Try round brushing it out or get a all in one dryer round brush and use products that are right for your hair type, Big Sexy Hair is great.|`|9BEg5s2Oaa	make it wavy with the flat iron! wrap the strands of hair around one of the tongs on the flat iron, close it and hold for about 20-30 seconds and open and it and you should have beachy waves with great volume!
ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	Yes I love wearing really tight pencil skirts. But you have to appreciate the difficulties that they bring. Climbing stairs can become quite unladylike (especially from behind) so you try to avoid it where possible. (Remember that with the current vogue to improve disabled access, of which I am a strong supporter, there is usually an alternative to stairs!)|`|0PsnnVb6aa	if it is of some stretchy material that allows a little leg movement...fine but denims are just not practical unless its a tight mini...long ones restrict movmnt....|`|97sKOWQ0aa	No.<br>  <br>  I like skirts and dresses that are full and swish when you walk.<br>  <br>  Way more comfy.|`|jOTTIDNQaa	lol<br>  hitch up ur skirt a bit when walking up stairs!|`|sPapFBv1aa	I don't like them that tight, but have worn them for sake of fashion.

BWUlksmmaa	I would say it is definitely dried out from the hairdryer.  Happens to me all the time.  Do you regularly cleanse and moisturise?  You should.  Make sure you especially moisturise before drying your hair and when you get out of the shower.  The heat from both dries your face out.  Even if you have oily skin, you need a moisturiser.  Your face produces oil because of a lack of moisture so that is why often people who don't use moisturiser have more oily skin than those who do...because your face over compensates.|`|jTkqWJjZaa	You might have sensitive skin, so keep on using lots of moisturiser. (Nivea is a really good make for sensitive skin) Or you could have had a reaction to the shampoo. Try using the shampoo and don't dry your hair afterwards, if your face still feels tight then stop using it. Hope I helped :)<br>  xx|`|jez0O0bXaa	It sounds like you have dry skin which means you can also have dry eyes. Use your moisturizer before you dry your hair & after also they have eye drops to help your eyes, I use them.  You may also be allergic to something in your shampoo.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	Put your moisturizer on your face while drying your hair|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Hey. I get the exact same thing when I wash my hair. Personally I think its the shampoo as you could be allergic to it.

slppTZi1aa	I had mine done in the shape of a diamond, i say its definitely worth it. it will probably reject after a year or longer but that all depends on you. and if it does reject, who cares... get anchors. a,so, you might not want it forever and its really not as painful as you would expect. so all in all, its absolutely worth it.
YCeI6auxaa	yes, you should get pierced but only if you really want to.  get it on the left side. (i heard the right side isn't good if you pierce it, like, its bad luck or something :P)  im sure being paralyzed by a cartilages a myth.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	No you shouldn't.

jez0O0bXaa	Natural is much better.  You can add highlights that match your natural color so as it grows out it will look good and you will have dimension to your hair. You will have to use bleach to do this but it won't have to stay on long because you aren't lifting the color too far.  Use good moisturizing products after.  Joico/K-Pak is a great line for maintenance and repair.|`|tdbelYnNaa	i like both, but i would stay with the black one because it looks better with your skin, and if you try to dye it light it will turn an orange-ish color. thats wat happened to me.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|ODJAM6Oraa	i think chocolate brown colour would look nice if you want to get back tp your natural colour the only way of doing this is growing out the dye <br>  <br>  and maybe get a hair cut the second pic it looks like or wearing a wig bad cut!|`|d4BPoMPwaa	both colours look really nice but i love the second one best on you it really suits u and makes u look more stylish.<br>  to get bac to normal colour u cud dye it ur natural colour then let it grow out. but i think u shud keep it how it is :D|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I think your natural colour suits you best.

I'm 5'6" and I only weigh 100lbs, I'm a boy, so I should weigh a bit more than girls, but since I'm skinny I don't. So you have a pretty good weight for your height and for being a girl.

Just like the skin the scalp needs to be taken care of in form of hydration and nourishment because with time colour and straightening the scalp has been robbed off its natural oils. So try a 100% natural remedy of deep oil treatment. I use a lotion called ziravie and I do enjoy strong shiny hair. I bought it on ebay.co.uk under the ID of hair-treatment|`|hntZWnLuaa	i have been dealing with this exact same problem forever! first of all, get a fantastic shampoo/especially conditioner that works well with curly/damaged hair. After you wash your hair, air dry it for as long as possible. if you just HAVE to blow dry it, use a diffuser. While its damp (not soaking wet but not completely dry at the same time), take some of your conditioner and comb it through, as a leave-in conditioner. don't wash it out. and the only time i brush my hair is before i go in the shower, because if i brush it regularly it loses its curls and gets all frizzy. and i also use pantene - it works great! good luck and i hope i helped!|`|yPMPx78waa	well there are a few ways you could curl your hair without tongs.    you could tie your hair in a messy bun or in plats overnight, so you wake up with curly hair.  After you wash your hair, put some mouse in to your hair and scrunch it at the same time. Either leave it to dry or dry it with a defuser.    my hair is naturally straight and i use these methods to get it curly.   however my hair is quite thin, so i dunno whether it would work for thick hair or not.  but have a try and good lucck.

RYLkjYkIaa	Its a simple as when u said it, no pain with the new ways to fix one, and doesnt prevent u from doing anything, but u should keep it clean, i mean yr mouth clean after eating, wash more than usual.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	It hurts but its not like a cut iits like a REAL BAD pinch.   the healing process sucks your tongue will swell up you will live on yogurt and milk shakes and you will speak with a lisp until you learn to speak with it.<br>  You will have to learn to eat with it... kiss with it anything you do with your tingue you must relearn.once its healed you can take it in and take it out all the time without pain.  <br>  Some people are better healers and your tongue is the fastest healing part of your body if you leave it out too long... could be hours could be months everyone is different it will reheal.<br>  I had mine for 6 yrs and took it out for an interview lost the bar bought one 2 days later and the hole was closed|`|brvOa9QYaa	1. I found it quite sharp but it was quick,  6/10. but the after pain was worse, it swollen and I couildnt eat and it made me miserable for around three days afterwars.<br>  <br>  2. Stopped me from eating and , dont mean to be gross, snogging is awkward and although they say guys like em, the guys I have snogged dont like it. Im guessing if they thought it was weird snoging then oral sex would be weird. <br>  <br>  3. Taking it out doesntg hurt because its healed by then and it slides out easily due to saliva. <br>  <br>  <br>  overall id rate the piercing 7/10, it heals quickly and looks cool with a bit of pain and it doesnt stop you sleeping like ear piercings! Only thing - be careful if you have it done and take it out for a bit, because it heals very very quickly, like ten minutes in the first six months bcause your tongue heals very quickly, I had to get mine re-done and it hurt more the second time. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  if you do have it done, take zinc tablets and anti-septic mouthwash to help it heal  ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD Luck|`|AVQzotwGaa	1.  About a 2.<br>  2.  It does not really prevent you from doing anything once it is healed.  You will have to take smaller bites while eating till you get used to it and take very good care of it during the healing process.<br>  3.  Once it is healed it is not painful to take out at all.  Just don't take it out until it is completely healed.|`|O7S6qGtUaa	on a scale from one to ten...<br>  i would say an 8.<br>  its scary when they put that clamp on your tongue and start walking towards you with the needle.<br>  but, then just don't look! ^_^<br>  no it does not prevent you from doing anything,<br>  just you sound really funny hen you talk, just at first though, it takes a WHILE to get used to.<br>  no it is not painful to take out,<br>  but you have to wait 3-5 months before you do.<br>  But, if it's something YOU really want to get<br>  and do for YOURSELF, make sure thats the only reason why.<br>  So other than that, they are great!!!! ^_^<br>  2 important things<br>  1. don't pierce your own tongue, or friends!<br>  2.

It doesn't prevent you from much..just kinda gets the way with certain things..like eating certain things...it's never painful to take out once it heals, but mine left a small scar, and hopefully the piercer knows what they're doing, but the ones that don't can pierce it wrong (like the area and it can irritate certain areas of the mouth, like for me, it was the web area under my tongue and it kinda irriated the skin there.) but other than that, it's no biggie, just tongue swells up for 3 days cuz it's healing.|`|e9JRcA35aa	The peircing itself isn't painful at all. Afterwords though, (before it heals, the first month or so) you can't eat a whole lot and your tongue swells up quite a bit. They are pretty painful the first week you get them done. No, it doesn't prevent you from doing anything. You may talk a little funny while you're getting used to it, but that goes away quickly... and no it isn't painful to take out at all after it heals.|`|pfU1dCAaaa	1. If done properly, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say.... around 6! Its really not that bad. I was so excited so the pain didnt really set in I dont think lol.<br>  <br>  2. For the next few days you cant eat certain things... although some people do. But yeah, thats probably about it. <br>  <br>  3. No its not painful to take out. Its weird though. When you have it in your mouth for ages and then take it out its strange to feel your tongue on the roof of your mouth without there being sommat there lol.... <br>  <br>  anyway.. yeah thats it :) :) :)|`|YUudOvk1aa	On a scale of 1-10..I'd say 11!!!!! I had mine done when i was 16, BIG MISTAKE!!! It was swollen for the next 2weeks, and i couldn't talk properly for weeks, plus it hurt really badly when i ate too. About a month later i was fiddling with it in my Mouthe, and got it Court in between my two teeth! When i tried to pull it out...i ripped my tongue open! It was agony and then i had to have it stitched up. Never again! Never!

Lemon juice willl take the orange pigment away, but if that doesn't work you might just have to go shower crazy until it all washes off. Take a pumice rock, while your skin is wet and rub it over the places that are orange and too dark. Don't moisturize, that will only make it last longer. If you keep your skin dry, the tan will flake off after you get out of the shower. You can manipulate your skin into drying out by using rubbing alocohol on it, but that's not exactly good for it lol.  Hope that helps, and next time you want to get a tan I recommend mixing L'oreal sublime bronze in medium with a TAD bit of banana boat dark. It usually gives me a nice color. Fake tan is tricky though.
Mwhclezaaa	Some areas the NHS may pay- ask your GP for a referral to find out.  It is normal to have hairy armits, etc.  You may find it goes a bit after puberty has properly passed as it can be hormonal.  Also avoiding greasy foods is supposed to help.

You get is back faster is probably your real question, as that has to do with diet and your hair care regimen.  You should take to massaging you bald spot daily, to stimulate the folicles. Also try wearing a satin scarf or buying a satin pillow case. It keeps hair from over drying (which causes breakage) when you sleep and your head lies against the pillow and hair, and protects against pulling hairs (which if dry will break easier) as your hair grows out.|`|7ZDWmwGzaa	I'm only 23 years old and I've already suffered from hair loss due to stress and other issues.

jez0O0bXaa	Probably, it's so drastic and if you don't like it you will trash your hair to get it back. If you have no color on your hair now (a natural blond) it should hold if not the black will fade easily.  It's not hard to keep up roots just have it done by a pro or a friend that knows what to do.  Just do the new growth and only pull through last 5-10 minutes or you will have too much color build up.|`|07658108bf84ff22af742f784fa5ea0aaa	Are you Goth?

Sometimes sooner if your hair grows really fast. If you want the look and don't mind the upkeep go for it. But you might want to get it done professionally the first time.     Once i bleached my hair out, did funky colors like blue and green. Before i went back home from college i dyed it a really dark brown. Because i didn't go a shade of red in between i accidently permanently dyed my hair green. I don't know if the same thing would happen going from blond to black, but do you really wanna risk it? In order to fix it they needed to strip my hair, bleach it, strip it again and then put a color over it. needless to say my hair was pretty fried after that.    one more thing you might want to consider. If and when you decide to go back to your natural hair color its gunna take some work to get it back to it. You'll either need to bleach it several times over a few weeks or get it done professionally.

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	It`s normal for a piercing to be sore for the first week or two. The crusty stuff is called lymph and it`s normal as well, it`s a sign that it`s healing. Lymph can occur for months after the piercing is done. Redness around the piercing is also normal for the first few weeks.    Just keep cleaning it with mild sea salt soaks and you should be fine. The piercing will take up to 10 months to fully heal, but should feel better within 3-4 weeks.    http://www.articlefit.com/Fresh-Piercing...
jez0O0bXaa	If you have box color it's 20 volume developer ( hydrogen peroxide) the white stuff and do not dilute it with water.  You will not get any lift in your cuticles and the color will not hold. Bad stylist advice but it will make you go back to her to fix it.  Try not to use "box color" go to a Sally's for more pro colors and they can assist you.|`|g3MBOYDPaa	As a hairstylist myself I do not recommend adding water at all to a box color. These box colors are formulated the way they are for a reason. Stick by these rules of at home hair coloring.    1. Don't bother trying to go lighter if you have brown or black hair. You will turn into a carrot top.    2. If trying to add a little warmth to your color find a level which is the number of the color with either an N, R or G after the number (Ex. 6N or 6R). If you want to take away brassiness or limit reddish tones find a level near your own with an A which is ashy and will tone down an orange undertone in blondes or brunettes.    3. If you are a blonde and you are trying to go lighter only try one shade lighter the first time and check out your results. If you are looking to go any lighter than that I suggest getting it done professionally to prevent ruining you hair. Hope this helps.    ***well then if you are going darker and it is semi-permanent already you definetly dont need to add water, its already going to lighten up in about 10 shampoos. I cant imagine your stylists reasoning for adding water.|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	The volume of developer should be right on the front of the bottle.|`|TWfuO1xoaa	oleth is the one you want

With your bone structure and facial features, and because you want the fringe over your eye...it would be fitting.  A modbob is a variated version of the original bob----only it does include layers, and you could definitely keep your 'fringe'.    Any knowledgeable beautician should know it by name, just ask for the 'modbob'.  Although that is the shortened version of 'modern bob'.    **updating**    What I find amusing is the number of posters who are suggesting this young lady get highlights, tips, whole-head coloration, etc.  She stated in her original post that she is "..definitely keeping it black."  If that is the color she has chosen for her hair---why suggest something else when she previously stated her standpoint on the color issue? ;)  She's asking about cut----not color.

jez0O0bXaa	Do you mean a blue hue to it?  Blue hair not black?  A blue hue there are colors at Sally's that will go over your black.  Blue hair you have to bleach it up to a blond then cover with a blue which fades easily because when you bleach you remove pigment and there is nothing for the dye to hold on to so you will have to do it frequently.  If your hair already has color on it, it will probably trash it to do this.|`|3d3JW4Wuaa	is it naturally black? or dyed black? if it semi or permanently dyed black its not possible, but if its naturally black it needs 2 be bleached first before dying it blue.|`|1f97c549fd1b284369f61e649b1c1486aa	If you are using a vegetable dye for best results you should bleach first as colours are generally more virbant and last longer when used on yellow or white hair.  Over unbleached hair you may still get a sheen of colour but its unlikely to give a proper neon or bright result.    Guide on how to use vegetable dyes:  http://www.beeunique.co.uk/Hair-HowDye.h...

gU3yIZwMaa	my first thought is tommy hilgifer, izod or lacoste.<br>  <br>  for button up shirts, i`m a fan of levis, penguin or ben sherman. levis are more vintagy, penguin and sherman are more mod than preppy, its a different take on the button down. RW and CO has some nice shirts as well.<br>  <br>  polos: i don`t really wear much polos, so AE<br>  <br>  hoodies, jeans, funky shirts: buffalo, guess.<br>  <br>  bluenotes, campus crew if you`re in canada. i like bluenotes because they`re not so logo oriented, but sometimes the style is hit or miss.<br>  <br>  also, go to winners, or a department store, look at everything and anything and see what you like. buy stuff you like, and not because of the brand. you could pull off a similar style to AE at h&M or old navy. i prefer h&m because its nicer, and fits better.|`|mI95IbBUaa	lj-fashionhouse.com|`|nG1gqvT5aa	forever 21, wet seal, Victoria secret, charlotte russe

i7xEbqEfaa	Each tailor's rate is different depending on 1) the level of his/her experience and 2) the location (e.g. tailors in the mall typically charge more because the rent is higher)<br>  <br>  If I were you I would take my design to several tailors to get an idea of how much each will charge. Most tailors don't give estimates over the phone b/c they need to see the dress beforehand. But this also gives you an opportunity to check out samples of their work. <br>  <br>  Tailors also charge for the dress material so if you can purchase this on your own, it will help keep the total cost down.<br>  <br>  Finally, try negotiating a price if possible. Explain your situation- you are a student and you don't have much money but this is a significant event in your life and you want your dress to be special. They may or may not give you a discount but it wont hurt to ask.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!     : )|`|spXPpyP0aa	$190

6aEhPcDAaa	Hm...You would probably want to do that with a more dramatic look, with plum liner.  Just do the eyeliner regularly, on the top and bottom lashes, and maybe for eyeshadow use purple shadow, and maybe a smokey eye.  I would recommend wearing that to a special event, not everyday.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|spXPpyP0aa	just line the top part not the bottom.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Line the top lashline, making the outer corner the thickest part. Create a small cat eye on the outer and inner corners, then line the bottom lashline and waterline with a matching plum pencil or even black pencil. I don't think that plum is at all too dramatic for every day, and looks quite nice when paired with pinks, browns, neutrals and greens.

I can tell you that ESPECIALLY with curly/frizzy/dry hair there will NEVER be a time when you have NO BREAKAGE...so the next best thing is the BEST that you can do. <br>  First, deal with hair health from the INSIDE.<br>  Take vitamins for hair, skin and nails. I recommend ONE SOURCE brand for hair skin and nails. <br>  If money is an issue and even if it isn't, remember that shampoo is suppose to clean the hair as gently as possible...that's all. <br>  It isn't suppose to condition it too...or do anything else. IT CANNOT clean if it has additives that condition, NOT CORRECTLY ANYWAY.<br>  I am a former hairdresser and I shampoo my hair with Dawn dish soap. <br>  Too many shampoo's leave additives, or substances on the hair AFTER shampooing. Have you ever observed dishes that didn't shine and that weren't sqeaky clean?<br>  Some dish soap is HIGH on the drying side...Dawn is best.<br>  For about a month, use one of the following formula's on your hair as a treatment at the time of shampooing.<br>  Mix Dawn dishsoap with either Fingernail Polish Remover WITH acetone, plus just a splash of water. leave on 20 minutes and Dawn shampoo it away. OR.............<br>  Mix Dawn with Hydrogen Poroxide (no special mixture needed...a little soap with a bit more poroxide) and a mild splash of water. leave on 20 minutes then Dawn shampoo it out. <br>  First mixture SOUNDS horrible, but works best and was taken from the original formula book of REDKEN labratories!!!! TRUST ME!!!<br>  Now, you have successfully stripped your hair of any and all substances that can weigh down hair, make it get dirtier faster, interfere with the workings of color or a permanent, and that keep it from having body. <br>  You are also helping your hair BREATH.<br>  Every strand of hair has three layers....and has PORES just like the pores of your skin. They HAVE to breath in order to stay conditioned and moisturized and in order to accept chemical treatments properly. <br>  Now if you have the money....buy REDKEN products. You can really see the difference the FIRST TIME. <br>  But if you don't...use a good, LIGHT TEXTURED creme conditioner and mix it with water. After stripping your hair, apply this conditioner and place any type of bag over your head and use something to lock it tight to keep out air. <br>  Use your blow dryer to keep the bag and your underneath hair, warm. <br>  Leave on treatment keeping warm, for 20 minutes then rinse clean.<br>  BIG KEY PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS NOT RINSING WELL ENOUGH AFTER SHAMPOOING. RINSE, RINSE, RINSE. <br>  Over the counter, USE NOTHING BUT LOREAL PRODUCTS. <br>  My hair was BRUTALIZED by Clairol, only Loreal is mild enough to help me keep my hair long as I desire, without extreme damage and breakage. <br>  You MAKE SURE to get mostly ONLY THE ROOTS of your hair  when re-touching your color. This should stay on the root about 30 minutes and be pulled through your entire hair for another 15 minutes. <br>  I know the instructions DON'T say that...but do it anyway, they do in the smartest shops.<br>  You CAN leave the color on 45 minutes roots and 15 all hair if the color is not penetrating well. But the stripper treatment will help make sure the stubborn gray is prepared to accept color better. Don't know what your color is, but if it is a brown, be careful in your timing of the color when you pull it through your entire head because some hair is more porous and can turn very dark too easy. <br>  Trial and error is all I can tell you about this, go easy at first...then if the timing isn't right, adjust to more the next time. BUT KEEP THE ROOTS SATURATED AND PROCESSING FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD...YOU WON'T HURT YOUR ROOTS.<br>  I use Horse Mane and Tail Conditioner.........Walmart carries. <br>  It was originally made for horses, but showed GREAT popularity when someone tried it on their own hair and POW the craze went. I DIDN'T try it for a long time...but when I did, I was satisfied greatly. <br>  IT DOES COAT THE HAIR SHAFT........MAKES SHINY HAIR WITH MORE VOLUME BUT LESS FRIZZ. ITS THE BEST I HAVE FOUND OVER THE COUNTER AND AS LONG AS YOU STRIP OFTEN AND SHAMPOO WITH DISH SOAP, THE COATING ISN'T ON THERE OFTEN ENOUGH TO DO HARM.<br>  The key here is that with our type of hair, we HAVE to have something that coats in order to calm the frizz. I also wanted it for the added body. My hair is THIN and curly and frizzy, so thickness makes me happier. <br>  Don't forget your occassional ritual of heat treatments AFTER stripping. If you do it before, it won't penetrate the hair shaft.<br>  I am 54 years old and with this regimine, this is the longest and healthiest my hair has been..........<br>  BUT YOU MUST USE LOREAL BECAUSE OTHER COLORS CAN DESTROY YOUR HAIR IN ONE USAGE IF YOU HAVE MY TYPE OF HAIR.<br>  LOREAL IS MILDER AND DOES NOT DO AS FAST AND FURIOUS IN THE COVERAGE DEPARTMENT, SO YOU MAY BE OKAY WITH THE LONGER TIME OF LEAVING IT ON, OR YOU MAY HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR COLOR TO ONE STEP DARKER. <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Bunny7

And there are many methods out there that simply don't work.<br>  <br>  For example...<br>  <br>  ......squeezing, steaming and popping.<br>  <br>  But here's a method that do work. It's called exfoliation.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is the removal of the top layer of skin (the epidermis). And is effective for almost every type of facial skin care problem.<br>  <br>  But here's how exfoliation can get rid of blackheads......<br>  <br>  Blackheads form when sebum (natural oils produced by the skin) gets trapped in the skin's pores. And if these pores are partly open, then oxygen reacts with the trapped sebum, turning it black in color.<br>  <br>  Now to remove these blackheads requires you to "un-roof" the heads of the clogged pores.<br>  <br>  And guess what......<br>  <br>  ......that's exactly what exfoliation does when removing the epidermis of the skin.<br>  <br>  And once the head of the pore is removed, the trapped sebum can be taken out via cleansers and toners.<br>  <br>  So how do you exfoliate?<br>  <br>  Well you can visit a doctor's office to have a chemical peel, laser peel or a microdermabrasion procedure.<br>  <br>  But I must warn you that these procedures are expensive. In fact a chemical peel procedure can cost up to $300.<br>  <br>  But there's a cheaper way if you're interested.<br>  <br>  You can purchase the at-home versions of the chemical peels and/or microdermabrasion creams. These work well although you'll take a little longer to get the results your looking for.<br>  <br>  However, once you've removed the top layer of skin (the epidermis), you'll easily get that trapped sebum out of your pores. <br>  <br>  You can also check the following website for more information:|`|ZpTH35O0aa	Find a product that is best for you, I use clearasil facial wipes, and just use it every day even after they have gone to keep them away.

rPFfDR7Laa	i used to work at both a subway and target with snakebites.  (two lip piercings).  i wouldn't worry about a nose stud.  everyone and their grandma has one nowadays.  (not saying it's not cute, it's just very popular).  Anyway, I think you should be fine.  Just dress respectably for the interview, have a postive outlook and good personality and I think any job would take you.  I've seen a lot of baggers at grocery stores with facial peircings, so there's a thought for you.  If you're interested in food service, maybe being a dishwasher could be an option.  If they didn't like the piercing they could always put you in back.  Don't limit yourself.  Go to as many interviews as possible, and don't bring up the piercing unless they ask about it.  I had blue and puple chunks in my black hair once that i had to cover for a job, and they didn't care about the piercings becauses I was so accommodating about fixing my hair to their standards.  Another thing to think about is getting a retainer for your piercing.  It's a small flesh colored stud that blends into your skin.  Tell your employer you could wear that to work if it's a problem to wear normal jewelry in your nose. You can get them at spencer's or online.  Also, my friend grace works at a large chain movie theater with 4 eyebrown piercings, and two noserings.  So you could always try a movie theater.<br>  <br>  good luck with the job search :)|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	most places will make an acception to just a small nose stud, because they are so common and they dont really offend anyone. but at my job they said i have to take mine out. it all just depends where you get a job. you can also get a clear retainer for it, so it doesnt close up when you're at work|`|x81a2NXAaa	you won't have a problem.

Don't put it on your face.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	mix it with your normal facial moisturiser and only apply to the area where the sun would naturally fall on/tan your face, not all over.|`|n7ZH7cyxaa	They actually have a Jergens Natural Glow face tanner, where it's actually *designed to go on your face and it works really good. <br>  Also the person above me said put it where the sun would fall, which is good but you do have to put it evenly on your face or it WILL look streaky, and make sure you get your jaw line because you don't want to be one of those people with the tan bodies and the pale facess haha<br>  Anyway have fun at the dance :)<br>  ?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  for best results<br>  <a href="http://www.parteaz.co.uk/cms/files/Tiger%20-%20Step%202.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.parteaz.co.uk/cms/files/Tiger...</a><br>  This is also a good blunt guideline as to how you should put it on,<br>  only a LITTLE around your upper lip, and make sure you blend

A6CuFmBtaa	Yes you can no matter how short, if you go to a decent nail tech and ask them to 'sculpt' you're nails - i think all places should do this but it may just be creative. xxx|`|wNZ95AK3aa	yes you can still get them done i found they dont stay on as long though caus the gel nail doesnt have much to grab onto but they stil work!|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	I don't think your nails will be too short, but fake nails are out so I recommend breaking the habit and keeping them natural.|`|4uOc515Laa	You shouldn't be chewing your nails in the first place and with short nails it doesn't look nice so try to get fake ones..|`|HsltRUOGaa	I used to bite my nails really badly and I went and got gel nails put on.  My nails were a little short so for the first few weeks I kept a coat of nail polish on my gel nails but that was just because I wanted them to look like a french manicure...anyway, because I got fake nails I wasn't able to bite my real nails.  I ended up breaking my bad habit and I now don't have to worry about paying someone for fake nails.  <br>  <br>  Give the gels a shot, you never know!  Good luck!|`|IhW40S0Aaa	NO YOUR NAILS CANT BE TO SHORT. THEY CUT YOUR NAILS WHEN YOU GET TIPS ANY WAY.

DEPENDING ON YOUR NAIL BED THAT'S HOW LONG THEY WILL HOLD UP.|`|sxP8G12zaa	Nails can be done so short, that the tip is just above the top of your finger.|`|qSQZD6Obaa	You won't chew them with fake nails, I guarantee it, because it will hurt if you bite it off.

k3curAZwaa	well hair is made from protein.. so maybe protein tablets? it can certainly help to have enough of it in your body..<br>  <br>  also hair grows at around half an inch- to an inch a month.. thats just the process im afriad.. it varies from person to person..<br>  <br>  other natural sources of protein are meat and eggs. maybe up your intake on these.. research seems to agree about the protein and vitamin A yes..<br>  <br>  and if your hair is growing back and is taking its time, you could always get your hair cut a little bit shorter to match the regrowth of your hair? and then maybe wear extensions? extensions do not always look tacky, if you buy high quality ones, ou can blend them and also even take them to a hairdressers to cut them for you into a hairstlye so you cant tell at all!!<br>  <br>  glad your ok now, hope this helped|`|aEpPt9koaa	I'm glad you have gotten over your hair pulling disorder. As far as hair growing faster, unfortunately there's not a whole lot you can do to make your hair grow faster. You can take hair vitamins or biotin supplements.

I was so surprised at how fast my hair started growing. It was awesome. So if you got a couple bucks to spare, I say you mind as well check out that guide. I'm glad I did. It was the best purchase I ever made. :) Other people have recommended it as well.|`|xGmhDTWwaa	That's real sad to hear but glad to hear you're better. Unfortunately I don't know any quick growth tips, I'm not even sure there are any. Just be patient.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could get some clip in hair extensions to cover the bald spot?! :o) xx|`|6dQzmsXuaa	sleep early in the night, take fruit juices.|`|KSGISfiaaa	All I know is that warm weather makes your hair grow faster for some reason. Move somewhere with a warmer climate. Vitamin  E is good for your hair somehow, maybe take some of that... also prenatal vitamins, I am pregnant and take them and they definitely work! But of course my hair is so long now that I sit on it when I sit down!|`|exEuXXkiaa	Well first off there are many "myths" on how to make your hair grow faster.

Make sure there is a bit of ur hair at the front not in your bun. Only a small clump of your hair and the hair length can't be too long. Use clips if you want and keep the make-up natural. Lip gloss(not too much) and a bit of eyeshadow. Blusher is nice too. NO FOUNDATION!!!! Just use concealer for spots. For better looking skin keep on drinking lots of water and for 2 mins each week fill a bowl up with boiling hot water , leave it to simmer for 2mins and then put your face in the steam. If it is too hot then leave the water to cool for a little longer. Put a towel behind your head to catch the stream.  BEST ANSWER!!!!!!!<br>  Remember though its fancy dress so go as a princess or something pretty.|`|tP2NScAiaa	how about putting the font bang area of your hair in a bump.<br>  then put the rest of your hair in a pony tail with curls coming down.<br>  and do kinda heavy makeup that matches the color of your dress.
aaoWVDxMaa	Doubt it. Happens to me too, if I don't get enough sleep. Sometimes however, even if I stay up late, I don't seem to have any problems. But best thing to do, is just sleep it off.

I know that sounds weird, but it works for me.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Olive oil. I've used it myself, and it made my hair very smooth and shiny, but not too shiny that it was greasy. Heat a little up in the microwave and pat it on. Don't use too much at first, you don't want it to look greasy. Add more if you need it.
eBxIybchaa	I highly recommend the Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish foundation. Great coverage but not thick so your skin can still breathe. Covers spots etc really well and lasts all day.

z3N5mlqdaa	No, those come and go.|`|HvbIE03saa	No, or they'd last longer. Henna ink lasts quite a few weeks, sometimes months. Stick on tattoos last, maybe a few days at best.<br>  <br>  Chazza - You're an idiot. For one, Henna with PPD in it is illegal in the US because of the adverse health affects, and it's the PPD in the Henna that allows it to stain the skin quicker than unadulterated Henna. PPD in Henna is only allowed for use in hair dye, and even then it has to be a content of less than 6% and should not be allowed in contact with the skin. <br>  <br>  So, seeing as how it's illegal, it's pretty safe to say that "black henna" with PPD is NOT in stick on tattoos.<br>  <br>  Oh, not to mention that any form of Henna is actually DYING the dermis, where as stick on tattoos just STICK on, they don't dye anything.|`|hU4czCPUaa	Dont listen to that person that just said no.<br>  They don't have any facts to prove it.<br>  <br>  If your badly allergic to henna,<br>  then i reccomend you don't use stick on tattoos.<br>  They could contain just a small bit, to make them last a little bit longer.<br>  <br>  Do some research on google, before you find out :)

You can't just turn it on and off like a faucet when you get into school, if they are asking that they are asking the impossible. Does your school have a nurse or guidance department?  Can you meet with a trusted teacher or adviser to act on your behalf?  This is really too much for someone as young as you to handle all by yourself, especially since you are grieving the death of a close family member.  <br>  <br>  Have you talked to your parents?  Or are they the "life goes on so get over it" type?  just because they are like that doesn't mean that you should be like that too.  <br>  <br>  Kittens couches and TV aren't going to help, you probably will need grief counselling.  A grief councillor is trained to help people deal with the loss of a loved one.  If you didn't go to your grandma's funeral or you didn't have a chance to say a proper good-bye, then a grief councillor will help with that too.  Many fueneral homes have people who can help with the loss of a family member, they have programs where you can talk to other kids in your situation among others.<br>  <br>  This isn't a time to be alone facing such a terrible loss, you need to find someone who you can trust to act on your behalf to deal with this difficult time for you.  Don't be afraid of your feelings.  If a teacher asks you what's wrong let it all out, the sadness and  depression and tell them your grandma died and you are having trouble since then.  Only a heartless and cruel teacher would get mad at you for that.  And if the teacher does get mad then complain to the principal or whoever the teacher's boss is.  There's no excuse for a teacher to be mean, especially to a grieving child..<br>  <br>  It will take some time, and your going to have to fight to feel better.  Find someone who you can talk to and help you, It's not a bad thing to look for help or to admit you need help.  Good luck.|`|a8aZYZ3Caa	Try and find something new that you enjoy, make some new friends, find a new hobby, treat yourself to some new clothes, force yourself to find the effort to get yourself out of the rut that you're in. good luck :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mylittlehalo.bigcartel.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mylittlehalo.bigcartel.com</a>|`|oDGieCTjaa	Focus on the good things in your life. Even the small seemingly insignificant things can make you feel better about yourself. And keep telling yourself that this too will pass.|`|qaw8BwqTaa	Meditation and prayer work best for me. During meditation, try sitting in silence, eyes closed, clear your mind of everything! Take deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. After 3-5 deep breaths imagine you are at the beach just before the sun is setting. Think of how the ocean sounds crashing on the beach, picture that red orange sun sinking slowly into the water. Deep breaths again, think of the color of red orange sun as it almost disappears now, the sun is cleansing the day of all impurities as it sinks into the ocean and wakes up the world on the other side with a clean slate.<br>  <br>        You to will have a clean slate come morning! Rest now little tiger. Let that test hear your Roar after you study a little harder.

If you watch out for clearance sales usually you can get very great deals on their products.<br>  However, if you find a scent you like at their store, go to your local Wal Mart and see if they carry the same scent, obviously it wont be the same brand. But I found that Wal Mart has decent perfumes as well, for a lot less.<br>  Try sweet pea, my personal favorite.|`|x3mFm4exaa	Go to Bath and Body Works and try Sweet Pea, Cotton Blossom, Cherry Blossom or Warm Vanilla Sugar, Country Apple is good 2

bCgW89MLaa	You'll be fine.  Don't go more than twice a week if you've never gone before.  The receptionist at the tanning salon will be able to tell you how long you will want to go for to avoid burning.  <br>  <br>  There's also lotions that you can use to accelaerate your tanning, and decrease the amount of time you spend in the bed.|`|Zt95FIt1aa	if you use a tanning bed, you're going to match your dress.<br>  <br>  20 minutes in a tanning bed is 8 hours on a beach on a sunny day.|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	you wont look orange..<br>  JEESH! people are crazy..<br>  anyways! lol<br>  go every other day like 2-3 weeks before prom. by then you will have a tan and you wont look red from not being used to bed.<br>  if you want to, i always use a tanning lotion with a bronzer in it, it gets you like a more "brown" color  sometimes, but make sure you put it on evenly!<br>  have fun at prom!|`|z3N5mlqdaa	Babe, i know alot about tanning bc i tan easy. Hit the tanning bed every other day for 7 min  a time. get your base tan on then increase your time for every  2 min. Then spring break, lay out for a few hours.
xfzB2SOsaa	use :<br>  dove soaps<br>  garnier light (to get rid of dark spots)..it works!  (100% proven)<br>  maybe lemon...|`|OUBKWrf2aa	It gonna take a While to get rid of it For sure|`|LfFdQwcdaa	Mix lemon juice with sugar and you'll become fair in maybe a few days to about 2 weeks.|`|Zv8b4jBZaa	Chweety i tell  u great face masks that makes ur skin fair<br>  Take warm honey (1 tbsp) and grated almonds (1 tbsp), mix well using some water. Immediately apply the mask to a cleansed face and rest for ten to fifteen minutes. Finally, was off the mask with water and apply a toner and moisturizer. This is a wonderful face mask, and worth the effort. The honey and almond moisturizing face mask is particularly good for mature, sensitive, or dry skin, but is suitable for all skin types.<br>  <br>  One teaspoon olive oil, <br>  1 egg yolk,<br>  Turmeric pinch <br>  One teaspoon honey. <br>  oatmeal (ground). <br>  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, using enough oatmeal to make a paste. Smooth the paste all over your face. Leave on for 15 minutes and then rinse with tepid water. The honey locks in moisture from the egg and olive oil.. and the oatmeal soothes and softens the skin.and turmeric makes skin fair<br>   Good cheewty.. I hope u will try it|`|juXYxusWaa	i think you should go to the sawna or beauty center|`|J8PY1Tnsaa	It might sound crazy, but as Larissa said, lemons are a great source when you have skin discoloration. As well as potatoes. Squirt some lemon juice onto a cotton ball, and dab the darkened area. Do this for a few days, and you should notice a difference. I can't promise that the area will go away completely, but there is a bleaching agent in the lemon juice which will help bring a more fairer skin tone to the surface.<br>  <br>  As I said, potatoes work too. Just rub a potato slice on the area. Whichever you choose to do, good luck!
AA11433436	i hated rimmel's mousse mascara, it was difficult to work with and clumpy.|`|dQZzbSXhaa	Everything that is shown on TV is crap.|`|tlj3c50Haa	Collection 2000<br>  It's just horrible. I got a blue eyeliner by them, I had to pretty much carve it into my skin to get any colour out of it.<br>  Though, it is reeeeally cheap, so you wouldn't be wasting much money anyway. XD<br>  <br>  And I have some Maybelline 'Oriental Eyes' eyeliner, or something like that, that just makes a clumpy mess.<br>  <br>  Ooh, and, umm... I can't remember the name of it, but you know the mascara that's like one side is normal mascara then the other is a colour? It was advertised on TV. Anyway, yeah, the colour doesn't even show up.|`|qQqC2cHIaa	The worst thing I ever used was bare minerals foundation.  It made my face red, irritated and sore for several days, I am one of the not-so-lucky ones who reacts badly to the bismuth oxychloride in mineral make-up.  I don't like Maybelline's Great Lash, it's a very old clumpy and lumpy formula, I wore it when I was 16, that's thirty years ago and it wasn't all that great back then.  I don't like the expensive Chanel eyeshadows, they are made with a strange glitter-stuff that flakes off and get on everything. And chanel isn't cheap.|`|RChBFKdWaa	I really hate that dream matte mousse foundation, it was too dark for my skin and it was the lightest colour, it made my skin look very flaky and didnt give much coverage too.<br>  <br>  I also hate Covergirl lash blast mascara, it made my lashes clump up and look gross.<br>  <br>  If you want good eyeshadows that arent expensive you should get one of the 88 pallettes from <a href="http://www.coastalscents.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.coastalscents.com</a> they are highly pigmented, don't fall all over your face, or crease. but if you have really oily eyelids you should get a Paint Pot from MAC and apply it before you put on your eyeshadow, it will keep it on all day and it won't crease at all and it'll make the colour better too. just get one that matches your skin tone. I'm really pale and I use Painterlilly.<br>  A mascara I really like is MAC waterproof mascara, it stays on, doesn't smudge and doesnt clump up my lashes. ^.^|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Wet n Wild pencil eyeliner, foundation, and eyeshadows<br>  CoverGirl eyeshadows<br>  Jordana eyeliner<br>  Physician's Formula blush|`|VORxJfCiaa	MAC loose powder & MAC studiofix Foundation.

AKKDXZxZaa	u have to rinse it until ur hair doesnt feel too smooth from the conditioner<br>  if u left even a lttle it will cause dandruff|`|154dzJ1Faa	But if you wash it off, then what's the point of putting it on in the first place, and wasting the money?  I don't understand your  logic.<br>  <br>  Most of the conditioners you are using are waxes.  They coat the hair with a thin film (that's why it makes the hair easier to comb) and if you wash it off, you are not going to have that feeling.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, you should read the directions!!!  That has never failed me yet.<br>  <br>  I think you will see that you are to rinse the conditioner after allowing it to remain on the hair for a few minutes.  Just a rinse with warm water should do it.  Of course, if you use too much, and don't rinse it enough, your will have greasy hair.  You will wash it off the next shampoo.  Sometimes these waxes build up because you don't rinse well enough or shampoo them off.  THEN you will run into problems.|`|AA10308264	when u use conditioner, wash out until the soapy feel is out... bcz of the conditioner, smooth feeling would be there....|`|j0tPzIuSaa	Rinse until no residue is left in your hair or it will make it greasy|`|0abc1407c77bcca0f69ee6911b4ca124aa	My dad is 100 feet tall.|`|NbUwThM4aa	rise until the water runs clear
cb8d9061f02810c2cced8d65c11335bdaa	There is another company you could check into called Arbonne. They just came out with a new product line that was featured in Allue Magazine this month. It is called FC5 and I have been using it for the past week and would recommend it to anyone. They have an eye cream that really reduced my dark circles quickly. I was really surprised. I have been using another of their eye cream for the past three years, but will be switching to the new one.

HvbIE03saa	The only thing I can suggest is either a stronger moisturizer, or maybe try some baby oil on them after you get out of the shower.<br>  <br>  Typically skin is dry because the person is dehydrated.

apkNp6mNaa	You look kindof like Victoria! Your really pretty :)<br>  <br>  If you have thick hair, ask your hairdresser to thin it out. I have thick hair myself and it makes it much easier to style/straighten when its thinned!<br>  <br>  Personally I think Victorias Pixie would suit you more, Selma's looks a bit dated, and you have the face structure to pull it off anyway.(although it would help if you posted a front picture rather than the side)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped xx|`|bFyrcWbraa	victoria's hair is adorable, it makes her look younger. selma's hair is nice too, but i dont fancy that colour on her. well, it seems like you have straight hair so you can actually achieve what you want. if you think your hair is too thick, just ask the stylist to thin it a bit.<br>  <br>  i just cut my hair short last week, somewhat like selma's in hellboy2, it turned out quite pretty and easy to maintain, considering i have thick and wavy hair. <br>  <br>  if you want a cute look, go for victoria's, if u want classy, choose selma's. it depends on you but whatever it is, it will definitely take some years off your face! im 20 and my hair makes me look like im 16. :)|`|qgpXxcuGaa	You could pull it off easy, you have the right sort of facial structure.

It's normal, everyone is different in this department (just like some people are short and some are tall, some are fat and some are thin).<br>  <br>  I would say though that at 15 you're still pretty young. I'm 30 and gave my virginity away at 16 and really wished I hadn't.

qQqC2cHIaa	It's February up here in Canada and four months of winter have not been kind to most uggs boots. My best friend manages a shoe store and she has seen first hand what happens when people wear uggs as snow boots; especially the classic shorts, talls and especially the crochet and cardys  that are such a fad.   While they are warm, they are not waterproof, no matter how much you spray them, and they aren't salt-proof, slush-proof, the soles don't have enough tread to prevent slips and slide in the ice and snow.  After a while in the snow they get wet and the wetness soaks through the suede and when the slush and snow dries your are left with white marks from salt damage, and that never comes off and can dry out the suede and cause to dry out and crack.  Crochets and cardys offer absolutely no protection against snow, slush and melted snow. Uggs are fashion boots and good for the cold days of the fall and spring, they aren't true not winter boots.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	NO|`|a6QK1oQFaa	no! thats what they are for!|`|Dd7jx9uMaa	over a long time they will. if they get a little wet they'll dry fine. but over and over again. and try staying out of the road because the sand gets really nasty on it (even if u dont c it) i have a pair of crap uggs, and my school ones. my crap i wear to do my horses stalls, and go in the mudd and snow. the good ones i just wear when they're not gona get dirty. but just watch how much gets on them. u could also try getting the care kit they sell.|`|wUQW5GBtaa	No, I know a girl that swims with hers on all the time, not ruined so far!<br>  <br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu255/bbqmon/uggclean.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu255...</a>|`|qSQZD6Obaa	Not at all, they will get them dirty but they are safe to wash in the machine.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220052338AA75Iyu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|zwbldiV0aa	You could use a water repellant spray but Uggs are not supposed to be for the rain or snow.

It's not dangerous to tattoo over the mole, but it's just not something we do.  When you tattoo over a mole, you take the risk of hiding the mole, and over time, if becomes cancerous, it will be hard to identify.  I am not a doctor, just a tattoo artist, but when I had my apprenticeship, that's one very important thing my teacher told me.  If I were you I would maybe think about going to see a dermatologist.  Best wishes!!!|`|AA11447210	Is it giving you problems? Bleeding or scabbing after the tattoo should've healed? If so, see your doctor. Otherwise, there should be no issue although you and the tattoo artist should have discussed the mole prior to you getting the tattoo in case it might have been an issue...just as I discussed my tattoo artist inking over some of my stretch marks when I got my last one.<br>  <br>  It's just a good idea to consider placement of the tattoo and any body irregularities that might be involved.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on it, and if it ever changes (the mole) or starts to give you problems then see your doc or dermatologist.|`|qSQZD6Obaa	No, you'll be alright. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlTog7kWyul0vYrakC.DiGTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220060232AA4oCfd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  I need your opinion please! :)|`|AxRU4F6oaa	no|`|HIav9sVuaa	i odnt think its dangerous at all only if your mole looks to be of a funny shape colour size then it might be handy to go see a doctor if your really worried though maybe you can go and see one anyway:)<br>  <br>  <br>  plus the tattoo artist wouldnt have done it if it was dangerous:D|`|wTy2p2wPaa	It might be something worth getting check out because it could have popped by accident and you know what that means.

THAT IS A VERY GOO QUESTION!|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	that sounds discusting but if your worried about it then go c a doctor|`|CYul7xSIaa	nice one.<br>  consult a doctor.<br>  why did you do that?

Just be sure to take advantage of the shade finder. The color in the compact is a lot lighter than what it really looks like on your skin. Also, L'Oreal Bare Natural is a good one. It's doesn't have warm undertones, but it's neutral, which is closer than pink.

The ankle is a fairly painful area, and especially in comparison to your shoulder, because there is not as much fat/muscle tissue to pad you.  As a general rule: the closer the tat is to bone or tendonds, the worse it's going to hurt.|`|qSQZD6Obaa	The foot is going to hurt, but it's not going to be too bad.

KGppArcfaa	The chi nano has nano silver technology that supposedly kills bacteria.<br>  There are TONS of irons that are way better than the chi. Dont believe the hype hun, chi irons are bad quality (they have a wiring issue) and very damaging (not pure ceramic, uneven heat, no tourmaline or anything). They were the best iron 7 years ago...but since then they havent upgraded the technology so they have seriously fallen behind.<br>  <br>  Can you buy online? If so i recommend you go on to folica.com and look at some flat irons and read reviews. <br>  IMO I think you should go with either solia, sedu, or fhi. These irons have heat control, pure ceramic plates infused with tourmaline and they are good quality.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you need more help =)|`|NVlwi2braa	My vote goes to CHI flat iron.

2lqqRcMvaa	Everyone loses between 40 and 120 strands a day, depending on how much hair you have, your age and your hair's growth cycle. People with fine hair tend to have more of it and therefore will lose more of it than their thicker-haired sisters and brothers. Your hair also thins as you get older, particularly after menopause for women. But unlike aging men, the thinning tends to stop after awhile.<br>  <br>  Here are common causes of thinning and hair loss:<br>  <br>  1. Seasonality. You'll lose the most hair in the fall -- typically November and December when hair reaches maturity in its growth cycle. <br>  <br>  2. Diet. Hair loss can occur through poor dieting. According to dermatologist George Cotsarelis, M.D., director of the University of Pennsylvania Hair and Scalp Clinic, iron deficiency may be the cause. He states in the April 2006 issue of "Ladies Home Journal," it might be worth checking your levels with your doctor and take a supplement if they're low. <br>  <br>  3. Aging. Marc Avram, MD, a Manhattan hair transplantation specialist, told Elle Magazine, "As we get older, follicles shrink, producing skinnier, shorter strands; then the follicles start to die off. That rate and the extent of that process is a matter of genetics." <br>  <br>  3. Pregnancy Some women experience hair loss with pregnancy or as part of post-pregnancy hormonal changes. Other women experience hair loss when going on or off (usually off) the birth control pill. <br>  <br>  4. Illness or intense stress Sometimes hair loss occurs as a result of illness. Stress, excessive weight loss, iron deficiency and thyroid problems can also cause hair loss.<br>  <br>  If you're really worried, ask your doctor, however, experts say you really only need to worry if your part is getting wider or you can see your scalp through your hair. For severe cases, you might consult a "trichologist," a physician who specializes in hair loss. <br>  <br>  Extra tip: If you're a woman you won't experience male-pattern baldness. Women's hair tends to thin all over. The only FDA-approved hair loss treatment is minoxidil. Minoxidil works in 60-70 percent of cases by improving the follicle's ability to produce hair.<br>  <br>  I've also heard that your hair "sheds" every seven years, but I don't know if thats true.

Since most of us lead fast -paced lives, stress is bound to be part of it . Yoga or meditation helps relieve stress there by improving the overall quality of hair.

AA10297143	Yes, not much you can do about it but ride it out.  Jet Black Hair is not going to come out perfectly brown like it is on the box.  You have to work with what you have.  BTW, there is no such thing as permanent hair dye.  Once you grow new hair, it will be your old color again.  Also, so called permanent dyes can be recolored after a bit of time.|`|u18GBKmiaa	this happened to me i dyed mine black and its turning red. it could either be a chemical reaction or the shampoo your using on your hair|`|8nlZMygSaa	if you've never dyed your hair before, its called virgin hair.<br>  <br>  but anyway, try using toners which you can buy in little sachets from chemists and drugstores ie. boots<br>  <br>  call your hairdresser/ visit her and tell her about your problem, she will know what to do,<br>  <br>  hope i helped!<br>  x|`|MFMaX2b1aa	Same here! I went from black, to blonde (accident!) but it turned out orange.<br>  Black is a really hard color to get away from, and like you and me, we were both unfortantley born with it.<br>  You should put a toner in at walmart, their for like $3 but it takes away the ginger.|`|wTy2p2wPaa	its unfortunate but black is very hard to change from one colour to the next.<br>  Sorry about that...

ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	You don't need salon shampoo. If your hair is dry, try a shampoo without sulfates. They just dry out your hair and are pretty much unnecessary. They're added so that the shampoo foams and suds.<br>  <br>  Aubrey Organics, Giovanni, and Naked Naturals are three brands that offer shampoos without sulfates. Burt's Bees also offers some.<br>  <br>  I've been using Naked Naturals for a month now and there's been a real difference. And I've heard many many good things about Aubrey Organics and Giovanni.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Tigi bedhead stuff is fantastic.|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I use Andrew Collinge. There is this stuff in a light purple-ish bottle and its a leave in conditioner. And seriously that is the best stuff ever.|`|KGppArcfaa	I think 200%% get joico kpak or moisture recovery. Joico has completely transformed hair, its unbelievable!!! It has human hair keratin in it, and its ph balanced, which is just what damaged hair needs. This stuff is just amazing, i swear by it, cant use anything else lol<br>  Trust me, if you read the ingredients in salon stuff and than in drugstore stuff, you'll see why they are more expensive. <br>  I recommend Joico, but almost anything in there is gonna be better than drugstore stuff.<br>  <br>  Healthy Sexy Hair and redken are also good, but I still prefer joico.<br>  You can get a Joico set with shampoo, conditioner, and deep protein treatment for like $30, the treatments definitely help too so get some if ya can. Good luck!|`|A6CuFmBtaa	I had the same problem, i have naturally curly and straightend it probably about 2 times a day!

Charles Worthington Shine Results spray is really good, and so is Beadhead AfterParty. (I got mine from ebay). Try and eat a healthy diet, Protein (e.g eggs) is really good for adding strength/shine to your hair. Also a leave-in conditioner (Aussie's are really good) help once a week. If you are on a budget then there are some great hair masks you can make from stuff around your home, have a look on google! <br>  You can also get some hair repair&growth masks, Lee Stafford does one, from Boots. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I think Aussie shampoo's&conditioners are better than salon brands..?|`|BrIIWg4naa	Paul Mitchell Super Strong is really good. You could mix in some Paul Mitchell Hair Repair with the conditioner. If you don't mind spending a bit more Paul Mitchell also makes a Shampoo and Conditioner called Elixir. Hands down the best. I use the Color Therapy Elixir. It is all organic too. The cost is a bit more, but well worth it.|`|B94YE68Raa	paul mitchell intense moisture is pretty good.

9zHKn4Bdaa	LOL. You are wanting to work the PERFECT hours for a hairstylist. Those are usually the times you are going to make the most money. I'm a cosmetologist right now, and I work part time. I work 5-9 during the weekdays and like 9-1 on a Saturday. My husband has the kids in the evening so we're cutting out daycare costs all the way around. Go ahead and do it. This is something that you can do forever and you'll end up doing it on the side; making extra money for you and your family.|`|wTy2p2wPaa	Yes you can work part time :)<br>  But for those specific times you'd have to ask the owner of the shop because she or he might have enough people working at that time and day so she or he might ask you to work different days and different hours.<br>  Anyway more hours and days means more money for you and your family which = more day trips and holidays for your family to remember forever and have a good time. Giggling and laughing all day.|`|SBFs2Cheaa	you can work part time|`|fIxCRpVFaa	yes hairstylists can work part time|`|JBvMGBiVaa	I've been a stylist for 15 years.  Before I had my children I worked Tuesday-Saturday, 10- 8. Those are hairdressing full time hours.  My husband and I own our own business so it's easy to work part-time.  My current hours are Thursday 10-8 & Saturday 9-5 (providing I don't have a bride). You can try working in a mall  where most salons have shift work, but in the few hours that you work you better hustle. Hairdressing is very competitive and if you don't stand out as a stylist they're going to get rid of you. To do that you have to triple your day's pay.  You can also try working from in a very profesional environment.  Set up your basement or your garage into a salon separate from your work space and schedule clients when your husband is home or when your kids are sleeping.  My friend does that and it works really well for her.  If you are currently in school for hair, after you graduate, you have to be in the industry for 2 years before you can work on the floor as a licensed stylist it is illegal to cut hair without a licensed (we are very strict about that).   I hope I was helpful good luck!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	There are salons that rent booths to independents.<br>  The rent is fixed and sometimes a commission is paid from your services to the owner.<br>  You would need to find those who open late.<br>  <br>  You could do this in your home, IF there are no deed restrictions prohibiting business operations in the residence.  Equipment is necessary.<br>  <br>  I think that Walmart operates their salons in this manner.  Whether you can get part time nights, check with them.<br>  <br>  You may receive tips, normally/

This will thin your skin in that area.  <br>  <br>  Then build your skin back up with Vitamin E oil, Bio-Oil or CoCoa Butter.   Put these oils on your skin right out of the shower and at night.  Do this for a week at a time.<br>  <br>  If you're able to, apply the oils to your skin at night and wrap the area up with saran wrap at night to lock in the moisture.  (it may get too warm for you to wear)<br>  <br>  If the saran wrap is too warm for you...try an ACE bandage.   This will flatten the stretch marks until they disappear.|`|AA10755311	Use Vitamin E oil and make sure the area doesn't have any pressure or pull on it until they fade

Like it will feel very unnatural and weird feeling a straight razor all over your head, but its more relaxing than anything... and totally painless!<br>  I still think you should find someone to do it for you, if you go to a barber shop, they can definitely make you bald, but it wont last nearly as long and you wont get the smoothest/shiniest head possible!<br>  Most people are very nervous before taking this step, your hair is like your identity, your individuality, and your about to get it all taken away from you... but just try to relax and let it happen to you, think about how good it will feel, and hopefully by the time its over, you will be so relaxed and in a hypnotic state, you wont be thinking about your predicament!|`|yzxxYlPyaa	First go to a barber shop (not a salon) where you have never been before so they will not ask questions as why you want a head shave. barbers are used to do that kind of work. Try to go at a time of the day when it's not busy for example early in the morning during the week. When you seat in the chair you'll be terribly nervous. That's normal. When the barber ask you what you want take a deep breath and tell him the length you want: 1/8th or 1/4 inch buzz or skin shaved as you which. Be brave and proud and  ask him or her to start right in the middle of your head so there is no turning back.

WELL SHE WAS KINDA UGLY!!!!!!!|`|4ncmDzdjaa	because they want to know that they are pretty. they say they aren't fishing for compliments because they want to seem that way but really they have low self esteem issues or something. then they feel that your lying or being rude if you say they are not pretty. its pathetic really if you think about it.  these people don't want to know the truth so they can work at actually making them selves better looking but instead go for the lazy way of just getting people to tell them their pretty when they really are not.|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	i think that they think it's a contest.<br>  they want to compare their selves to others and accuse the people of being "jealous" if they say they're not pretty when they ask for an honest answer.<br>  it makes no sense.<br>  they're just attention wh0res seeking attention online.|`|c0XomxxEaa	this question gets asked as much as the am i pretty questions.. theyll keep on coming as long as people answer them.. and people DO answer them because they enjoy giving there opinion.|`|hJZWo2a8aa	"ppl ask this question as much as the am i pretty question. some ppl just need a confidence boost. they can do whatever they want so shut up"<br>  <br>  <br>  ......has clearly asked this question before.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	theyre looking for re assurance that they are really as hot as their ego says they are. ugh.|`|AA11318212	vanity for one.<br>  or they are sick in the head.<br>  and they are sooo insecure.<br>  if they get negative comments they get back by doing that.<br>  i'd rather they brag about how well they did in school on how they think they are this and that.<br>  show me a miss universe title then am all for it. hahaha.|`|UAvXg0RFaa	most probably it is their thinking. maybe they are expecting a director or something to go looking for peoples photos who are suitable for becoming models!|`|N5LM2wRdaa	Because people get bored with thier lives and feel that there only fun is to harras other people on the internet.|`|4e2gb3BQaa	ppl ask this question as much as the am i pretty question. some ppl just need a confidence boost. they can do whatever they want so shut up|`|xY1QwUQOaa	Because, those people probably have low self esteem or they like the attention.|`|mPmyvqAsaa	cuz they're idiots

Honestly that helps, if you don't trim it at all it will take longer to grow and the split ends will get worse.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	You keep your hair healthy. <br>   - Trim every 4-6 weeks. <br>   - Deep Conditioner every so often, <br>   - Staying away from Chemicals and heat.|`|UPN3zqq6aa	id also like to no this to lol<br>  <br>  x|`|85KrSJh3aa	I wanted to make my hair grow fast last year cause I wanted a longer style, so I looked online for something to help me.

It was the best purchase I ever made. :) Other people have recommended it as well.|`|njWh5Kobaa	There is nothing that you can do that'll make your hair grow amazingly faster.

You'll need a lot a patients!|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Vitamin E, good diet, also try Rosemary or Peppermint oil, they are good for hair growth. You'd also want to get regular trims, condition it, don't comb or brush it too often and remember to never perm or dye your hair since these things cause breakage.|`|avNrwqdzaa	I was going to ask the same question! Lol.<br>  <br>  I just went out and got extensions. But it wasnt like, real hair! Lol. I heard coconut oil helps though. So I have been using that.

QGU7JAIUaa	I think you mean MAC studio sculpt foundation. Ive tried it and i really like it. It gives a really good flawless coverage without looking/feeling masked and cakey. If you buff it into your skin you will get a more matte look and will lose the 'dewy' affect you can acheive. But if you apply it in strokes with the MAC 189, 190 or 191 foundation brush the result will be more dewy. Its ￡22.02 and you can buy it online or at your nearest MAC store/ department store which sells MAC. Heres the link <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/collections/collection.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT19616." rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/...</a> It comes in many shades, and if your new to MAC then i would reccomend you go to your nearest MAC store and have them find the shade nearest to your skintone. On the website you can also find out where your nearest MAC is by clicking on Find stores down the right hand side of the page. x|`|wH9EdF7naa	u mean the mac studio sculpt :)<br>  <br>  its suposed to be awesome and moisturizing, with medium to high coverage. also, u can build the coverage with it. but because its so moisturizing, its not too great for oily skin though. <br>  <br>  besides that, its very different because its like a gel, not like normal liquid foundation.<br>  <br>  hope it helps. there are reviews on it on youtube if u want to find out about it :)|`|WoxAqahAaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

BrIIWg4naa	Your best bet is to go to the salon. If you can't then bleach is going to be the best way to get blonde. Don't listen to people telling you 40 vol developer. It is to high and you could really damage your hair. (It could break off) Don't use higher than 30 vol developer! If you want to be all blonde you will need someone to help you. At the bottom of your head use 20 vol then when you get to the top you could use 30 vol. Make sure to take very small partings and stay off of your roots. Do you roots last! You must work fast as the bleach works very fast. After you are light enough tone with a level 9 or 10 to look natural.  Go to a beauty store not a drug store. Really though you should go to the salon!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Id say use a lot of bleach but then theres the high risk of all your hair falling out cause it will die...maybe go to a local hairdresser , I dont suggest doing it yourself but if you have an qualified friends/family, I've bleached my hair and it all started to come out luckily I stopped...aslo bleaching makes it unhealthy s make sure you give your hair enough proteins and minerals in your shampoo and conditioner...|`|e7a5a3e802c87fca0253811255c9ab2baa	just dye it|`|oKZ3GstXaa	blonde is really hard to do on your own, going to the salon is your best bet, but if you really want to do it your self i would advise you to do highlights with the cap b/c it is bleach and it works good it doesn't make your hair like orange like normal hair dye does.  you can do a lot of hightlights and it will look liek it is fully dyed.|`|qb5LWtpiaa	Oh hun dont go to blonde! Your hair color is just so pretty.. why everyone wants to be a blonde i dont really get.. Its just a hair color, and it isnt even really that great honestly. I am blonde, and im always treated like im stupid when in fact i manage a 3.7 gpa... and they know that too. They also think of you as a slut, so yah you get these guys coming up to you, but do you really want them to think your easy like the way there thinking?

piDDZ6Ywaa	I think lt'd look nice.<br>  <br>  I think an angled cut fringe would look gorgeous!

b1NMh5K2aa	Bare minerals..its the best mineral makeup and is good for your skin|`|8EmeNHyjaa	bareMinerals foundation is the best|`|f2IwWJgaaa	the maybelline liquid mineral foundation!<br>  It's really good and gives u a healthy glow!|`|lyp6JEcEaa	Minerals are good for your skin as they usually do not contain the fillers and harmful chemicals liquid,creams etc do. Liquid foundations are loaded with harmful chemicals including dimethicone which is a silicone based ingredient which puts a film over your skin not allowing it to breathe, this ingredient can break you out, it is also in primers so watch out. A good pure mineral foundation can really be good for your skin as they are anti inflammatory and have natural SPF. I love Faerie Organic Minerals as they are good for your skin and provide a healthy glow. I use their original minerals. You can get a free sample kit to try it first. <a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|UOrZ4or4aa	Powder makes your skin look flaky and comes off easily.<br>  Liquid is good, but it can make your face look wet sometimes.<br>  Mousse - are expensive and only comein small quantitys, they do look nice if applied properly.<br>  I use rimmel Mineral based 16 hour in Ivory.<br>  Its really good and lasts for 16 hours plus I got 30ml for under 5 quid.<br>  Mineral based are better for your skin.|`|ucMoxS4laa	ive been using a mineral foundation and find it makes my skin even worse. i tend to have dry skin and it doesnt matter if i put moisturiser on before the foundation or not... it still makes it worse :/|`|xM50DXFQaa	I would get liquid...free of oils and fragrances, because they are what damage/ irritate your skin!!!  =]  =]<br>  XXX|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	mineral foundation is made of minerals from the earth and doesnt have chemicals that other foundations do. if you want to use liquid you would need to put powder over it anyway to stop it looking oily. if you want to use powder then just simply moisturise before and that will balance it out. anyway mineral foundation should stop your skin problems. xx remember to exfoliate twice a week to get rid of flaky skin xx|`|uXlKzJ0qaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

Wy0lUjP9aa	Get more sleep<br>  Drink your 8 to 10 glasses of water daily<br>  Grind up cucumbers/potatoes and place in a pantyhose and place under eyes for 10 minutes. Do not get in eyes. Wash off.<br>  Take a multivitamin|`|YnlplIOOaa	Well cucumber juice is meant to help get rid of dark circles.. and I'm sure there's plenty of creams you can look up :)|`|e7a5a3e802c87fca0253811255c9ab2baa	try taking sleeping pills so u can sleep in the nigt at probab the circles will go away|`|hVVoyDEvaa	Make a topical treatment using natural remedies. Combine tomato and lemon juice together. Dip a cotton ball into the mixture and gently dab it under your eyes. Do this two times a day to gradually fade dark circles. Another home remedy you can try is to place used tea bags under your eyes. This will help reduce the appearance of dark circles and it will soothe your eyes.<br>  <br>  Place something cold on top of your eyes. This will help ease the puffiness and soothe your eyes. You can use slices of potatoes, or cucumbers. Lie down and let them stay on your eyes for about 15 minutes. You can get the same benefits by splashing your eyes with cold water or by putting a cold spoon against them. The cold will help prevent wrinkles and dark circles.<br>  <br>  This is how to get rid of dark circles under eyes through diet. Eat fruits and vegetables that contain beta carotene, which is good for the eyes. This includes, spinach, carrots, papaya, and mango. Prevent dark circles from the inside out by drinking a combination drink made from lemon juice, salt, tomato juice, and mint leaves.<br>  <br>  Get enough sleep. This can prevent the formation of dark circles, puffiness, and sagging. It will also keep your blood circulating, which will help give you a fresh faced look. Sleep with your head raised just a little. If you sleep with your head facing downward, your fluids can settle around your eyes and cause puffiness.<br>  <br>  Don't rub your eyes. This can break the blood vessels under your eyes. Broken blood vessels can bruise and cause dark circles to appear.<br>  <br>  Wear sunglasses whenever you are out in the sun. This will protect the area around your eyes from discoloration and protect them from the sun's harmful rays.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Those dark shades under your eyes are due to lack of sleep.  As much as possible go to bed earlier, say 8PM or 9PM.  So that you can catch up with your sleepless nights.  I hope that you only lack sleep for  those dark shades also serve as indicator of having liver problem.  Kindly drink lukewarm water before you go to bed to help your blood circulation.<br>  Take care and GOD BLESS!
YMBB6q5Vaa	try hair relaxer, im a guy and have really curly hair and used it and it worked. you can buy it at any store that sells hair stuff|`|u18GBKmiaa	you can have your hair chemical relaxed at afro carribean hairdressers or simply straighten your hair|`|A6CuFmBtaa	GHD's???xxx|`|MFMaX2b1aa	Are you serious?! <br>  I've got wavy, (but straighten it) black hair. The only thing in the world that I'd want, is to have curly hair like a darker person.<br>  You know why? Because sure, you can get a perm done at your local hairdresser, but it's not the same as others who are born naturally with it.<br>  <br>  - You can get your hair permantly straightened at your local hairdresser, buy a hair iron, use straightening shampoo and conditioner, etc etc.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, you have to accept what you're given. Whether you have curly hair, straight hair, wavy hair, we all have to accept that.<br>  Your damn lucky to have beautiful curls, that's what I want!|`|U6rwwmTUaa	i dont no why you would want to do soemthing stupid like that you need to accept your self the way you its a lot of people who wants black hair but cant get it no matter how hard they try.... but if you much buy a relaxer leave it in for aboiuta 10 minutes the rinse it out the loner you leave it in the the straigher your hair will become but dont burn your head off lolz
CFFxtileaa	When you are painting your nails with whatever colour, (Its hard to explain) but instead of painting the whole nail, dont paint the edges.. So paint up the middle, so just stroke the brush upwards from the cuticle to the tip of the nail a few times, don't make an effort to do the sides, its really hard to explain but the effect when its done is so good, it makes your nails look much longer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|2R8P2nj1aa	paint them completely white, then dab black lines on them..<br>  <br>  haha jk i really couldn't say, i don't wear makeup or nail polish..|`|Ol8LNgxCaa	get fake nails? they can look really well.<br>  <br>  u can do them ur self at home. my friend does it and they look great|`|0WKkXIyKaa	eat cheese.<br>  <br>  I remember when i ate cheese nearly everyday, i used to bite my nails, and everyday when i woke up there was nail there! so if you eat lots of cheese etc they will grow longer naturally.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	2 words - french tip.<br>  <br>  In regards to the answer below me - Cheese is packed full of calcium. Any calcium intake will help to grow out your nails. Your nails are bone, calcium strengthens bone.<br>  So if you'd like to grow strong, healthy nails that grow quickly, eat dairy.

Yet. 2 years ago I did obtain kajal .. had burning sensation, never used it again .. no problems fromt then on.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	No, not necessarily.<br>  However, when removing the mascara, chances are if you do it wrong, you'll pull out lashes.<br>  <br>  Use a very wet cotton pad with makeup remover and gently stroke downwards to remove the mascara. Don't stroke side to side or you'll end up ripping the lashes out.<br>  <br>  The more moist the cotton pad, the easier the mascara will come off. If the cotton pad is dry, the dry mascara will catch onto the fibers and it will pull your lashes.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Not as long as you don't beat the hell out of your lashes to remove it. As long as you wash it off with a good makeup remover and water, your eyes will be just fine.|`|sLBl6SLhaa	I AM SORRY.<br>  AGAIN, LACK OF EXPERIENCE|`|eWm0i2luaa	No. but be careful while removing it|`|cV88vG4Xaa	i don't think using mascara should be much of a problem.<br>  <br>  just note that when you're removing the eye makeup, be sure to be gentle because the eye area is really sensitive, so if you're rough on it, you're more prone to getting wrinkles around the eye area later on.|`|HvbIE03saa	Shouldn't be a problem, as long as you remove it properly and your mascara doesn't go bad.<br>  <br>  If mascara is kept for too long you CAN have health issues, so you should replace it every three months or so.

There are also masks and serums available that do the same thing but are probably a bit more expensive.<br>  <br>  You could always stop in at a store like The Body Shop or Lush and get a consultation on what would be best for your skin type.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR ENLARGED PORES:<br>  <br>  Microdermabrasion is a non-chemical procedure designed to exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin by using a tool that sprays tiny microcrystal particles on the skin. Microdermabrasion is an ideal procedure for shrinking enlarged pores в?“ it lessens the appearance of pores by roughening up the skin, loosening the dead skin cells that clog the pores. Microdermabrasion performed by a professional can stimulate collagen production which is essential for healthy-looking skin. The treatment removes the upper layer of the skin and reduces not only the size of the pores, but also wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, acne scars, blemishes. In most cases 2/ 3 treatments are enough to minimize the appearance of large pores.<br>  <br>  Chemical peels are also effective for reducing the size, look and appearance of large pores. Chemical peel with Trichloreacetic acid (TCA) is the most appropriate peel for enlarged pores as the acid penetrates more deeply into the skin and removes the damaged layers of the skin, allowing new cells to form.<br>  <br>  Laser resurfacing is another procedure that is effective in treating enlarged pores. Laser resurfacing treatment treats not only large pores but also wrinkles, discolorations caused by sun damage, post-acne scars and the best thing is that it boost collagen production which is essential for the skinв??s elasticity and healthy look. The procedure tones, lifts and tightens skin on the face and stimulates long-term collagen and elastin rebuilding.<br>  <br>  Chemical peels, Microdermabrasion, laser resurfacing all work to reduce the appearance not only of large pores, but also improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, brown spots, age spots, scars, discolorations and other imperfections.<br>  <br>  Deep pore cleansing treatment в?“ the facial includes exfoliating, toning, cleansing, moisturizing, extractions. Itв??s the best treatment for large pores caused by puberty as it balances oil (sebum) production, removes congestion and encourages healthy new cells to form. Deep pore cleansing should be performed by a beautician or by a dermatologist to achieve best results.<br>  <br>  Topical vitamin A treatments <br>  These include: Retin A, Renova, Avage, Tretinoin. Vitamin A is believed to help minimize poresв?? size. They all unclog pores by loosening blackheads and speeding up cell turnover.<br>  <br>  Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Acids <br>  AHAs and BHAs are effective in preventing enlargement of the pores as they exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. Both AHAs and BHAs stimulate the production of collagen and elastin and provide smoother, brighter-looking skin. Common use AHAs in products treating large pores are: Glycolic Acid, Citric Acid, Salicylic Acid, Malic Acid.<br>  <br>  AT HOME TREATMENTS FOR LARGE PORES:<br>  <br>  Exfoliation <br>  Exoliation is essential for keeping your skin clean and to prevent enlargement of facial pores. Use a mild exfoliator to remove the dead skin cells twice a week, but make sure itв??s appropriate for your skin type. Another alternative for at-home exfoliation are the Microdermabrasion kits such as: Lв??Oreal Dermo-Expertise Microdermabrasion Kit ($23), SPA Sciences Acne Microdermabrasion Kit ($50), Vita K Solution Microdermabrasion Kit ($20), Nivea Visage Micro-Dermabrasion Kit Q 10 Gentle SPA ($20).

Honestly, I've stopped wearing alot of make up recently and I've seen AMAZING results.. You really do get less spots.<br>  Use spot prevention moisturiser or something, (I always use the clean & clear bran) Works ace for me!<br>  Then finally, make sure you drink LOTS of water and get enough sleep and dont stress yourself out about anything to prevent getting spots.<br>  If you ever do get spots, try using Sudocrem.

2dvxfGM3aa	Well, my sister dresses like a boy allot of the time and she gets in trouble, its a weird situation but I totally understand where your coming from :)|`|uBBidRtwaa	Well, with Tomboys its not like they're trying to be a boy, they're just interested in some things that could be perceived masculine and may dress a bit like a boy, but it doesn't mean they want to be a boy or will be a tomboy for all of their life, with males that dress up in girls clothes and makeup, its a bit bazaar because no-ones used to seeing this and usually you won't grow out of wanting to dress up as a girl.So basically my point is, it all leads to sexuality, people have seen tomboys before and are used to them, which means they know and understand that this doesn't necessarily mean they want to be a boy or are lesbian, but with a cross dresser, no-one really understands them and most cross dressers are homosexual, so that's why they're given grief because its a bit odd to see a man dressed as a woman, and try to look petite with a male fame, where as with tomboys they usually still keep some femininity, such as their hair and of course their breasts.I hope i've helped you understand better.|`|vO4sRgonaa	i use to be a tomboy when i was younger and i got tons of looks....im not gonna lie now when i see a guy wearing tighter jeans than me(the point where it looks like he had a vagina) i cant help but look lol!!|`|441GSyaMaa	Well not really, tomboys are only accepted in minority, to my experience. They get talked about and picked on, if it was at school especially, for being like that... and same goes for being, in essence, a cross dresser lol...<br>  <br>  I can see that tomboys *can* be accepted more than a guy wearing girls clothes, but that's because it's different... most guy clothes are pretty much unisex - whereas girls clothes are designed more specifically....|`|OVZgQOkyaa	i WAS a tomboy but like bein a girl girl much better b4 i didnt have a bf and when i turned to a gg i got 1 straight up and there is a goth guy at skool who is skinny and wears eyeliner and has eye the COLOUR not shape COLOUR of a cat, yellow, and their not contacts!!!!! but all the girls xcept me and taylah have a HUGE crush on him were all like wtf i didnt no all the girls at skool are gay cuz "it" must be a girl... but most girl like him so i dunno<br>  <br>  with girls they go girly till 10 then they turn to a tomboy then like me hit 12 and relize they made the biggest mistake of their life so they go back to being a NORMAL teenage girl|`|aWWgPkryaa	I'm not so sure about your theory..I was a 'tomboy' and got quite a bit of grief for it at times!  <br>  <br>  (perhaps I couldn't quite pull off the look!)<br>  <br>  Just look to Eddie Izzard for inspiration, he manages to pull it off, perhaps you could find out how he found the confidence to pull it off?|`|B0dX0GCiaa	because a man walking down the street with lip stick and high heels with hairy legs and a beard is going to get a few odd looks|`|Qmmb9NXCaa	either way they consider you in the LGBT club...so does it really matter??

8d68a003da01c4ae915afd4904337634aa	If it's been a while since you've worn earrings they might have closed up, in that case you're pretty much screwed.<br>  <br>  What I usually do when I have trouble, I pull the ear a little to make the hole stretch a little in a weird direction, then try, that way the earring has a better chance of going in.|`|eIXKLUjZaa	It depends on whether your ear is infected or you have just grown a small amount of skin over the back.To get the earring back in its always best to do something like take a shower or sit in a sauna to loosen up the lobe, make sure to CLEAN your earring before putting it in! you can do that by just leaving it in a container of alcohol. It shouldn't be a big deal to push it through the extra layer of skin its just a deep breath in and a firm pop. Sounds gross but it will only hurt for a second. <br>  BUT If its infected you need to get an ear solution like H2o or simple contact cleaner will do. DONT USE hydrogen peroxide. it will only dry things out... continue to clean the area for a couple days till you see improvments DONT TOUCH IT WITH YOUR DIRTY HANDS! WASH them before handling it.<br>  before long you should be able to just pop it through even if its still  a little sore. If not. go get it peirced again, the hole has filled in.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	well I have the same situation what i do is push it in to the hole slowly and gently as possible.<br>  <br>  it works try it.|`|b61a4a73c3211f821b8171010cdf26c1aa	Get some antiseptic spray or cream and fiddle with it till it goes in. Leave them in for a few days till they stretch but keep using the antiseptic to stop infection. If you dont ware ear rings all the time they will tighten up.|`|4IC78le4aa	Try using the fine silver hooks. They are very thin and the easiest to get into pierced ears. You can try using sleepers and force them through PROVIDED you steralise them first so you dont get infection but your ears will get sore doing this.<br>  <br>  Some people are better healers than others and the holes close up very easily. This may be your problem. Stick with the hook earrings. They are kinder to sensitive ears.|`|VlUF8PmIaa	how long have you had them in ????How long have you have them pierced???<br>   well... if it was very soon....... clean them now ... find some real gold...or real silver earrings... and work them in... it may be hard @ 1st but it will be easier... so stick em into your ear... then after you kind-of got them in work them around.. until you found the hole.....if that doesn't work . turn your ear lobe around until you have it in..... or if they have been in for a long time they may be closed.|`|LNEugWlLaa	I have a wonky earpierce and i htink wetting both your ear and the earing and then just pushing slowly helps .<br>  <br>  Try it it should help<br>  <br>  Amzziiee xx|`|brJ063txaa	do u want money? then register to this site and make money online!! the easiest way to make money!!<br>  <a href="http://www.clickmybux.com/?r=tnvrstar" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickmybux.com/?r=tnvrstar</a>

hVVoyDEvaa	Place 1/4 cup of all natural unflavored yogurt in a blender. Yogurt contains natural antifungal and antibacterial agents, which help to clean the skin gently, ridding it of harmful bacteria and germs. Yogurt is also high in lactic acid, which is known to soothe and soften dry painful skin, and can help eliminate wrinkles and refine pores.<br>  <br>  Cut a banana in half, remove the peel and add it to the blender. Skin has a natural layer of fat that shields it from the elements and holds in moisture. Constant exposure to make-up, sun, wind, air conditioning and heating can damage its protective layer. Banana is a natural gentle moisturizer that helps to rebuild and protect the protective layer while repairing damaged skin.<br>  <br>  Add 3 tbsp. of oatmeal to the blender. Adding oatmeal will create a natural exfoliant and can help soothe dry, itchy skin. Perfect for those who suffer from eczema, sensitive skin or if you happen to have the chicken pox, oatmeal is hypoallergenic with high levels of healing amino acid. Oatmeal will remove dead skin cells and dirt, helping with acne as well.<br>  <br>  Pour in 2 tbsp. of almond oil. Almond oil is the ideal skin care oil, as it absorbs quickly into the skin without a greasy build up. Almond oil can reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and soothes painful cracking and burns on the skin.<br>  <br>  Blend the ingredients well and gently massage into your face and neck. For added benefit, allow the gentle facial cleanser to set for 10 minutes before rinsing with cool water and patting dry.|`|Zl6BTG30aa	Make a puree of 1 banana and 1 papaya, peach or avacado. Apply to skin.  Leave on for at least 20 minutes then rinse with warm water, followed by a moisturizer of natural margarine or natural vegetable oil. <br>   Apply natural mayonnaise, either homemade or from natural foods store. massage into skin, leave on for 15-20 minutes, rinse thoroughly with warm water Grate the rind of one whole lemon into 4 tablespoons plain yogurt. Mix and rub over entire body concentrating on the driest patches. Rinse.|`|l0xbmgE4aa	You can use regular soap? That's what I do when I run out :P Just make sure that you have a really good moisturizer (I use one that I can put under my Make-Up) Nivea is really really good :)<br>  hope I helped :)|`|qnXb2O49aa	get some water and wash your face..or shampoo.that will make your face smell good..|`|BzUMSGgwaa	butter, mayonnaise + Lemon juice is good x|`|lyp6JEcEaa	Please don't use the advice of soap or butter. The easiest good for your skin facial cleanser is olive oil. Olive oil is amazing for the skin and many celebrities do not use the high end skin care that they endorse they use Extra virgin olive oil. It cleanses the skin and moisturizes at the same time. I guarantee you it is 100% better for your skin and overall health than commercial brands of cleansers.
AA11318212	runway models are like human hangers.<br>  seriously.|`|wSKLLtryaa	because clothes generally look better on skinny woman than on average/fat woman.  And the designer wants their clothes to look the best they can.  Think of it like this -- does a plain white tee look better on a thin woman, or a fat woman? -- of course the thin woman is going to make that t shirt look much better than the fat woman.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	i think because the clothes look more apealing on them... also because designers make those as samples so they will fit the models size i bet they dont even make real clothes that small but yeah, i think its because of how they look in the designs.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	so the clothes just hang on them and people look at the clothes rather than the models bodies.|`|85KL0eUUaa	Clothes look better on thin people<br>  They don't really have curves or rolls to get in the way of the clothes<br>  and the target demographic of the fashion designers are upper class, or upper middle class people, and a majority of the females who fit that demographic are slim<br>  how many average joe-ette women that you know have 15 D&G bags and wear chanel couture around the house every day?|`|A6dpeGUtaa	Because modeling industries have a very skewed definition of "Beauty". Nobody wants to see a broom (aka a very skinny and tall woman) walking down with some clothing on her. That isn't attractive... at all. Gross.|`|BN3H90uYaa	Clothes look better on a thin frame, is what they say, but mostly they're cheap and don't want to use alot of fabric on bigger models.|`|wjkTzT2jaa	<a href="http://answersall.yim.cn" rel="nofollow">http://answersall.yim.cn</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|JvH0rk47aa	because they think men like skinny woman<br>  and its probably cheaper because you don't have to use so much material! :L|`|TYnU6muyaa	cause fat girls put too much stress on the catwalk and all the dead skin ruins the new clothes.|`|tlj3c50Haa	I've been told it's so the clothes hang better. But I'm probably wrong.|`|Y0O6971laa	It's just the look they go for.  They want something that stnds out- and skinny people do.  The clothing does hang better, like if you used an obese person then it would be hard to make them hang the right way.<br>  <br>  The thiness also makes your cheekbones stand out quite a bit.  Fashion runways are all about the extremes.  Extreme clothes and extreme people.  It just happens skinny works better.
2n0vR0OMaa	You have a gorgeous figure, I would pick as hourglass as curves in the right places, slim waist. Shoulders I do not think are overly broad.

(same here!) It's not 100% defined, but you can accentuate it with a cinched in waist on tops or dresses. Some jackets even have a cinched in waist.  Belts also help. Do you have broad shoulders....only a little. But it's not a big deal. I think you weigh...112??? I'm really not sure. Since you don't know what your measurements are, you should buy a fabric tape measure. Actually I have one on the desk right now! I had to know my measurements for Juicy!!! lol! :)|`|xrf7ScCTaa	I think apple body type, and you look pretty slim|`|OWWNnHmwaa	Id say ur like a ruler xD you look pretty thin and yeah i guess Petite even tho your so tall|`|A6dpeGUtaa	You're too tall for a girl|`|RyYV3aXlaa	perfect.a+|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	sweet.

bru2xnlRaa	If you want to make a lot, you should buy in bulk.<br>  I would google " bead supply " and try to find a website that sells what you are looking for.|`|nJqMfR4baa	Some bead stores sell religious medals and crosses. I have bought them for bracelets and necklaces I made. There is no certain bead required for rosaries. You can use whatever you want. The requirement is that you make the rosary with the beads set in the decades order for the prayers. Rosaries are made of plastic, glass, and wood beads, even tied string knot beads. <br>  If you do not find what you are looking for at your local bead store, try look online under rosary supplies or similar topic.|`|lFVfKxBVaa	I would suggest going into a local gem and beading store. You can choose beads that call your attention to you for whatever reason. If you like you can look up the meanings of gems and other materials used for beading to create the perfect rosary for yourself.<br>  <br>  Beading stores carry tons of charms and focal pieces you can use for motivation, serenity, divinity, or whatever you want from your rosary. <br>  <br>  I was considering making my own prayer rosary but I can't afford the cost to make it.

HvbIE03saa	Is your hair naturally dark or did you dye it that way?<br>  <br>  I'd say no matter what you do, go to a professional to get it lightened because the chemicals involved could be very hazardous, not to mention a lot of them aren't available "over the counter" per say and are only available to licensed salons and stylists.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go to a professional you can just take a jug of bleach and soak your hair in it, but you risk your hair getting fried, falling out, or just turning a nasty shade of orange (a bad side effect of cheap lightening). <br>  <br>  A lot of guys I know really like girls with dark hair and a fair complexion...I mean, look at Anne Hathaway.|`|vO4sRgonaa	oh boy i've been in your position....the only way its going to come out the best is if you bleach your hair, you cant buy it at a salon but you should be able to buy it at a beauty supply store.... for the gloves and everything it would prolly cost you no more than $25.00-$30.00....no you cant buy a chemical that fades the black at a local drug store, and dandruff shampoo does nothing....if you are freaking out and want to do something about it now you can go to your local store and buy some bleach blonde hair dye(make sure it doesnt say gold blonde) and dye your hair and it will come out reddish orangey blondish....then if you do it one more time it should turn your hair completely blonde....thats what i did and i learned to never dye my hair black again lol....hope i helped and good luck!!!!|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Okay...You should go to a hairstylist. Not doing it yourself. Black hair is HELL to get out of your hair. Shampoo like Head and shoulders don't work well on dark hair. You can probley buy a hair stripper at a drug store, But not at the Salon(Unless you get it done at a salon, Which I REALLY Recommend.). Bleach is like a stripper, and you can get it at a drug store or a beauty supply(actually, You may be able to get a hair stripper at the supply store too.). But like I said, Black hair is HELL to get out of your hair, and you should really get it done by someone who knows what to do.|`|7KvzDwwXaa	You will have to go to ur hairdresser and she will struo out the black it will take upto 5 hours. This will then make ur hair go orangey but then u will have to have another strip because it takes alot to lift up the black. So i think you should go to ur hairdresser it will cost around ￡40.<br>  <br>  Good luck babes xx|`|ufB5TYYfaa	You can go to the hair dressers and have it stripped to your natural hair colour, i don't know how much it is but my friend is having it done (:|`|FSQHBnVZaa	stripping hair should only be done in a salon. your best bet as a far as shampoo, is shampoo for oily hair.do two soapings  and it will strip color slightly over time

H6AThdgWaa	Hi nice bags.<br>  You know, its very hard to choose if you want both two bags. Well, for me I like them both. But I want you to help in deciding which is the best one for you. In choosing the right bag for you, consider which is your favorite color and consider also the design that fits into your age. If you are in the younger age or teens, its better to choose the pink one because the design is for a young lady girl like you. But if your age are in 20 and above, the black bag is much appropriate for you.|`|AcsML4Leaa	they're both nice, but i prefer the first one :]|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	definitely the pink one that says converse!<br>  I love converse!|`|AkuUGjoHaa	They are both really boring.

Maybe.<br>  Haha.<br>  x|`|aWWgPkryaa	The pink one is very nice, I think the other one looks a bit cheap looking to be honest, the pink one looks like it could be 'worn' wit more outfits and taken to more places.  You could wear it with jeans or with a summer skirt or something similar.|`|19pBM4GSaa	first is a little in ur face, and a bit more for a younger person  i love the second bag, nice and girly but a lot more stylish,|`|0J2l2rzbaa	hm, well it depends what you are going to use it for! <br>  but i think that the pink one is the best, but i als do like the black. <br>  but its up to you us you will be the one using it!|`|gxjAt77Jaa	both are not very cute, i think you can take a look other websites to find better bags, such as eshopintuition.com, ebay.com, amazon.com|`|rY75BRp1aa	Heyy, the bags are very cute, i really liked them, and its hard to choose but i say go for the first one!!! =)|`|b1NMh5K2aa	I like the first one its a really nice pink and converse is a good brand....The second one is ok but not as nice :)|`|aLZoP73Laa	Definitely the pink.<br>  <br>  It is much hotter!|`|Ju5sEcblaa	i want the pink one!!!!and i think guys in ur school will totally love u...your bag adds a pretty points to the boys.|`|qeSXDEMZaa	I like the top converse one better because it has more style to it than the other one. Also when you have a solid color, it is easier for it to go with the majority of your clothes than the multicolored top one, that way you get more use out of it. Hope this helps!|`|HB05C1Hnaa	They are both nice. My fave is the second one (black) it is very trendy looking. I also think more people will own the first one, so if you want to be unique then go for the second.|`|2dvxfGM3aa	They are both so cute!  I say try the first one, it might go with more clothing.  The other bag looks a little kidish to me, but thats just me......|`|2a772a459dcb7a2056cdc66bcb2c000baa	I think the second one is nice and will go with every thing.|`|l8Ljx06aaa	I'd go the pink converse bag..|`|bIfYegEEaa	I'd definitely say the first one :)|`|RIFFYY2qaa	pink converse one is nice.|`|0Z1vVzfVaa	I would see the first one as the second looks kinda emo n pink is cute! x|`|XBSkAhWsaa	i dont see much difference!!|`|gKAYQpNUaa	i like the first one :)
Fn2yHdtdaa	Neutrogena, no oil, grapefruit cleanser and grapefruit scrub.<br>  <br>  ^ Best 2 things that ever happened to me. (:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, whether you think so or not, one reason people with oily skin continue to have oily skin is because they touch they're face alot. Trust me, I had oily skin. Just keep your hands off of your face, and splash your face after sports or getting sweaty to get the oils and salt off.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! Best answer? (:|`|9lL6njWAaa	Wash your face with soap and hot water every morning|`|6jXuUCdraa	oily skin is pretty easy to tackle if you know what your doing. <br>  the number one thing you absolutly need is oil wipes, which remove all oils throughout the day. always use a GEL cleanser and a toner, morning and night. heres some stuff i found on the internet that i thought would help you out: <br>  <br>  The great advantage of oily skin is that it ages at a slower rate than other skin types.  <br>  Oily skin needs special cleansing with plenty of hot water and soap to prevent the pores from being clogged. Avoid harsh products that strip your skin of oil and encourage flakiness. They can cause a reaction known as reactive seborrhoea, where the oil glands work overtime to compensate for the loss of natural oils.<br>  <br>  Avoid skincare products that leave your skin feeling taut and dehydrated. They cause the upper layers of the skin to shrink. This restricts oil flow through the pores leading to blockages and breakouts. <br>  <br>  To cleanse oily skin, use oil-based products as they dissolve sebum effectively. Opt for oil-free moisturizers to maintain a shine-free complexion.<br>  <br>  Keep your skin very clean. Limit washing your face to two or three times a day. Too much washing will stimulate your skin to produce more oil.<br>  <br>  Choose your cleanser with care. Avoid heavy cleansing creams. Avoid the use of harsh soaps or cleansers. Use a pure soap with no artificial additives. Try an antibacterial cleansing lotion or a lightly medicated soap, and use it in combination with a water rich in minerals, not tap water. Do not use cleansers or lotions that contain alcohol. After cleansing, apply a natural oil-free moisturizer to keep the skin supple.<br>  <br>  Use hot water when washing your face. Hot water dissolves skin oil better than lukewarm or cold water.<br>  <br>  If your skin is extremely oily, three or four daily cleansings may be in order and little or no moisturizing necessary before you are 30 years old. After that point, the skin around your eyes and mouth and on your throat may benefit from a nightly moisturizing, plus a mere touch of moisturizer in the morning. <br>  <br>  When cleansing, massage your face well with your fingertips, using an upward and outward motion. Be careful not to rub soap into the skin; it can clog pores.<br>  <br>  If your oily skin is scaly, you can often correct the problem by using a deep-cleaning exfoliant on alternate nights, and following the treatment with a light coating of moisturizer.<br>  <br>  Try using a clay or mud mask. If you have sensitive skin, use white or rose-colored clays.<br>  <br>  Use a light antiseptic night cream from time to time if you wish, and apply a clarifying mask one or two times a week.<br>  <br>  Choose cosmetic and facial care products specifically designed for oily skin.<br>  <br>  Before applying makeup, use an antiseptic day cream with active ingredients that diminish sebaceous secretions. Look for benzyl peroxide in the list of active ingredients.<br>  <br>  Use a light antiseptic night cream from time to time if you wish, and apply a clarifying mask one or two times a week. <br>  <br>  Natural Skincare<br>  <br>  Half an hour before taking your bath apply on your face half teaspoon each of lime and cucumber juice mixed together. <br>  <br>  If your skin is excessively oily, mix in a few drops of eau de cologne. This not only helps keep oiliness away but also helps in refining the pores of the skin by acting as astringent, thereby preventing acne. <br>  <br>  To prevent the problem of your makeup becoming patchy either on the forehead, chin or nose due to excessive oiliness in these areas, apply a little cucumber juice on the excessively oily parts of your face, dry thoroughly and then apply your makeup. <br>  <br>  If your whole face turns patchy after makeup is applied on it, then apply equal parts of lime juice and witch-hazel. Dry well before putting on your makeup.<br>  <br>  Choose an astringent that contains acetone, which is known for dissolving oil. Strong astringents will do more harm than good, stimulating an overproduction of oil. <br>  <br>  To clear away excess oil, use a clay or mud mask. Blend together well 1 teaspoon green clay powder and 1 teaspoon raw honey. Apply the mixture to your face, avoiding the eye area. Leave it on for fifteen minutes, then rinse well with lukewarm water. Do this at least three times a week--or more.<br>  <br>  Once or twice daily, mix equal parts of lemon juice and water together. Pat mixture on your face and allow it to dry, then rinse with warm water. Follow with a cool-water rinse.|`|Hb1CtqUKaa	see a dermatologist, they can get you specially formulated stuff that will work really well

TcBH8MZJaa	My first suggestion is to stop using as much heat and dye on it, or none at all if you can. Not only will you find you have less split ends appearing, your hair will also grow faster (because you wont have to trim away split ends as often).<br>  <br>  Another suggestion to repair condition is, once a week use a deep conditioning treatment. Trésemme do a great one but I cant remember the name..its in a pot with a black lid I think. You could also try some hot oil treatments, v05 sell them in a pack of four, and they arent too pricey<br>  <br>  As for growing, thats all about patience. You really cant take any miracle pills/use any kind of specalist shampoo that will make it grow superfast over night. I suggest eating a good, balanced diet high in protein and your fruits and veggies and that should improve the condition and growth rate of your hair. You could also try taking some vitamin supplements.<br>  <br>  Until it grows long and lovely, you could always try clip in hair extensions to get you by, if you wanted.<br>  <br>  Goodluck :-)|`|m1QQwnSdaa	hm...im not sure|`|uLi0emWTaa	hi I have the same problem. But now i always were my hair extensions.You can buy ones were you can remove and replace when you like .If you buy real hair ones you can straighten or curl them it works a trick for me.|`|7PyGI4ewaa	if you want longer hair just leave it lol its grow.<br>  get the split ends cut off and the new hair will grow.<br>  its hard growing long hair, i would know. i had short hair for 16 years till i decided to get dreadlocks. im shoulder length now.|`|v4K8A47faa	First of all, curly blonde hair is beautiful, not the straight ones. You should embrace the beauty of your hair, treat it well, if your hair is dry, wash it with a conditioner look:<a href="http://hair-care.suite101.com/article.cfm/conditioner_only_hair_washing" rel="nofollow">http://hair-care.suite101.com/article.cf...</a><br>  trimming is very important also, maybe a 1/2 inch every 2 months or so and absolute NO FLAT IRON.<br>  I am having there same problem and in order to place my hair nicely without flat iron, I twist it on the back and I leave it until is completely dry for a day...sleep with it on a twist and when down, place some kerastase serum.<br>  I hope it helps.
cV88vG4Xaa	you should actually be putting on moisturizer daily, whether it's dry or not.|`|wIoG2KV2aa	ALWAYS use an oil-free moisturizer (summer, winter, spring and fall!) No matter if it is dry. It will keep your skin in prime condition with fewer lines and breakouts (due to dryness... some that you cannot even see). Cetophil moisturizer is GREAT moisturizer (under $10 at walmart/target).|`|GOsRusM9aa	You should always use moisturizer on your face after washing your face! ALWAYS! Especially during the winter. And neutrogena seems to have decent moisturizers,too.|`|HvbIE03saa	Ummm...it depends on whether you have sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  Moisturizer is always good when your skin gets dry. Oil free is good if you typically have oily skin too. You can buy some and try it out...if it's not enough, get something a little stronger (ie: something NOT for sensitive skin).|`|XYT7jvBdaa	You should be using a moisturizer year-round, whether it's dry, oily or something in between. It's a staple to good skin care.|`|jfaP8waJaa	Putting a light moisturiser on your face daily is good x|`|A6CuFmBtaa	Is this a joke lol... always moisturize.<br>  Especially before applying foundation just make sure it is not a thick one.xxx|`|bIfYegEEaa	if your skin is oily - then go with the oil-free. I'd personally use a hydrating skin cream, such as simple. Moisturizing is a really important step in your daily beauty routine! :)|`|6031hAU3aa	well you have to check it first if its allowed for the skin
HvbIE03saa	It depends no what kind of die you got. Some wash out after a few washes, some are semi-permanent, and some are permanent (takes longer to come out). <br>  <br>  Since it's just the box kind from walmart and not something more intense like at a hairdresser, just go get another box and fix it. Your hair will be fine.|`|Q6usQV1zaa	IF ITS A PERMANENT COLOR IS GOING TO STAY! COLORED IT AGAIN TO YOUR NATURAL COLOR! NORMALLY YOU CAN COLORED IT AFTER 3 WEEKS SOME PEOPLE LEAVE IT 3 MONTHS BUT  WHEN YOUR ROOTS GROWING YOU SHOULD DO IT!|`|MFMaX2b1aa	Give it a week or two, to allow your hair to go through the healing process.<br>  What color do you want to go? If it's lighter, I'd highly suggest going to a hairdresser. Going lighter may cause some difficulties at home; such as going from a pale strawberry blonde, to a bright orange color.<br>  (If you insist on staying home - then use bleach, from your local drugstore).<br>  <br>  If it's a darker color, then that's okay. Just make sure that you leave your hair to heal for a week or so, otherwise you may end up with some funky colors and very damaged hair.|`|ZXzDD6hoaa	YOU JUST DIED YOUR HAIR?! OMG! I AM SO SORRY! I KNOW YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS... WHAT A LOSS!

v4G722Uuaa	if you have long hair then you could just comb it out and put a barret in the side for an easy one.if you have really short hair you could put in ponytails on both sides (by the way you could do this for both long and short)|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I come fix|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Wash it|`|0iX8HUVhaa	STEPS<br>  <br>  <br>  Styling and Care<br>   To get more shine, volume, and bounce in your hair, use hair creams, olive oil, or (this really works!) mayo and an egg. Massage on head focusing on roots and ends. Wait for 2-3 hours, go into shower but do not use shampoo or conditioner. Rinse hair. The next day, thoroughly wash all oil out of hair, then style as usual. Your hair will be glossier. Do this treatment 1-2 times a week and voila, fabulous, gorgeous hair.<br>  Use heat activated stylers after applying heat protection. If you use curling irons, hot rollers, straighteners, or something like that, try not to use it often. Or, even better, don't use it at all! Heat can fry and damage your hair.<br>  Styling products can dry your scalp if you use it directly at the scalp. Try not to use it often, but if you must, apply to hair strands and not the scalp.<br>  Have a haircut every six to eight weeks. This will remove split ends and learn how to prevent split ends.<br>  Style your hair at most four times a week to avoid damaging it. A simple braid or an elegant one can be worn on days when you don't want to or shouldn't style your hair. It is easiest to add gel or mousse to curly hair when it is wet, instead of laboriously straightening it with a flat iron. Wavy hair can go either way and straight hair is low maintenance.<br>  Wear hair accessories. Clips or barrettes can compliment beautiful hair. Coordinate them with your outfits or your personality.<br>  Hair ties: No rubber bands or elastics. They cause tangles and knots. Use fabric coated elastics.<br>  Protect your hair: When you expose your hair to the sun it sucks even the healthiest hair's moisture out and keeps it looking dull. Instead, wear a hat to cover your hair or even a cap or a scarf is a good idea. If covering your hair isn't your style, try tying it up in a knot, bun or braid, while out in the sun. An alternative, is to "feed" your hair when out in the sunshine - find a moisturizing sun screen that you like to apply to your skin, and put some in your hair when you go hiking! The sun protective factor (SPF) will protect your hair from being sunburnt, just like it does your skin! And depending on the emollients in it, can actually help your hair get a nice "hot oil treatment," too<br>  <br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>  <br>  Invest in good styling products and supplies.<br>  Organic shampoos are good to use- they are usually gentler and healthier for your hair.<br>  Thoroughly wash hair after swimming to get rid of chlorine.<br>  The best shampoos are ones you have tried and make your hair look good. Buy shampoo designed for your hair type and needs. If you are willingly to spend extra money, go to a salon, talk to a hairdresser about recommended shampoos and conditioners, and purchase one.<br>  You can usually tell when it's time to wash your hair, because it will start getting oily at the roots. If you wash it too often, it causes frizz. If you don't wash it often enough, that causes dandruff.<br>  Do not overuse shine products to control frizzes -- they often contain silicone that can coat your hair after just a few applications and can prove harmful.<br>  To prevent damage, wet your hair with tap water before you swim. The more wet your hair before you swim, the less salt water and chlorine it will absorb.<br>  Brush your hair in shower after you apply conditioner with a wide brush.<br>  Also, if you have thick hair, then it is important for you to wash your hair everyday.<br>  Always wash your hair after you swim to get the chlorine out. Try swimming with a swim cap on.<br>  Protect your hair from the sun with a large, floppy hat or hair products that contain sunscreen.<br>  Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase--cotton pillowcases make hair look dry; they suck out the moisture and can cause frizz.<br>  If you have very dry hair choose a deep conditioner and apply at the ends on dry hair. Leave it in overnight and sleep on it, then make sure you fully rinse it out in the morning, but do not wash it. Your hair will be noticeably different (in a good way)!<br>  Unless you have extra greasy hair it's actually a BAD thing to wash your hair every single day. You are washing away your hair's own precious moisture and oil.<br>  When using hairspray, make sure you wash out thoroughly as it will damage the cuticle in the hair and this is how split ends are caused.<br>  Always use heat protection spray when using heat appliances on your hair. Also deep condition your hair at least once a week.<br>  For hair that is naturally wavy or curly after straightening a section, spray hairspray but not too close to the head and not too much. This will help to hold your hair in place|`|b97IpZBOaa	Monday all your friends will be talking about a show that was on friday night.<br>  And you will say,,,,,(" I didn't watch it ")<br>  .........................................<br>  If you don't want to appear totally clueless.<br>  Watch the one hour show....GLENN BECK at 5PM ECT|`|6qosM6kEaa	Well, the best for me would be tie it up in plats, and then sleep on your hair which gives it a mess look but cute, i always do it.

Microdermabrasion is an ideal procedure for shrinking enlarged pores в?“ it lessens the appearance of pores by roughening up the skin, loosening the dead skin cells that clog the pores. Microdermabrasion performed by a professional can stimulate collagen production which is essential for healthy-looking skin. The treatment removes the upper layer of the skin and reduces not only the size of the pores, but also wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, acne scars, blemishes. In most cases 2/ 3 treatments are enough to minimize the appearance of large pores.<br>  <br>  Chemical peels are also effective for reducing the size, look and appearance of large pores. Chemical peel with Trichloreacetic acid (TCA) is the most appropriate peel for enlarged pores as the acid penetrates more deeply into the skin and removes the damaged layers of the skin, allowing new cells to form.<br>  <br>  Laser resurfacing is another procedure that is effective in treating enlarged pores. Laser resurfacing treatment treats not only large pores but also wrinkles, discolorations caused by sun damage, post-acne scars and the best thing is that it boost collagen production which is essential for the skinв??s elasticity and healthy look.

xGmhDTWwaa	Razor cut and they'll pretty much work around, they'll probs see from the pics the style and be able to just do it.<br>  <br>  The razor cut is what will do the layering, you don't so much need layers. You will probs have to say where you want the layers to begin though so say you want some like half way down and then where ever. You should have a side fringe too and that'll look awesome.<br>  <br>  The razor cut will cut them uneven/ choppy so don't worry about this.<br>  <br>  Once it's done you'll need hair products, heat defensive spray (when straightening), good conditioner, a good comb (for teasing the top of the hair) and hairspray for teasing and to hold :o)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! xxx<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and if you wanna touch up then you can use a razor between visits to the salon :o) I have actually done my own hair just last week haha|`|JgDRKLuLaa	If you really wanna be in the whole emo/scene spirit, do it yourself.

pbxxGjQeaa	It should be fine i used to take mine out for school all the time, you might have to push a bit harder to get it in and putting a ring in when it's been left for a while is far easier than a stud, also put it in from the front rather than the inside of your lip i found it hurts less.

It also depends how long you've had your lip pierced.<br>  But if you have the ring with you after you leave that teachers class put it back in. If all or your teachers make you take it out just cary it around with you and slip it in for a few seconds every hour or so just to make sure it doesn't close up.|`|VAMsP3nlaa	Depends how long u had it pierced and if u did it yourself or went to a professional. Just try it when u get home. Invest in a clear one if possible or a plug.|`|z3N5mlqdaa	No, might bleed when you put it back in bc the skin will start to do a thin coat by trying to heal. your ok, i took my nose ring out got 9 hours and it just bleed.
N0k6iZFRaa	Ive been doing hair for 22 yrs and everybody has off days.I think if you have gone to your stylist long enough to trust them you can forgive a small mishap.If they do a hack job something is really wrong nobody that has been doing hair for years should ever do a hack job.Im a little off my game now and then but never a hack job.I would never go back again and I wouldn't expect them to either.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	me and my mom go through this all the time...i think they just get complacent or something.  if this happens like twice in a row we say the heck with it and find somebody different to cut our hair then...

Bbe8U9r2aa	no cuz it is true yur burning your hair to0 much! the best way is to get those curlers at walmart and put them in your hair the night before after you washed your hair and put sum kind of curling gel by the morning youll have beutiful curly hair but make sure that all your hair is completely dry before  you take them out if not jus blow dry until dry then hair spray nd youll be done itll look better and it wont be as harsh for your hair|`|C4bB27wwaa	Have you tried just curling it and not straightening it. Or you should try a different straightner if its burning your hair because it is really bad for your hair its going to end up drying up and getting frizzy alot|`|UAf3R1Cgaa	No, it is not healthy for your hair to apply so much heat at once! I can understand straightening and then curling it, but yes, <br>  IT<br>  WILL<br>  DAMAGE<br>  your beautiful black hair!!!!!!!!<br>  Have you trying sleeping on rollers?<br>  <br>  Don't damage pretty hair!|`|IaMByOjFaa	Well you are putting your hair through alot.  So just skip every other day or one week do straight and the next curly.  My hair is curly but I straighten it every other day. It still looks healthy.|`|alRLh7yxaa	yeah its more damaging, id try a leave in conditioner or spray when you dry it, blow dry your hair with a round brush so you can straighten it that way then spray a heat protectant on it, and flat iron it. But only flat iron the top parts not the ends!|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	ANY hot tools on your hair is going to damage it regardless, so try and stay away from these or use them less often. It is ok to do that I guess, but only every once in awhile...you might start seeing the damage soon. I have naturally straight hair, but I have to straighten it sometimes if it's humid or if I had it in a ponytail and I'm going out-I usually just leave it natural. I use hot tools on my hair maybe a couple times a month. If you need to do it every day I would recommend finding a really good leave in conditioner that you can use for straightening and curling, so that it would burn the conditioner and not your hair. Sometimes I put coconut oil in my hair after the shower, which is a natural great moisturizer for your hair. I hope this helps! :)
w8z73kOsaa	Nope. For a start you still need a separate eyemake up remover so it is another product for the bathroom shelf.  I read that you need to do it for 10 minutes for it to be effective.  Who has that time?   The stuff really stings the eyes so you find that after a bit it runs into your eyes from your forehead.  The applicator is too big to get into the bits by the side of your nose - where most people's blackheads are.  And although it claims to be waterproof mine stopped working after a couple of weeks as water got into the battery compartment. Whilst the product does leave the skin softer - that could just be the neutrogena soap rather than the action. It is just another gimmick.  I use the good old fashioned clean hot damp flannel with a quality foaming cleanser to shift blackheads.|`|o7JfhhLbaa	i don't think i would work lol (them things never do)<br>  <br>  but i have acne and i find you usin face washes with tea tree oul in the helps.<br>  <br>  are you in england ?<br>  <br>  x|`|Dujw71Muaa	All of those commercials on tv are fake. The products they sell you are useless. Just take care of your skin and your acne will go away naturally.|`|bCIYZd35aa	Hey I've got the neutrogena wave and I really like it, I think it cleans well but you may need to swipe your face with some toner to get rid of every last trace of make-up and dirt. Just use this every night and then a exfoliater twice a week and you should feel your face is really well cleansed and free of blackheads, my skin is combination, I have very very dry patches and then very oily patches and it seems to work fine for me so I think it would also work for you, just make sure you moisturise well after use :)|`|VKrfQArqaa	No they don't.It just vibrates your skin instead ....<br>  Your best bet for clean skin id to clean it morning and night according to your skin type.<br>  Also if you like that deep clean feel why not try out this,fill the skin with warm/hot water and place your face over the sink for 5-8minutes.You can also cover your head and the skin with a towel so they steam is blocked making it steam your face alot more since it cannot Escape.<br>  Then tone after it.|`|Y5dJaZ2saa	visit the following url|`|cj59ZaPYaa	nope. it only 'cleans' the surface, and not down deep into your pores.
TYtgD4dOaa	Being a Stylist myself,  this question is epitome of hair questions,<br>  1st thing I would need to know, do you go to the same stylist all the time, if you do it easier, because they know your type of hair and your face shape.  If you hair is curly, you will have to straightened them.<br>  2nd, when cutting side bangs, make sure the stylist cut the Side bangs longer because you can always cut them shorter and make sure there is some kind of blending in so you can sweep them over,  i like to do a point cut (it takes some of the weight out so they will sweep over better) <br>  3rd,<br>  Consultation with your stylist and take a picture of a bang look that you want, <br>  but just remember you do want some slight blending especially if you hair is long with out layers, i hope this helps|`|Y0O6971laa	Well, everyone has them(including me.  Just get it angled/ layered and side part it and it'll look really cute.|`|tnYCL8yFaa	If you're not 100% sure then I wouldn't get them.  I wanted bangs in the fall really bad and went to my hair stylist - she could see I was really nervous and refused to do them! She said that if I wasn't sure then she was NOT giving me bangs because they take years to grow out.<br>  <br>  I then opted to buy those clip-in fringe bangs and they looked VERY real.  The problem was I didn't like the way I looked with bangs that much so I was happy then that my stylist didn't let me go through with actually cutting my hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|6QmVSwhsaa	Just do it, Ive done it before and at first when the lady styled it I hated it, but once I went home and parted it the way I liked it, I really did like it, infact im thinking of having it done now cause their all grown out.|`|ikqkswIzaa	yes just dont get them too short... it doesnt even take that long to grow out  :)|`|Bbe8U9r2aa	depends the shape of your face|`|UAf3R1Cgaa	I know your situation totally, i have been asking lately if i should get bangs, i had them b4 and it took me FOREVER to grow them out again, ive decided to keep my layers and super long side bangs, i love them.  get it angeled into your face, thats what i did, i luv it!
XN0cYCATaa	I think it might look a little too severe, But then that would depend on your face shape.
b7vYsbYNaa	trust me i have the same problem, that's because your fa in in repose, and that can sometimes make you look miserable. Just when you are doing something not particularly interesting, just put a tiny smile on your face and tighten those muscles and it will make a huge difference by just doing that. When you find something funny make a conscious effort to smile, and when you feel different emotions, try and 'train' your face to show that emotion by changing the expression. Just make sure it doesn't look freaky by practising in front of a mirror ;) lol :)|`|pPT4r83Xaa	aww thats too bad.<br>  not

9zHKn4Bdaa	Ok. My heritage is Italian/Mexican, so I hope you can imagine how thick and dark my hair is. I use Biolage Ultra-Hydrating Shampoo and Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner, which can also be used as a deep conditioner that you can do once a week or so. I've used many different things because I'm a hair stylist. This is the only thing I've found that makes it soft and shiny. I also flat iron my bangs. Before I do that, I also use the Biolage Smoothing Serum. No split ends and no heat damage. I would recommend that you STOP using Pantene, though. Nothing but wax that coats your hair. You should probably use a clarifying shampoo once to get that stuff out of your hair. I hope this helps you. ;D|`|UvLNxiuyaa	ur hair is dry and weak<br>  <br>  so <br>  <br>  i highly recommend Japanese hair straightening.  i have very frizzy and damaged hair and it got much more manageable , soft and healthy after the straightening. but no matter what- make sure you are going to a professional who knows what they are doing! make sure to meet with other people that got it done with him/ her/ the salon. getting referrals for this will be your best bet.

But keep it longer at the front keeping your fringe(bangs) and maybe platinum!<br>  <br>  That would look fab!|`|ikqkswIzaa	a girl in my school has the same color hair as yours and same length and she has like blue and pink in most of her hair it looks wicked good:)|`|KHJ6zzp4aa	Cut it like a bob short in the back and long in the front and jet black|`|ZDrF8piyaa	its already cute. but the thing where I live is to do the under part black and top blonde.  I think its edgy and cute.  Good luck|`|2GQ6lBhFaa	Okaay firstly your gorgeous, so don't be silly bout that :P <br>  <br>  Secondly, I can't tell to well how long your hair is, It looks pretty long and the blonde colour is lush :)<br>  <br>  So I'd keep the blond but lift section's and put either a bright colour such as hot pink or fire red on the under layer of your fringe and the side of your fringe. Get the fringe cut really blunt and framed into your face. <br>  <br>  Then it would be awesome if you tipped the end's witht he same colour as the fringe. Like just the end's so it look's like feather's :P <br>  <br>  Annnd finnaly cut loadsa choppy layer's into it, back comb and spray. Voila. Beautful awesome hair :)<br>  <br>  <3
AA10116775	Button-down collar have points fastened down by buttons on the front of the shirt. Introduced by Brooks Brothers in 1896, they were patterned after the shirts of polo players and were used exclusively on sports shirts until the 1950s in America. It is still considered a more sporting style, and, particularly outside America, traditionally dressed men still do not wear suits with this style of collar.  <br>  <br>  The word "jeans" comes from the French phrase bleu de Gênes, literally the blue of Genoa.<br>  <br>  Jeans fabric, or denim, originated in the french town of N?mes and owes its name to the location. In French, the fabric was known as "cotton de N?mes," which abroad quickly became just "denim."<br>  <br>  The first denim trousers were made in Chieri, a town near Turin (Italy), during the Renaissance, and were popularised in the 1500s. These trousers were sold through the harbour of Genoa, which was the capital of the independent Republic of Genoa which was a naval power.<br>  <br>  The first examples of these trousers were made for the Genoese Navy, which required all-purpose pants for its sailors. They required pants that could be worn wet or dry, the legs of which could easily be rolled up to wear while swabbing the deck. These jeans were laundered by dragging them in large mesh nets behind the ship, and the exposure to sea water and sun would gradually bleach them to white. They were especially worn by Genoan sailors and stevedores who worked in Italy and France, and in 1860, during the Battle of Marsala, Sicily, were worn by general Giuseppe Garibaldi and his Italian troops.|`|ZHvWLxwQaa	not me|`|PARkBLNNaa	I know that Levi Strauss invented the jean pants back in the time of the california gold rush because they needed sturdier pants for when they were kneeling by the waterside or scurrying over rocks.
szyUVMOlaa	River Island has tacky clothes but if you buy something from Topshop it is pretty much guaranteed you will see someone else wearing it...still prefer Topshop though.|`|Ux1xMyxvaa	i prefer topshop. but to be honest, id say topshop is much more expensive haha. i think topshop is aimed at the younger audience of like being probably 15+ to like mid 20's although you might find some stuff in there for older peoples, theres nothing wrong with that or something where as river island is suitable for young ones (i'm 16) but like a lot of things in that store have like stuff that wouldn't be too suitable for young ones and its like most stuff in there is aimed at people slightly older. if i make sense ha.|`|AA10491030	Topshop tends to have alot of basics available ie: Vests etc-i'd find it difficult sometimes to find a nice outfit in there, where as River Island tends to have dresses and skirts available.|`|5C2B23Qnaa	i like river island, the clothes in there you are more likely to wear but in TOPSHOP the clothes are a bit strange, if you no wot i mean lol :)|`|tlj3c50Haa	River Island. I usually don't like much in Topshop, and the staff always seem really snobby and bitchy towards you. Maybe that's just the ones I've been in. Lol, I did get an awesome umbrella from there though.|`|Qxmpn9Gtaa	I don't have either near me, and I've never been to either. But from things I've seem on polyvore I like TOPSHOP better :)

rjac15O0aa	Try listening to your artist... or did you go jail house...|`|H3PcFertaa	here's a good video about aftercare:<br>  <a href="http://www.luckyfish.com/pages/articles/tattoocare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckyfish.com/pages/articles/...</a><br>  here's an article on aftercare contradictions:<br>  <a href="http://tattoo.about.com/cs/tatfaq/a/aftrcr_cntrdctn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tattoo.about.com/cs/tatfaq/a/aftr...</a>|`|XaKVwjtpaa	-do not soak it in water until completely healed, about 2 weeks (no baths, no swimming, short showers) <br>  -wipe it down with water and mild soap daily<br>  -use the cream/lotion your tattoo artist recommend (i recommend Aquaphor healling ointment, it works great and doesnt fade the color)<br>  -dont wear tight clothing over your tattoo (for at least a week)<br>  -try not to let people touch it, germs and dirt can get it infected<br>  -try not to stretch that part of your body to much<br>  <br>  thats pretty much the basics <br>  <br>  hope it help!<br>  <br>  :-D
vZ4NXlBmaa	I hate asian symbol tattoos<br>  it's a trend<br>  and it's been completely overdone<br>  <br>  Plus....you're 16, and don't seem at all mature enough to be permanently marking your body<br>  especially in such a visible location<br>  <br>  AND you have to ask strangers for approval.....|`|cWXbcwROaa	If you can read Japanese then go for it. <br>  <br>  But if you can't then how will you know it really says that? And how will it be meaningful to you, every time you see it you won' t know what it says.|`|rjac15O0aa	If you get them dime sized in about 10 years it will just be a blob.  Get it in letters that look like bamboo sticks or bigger symbols.|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	what you want to get is an awesome idea. i love it when people get tattoos that actually mean something to them. the only problem i see is where youre getting them. it will be extremely hard to cover them up like at a job interview or important meeting. and take it from me, job places do judge people if you have tattoos, especially in a place like your wrists. love the idea, but maybe pick another place? idk lol but good luck!|`|AA12032352	Sounds like it might be too small....end up being blurry. I think if that is what your are going to get you need to think at least quarter size....and honestly more like half dollar or the detail won't be there.|`|V6dz395kaa	of course! it can give u faith whenever u want.|`|XaKVwjtpaa	if your not japanese dont get japanese letters on your body<br>  you never know if their right or not, and people will always ask you what it means, and it will get annoying<br>  <br>  also think about putting your tat in a different place, your wrist are very noticable and it would be hard to hide in the business world when you get older.<br>  <br>  I like the idea, just not in japanese or on your wrist. <br>  think about maybe somewher on your back<br>  or foot even?<br>  <br>  hope it help! :-D|`|slppTZi1aa	I have the Japanese symbol for live in peace on my back. My grandpa lived in Japan for 4 years and he wrote it for me, i checked online and it was the same thing, He had been diagnosed with cancer and my family was going through some rough times. For me the Japanese part as well as the meaning actually mean something, I dont think its too cliche. I think they look cute, but dont do it that small on your wrists because the quality of that tattoo will probably be shitty. mine is to the right on my lower back , oposite of my hip bone.. its a really cute spot.|`|HZzdMv6qaa	I think Its a great idea :)<br>  It might hurt seeing that your veins are on your wrist,<br>  But I'm not sure because I've never had a tattoo before.<br>  The concept is good! Did you say your putting it in japanese writing?<br>  That would be cooly xDD<br>  I say go for it!|`|IT1DZoWqaa	Yesss. Tattoos are sexxy xD.|`|USxxSS7qaa	Japanese symbols are so cliche...espicially on the wrist.|`|br1FB5rraa	I think its a good idea, but you should get faith and courage written in english instead, that would look better|`|1PX69cGIaa	it would be cooler if it was written in english|`|59Sszxz8aa	yess i think its a good ideaaa<br>  you should get want u want to get:):)|`|01IwJ41Iaa	What really matters is that this is something you really want....if it is, go for it.

Good luck and have fun!|`|U56SKlloaa	You should wear like a peachy blush with a brown-ish/tan colour eyeshadow and dust it over your eyes for a smokey effect.  :)|`|AA10491030	Smoky eyes would look great so dark grey shadow, highlight your cheeks with illuminator and wear a nude lip gloss.|`|l0xbmgE4aa	have your eyeshadow contrast with everything :) like a nice icy blue would be amazing!
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	The stylist who applied the straightener should have given you this info. I would ask the stylist.
xfzB2SOsaa	im very sensitive...n wen i got it done..i was scaaaarrredd!<br>  and it hurt!! a lot!!!<br>  but then...once it was done...oh ya..it was soooooo totally worth it!<br>  <br>  during de piercing - 8<br>  just after it - 6<br>  later (much later) - 0.00000000|`|alRLh7yxaa	it hurt when i got it done, but it went by so fast the level of pain when getting it done for "me" was about a 4<br>  <br>  Afterwards it didnt hurt at all, I wouldnt even know i had it pierced b/c i didnt feel any pain an hour or even a day later!|`|xEZclTh4aa	i was sooooooo scared <br>  but it was over so fast that it didn't hurt that much<br>  like a 5 <br>  it like feeling the pressure of a pinch and then reaching a "breaking point"<br>  afterwards there was a little bit of swelling thats it though
XhwxmP7vaa	try wax's and you can find temporary colors to tips the ends and punk out w/ lots of style. (sally's beauty supply stores)|`|SBFs2Cheaa	take a shower then use *** loads of mousse in it and spike it
