AbVUDTKAaa	Dragons mainly focus on power and special summoning them. I would strongly recommend Decoy Dragon and Red Eyes Black Metal Dragon. They can special summon powerful dragons for a very low cost. Also Kaiba-Man works well. It lets you get out Blue Eyes very easily. Lord of D. works well to defend your dragons. And the Flute of Dragon Summoning to special summon dragons. If you're going to use Blue Eyes, try Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon, the fusion of the three. And F.G.D. for a dragon deck. You can use Dragon's mirror to remove the dragons from your graveyard for fusion summon. If you want, Future Fusion isn't that bad.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Monsters: 19  3 Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon  2 Prime Material Dragon  3 Tiger Dragon  3 Blizzard Dragon  2 Red-Eyes Wyvern  2 Mirage Dragon  1 Twin-Headed Behemoth  3 Masked Dragon    Spells: 12  3 Dragon's Mirror  1 Future Fusion  1 Lightning Vortex  2 Soul Taker  1 Heavy Storm  2 Stamping Destruction  1 Monster Reborn  1 Brain Control    Traps: 9  3 Solemn Judgment  2 Compulsory Evacuation Device  1 Bottomless Trap Hole  1 Dimensional Prison  1 Mirror Force  1 Dust Tornado    Total: 40 cards    Extra Deck: 15  3 Five-Headed Dragon  2 Red Dragon Archfiend  2 Goyo Guardian  2 Thought Ruler Archfiend  2 Stardust Dragon  2 Black Rose Dragon  1 Magical Android  1 Chimeratech Fortress Dragon          Cyber Dragon = [Super Rare, Cybernetic Revolution]  Cyberdarks = [Cyberdark Impact super rare / commons in Duelist pack Zane]|`|oo7WiuuPaa	Cyberdarks = I think all in Cyberdark Impact  Cyber Dragon/Twin/End = Cybernetic Revolution    Also, get the deck Dragon Roar, obviously it's a Dragon deck =)    Hope this helps!|`|vZJL5XUpaa	for dragons, get a tyrant dragon!!! cybers CRV(cybernetic revoloution)
Sow1mTFuaa	check out piggy wants a signal, it's kind of a form of hide and go seek tag but with some different rules and ways of playing it. I played it as a kid and loved it. Look it up on google to get the exact way of playing but basically one person is it while the rest hide, when a person is found they go to a center location or the "pen". People who are in the pen can be released by yelling "piggy wants a signal" and if you see a signal like a arm wave or a flashlight from one of the other hiders you a free too go hide again. But if the person who is it sees you leaving the pen you have to go back. So the point of the game is to get everyone hiding into the pen.|`|4YqVNiJzaa	truth or dare   prank call random people in your phone book[make sure to *67]  hotter colder  hide the monkey|`|qP7HuJovaa	why play inside, the best things to do are outside.

AA12113863	Your sims have to be at least a Child to get into a car. After that, there si no limit. You can put as many people as you want into the car. For example, I had an eight person family, and only one car. The car was the cheap hatchback. I had them all go somewhere in the car, and the mom and dad went in. There are only four seats, so when the first two kids got in, the others had no-where to go. Trouble, right? Wrong. The first kids just disappeared from view and the others got in the same spot. When they got to the lot, everyone came out, safe and sound. The only person that will never disappear is the driver, because they need to drive.|`|riO929X4aa	I'm not sure about how many, the maximum that I've taken out in a car was about 5 or 6. I'm sure you can take about 7 because thats the amount of sims allowed in a sim family and you can go on a family trip so I'd say about 7. No, you cannot use 2 cars because you can only control one and you'd normally only need 1. The sim has to be at least a child to get into the car to go somewhere, but they can't drive the car until they become a teenager. The amount of sims allowed in the car is the same for all of the cars. So, about 7. Hope I helped. :o)|`|7qJAcAFXaa	as many as you want, but they have to atleast be a child to go|`|DAEsT2VTaa	Im pretty sure 8 sims can fit into a car because thats how many sims can live in a house.

RKIt9zSIaa	I think this is because their sim files have been ripped.  Many of the Maxis sims have character files that are incomplete or have been ripped (i.e. most of the data has been stripped out).  When this happens, you can't resurrect the sims.  Certain Maxis sims are also known to be impossible to raise.  I can't tell you which ones exactly as I don't play Maxis hoods and have never tried it.  However, the information about which sim files are incomplete is all over Sims modding sites if you want to have a look for it.  There are also various threads about restoring files though I have a suspicion those two can't be raised no matter what you do.  Also, you don't always want to do it because the files can be damaged which means you get sim/family/lot corruption when you try to breed the sims.  Just saying.

AA11850311	I've had the error a few times, and it was always due to me having a piece of incompatible custom content.  This guide show how to find problem custom content http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...  Now the computer not turning on is a separate problem.   Is it plugged in?  Is the battery charged up?  Sometimes Sims2 can cause laptops to overheat, but unless this was a very old, already damaged laptop, one day of playing should do have done that.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	That happens to me too! but i dont knw why i have no clue why it does it but for a while it hasnt done that so maybe i'm just running along with luck|`|riO929X4aa	I've had this problem before too. My dad works with computers and he said that the only way he'd be able to fix the problem is to re-format it. Maybe you could ask someone to re-format it for you, but don't reload the game onto it. I'm afraid the game may not be able to work with your laptop. I got a new computer a couple months later (not because of the sims, it was something else.) and I loaded it onto this one and it works perfectly fine.|`|5O1HtiqAaa	I would try to reinstall it, it might just have been a slip up but if that doesn't work I would either take it back to the shop or I think there is a number on the instrution mannal to call if there is a problem.    GOOD LUCK|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Where did you get it? If it was a download, was it a clean one and did you scan it for viruses. I haven't had any problems with Sims 2 breaking my computer. How far does the computer boot?|`|qsp6tYaQaa	JoJo is correct...you need to re-format your laptop. The Sims 2 & all their expansions require so much memory & space that often older laptops can't handle it. They'll run too hot & then crash.     Is the copy of The Sims 2 Nightlife a store bought copy or did you burn it from someone? If it's from someone, it's possible that you didn't get all the files properly so it didn't install completely. Either way, I don't recommend installing it again.     Do some simple upgrades to your laptop before you attempt to play the Sims again & make sure that when you play with it, you have it well vented so the fan can get plenty of air.    If you need help upgrading it, give me a shout.

riO929X4aa	If you haven't saved your game thats in progression maybe you could just go back to the neighborhood without saving and re-enter the household. If you've already saved it I'd use the cheat that the other people are saying to use and just pull up the cheat bar using these buttons: Shift, Ctrl, and C. Then type in 'moveobjects on' without the quotation marks and push enter, then go to build mode and move your sims out of the hottub, but the bad thing is, is that you sims might work a little weird at first. You'll see what I mean once you do it. If all fails, you could always make them move out of the house and move back in and just re-fix the house the way you had it before. If that doesn't work then I'd just delete the house along with the family and build a whole new house and family. Hope I helped! :o)|`|bM6WA3TXaa	get rid of the tub?|`|BBXpXZp0aa	try to delete the hot tub|`|2beeb428b630fe34c36e748e0fd66b3aaa	Maybe they're busy in there! ;)    Seriously though, use the cheat "move_objects on" and try to delete the hot tub or pick them up and move them out of it.  Use CTRL + Shift + C to get the cheat command window up. :)

You can use any pattern that you like.  However, you want one that is stretchy so that it fits snugly.    You can do it all in garter stitch (knit every row), or seed stitch (alternate knit and purl) or moss stitch (alternate 2 knit and 2 purl over 2 rows).  There are many other patterns you can use, even cables, and bobbles, or lace (but you don't want too many holes if it is to keep you warm).    Measure around the head to know how long to make it.  You can make it as wide as you need, but at least to cover the ears, or a bit more.  Make is a little shorter than needed, so it is snug.  Too loose and it will fall around your neck!

RKIt9zSIaa	I get mine from Gamecopy World - you need to check the configuration is right for what you have.  If you have Seasons, you need the Seasons noCD.  If you have Seasons but have PATCHED the EP as well, you need the version for Seasons + the patch.  Although both versions are for Seasons, they won't work properly with the other configuration.  Read the instructions carefully when you go and look.  On the other hand, the fact you have University and Seasons with DD doesn't make any difference to which version of the noCD you get - you get the one for Seasons - older EPs don't affect it, you always use the noCD for the latest EP you have.  That is the latest one published - not the last one you installed necessarily.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Read the first post on this thread:    http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/in...

You can try to get your hammer up to skill level 3 and break it yourself, or you can just wait until the last day of your first spring, when the rock will disappear on its own due to a festival that has to take place at Brownie Ranch. However, silkworms might not be available from the moment the Brownie Ranch store opens. You'll get a notice in the mail or in the bulletin board when they get "new merchandise."    You can buy the Yarn Maker at the General Store in Waffle Town. It costs 4500G, but also comes with a Dye Pot.    The yarn maker goes in the barn (which you can build at the carpentry shop in Ganache Mine District if you have enough lumber, material stone, and money), because you can make Wool Yarn with it out of wool from sheep, which live in the barn. But the maker can also make Silk Yarn out of silkworm cocoons, and silkworms reside in the coop along with chickens and ducks (the coop can also be built via the carpenters).    Good luck!
RKIt9zSIaa	I have no idea why you are having this problem - maybe your computer doesn't like package files for some reason.  (Package files are the file type for the game).  I have tons and tons of MTS2 stuff in my game and have no problems.  Like you, I test everything to make sure it's working.  I think it's likely a setting on your computer rather than a problem with MTS2 - hundreds of thousands of people have dl files from there without problem.  I've never heard anyone mention anything like this before.  There is no limit on the number of files you can download and anyway, how would exceeding any limit affect the operation of your computer?  I'd look for a solution to your problem in your operating system.

Some say that it opens up "Doors" from another reality, world, etc. It is said that once you play this your pretty much doomed for you have opened the door to a "creature" which will follow you everywhere, anytime, all the time. Or something like I'm not sure. But what I do know is that it deals with bad spirits or demons. Certainly not angels or jesus. Umm...my moms friend's husband had one of those board. But I kinda forgot what he did with it. Except he never played it or something. Anyways i think i read a story about the board before talking about how it was made by these brothers or something by satanic actions. Gosh i don't memba much.   Good luck and be aware of the dangers that the game brings. If, this game is really what its all about, then theres hope that there really is a heaven and jesus realy exist. Cuz if demons or spirits exist, then why not angels, jesus, or another world?   Blah (:
uctxzjIIaa	Method #1 you list there only works for monsters, and I'm not even sure that it still holds true on the DS version.<br>  <br>  At least on the PS2, the method was commonly believed to be #3 (and yes, by fighter, they do mean the brawler line of characters). However, it turns out it was "Have the combined levels of all male fighters and male warriors be at least 20"
EqArYOXBaa	This question has no "real" answer. It is completely based on opinion. For the moves, I recommend you have as many different types of attacks as possible for type-trumping purposes unless you have the patience to train them each to high levels. For example, Infernape should not only be taught fire moves, no matter how much you like them. What if an Infernape goes up against a... say a Bibarel? Then you may feel pretty foolish for not teaching it Close Combat, huh?    Electric Pokemon are generally very fast. You may want to consider some of those, like Luxray or Pachirisu. In the sources, I included a very helpful page.    If you want a team to beat the Elite 4, here is a list of decent Pokemon (IN MY OPINION) that will be able to type-trump every E4 Pokemon (except Spiritomb, it has no weaknesses):  Golem/Onix- Rock/Ground types  Rapidash- Fire  Abomasnow- Grass/Ice (other good Grass types include Carnivine and Cherrim)  Machamp/Lucario/Toxicroak- Fighting  Drifblim/Gengar/Spiritomb- Ghost    Then 1 free slot for a high level Pokemon.|`|nHJSRUxUaa	I am good in this game........ so if u wanna make your pokemon good... then Email me...... what u need help on........|`|9YTIwgIZaa	All Lv. 100    Charizard: Blast Burn, Fire Blast, Heat Wave, Flame Thrower             Lum Berry    Torterra:  Frenzy Plant, Leaf Storm, Earthquake, Wood Hamer            Shell Bell, Lum Berry    Staraptor: Brave Bird, Aerial Ace, Fly, Close Combat            Lum Berry  Lucario: Close Combat, Aura Sphere, Extreme Speed, Metal Claw           Lum Berry  Empoleon: Hydro Cannon, Drill Peck, Hydro Pump, Ice Beam    Lum Berry  Salameance: Dragon Rush, Fire Blast, Hyper Beam, Hydro Pump          Draco Plate|`|kSKHpcqEaa	tiranitar,fireblast,thunder,surf,icebeam  arcinine,extreemspeed,fireblast,dig,th...  dragonite,outrage,surf,fly,dracometeor   electivire,thunder,earthquake,fireblas...  lucario,closecombat,extreemspeed,thund...  dialga,roaroftime,earthquake,thunder,f...  all at lv100
T0Jqr1Aoaa	The big games out right now are the Gears of War games,Call Of Duty games,as well as Halo 3.Halo Wars looks too much like Command and Conquer,and it also looks to be too much of a computer-type setup (the screen,the way you play,etc.).I wouldn't suggest getting it.|`|lNubFvPkaa	Well to me,to be considered the best i think the game has to played by a lot of people and it has to be a game that you can play over and over again so i would have to say Halo3 or COD4|`|dWHeWkb7aa	call of duty 5|`|91qkEnkHaa	In my opinion it would have to be Fallout 3 because it is long and always has something to do for a good while.

t1wBZthoaa	Well, it depends how long your vacation is. Disneyland is actually 2 theme parks (Disneyland and California Adventure) and Disney World is 6 (Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, EPCOT, MGM Studios, plus 2 water parks). If you have a week or more I'd go to Disney World, since you can spend a week easy and never get bored there. If you only have a day or 2 Disneyland is the way to go.     Best way to save money is to get a park-hopper ticket if you plan on going to more than 1 park per day (like in Disneyland) and if you'll need a hotel, compare rates between the ones owned by Disney and the others nearby.|`|zeV5cCalaa	Yesterday i went to disneyland for my bday haha   i suggest disneyworld bigger and betterrr than disney    you'll have fun eighther way their both awsome  but disneyworld you'll have loads of fun :)|`|29dVhqXUaa	Disney World is way more fun because there is much more to do.  If you are trying to go cheap, pack your own food because even one apple is a dollar.  Do not stay at the Disney Resorts either, unless you are only staying for a couple of days, as it is really expensive and many great deals can be found moment outside the parks.  I would suggest going to Magic Kingdom first because, as it's name entitles, it is magical.  Plus, if you only have a couple days, it would be better to stay at one park and make sure you do everything.  Both my grandmother's loved Epcot and there are a lot of things to do there for the older crowd.  Defineatly stay and watch the Spectro Magic Parade and fireworks in Magic Kingdom, and the World Showcase fireworks in Epcot, they are absolutealy awsome.  It is actually pretty cold here in FL now, so rule out the water parks, and Animal Kingdom is fun, but always very crowded except on weekdays in the morning when it first opens, but only for a few hours.  Same for Hollywood Studios, HS also doesn't have a whole lot to do for your age.  Good luck and have fun!!!|`|8tz8GKbkaa	DISNEYLAND. THERE IS MORE TO DO IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN FLORDIA EVERYTHING IS SO FAR AWAY!|`|UMg1CL7baa	i just came back from disneyworld, and had the time of my life. Its really fun they have rides for all ages depending on which park you go too within disney. If you want more intense rides you can go to mgm stuidos and ride the rockin rollercoaster which i highly recomend. or you can do tower of terror. if you dont like intense rides so much theres still magic kingdom, and epcot. I happend to really enjoy the rollercoaster in animal kingdom.  ive never been to disneyland so i cant really recomend anything for you there.    Have a good trip!|`|dhdz5uNSaa	If you're not breaking the bank, go to Disneyland. Disneyland is more of a 1-2- day trip. Disneyworld is 4 amusement parks and 3 water parks.

I have not been to disney world since 1992 or disney land since 1990, so off hand I don't know about getting good deals.  i would say go on a cruise or something like that. that might be a little less expensive and your grandma as well as you would really enjoy it more. cruises are fun packages that 'pack in the fun for the price'|`|MErTirOwaa	disney world...and then while your there...theyre different parks go to the MGM studios|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Don't half-*** when your going to a place like Disney World, its truly a memory you will always have..

djQ6UyzIaa	In my opinion, they are VERY stupid.<br>  <br>  They are the most show-off thing a F2P(Free 2 Play) can acess. They look just like dragon so are really cool but (and here's the stupid part) they cost 10x more and destroy themselves after a number of uses.<br>  <br>  So they are something you only want if you are poor (F2P). But if you are poor you can't afford them. And even if you could afford them, they break down every 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  They are like selling solid diamond, disposable helicopters in South Africa. They are the single stupidest things in Runescape so don't even bother with them.|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	Basically they're junk designed to give F2P more of a taste of what P2P have. You get them from pking but they degrade into dust very quickly. They do have some of the highest stats a F2P character can get though ( if you don't mind your armor suddenly disappearing on you ).

Paper is readily available and is not at all expensive even if you order it online.     You can use any kind of paper, from craft paper found at your local store, origami paper (amazon.com) or even simple, colorful wrapping paper which is more readily available!    You can choose to fold a variety of patterns and models, from birds, animals, dinosaurs to Ornamental kusudamas or trickier modular origami pieces.     Models can range from beginners, to intermediate to complex. It depends on how experienced you are to try the more complex ones.     What is:  Origami: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami  Kusudama: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusudama    To give you an idea, you can simply run a search on youtube.com for origami models such as butterflies or dinosaurs, etc.     My hobby is Origami, too and I can spend hours a week simply browsing through books, patterns online and of course trying my hands at folding these models.     You can have a look at Origami Ideas, tips and instructional videos at:  http://origamiancy.com/  http://www.happyfolding.com  http://www.origaminut.com

JtcVwK2Caa	If you can't get to a library, here's an online resource:    http://www.aboutbookbinding.com/    You can also make your book out of folded groups of paper that you sew together. Basically, you fold 2 pages in half lengthwise, then sew them together. Make groups of folded, sewn together pages until you have a book with the number of pages you want. Sew the groups of pages together as well.     I think it would be better for you to have instructions, so here's a video:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=LVkO6dyOBt...    It's part 1 in a book binding series. You can find other parts on Youtube as well.    HTH!|`|af5ac6e4768248c92fc36981d9f2cf71aa	wow to the 1st answer, if this is not what you are talking about you could go to your local library for free and ask the librarian(?) to search the catalog for book binding book for you, if that library does not have them they can send for them for you for free.|`|wnGBq14maa	Hi,     If you are talking about an Origami book, the link to a very helpful and easy to follow video is:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3HV1etpH...    For any Tips / suggestions on folding the book, please refer to this website:  http://origamiancy.com/      This is a design by David Brill and is very realistic when finished. You can adjust the size of the book by using a larger or a smaller sized sheet of paper.

63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	let say 9500 enter his odds of winning is the same as the next person 1 in 9500<br>  as where wining the lottery can be 1 in 12.5 million or so|`|UVUYG5jaaa	a rookie can get 4 aces<br>  a professional can get junk<br>  let him enter and make his own mistakes<br>  you can play too, dont be jealous|`|crhJLuw5aa	It depends upon how you look at it. If the chance of winning the state lottery is 1 in 12.5 million, as someone has stated; and the chance of winning the WSOP is 1 in 9500; then on the surface it certainly APPEARS as if the WSOP is the better bet. But WAIT! It costs $10,000 to enter the WSOP, but only $1 for the state lottery. So for the price of the WSOP you can buy 10,000 chances in the lottery, which means that your chance of winning the lottery is now one in 1250. If you figure it THIS way, then his chance of winning the lottery is almost 8 times as much as his chance of winning the WSOP. And besides, he's only been playing poker for a year? It's VERY doubtful that his chance of winning the WSOP is anywhere NEAR 1 in 9500 anyway!<br>  <br>  I agree with you: Your friend is nuts.|`|C6sFxTVnaa	Your friend is right. His chances of winning the WSOP are higher than his chances of winning the lottery. But that DOES NOT mean that playing the WSOP is a better thing to do than play the lottery. His expected LOSS will be higher playing in the WSOP than it will be playing the lottery. So although he has a better chance of winning the WSOP, the better decision would still be to play the lottery.<br>  <br>  As for his chances of winning, it would be impossible to get even fairly accurate results. Ignore the above replies which say that his odds of winning (if there are 9,500 players) is 1 / 9,500. This is wrong, you have to take the pother players skill levels into account. Like I said, it would be impossible to get an accurate result. But I can definitely tell you that he has a better chance to win the WSOP over winning the lottery.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	No, you are nuts.<br>  <br>  The chance of winning a state lottery are in the millions.  Granted, it only costs $1 to play it.<br>  <br>  Playing the poker tournament costs a lot more, but you have a better shot than millions to 1.|`|t6CKMIznaa	That depends on how good he is.  Is he talking about the main event, or a normal event?  I think there are around 45 events and I know people that have gotten 2nd, 1st, and 4th places.  My brother got 2nd in some event, and got $300,000|`|HPuiI7BCaa	These calculations should give a rough estimate before the event actually begins:<br>  <br>  Let's assume that 6000 players enter the event. Assuming that everyone were of equal skill then his odds would be 1 in 6000. <br>  <br>  If he is twice as good as the average player (which I doubt), then his odds would be 1 in 3000. If he is half as skilled as the average player then he would have a 1 in 12000 chance. Assuming that he is a substantially below average player, for that event, but not hopeless then his odds might be as poor as 1 in 120000.<br>  <br>  Several initial factors would greatly influence this. His initial table draw could seriously change these odds, but there is no way to adjust for that. <br>  <br>  the odds of winning the lottery are several million to one. So, I would say that his chance of winning the WSOP is better than his odds of winning the lottery.|`|ltVk6noOaa	The actual odds are impossible to calculate since the tournament takes skill into account. No matter how lucky someone is they can't win on luck alone. And the same goes for skill. Basically, the more skilled your friend is, the less he needs to rely on luck. But, he cannot win without one or the other.<br>  <br>  But here is the question. Why worry about winning the whole thing when you can cash and more than double your money. About 10% of all entrants to the main event get at least $20,000 back. Now if you are a skilled player, that is a very good reason for you to enter the tournament because if you don't get unlucky, you should be able to at least double your money or even more. You don't have to win the whole tournament to justify entering the World Series.

e11rLfpeaa	I've seen people no scoping with Kar8k the German Bolt Action Rifle|`|6RqBOxvjaa	Wow you guys are so stupid, you can't no-scope with an SMG. and lucifer, an STG isn't even an SMG. No-scopes are for sniper rifles, at least the M1 Garand with a sniper scope.<br>  <br>  The best no-scoping weapon in Cod WaW is probably the M1 Garand, but working for the scope sucks cause the Garand isn't the best gun to use. <br>  <br>  Other guns that are good for no-scoping are the Kar98k and the Mosin-Nagant, they're my favorites.<br>  <br>  Remember to put steady aim on though.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	I have played WaW quite a bit. The Mosin-Nagant has a very high power rating, and the accuracy is spot on. Add stopping power and any shot in center of mass (limbs are not an instant kill) is a one hit kill. It's quite easy once you learn not to shoot SMG style. Take your time, lead or wait for a pause as they shoot at someone else. Its also frustrating to play against someone good with this rifle as you usually dont see them before you drop. Try it out. Good luck|`|GFAgYMYsaa	What are you guys talking about?!?!?!?<br>  You cant no scope with a machine gun!<br>  BOLT-ACTION SNIPER RIFLES ONLY!!!<br>  I am very good at this game and also high level.  the best no scopoing gun is the first 4 bolt actions.  but the springfield is kind of weak and the shots will hit but they won't die.  I'd say the Mosin Nagant is the best for No-Scoping.|`|91qkEnkHaa	Once you unlock if you havent already the ppsh  but if you havent the Tompson|`|59c6943fced2ae982a2fec5167c22740aa	most smgs are fine for no scoping, but personally i use the stg.|`|ulMsw4pPaa	After playing the game as much as i do i have learned that it is not really the gun that you use its really just you set up your perks with the gun. The gun i love to use is the stg with stopping power, steady aim,and bouncing betty

nGYqrKPTaa	Phantom darkness|`|mHWsuqjZaa	really it depends on what type of deck you want it to become.|`|PSwaQnlzaa	The Dark Emperor Deck is focus on Removing Cards from play, and it has Caius.

DijHmtxiaa	It sounds like a disc problem to me, not an equipment one.  I have two copies of FF VIII; one of them freezes and the other does not, simply because they're CDs -- so they're weak, and they acquire imperfections easily.  I would definitely try cleaning off the disc (check for scratches, of course; those would obviously explain the problem), and you might try blowing some canned air into the PS2 or testing another game on it if you really think that's the problem.  If none of this works, then I'm betting you've got a copy that's developed a glitch and there really is no fix except getting another copy . . . if that's the case, sorry.

qvWbPZrdaa	listen, this works for me because my xbox had the most problems ever, so here it goes: whenever you want to send your xbox in for whatever reason, write a note complaining that you are willing to tell people not to buy from xbox and tell them you are on the verge of not buying from xbox and microsoft ever again(this will almost always guarentee you a game or an extra 3 month card), sending in a note also makes them fix it and return it SO MUCH FASTER because you are their top priority,(i sent my xbox on monday, and i got it back in 7 days and i live in NY!) also, this whole thing that they only fix RRoD for free is complete BULL SH!T!!! i sent my xbox in with 3 red lights(RRoD), a stuck dvd drive with CoD WaW in it, and 1 red light (e74) and they fixed it for free because they knew if i got it back unfixed i would go "nuts"(no i wouldnt really go nuts over an unfixed xbox, but they dont know that, the toughness on the note is all an act lol) just try to sound kinda tough in your letter, but be sorta sweet at the end....it works----and if you want me to send you the note i wrote, just message me|`|972OdSIJaa	yes if you got the RROD|`|FPsMtmThaa	If it's RROD, and your console is still under the 3 year warranty, it should be fixed for free.<br>  <br>  Check out some RROD tips to make sure you don't get it again..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thegamerreport.com/2009/02/gamepro-6-steps-to-avoiding-rrod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegamerreport.com/2009/02/ga...</a>|`|QQcpDiVqaa	you probably have to pay and they take forever..best bet is to send it to a repair shop. there is one in Salem, MA that you can send it to..they repair it within one day and have good prices. they have a website<br>  <a href="http://www.computerlabsalem.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.computerlabsalem.com</a>|`|LTxBjB5Uaa	if your under warranty they will do it for free. xbox and accersoies*
qbzen2XYaa	When you look at the bottom fo the cards, it will tell  you what deck it is from, it will say Illidan, Drums, Azeroth, etc for the different card sets they have produced     However, when you look at the cards, they are color coded.    A white is the most common card there is.  Green is uncommon.  Blue is Rare,  Purple is Epic  Orange are Legendary, and usually reserved for LOOT cards which are redeemable for in game rewards depending on the deck set in which the loot card comes from.    So Basically there are 3 sets of cards within the set, however, Collecting them all for every set will probably be almost impossible without spending alot of money as Purple Epic and Blue Rare cards have a chance to come 1 to a pack i believe, while there are usually 3 green cards to a pack.  IF there are 200 cards in the set  That would be 200 packs with no doubles, which is never going to happen.    Just looking at a card i have sitting here at my desk from the OUTLAND set, there are 247 cards in that set. so even if you were to buy every epic card at 5 bucks a card on Ebay  your looking at 1000 dollars just to obtain the Epic set within the series.      Hope this helps you

That'd probably be your best bet.     Here's a checklist though if that helps too    Sierra 117: Blind and Iron  Crow's Nest: Black Eye and Grunt's Birthday Party  Tsavo Highway: Tough Luck  The Storm: Catch  Floodgate: Fog  The Ark: Famine and Cowbell  The Covenant: Thunderstorm and IWHBYD  Cortana: Tilt  Halo: Mythic    Oh, here's a few need to know things for a couple skulls.    For Catch, you can't destroy the Anti-Air Wraith otherwise it'll disappear, it's on top of the pillar next to it, your best bet would to be put a Warthog next to it and protect it with a bubble shield    For Fog, it's right when the Flood are starting to be identified by the marines. The first building you see when you start walking into the area for the mission, keep your Battle Rifle positioned at the edge of the building and you'll see a flood on top (you'll hear "There! Over There!" on the radio), shoot him before he jumps off and he'll pretty much throw it off the building    For Cowbell, there should be a Grav Lift in the temple-like building as you head into another Scarab fight, grab that before you head into the rest of the mission. You'll see more if you search it on youtube.    For IWHBYD, kill the Prophet of Truth, and defeat the bridges of enemies. Then, jump through the Halos in this order, with "1" being at the entrance and "7" being the end near where the Prophet of Truth was located: 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4.      The other skulls are pretty much findable without a catch, and once you youtube it you'll see where to find them, just keep your eyes open    hope this helps!

4lO7CSn0aa	Strength is compared to Toughness to determine whether the target is wounded.  A weapon with Strength 4 hits a target with Toughness 3.  You compare Strength and Toughness of the table at the back of your rulebook and see that you'll need a 3+ to wound.  If the same weapon hits a target with Toughness 5, you'll need a 5+ to wound.    Once you've wounded, the target might get an armour save.    The AP of a weapon dictates whether or not the target gets an armour save.  If a weapon has an AP of 5, say, then any model with an armour save of 5+ or 6+ won't get to use that save.  If it has an AP of 2, then any model with an armour save of 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ or 6+ won't get their save.  In other words, the lower the AP the better.    Weapons with an AP of 1 have extra rules relating to the penetration of vehicle armour.    Note that targets without an armour save may still get a cover save or an invulnerable save.

0jBjvOuwaa	No getting enough sleep and not playing in a while contributes, in my opinion. Because of few hours of sleep gives you lack of focus, and not playing in a while, you tend to forget some moves.     Hope it helps. 8D|`|kNGMVXBLaa	Play the game for a few time. And then, you'll get your skill back (may not be as effective as before thought)    I,too, haven't play super smash for a while, but played it a few matches, I'm get in use to it ^^    You have a natural gaming skill, like your first time to play the game, you'll think that is really hard, but you'll get better and better as the time past.    And by the way, get more sleep because if you don't sleep much, you'll loose patience and focus.    Play it, like it is your first time to play ^^  Hope i helped.|`|F0d2W9Zyaa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...    just play it 2 hours everyday and youll get better in 1 month|`|UShcJrF8aa	i dont play those games  play call of duty|`|7basZRQ7aa	Yes, if you don't practice or play something for a while, you will get "rusty".

Brawl = Fun|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Calm down, get a good night sleep and try to be patient. Some games take a while to learn, others are quick to pickup. I know from experience that some games no matter how long you go without playing them you will pick up again in a few hours. For me it was Perfect Dark, I knew the levels cold the enemy patrol paths, where the ammo and weapons were, key locations, etc. Its also your state of mind when you play, I've noticed that when I'm angry I make a lot of mistakes and do bad, but when I control myself and concentrate, I'm a killing machine. Your skills will come back pretty quick, you just need to sit and play for a couple hours and you'll be amazed how fast you improve.|`|CLzREaYXaa	Oh.

NDNUjuwBaa	well, you didnt list enough of your specs to give a definitive answer, but if your rig has 3G ram i would guess that the rest of your specs are probably fine. Warcraft is a really forgiving game in terms of system requirements, but to turn all the settings up to max you need a pretty serious machine.    one thing that may help though is Can You Run It. it does a quick diagnostic for any of the games on their list. the link is in the source box|`|bGNBEtImaa	You will be fine on downloading, installing, and playing the game. In my opinion though, just pay the $15 a month fee. It is not much, $0.50 a day, so just pay the dang bill and take advantage of the numerous servers with nearly full populations much of the time, the patches/updates, and other ingame features that you will miss out on.|`|ZVMn6lUfaa	i know someone who can help in my source|`|qusraJWhaa	i dont know

SeSObtS0aa	Is there a monthly fee to play the game?  Yes. After the end of the free month included with the game, you need a subscription in order to continue playing the game. There are three subscription options: a month-to-month package at $14.99 per month, a three-month plan at $13.99 per month, and a six-month plan at $12.99 per month.    Are there multiple methods of payment?  Yes, customers can pay their subscription fees using credit cards, PayPal, and pre-paid game cards, which can be purchased in many game and electronics stores.    Prepaid Game Cards make great gifts and are an easy way to create a new subscription or extend an existing one. These cards retail in most game stores for $29.99 and add 60 calendar days of play time to an account.      Can you quit at any time?  Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time from the Account Management page.      If you intend to purchase the game, I would recommend purchasing the World of Warcraft Battle Chest which costs $39.99 and includes:  1) The original World of Warcraft game  2) The Burning Crusade expansion  3) A World of Warcraft Strategy Guide from Brady Games  4) The Burning Crusade Strategy Guide from Brady Games    It is also possible to begin playing just by purchasing the original World of Warcraft game without any of the expansions; costing you $19.99 only. You'll not need to purchase The Burning Crusade expansion until you reach Level 60 and Wrath of the Lich King expansion only when you reach Level 70.    You might like to note that the original World of Warcraft game includes 30 days of game time; while no additional game time is provided when upgrading your account with The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King expansions.      Finally, should you still be keen in purchasing the game, please allow me to recruit you via the Recruit-A-Friend program (click on my avatar and check my profile to contact me). You'll receive a special trial Authentication Key that would provide you with 10 days of free game time and the recruiter would be rewarded 30 days of free game time after you purchase the game and begin your subscription. Thank you.|`|elPLFotOaa	you go and buy both the wow game and the expansion pack.go to best buy or something.you have better chances finding it there.  yes you can quit any time, by simply not paying the 15$ monthly.  and the card does...instead of paying and playing for monthly prices, you pay and play for the hours.  if you have any question just ask me.|`|IiPlkjNMaa	you can go month by month or buy 3 months, 6months, 1 year.  The longer you buy, the bigger discount you get.  I believe it's 15.95/mo for month by month & I would expect a dollar less for 3 months, 2 dollars less for 6mos.  You can quit at any time if you go month to month...they will expire your account at the end of the 30 days from which you purchased it.  A prepaid game card does nothing...it's mostly just used as a gift so someone can buy you more gametime for xmas/birthday.|`|ncs6NLVZaa	okay you buy the game and the expansion, then you pay 15$ online to play it, the cards work as a alternate for credit cards|`|rj8arBLgaa	u pay for wow eithe rby credit card (monthly) or a prepaid card, with a credit card u pay every month that u play, if u dont play a month u dont have to play for that month    a gamecard gives u a certain amout of time(a month 30 days etc.) to play without having to pay|`|qbzen2XYaa	OK... let me give you the real answer to this question..    FIRST of all...    If you dont own WoW yet, dont even consider buying the expansion parts yet, and here is why.    The original game, was designed to allow players to go to a level of 60 in the game..  It will take you a month or 2 to get to level 60.  Maybe even more, depending on how long you play.    At level 58, you can now go through the DARK PORTAL which is the entrance to the First expansion pack.  so when you get to be around level 50-55 or so, go and buy your expansion pack     You have to buy a key for each expansion.  So in order for you to play the newest content with the 2nd expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, You need to have the Original Game key, and the Burning Crusade Key in order to activate a Lich King Key on your account.    Now.  Since you can not even possibly entertain the thoughtof using the Burning crusade content until you get to level 58, dont waste your money and buy it yet.    Just get the original game, and level your character until you get close to Burning Crusade expansion.    Once you get there, unlock Burning crusade content with that key, whether you buy the digital key, or but an actual disk from a store, it doesnt matter.    Play from level 58 to level 68.    At level 68, you can unlock the newest game content from Lich King.  So then this is where i would suggest you go and purchase a STORE BOUGHT copy of the game.    The reason for this is if you have to reinstall the game at any point, you can reinstall all 3 games from the Lich King disk.    Also realize this...  With the release of Lich King, there is a new class of character called a Death Knight.  Once you reach level 55, you can unlock one of these characters.  These characters start out at level 55.  You will however need Lich King installed, so if you want to play a death knight, at level 55 when you can unlock it, you will want to purchase Burnign crusade and Lich King at the same time.  So to possibly save money.  Buy the digital key, and buy the store bought game for Lich King.  You will have NO REAL USE for a Blasted Crusade store bought disk if you immediately intend to upgrade to lich king.    Now for Payments....    World of Warcraft costs 15 bucks a month.  Most people pay for it with a credit card.  If you dont have a credit card, you can purchase game cards at stores like Game Stop, Wal mart etc.. Pretty much anywhere that sells Video games.  Game cards work just like prepaid phone cards etc.  You go to the WoW website, and in your account management, you need to scratch off the code and enter it from the back of the card.  Once you do this, you have 2 months of playing time, and the card is now useless.    Hope this information helps you.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	First off you need to go to the store and buy the game. That comes with I think 30 days of game time. I think the Expansions also come with another 30 days of game time, so buy the other 2, and you have about 3 months of play time. Once you use the time cards that much time is added to your account allowing you to play. When it runs out you have to buy another to continue playing. When you don't want to play just stop buying cards or paying on your credit card (if you subscribe that way), but you will not get a refund for unused game time.|`|MyqOdACOaa	u have to pay 30 bucks to get a game card then u get to play for 2 months so its 50 cents a day and if u do buy the game email me beacue i can send u a friend request so we can both get triple exp from monsters and quests then make and account with my code i gave you email me at albert.alar@yahoo.ca for more info i hope to hear from you soon thanks

MnEHO9u9aa	get a college education son|`|iH07L6iDaa	well there is this FREE website called sploder.com where you create your own video games (they do have a style though (your a robot or a spaceship) its pretty cool and not many people know of it i really like it (you may have been thinking of creating something like halo or something but its not like that)|`|3cQJhSqXaa	Go to college.    Edit: yarly|`|IgdbZvASaa	First step is getting a college education.    Making a video game is not as easy as saying "hey, I want to make a game" and buying a book that will teach you. It's a college level class that takes years of training and studying.|`|AQ9JxT5xaa	You need a good graphics card, like GeForce 8800, a lot of harddrive space, like 500-750 gb for saving files, and you need a lot of time.  Go to    http://www.stormthecastle.com/video-game...    for more info.  Oh yeah, you do need to go to college to learn how to write programs, actually program it, make models, and other stuff.
eHXZRohxaa	Yes! 9/10 times it will run off and you won't be able to do anything about it .Best thing to do is invest in a car saver/fail-safe, for $25 (Aus) you can save having to buy a new car. I had a Hobao Hyper 7 and on the third run it smashed into a brick wall and twisted the chassis + smash front shocks. For all the trouble it's worth getting a car saver. About the AM frequency I'm not sure but if you get a car saver both problems will be solved.  Cheers|`|GLtGTQ8maa	Where ever you were on the throttle and steering will either lock up or freak out.  They sell fail safes everywhere and it will return your car to an idle and apply break if you lose radio control.  It wont automatically go to full throttle though but it is possible.

I can't remember where I got it, but if I find it for you, I'll let you know. But there is a hack to let them hang around indoors during the daylight hours. :)

Then on the main menu you touch "Ranger Net", then you need to touch "Seek New Missions" .Then there will be a list of missions you can download. Touch Darkrai's mission which [i'm pretty sure is] "Liberate the Tower" . Yes you will need to have finished the game. But don't worry , the mission will stay in your game. When you have beaten the game you can acess it pressing, Ranger Net then Play a New Mission.   The mission is fairly easy .

eSu9ZX2Naa	to be honest yes it is.I have been a ps2 and ps1 fan forever lol, but xbox 360 just kicks ***!first of all,you will get 3 months  free online play which i think is the best experience ever. playing games on xbox live while u can talk to your team mate and opponents is very fun and interactive..so yea i think its worth getting it.unless you dont play much games anyways in which case its jus a waste of money lol|`|b6GLnqiSaa	I would definitely get the 360, a lot of fun games on it, you can watch movies and buy games straight from the console.|`|eE7Np0n6aa	Just getting the regular one Xbox 360.|`|23ef0a274eef4b558738966afa8236dcaa	no get a ps3 SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!!  I was a little nervous about spending 600 bucks but i dont regret it at all|`|4x9PBxAoaa	Definetly, I love xbox 360s. There a great investment.|`|yiZpsEYCaa	Xbox 360 is just great you can make your own avatar get achievements  play awesome games. The graphics are amazing. You should sell your ps2 for it because the graphics are twice as better, they have so much better games. Also, you could sell your ps2, games, controllers, etc. for even more money to get what you need for the xbox. If you like shooting games and you decide to get the xbox i recommend that you get Left 4 dead, call of duty 4 or 5. It is so worth it to buy a xbox 360 because like i said they are just great don't stop to think please. Just buy it :).|`|Bk7E7MYNaa	no trade in your game for a good time outside and live your life. games are imaginary.|`|LFDLpFq6aa	A Xbox 360 is Awesome! I think you should look into which games you like, because Xbox is more into shooting games and stuff, you should look what Xbox 360 and PS3 games you like more|`|9Ywbz5w3aa	for me i'd rather have a PS3.  but i've been a sony person all my life.  so, it depends if you really want one.      you could see if the games that they have are what you like as well.|`|SlkKa1jsaa	Dont sell your ps2 cause you can have alot of fun stlll,used games are very cheap.Id just wait a little longer to gather the money for the xbox.|`|PVc0gIeVaa	You have to get a PRO because if you geta regular one (ARCADE) then you won't have a hard drive.     Pro: 299   arcade:199  -hard drive(can burn cds and play music while you play games)  -extra memory( aracade only has a little)  lol i forgot but you safe a lot beacuse your gonna need a hard drive for XBOX LIVE.. but the pro comes with everthing trust me it's worth it.|`|0Gm0fTYIaa	yeah i think you should get one because of all the great things i have.  form video games to hd movies.etc.etc. but i have all three the ps3 the wii and the x box 360 and i love them. they all have something that's good about them. so it your pick this will be your gaming system.|`|rHJGqKQNaa	You won't get much for a PS2, save up a bit though, the 360 is definitely worth it.|`|idd2WUkNaa	You're gonna want the ones with the hard drives, which is any Xbox 360 that is NOT an Arcade or Core system. The harddrive allows you to download game content like more levels or song tracks. You can buy a hard drive later, but you're better off getting one with your console. Hard drives also let you run most Xbox Original games.    Here are the most recent Xbox 360s:    The Xbox 360 Elite comes with all HD cables you can think of and a 120GB harddrive and a headset.    The standard Xbox 360 comes with a 60GB HD and standard video cables that can be HD and a headset.     The arcade system has no Hard drive and only comes with standard definition cables.    All systems come with a wireless controller and Xbox Live Silver (not online play)    I have a 360 Elite and it looks awesome on my TV and the sound quality is amazing. Plenty of room for new Gears maps too!!!|`|hc8cNExFaa	I would get the Xbox 360 because it has amazing graphics!!! It's totally worth getting, and there are more hardcore games for it, totally recommended!|`|B7utlxNHaa	i would say yes because the ps2's graphics suck(if you care)and there are more game choices than the ps2  but, you won't get alot for the ps2 if it's been used.  -  hope i helped|`|sqaRnidQaa	xbox is only good if u have online. pro is good cuz you can play demos.if ur still only playing ps2 yea its time to step up n move on.|`|S5seUdSRaa	personally if i were you i would go with the PS3, that way you can do almost everything a 360 can do plus you can still play you PS2 games... BTW PS3 IS better then xbox ;)|`|3P9w01Y7aa	yes it is worth it. it comes with a 20gb hard drive already whereas the regular comes with nothing. that right there is enough for me.|`|Knl3CYX4aa	Depends if you are actually interested in any of the exclusives that the x360 has to offer. Also there is a large price difference in what you will get for your PS2 and a Xbox 360. Take a look at some of the games that the 360 has to offer and make the decision based on that. In the end it is your system and your money. Good Luck.|`|dSvXWPiJaa	360 and iliam a most people do have a life and do other stuff but video games are fun when you are bored.
qVuYGiF2aa	I bet it is but if the DS and the PC version are the same i'm guessing that the PS2 theme will be the same or a little bit more harder.|`|CcFH0TLzaa	doubt it cause they have to minimize the game a lot on the DS so its probably gonna be different but the comp. might be the same

As for the online glitches and all ... ALL GONE ! the only one left is the glitch letting u smoke gernade yourself through the lasers in security, remember that gears of war update like a few weeks ago?  it was like 10 seconds long and it fixed alot more things   check it out     http://kotaku.com/5136028/gears-of-war-2...|`|KtsOtRiPaa	The story line of that game is amazing.

They Shouldn't Have Downgraded the Shotgun.    Blind Fires Suck.|`|qHhtqoM1aa	The online is a disappointment i will agree with you there, but i wouldn't say its the biggest let down ever. What i found disappointing was that yes, they pro bally did just tweak things up a tad, but hey, you got to agree its still a Pretty kick *** game. Its not the greatest game ever, its not even that close but its pro bally right up there with Halo 3, and all the other good ones.

Rise of the Dragon Lords.  It's got some pretty good cards in it that would help your deck. You should get it if you already haven't. Also, you should take out 1 Spear dragon and magna drago and swap them with a D.D. warrior lady and Decoy Dragon. Maybe Chainsaw insect too, it's draw a card effect is to high a price to pay for a monster like that...     Another point I very very highly recommend is taking out royal decree and some magics and putting in cards like divine wrath, threatening roar, sakuretsu armor, and negate attack for stalling and defense. Defense is extremely important in yugioh because it usually takes a little time to set up the field the way you want it and then keep it that way.     And to argue with the "strong offense is a best defense" trick, offense is all about getting your field set up SAFELY the way you want it. And that's impossible if you just let your opponent do wat they want...    Good luck when dueling and have fun with your deck.  :D
7eIp8POXaa	Add summond skull somewhere.  Your deck is already very good.Hope this helped.

qHhtqoM1aa	Well i was just playing it and i realized something.  If you don't like blood, or gore. No. Because that's what this game is all about. Its also a very depressing game. Every where you look there is a dead body, destroyed buildings, and many other things that you would find depressing. And i just realized you already know this because you have it for 360. Alright well for the pc its alright you could say. I myself don't like the Controls but hey, its different for everybody. I would recommend it because yes, its a very good game, the graphics are Beautiful, and if you liked (played) oblivion you will love this game.|`|KtsOtRiPaa	I have it for the 360, and i love it, and cant wait for the 3 DLC's coming out this month, next month. and march. The pc is getting them too though. But i enjoy it on the 360, you dont have the temptation of cheating and hacking and crap. the geck would be nice, but it would make the game to easy in my opinion, like, quest making wise. it would be fun to make cities though.|`|Uyo1W3p4aa	Its average rating is a 9/10 on PC. It's fun to play, but not the best, although it's definitely worth your money.    GameSpot:    The Good-   1. Freedom to explore what you want, when you want.       2. Fantastic, intricate quests can be completed in a variety of satisfying ways.       3. VATS combat system results in all sorts of tense and gruesome encounters.     4. Outstanding art design makes for a desolate DC.     5. Rewarding mixture of excitement and atmospheric exploration.    The Bad-    1. The story and characters can feel a bit sterile.    2.Combat feels mildly clunky.|`|CcFH0TLzaa	let me get this straight you want to have two copies of the same game?|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	The PC version looks way better than either console. There are lots of mods available, and the GECK is fun to play with. In your situation I'd wait until I beat it on the 360 then hopefully it will come down in price and mess around with the mods on PC, they will only get more plentiful and better in time.|`|2ha67LmPaa	i dont have the game my self but if i were you, i would be patient and wait until your done with the 360 one, then get the pc one, play that and then compare. that easy!

eHXZRohxaa	Trucks do tend to roll a bit more but you can run em easier in more places. If you can try to stick away from HSP. i've had bad expeirences with hsp replacing parts all the time things just brake on them so easily. i'd probably get the truck but just make sure you can contact the seller easily .If theres no phone contact i wouldn't touch there products.  G luck|`|8oYZXOdCaa	How big is the truck's engine?  I would pick the truck because even though they are a little more expensive, they are usually 4x4 and have more suspension.  It depends on what you are doing.  I would say the buggies are better for racing because they are lower to the ground.

SkpRC2Nmaa	Check if the site bellow helps you    http://faqs.ign.com
mHWsuqjZaa	Ok... um. this deck needs alot of work. Use 3 junk synchrons and 3 junk warriors. Use 3 speed warriors and nitro Synchrons aswell because of junk warriors effect. Krebons, thats ok 3 is good. take out LADD, D.D. Warrior lady, cyber dragon, Mask of darkness, spell striker and 1 of your jinzos. So your monsters should look something like this:  Monsters:   Junk synchron x3   Speed warrior x3   Nitro Synchron x3   Gorz the Emissary of Darkness   Jinzo   Caius the shadow monarch   dark resonator X2   Krebons x3   sangan   breaker magical warrior   mystic tomato   skelengel   spirt reaper   neo spacian gran mole    So thats 20 monsters. Now for spells. They look good except i would take out 1 soul exchange and put in another enemy controller. Traps, wow. Um, keep mirror force, scrap iron scarecrow, and the torrential tribute. I would put in 3 solemn judgment, 2 pheonix wing wind blast, and a trap dustshoot. So the traps should look kind of like this:  Traps:   Solemn Judgment x3   Scrap iron scarecrow   Mirror force   torrential tribute   pheonix wing wind blast x2   trap dustshoot    and last but not least your synchros. They are not that bad, but they could be alot better. Try to use these:   Junk warrior x3   Stardust Dragon x2   Red Dragon Archfiend x2   Nitro Warrior x3   Magical Android   Thought Ruler Archfiend x2   Colossal Fighter x2    So your deck should be cut back to 41 cards now and it will be a hell of alot better than before.|`|zDGIjehgaa	its ok........ but    i wouldn't say that its that great, i think u need a lot of work on it

YM6MrT8Xaa	try reloading the most recent save or leave and reenter. Failing that, type "tcl" in the console and walk through the wall. I'd also say put a few rounds in the kid's face, but it'd just be wasting ammo since he won't die.
rP1OWD38aa	The Art of Polymer Clay Millefiori Techniques: Projects and Inspiration for Creative Canework by Donna Kato   would be the first book I recommend for canes. (you can find it on Amazon.com both new and used and probably EBay as well.)    But, honestly, you really wouldn't have to buy a book unless you felt it necessary.  There is a ton (and I do mean a ton) of information on how to make polymer clay canes on the internet.  You Tube, expert village, wonderhowto and a host of other sites have specific instruction on making very simple (newcomer) canes to those that are extremely intricate and will blow you away. I would suggest that you go to Google and just do a search for 'polymer clay cane making' and just go down the list.  Make sure you open a folder in your "Bookmarks" for all of the bookmarks you're going to want to save. :)    Enjoy!

I have been playing diamond since 2007 and i had no problems at all.   But if you mean your playing the D/P ROM in an emulator in your pc then no you can't trade them
TibS1kUqaa	I would suggest using only psychic pokemon. You can find several on the ship.    Good luck capturing it.    Here's a tip.    keep drawing circles in a corner away from Drapion and send the rings at Drapion, and then, draw circles around the paralyzed Drapion.     Also, if it's using it's several poison cloud attack, every time before it does it, circle around it once, it makes it easier.

idd2WUkNaa	Should be on the Playstation Store, but I don't think that they released a demo for it. The reason that they didn't release a demo for it on PS3 is because most people play on Xbox 360s and PC and most game companies won't go through all the work to get the demos running on all platforms, they just go for the most profitable one (Xbox 360)|`|NQYJZqUCaa	cant even if u want to play for pc u cant cuz the real games is out same for xbox 390

But note what she says about these: While the instructions are very detailed, this is a challenging pattern.    If you know how to use your loom, you should be able to make these. They are fairly simple, although they do take some time.  I think I'd rather do them with needles instead; it would go faster.    The looms are good for some things, but they can't do everything.  However, it is fairly easy to take any knitting pattern and just do it on the loom.  Stitches are still the same, no matter how you do them.    Stripes are very simple, and chevrons can be very simple too, depending on which ones you are doing.  Give it a try.
jz0YekUEaa	definatly! im thinking 4 or 5 years for it but yep. definatly. cuz grandtheft outo 4 is already kinda like that except not mmorpg and its not time activated unless you think about the muscle part.|`|nSlca3vvaa	Sounds to me like a mixture of Harvest Moon and GTA =P|`|KtsOtRiPaa	Man, I am not sure about making it like GTA, but, a MMO based off of Fallout would be amazing. Like you can build your character offline, and then take it online or something like that. Show off your stuff. But if it was like that, building offline, and playing online, it could be like GTA. Either way it would be tight.

If this program doesn't take your fancy, You can make a Deck using any card right away with the next program. But its a lot less designed and doesn't have random Duelers.     http://www.xerocreative.com    The program is small and uses the same system as IRC.  -  Dueling using MSN... sounds hard. Even if you were the only person to Duel with I don't think I would resort to Dueling like that... =\ I did that once for a card game long ago and I never want to do it again...

qP7HuJovaa	what do you mean by speed, how many it shoots a second, or the velocity? for speed take off the grips(gun on) and you will see a button, press it to turn a light on (this shows youve entered programming mode), then press the button until the light turns red and is in a three blinking pattern (like ...   ...  ...  ...  ) then start pushing the power button, this will lower the shooting speed. the yellow three blinking will increase it. then pull the trigger to save the settings. for velocity you have to have a wrench, there is a nut on the bottom of the regulator that you screw/unscrew. turn this counter clockwise to decrease the velocity. do opposite to increase.
