20090226130747AA981ha	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When you were first pregnant,?	Did you have any CM changes?   I am trying my hardest not to get my hopes up again since ttc for 18 months. but when you first found out you were pregnant, did you notice and Cm changes or anything?   I am on CD 28 out of a 30-33 day cycle and for about a week now i have been EXTREMELY wet "down there" (sorry tmi) now this is odd for me because i am pretty much ALWAYS dry. we tried pre-seed this month for that purpose. also while taking a shower i noticed my breast were really ugly due to blue veins everywhere. they are also a bit sore but to much. wondering if this could possibly mean this is our month?   ill test on CD 30 or 33 if AF hasent showed but in the mean time i was just curious?   thanks!!

20090226131330AAulDeO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I just feel so bad sometimes, that when I had my babies(over 20 years ago), I'm old) I was stressed and upset?	I read about how happy new mothers usually are( and that's great), and i feel so guilty that i spent most of the time being depressed and unable to cope.   I really believe now, that I had post-natal depression, but didn't know what to do. My girls are now in their 20's, I just feel guilty that I was such a bad mum- I was usually grumpy a lot when they were little.   I hope any new mothers to be are a lot happier than I was- also, it's not that they weren't wanted, they were, it's just that I was so stressed

20090226131515AAI4ReL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby feeding at 4 weeks?	My baby girl is currently feeding approx every 4 hours although is not in a routine and so is not at set times.  However, she is taking about 150-170ml each time (5-6oz).  I know this is a lot for her age but when I asked the health visitor and dr they say that if she needs it to give it to her.  But she can have 170ml and still cry and root for more.  Is this normal?  I am worrying about over feeding her.  People have said that shouldnt happen as she will only take what she needs but am concerned after reading other questions that she is having way too much.  She has silent reflux (shes not sick) and maybe this is making it worse.        Does anyone else feel constantly guilty about everything!!! lol
20090226131451AAwU8rj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Please help me toilet train my 2 year old before my new baby comes!?	My daughter turned 2 in December. BEFORE we went on Christmas vacation, she was using the potty although she didn't like Pullups and still wanted to wear diapers. She would sit on the potty whenever I asked her if she needed to go and it was something she pretty much enjoyed doing. Well along with her sleep schedule Christmas totally destroyed any progress we made. Now she hates the potty. She sits on it playing around with her diaper on when I use the bathroom. She is pretty smart for her age and when I ask her if she's ready to use the potty instead of her diapers she says NO. We were making such progress before Christmas. Now I'm half my normal self due to all day morning sickness. I've lost a lot of weight and I'm weak not just physically but mentally as well. It's hard to wrestle with her over just every day things, let alone trying to help her learn the potty. She is very hardheaded.... that is the nicest way I can put it. lol. I would really appreciate any help. I know the key is persistence but goodness it is a battle to get her to eat or even get her dressed and honestly it is really, really hard. It's me and her all day until my husband gets home around 6.

20090226131505AAXlRMr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 31 weeks and doctors say the baby is too small?	I'm 31 weeks pregnant and i just went to the doctor yesterday. I was told that they would have to make another ultrasound appointment becasue the baby is rather on the small side (she said 20% tile or something) What can I do or eat to help him get bigger. About 3 weeks ago they said the baby's body is 2 weeks behind then at a regualr appointment this week when my stomach was measure they said it was only one weeks behind-but then i had another ultra sound done (for another reason) and THAT doctor wrote me up for another appointment becasue she thinks the baby is too small. I'm hoping to carry for 42 weeks so the baby can be for surely helathy but as low as he's sitting (and the women on my side of the family) I'm afraid 'll go into labor 2 weeks early like my mother and becasue of my size and the risk of my baby being a premie or having complications. Please, any and all informaion will be greatly appreciaited!   Thank you

I'm so grateful to be having a shower and all, but i'm a little concerned. I told my mom I would like to have a "Supplies Raffle" (like the diaper raffle.. bring a pack of diapers and get entered to win a 30$ gift certificate to target) The only difference is we're using cloth diapers, so I thought wipes, lotion, snappies, and baby laundry detergent would be a fine alternative. My mom told me that people might "get confused, and that would be all I ended up getting."  What do you think?        Also, what types of food would you serve at a shower?  My mom is convinced a chicken casserole is a good dish.. but I would prefer something that didn't require heating, such as pasta salad or a giant sub.  I'm very grateful to be having this shower, don't get me wrong!  I just feel like my ideas should be considered.

20090226131954AAqVGO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has your baby started doing anything recently because they know it gets your attention?(apart from crying)?	Im having a little trouble with my 9 month old, she has a bad cold and cough atm and isn't settling or sleeping very well at night, i have been to see the doc and they have said its viral so we just need to ride it out.   Anyway since she has had this cold she has decided its fun to flip round onto her tummy while in her cot trying to go to sleep (baring in mind she HATES being on her tummy), she then starts moaning because she doesn't like it so i go in and move her onto her back and within minutes she back on her tummy. Its kind of cute as when she hears me come into the bedroom she wiggles around and smiles. I think its now more of a ' i know if i do this mummy will come and see me' thing.   So my Q is, has your baby started doing anything recently because they know it gets your attention? (apart from crying that is, lol)

20090226134836AAShbXH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How to deal with my unvaccinated child and her school?	My daughter is 21 months old.  I have not given her any vaccinations because of the autism scare.  After researching the issue I discovered that the chance of getting autism, regardless of the cause, is higher then getting one of the diseases that are vaccinated for.  The likelyhood of death as a result of these diseases are even lower.  It seemed to me that, if autism is caused by vaccinations, it is more dangerous to have the vaccinations then to not have them.  My husband and I are still discussing whether we want to have her get them, or some of them, now that she is a little older - her body, perhaps, better able to handle all the 'poison'.  If she doesn't have any by the time she starts school how do I handle it.  I live in Nevada.  She will be going to a Montessori charter school but I believe it would be handled the same way as public school, they receive public funding so they have to go by state rules.

My husband and I had sex for nearly a week straight during my ovulation.  My last period was Feb 2nd(first day) and it is due on March 3rd(ish) but now I have some signs of pregnancy (I think) the one that really sticks out is I am really wet down there, I guess the technical term is cervical mucas, although I can't see anything in my underwear.  I am usually incredibly dry and want nothing to do with sex, now i seem to not get enough (sorry so descriptive) Lastly, I am having period like cramp stomach aches.  Also, my nipples are really sensitive.  Does this sound like pregnancy to you?

20090226105816AAVVAB4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you do when you have to leave the pediatrician you love?	We moved to a new county and the health insurance I have for my son changes county to county. I called to inform the insurance company of my change of address, and it now changes my health insurance coverage to a new company. It used to be United Healthcare and now it’s another company.       I called my son’s pediatrician’s office to ask if they took his new insurance. And they DO NOT! I’m crushed about this. Like seriously, almost in tears over it.       Our doctor has been our pediatrician since birth. When we moved up here I was 8 months pregnant and knew nobody. We came across this doctor because he was the pediatrician in the hospital and we needed to choose one before they’d release my newborn. We have grown to just ADORE this pediatrician!       My son is now 2 yrs old and I have to change now???      What do I do? I mean, I could try to find new insurance but I doubt I can find affordable insurance at this same rate. (I pay $159 a month and nothing during visits or any prescriptions)      I’m so sad about this. I know it might seem silly to some people but I’m just heartbroken.       Have any of you been through this before??

20090226110151AATNqmU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	As a parent, what would you do if..?	You have a daughter, aged 15, who has been bullied since she was 8.    She's always been shy, she finds it hard to make friends.    Recently, her only friends planned to beat her up, because of some rumors. After they ended the friendship, they found out the rumors weren't true, and tried to apologize, but your daughter will not accept them as she is in shock that the people she trusted her life with, planned to attack her.   Imagine, now, she's getting help with trying to get back into school (She hasn't been for 6 months),..   what would you do if..?   she never go's outside, she cries in her sleep, she walks around like a zombie, she doesn't show affection towards anyone, she cant trust anyone, she smokes cigarettes, she refuses to get counselling, trying to go to a different school is stressing her out, she has had major depression for 6 months?      what would you do?

20090226104425AAWS5r2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could these be early signs of pregnancy?	I'm 4 dpo according to my chart...but I believe I ovulated twice this cycle(runs in the family) so I would actually be 6 dpo according to first ovulation. Ever since last night I have been burping like mad! I normally rarely burp, and I actually have a hard time getting to burp usually when I actually have to. But today they just keep coming. I am burping at least once every 2-5 minutes. My head feels extremely fuzzy and I've been getting farely bad dizzy spells this morning. I also had a very sharp pulling pain in my right abdomen this morning, and some light cramping. I also woke up at 3 am to a pulling cramp between my stomach and my thigh.....like between the crease between your stomach and thigh. I also was very emotional this morning when my husband was cranky. He is almost always cranky in the morning so this doesn't normally bother me much, but I just stated bawling this morning.....basically, I just don't feel right. Could I be experiencing pregnancy symptoms so early? What do you think? At points I feel like I'm about to start my period and run to the bathroom to check, but nope. Plus it's not due for at least 7 days. I'm still getting random light sharp pains in my right abdomen.

20090226111138AALVCsY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think a child molester.....?	Child molesters know what they are doing to be wrong, and if they know.. do you think they just can't control themselves? If they have no had therapy and just can't control themselves should they be blamed for their actions? I mean.. I personally think  child molester/rapist should get the death penalty simply because they ruined someones life. But I'm always asking myself if my feelings are justified. This person could have had the same thing done to them as a child and there for it's a learned compulsion, so... is it reallllyyy their fault? Who else agrees that they should get the death penalty or life in prison? To me it's equal to murder, or worse. And who here will also agree that the penalty for these crimes are not harsh enough?

20090226124016AA7JhCa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can it take only one day for a child to develop a genital yeast infection?	My daughter, who is 7 months old, was sent with her father for one full day over the weekend with a clean private area. When he brought her back to me the day after he picked her up, she had such a horrible rash, that when i wiped her she screamed and cried like i have never heard before. Her father is 19 years old and very immature and doesn't have the knowledge to take care of her. That's my opinion. Every time he picks her up I have to write down what she eats, when she eats, how much to feed, how often, when she needs a bottle, when she naps, and when she goes to bed for the night. It's pathetic! I mean any mother in my situation would think the same. You have to know these things about your child! So I called her doctor yesterday and told them the rash was terrible. I took her in to the doctor today and the doctor told me it's a bad yeast infection. I asked him how it would have happened and he said she sat in a dirty diaper too long. I figured it was her father's fault. In fact, I was sure. He perscribed her an anti-fungal cream that is suppose to be put on with powder. So, my question is, does it seem to anyone else that My daughter's Biological father is neglecting her needs?

Before heading over there, I was talking to my bestfriend about possibly getting another u/s to confirm the baby is still a girl. I found out at 17wks3dys. The tech (who apparently was a doctor) said she was 99.9% positive it was a girl. However, I've heard many stories of girls turning into boys. So I brought it up w/ the new doc. She said she knows all of the doctors at the place I went to personally & she has NEVER known them to get it wrong. She said they would NOT say anything if they weren't absolutely sure. I felt reassured, but still requested another u/s. She said she couldn't bc my insurance may not allow too many ultrasounds & I will need the ones I get at the end. Made sense, but then I thought of 3D u/s's. The doc's office has a coupon for one for $99.       So I called Daddy. Told him my fears & what the doc said & brought up the 3D u/s. He said it was a waste of money bc we see her on the sono's every other time we go. I got really upset bc he's about to get a tattoo this weekend & I said "That's NOT wasting money, but seeing our first child is!?!?!!?"      I really don't know what to do.      THANKS!

20090226132916AAYxAN3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Making soy milk taste better?	My son is 17 months old. He has been on whole milk since he was a year old. He has been having a lot of problems with having very hard bowel movements and he is getting fissures from pushing so hard. I took him to the pediatrician a couple of weeks ago and he put my son on Colace, which is a stool softener, but it hasn't really helped. He also suggested switching him from whole milk to soy milk. I bought some soy milk but my son will not drink it. The doctor thinks the whole milk may be to harsh on his stomach. So, will it make any difference if I mix half and half of soy and whole milk? And, what can I do to make the soy milk taste better?
20090226132115AAqJjO8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Ethical kind of question...?	My youngest daughter's grandmother just called me to tell me when she was going to be picking up my daughter for their family visit this weekend.. She also informed me that her son had lost his job last Thursday or so..      This, of course means that I will not be getting any kind of child support until he gets a new job, or is approved for unemployment (almost a month in that case).      She told me that if I needed anything for my youngest child (diapers, etc.) that she would provide it for me... Now here is my question..       If she does provide something for me should I report it to the child support office as "child support" or would this not be considered any kind of child support?      I ask this because she already provides diapers, clothes and so on and so forth for when Ruth is at her home.

She did it again today, and I was FREAKING out. Does anything like this happen to anyone? It's scares the crap out of me. Just today too, she banged her head off the floor purposely because I took something she shouldn't of had away from her. It's the first time she has ever done this. I'm worried about that too, because she hits it pretty hard off the floor.. and we have tiles. Should I be talking to my doctor about what's going on?       Thanks

20090226131828AA7JGDf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What would your feelings be if your Dr wanted you to take a pregnancy test now?	I was having some bad cramps in my abdomen last night & the Dr said come down so he could have a feel (lol)      He said it was too high to be baby related but asked if I could be pregnant - I answered that its not beyond the realms of possibility but it is unlikely - he wasn't happy with how long its been since my last period (even though I told him I am b'feeding) so he said, do a test in the morning and call me with the result.      Well, I was in a right panic - my son is 7mos, and whilst I'd love another soon, my plan was not quite yet - afterall I am not returning to work until June so It'd hardly be worth going back & I couldn't face my boss's disapproval.      So, I was like a schoolgirl doing the test - shaking, feeling sick etc      I am not pregnant but it got me wondering - how would you be feeling if that happend to you tomorrow say?

20090226132855AANUR5G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is my mom being ridiculous?	I'm in the 9th grade, and I'm supposed to graduate next year unless I change my mind. I've always had straight A's, but this year I'm taking like, 3 or 4 Ap courses, and I have Algebra 2 and Pre-Calc.. So it's a lot of work. I missed a lot of days because of my pregnancy.. I still have all A's except I have a B in Algebra 2.. And my mom's keeping yelling at me for it. She says sh*t like, if I get a B I'll end up a hobo, and my step-dad who already is mean to me, is saying like, "Oh, you had time to get pregnant." It pisses me off, and I don't think it's that horrible.. The quarter isn't even over and it's the only B I've ever had. It's not that I'm not trying.. Just hard when I'm absent a lot and yeah... Do you think it's that bad if I get all A's and a B in Algebra 2, or would that be as bad as my parents seem to think?   Thanks.. -x-

20090226133340AABdXzN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I potty train my daughter outside of the house?	I am in the midst of potty training my daughter (she's 21 months).  She is doing very well inside the house and has been using the potty with minimal accidents.  When we are at home I don't put any pants on her at all and when she has to use the potty she goes and sits down, but she doesn't often tell me she has to go potty, which I'm assuming is essential to getting her "fully" potty trained when we are out of the house.        I know potty training is a long process and I'm not rushing her along, but I just wanted some advice on where to start as far as getting her to potty train out of the house and using big kid underwear.  Any advice would be appreciated.

20090226134534AA79q2i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Serious question - If you were me and miscarried at 19 weeks.....?	... Touch wood none of you do! But what I mean is....      Tommorow will be exactly one month since I lost my baby girl due to an infection in my womb - which sent me into labour (Most of you know this though)      My question is.. I work on a delivery suite, I also do work for the ante-natal clinic and both the ante/post-natal wards. I have been off sick for 4 weeks since my baby died.      I tried going back on weds - but it hit me really hard bringing all the memories back (I lost her in that hospital and her body is still there!)       So I phoned in today saying I couldn't go in, and I am also having tommorow off.      The co-ordinator was really pissed and made me feel stupid for having 4 weeks off over this. Yet one of the pregnant staff has been off for 20 weeks with depression.      I am in tears now and just don't know what to do my whole life is falling apart I can't afford to leave this job and can't transfer to another ward.      Please please just tell me how long you would expect to take off work if you were in my shoes? Am I being silly and 4 weeks was plenty of time???
20090226140045AAyBdaL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	If the Mother of your child was breaking the law...?	by receiving welfare and public housing and NOT claiming other income she was receiving would you report her?       This is not me, I work and am married, this is something my brother in law is struggling with. I guess this is one of those questions I want others who are out side the situation to input on. He is stressed out and been asking his brother and I for advice.      His ex is on welfare, and lives in public housing but she does NOT report the income she gets by having her brother live with her and pay her rent. My brother in law shares 50/50 custody with his 8 year old daughter and does not want to disrupt his daughters home life when she is with her mother, yet he does not want his daughter to think it is ok to rip off the government and commit fraud.   If she is reported she could lose her home and income, and maybe even jail time.       He  would love to have his child full time but he is military and gets sent away so 50 /50 when he is home works best.  Even though he has joint custody he still pays his ex support. She does not work at all, even tho she is only 32 and has the one child.

20090226135221AAu42Tv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can an OB REFUSE to give you an IUD?	My doctor refuses to give anyone an IUD. He put me on YAZ, even though I told him I always get horrible side effects from the pills. I asked for an IUD and he said I didn't need one. Anyway, while he was on vacation I called because I stopped taking my pills cause I was having vaginal dryness, lowered sex drive, and extreme irritability..and they told me to come in and see the nurse practitioner. She told me that I was a perfect candidate for an IUD but that she'd have to put it in and just not tell the doctor...apparently she does this with all his patients that want an IUD cause he refuses to put one in for anyone cause HE doesn't agree with them. Can he really refuse a form of birth control if a woman asks for it considering it's HIS job as an obgyn?

My husband and I both had a small bug the other day and were both throwing up w/ diarrhea and slight fevers, so I'm afraid he might be getting sick.  Also he isn't sleeping as much as he was before, like hes still sleeping all day but more awake during the day time. Sorry if this doesn't make any sense, but is this all normal with newborns, looking kinda exhausted?

I thought she was ready to drop her nap but when I let her go without it one day we were both miserable until she went to sleep. She was really irritable.

Its my first child so I'm still learning how all this works.    I was at an appointment for my son at the clinic and their nutritionist came to talk to me and give advice on what I should feed him and such. Her advice seemed a little strange though.      Tell me if this sounds right, REMEMBER he JUST turned One.       1>. He should be COMPLETLY off the bottle and on sippy cups..absolutly no more nipples   2> He should only have 10-12 ounces of milk in a 24 hour period. Only 4 oz of juice in a 24 hour period and the rest of the time it should be water.   3> When he eats or drinks, he should always be in a highchair..   Even if he just wants something to drink, I have to put him in the highchair.    She told me that I should NOT hold him at all when he is eating or drinking at all.    5> Nothing at all, even to drink before bed...except maybe water, and even then I have to put him in the highchair...no sippy cups or bottles should go in bed with him.

Well, I told myself I wouldn't get on here and ask questions just to get false hope... But here I am! I can't help it!! I hate the dreaded 2ww!!!       Okay, so my question is about implantion. I think I'm 5-7 dpo. Yesterday and today I have been having some cramping that feels like period pains. My boobs have been a little sore and feel full and heavy. Both of these symptoms I get before I start AF too. But its still to early for AF. So I thought maybe it could be implanting? But how long do you cramp from implanting? A few hours, days, weeks? Have any of you started cramping at about 6dpo and ended up being pregnant? I have also felt a little sick today, but it might just be in my head.. Thanks alot girls, its nice to have such a good group of people to talk to! Thanks and lots of baby dust!!!! xxxx

20090226132727AA0R95j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Am I the only one who thinks this is wrong? Help Please!?	Okay, so my best friend (let's call her Amy) and I are always on Y!A's Religion and Spirituality section. If you've ever been there you'll know that there are a lot of dumb people on there that ask stupid, un-serious questions. Long story short-at lunch i said "97% of people in that section are ignorant."   Amy said, "I'm part of the good 3% right?"   "Yeah. Sometimes you have ignorant questions like that video about hell. But besides that you're okay.'      She didn't seem upset about it at all but I just read (like 5 minutes ago) 2 questions that she wrote about me on here!       My question is: Wasn't Amy wrong to write a question to people she doesn't even know instead of talking to me about it? I JUST found out and I feel so bad. I really didn't mean to offend her with my comment, plus Amy and I usually joke like that a lot.   What do I do? Am I overreacting?

What if it was a family member?       The reason i ask this question is because  i myself after 2 yrs have never been invited into my Boyfriends mothers apt. Ever since we have found out we are expecting he always volunteers his mother for babysitting.     I really would prefer that we spend our time with our son doing things as a family.       He always says that i am using our son as a weapon by not letting her  babysit. Which its more his mom doesn't have the best track record,    she's a heavy smoker,    she drank at her own daughters sleep over and ended up getting into a physical fight with her then trashy b/f.    Also she co babysits with her neighbor , who i know nothing about  I don't want a stranger watching my child, His mother might as well be a stranger since like i said i have only seen her 3 times.       thank you for taking the time to read and give feedback :)

We decided to let him cry it out. It worked like magic and he is leeping 8 hours straight before he needs a bottle. But i have one question:   When he goes to sleep at night he has a very good routine,dim light, book, bath , bottle and off to bed at 8:30pm  I burp him and put him in his crib drowsy biut not fully asleep....he doses of byhimslef.    In the morning he has cereal and 3 hours later a bottle then a nap...at 3pm another bottle and off to bed....      SO my question is....with the cry it out method do i have to eliminate those feedings that make him drowsy and help him fall asleep??? I am scared he starts to wake up again needing that bottle to fall asleep......he has been sleeping 8 hours straight for over a week now.

I was on levlenED (the pill) for about a month, over this period of time i gained an excessive amount of weight, i felt depressed and moody all of the time. so about 2 weeks ago i stopped taking it.      Over the last weekend;   Friday, Saturday, Sunday i had unprotected sex (with my boyfriend) .   He "blew" every time.         I took the morning after pill on Monday and the 2nd dose on Tuesday but i'm  afraid i may be a little too late.         Over the last week i have experienced spotting (i've heard this can be a sign of early early pregnancy) but i also heard this can be caused by the morning after pill.         Now i am experiencing severe leg cramps at night, where my leg locks up and is very painful to move, it takes about 5minutes and then my leg will be fine. (first it was the right leg, now the left it changes nightly)         I have become very stressed which has;      *caused me to loose my apetetite      *caused my hair to fall out      *has made me extremely moody.

Good question, but its too late now please save the "omg your so dumb" remarks.      *He is my boyfriend, i love him.he loves me;         *NO the blood is not my period, I am not due..and the spotting is ultra light.            :) thankyou. please reply;;
20090226135958AA8blh7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I be pregnant after being off the pill for 1 month?	Ok so here's my story, I was on birth control for about 8 years and my husband and I decided that we would like to start trying to conceive so I finished my last pack of pills (had period Jan 25th and ended 29th), then instead of starting my new pack, I just stopped them all together.  Then on Feb 22nd (which would have been the day I normally would've gotten my period if I was on the pill), I got it but it was very different this time.  Very light period, barely bled at all, more reddish brown blood than bright red.  I've been super hungry at all times of the day, I've had headaches every single day, my stomach feels hard and very bloated, my pants fit a little tighter than usual, extremely tired all the time, and my body temp is all out of whack, feel like a low grade fever all the time.  We had sex Feb 3rd, 6th and 7th; then didn't anymore in Feb because he was away.  Is it possibile that I could be pregnant already?  I took a hpt and it came up negative.  Please help!  I've never been off the pill before so I'm very confused.  I just feel different, I know my body and something feels off.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

20090226142521AA1fde1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I deal with an ultra nosy mother?	I'm 15 years old, and as far back as I remember, my mother has always put herself in the center of anything dealing with me. Okay, maybe as a young child, I understand--it's essential to be involved in such a manner.      But now my mother feels as though she has to know exactly everything about me at all times. Say, I got into an argument with a friend at school, and she overheard me mentioning it to my brother. She will demand for me to explain detail by detail what happened, THEN she will call the other person and ask what happened! (or worse, actually go to their house)      If she walks in on my younger brother and I laughing and snickering about something, she will demand for us to tell her what we're talking about...and will actually stand and fold her arms until we give her the full scope of the conversation.      One time, someone called and my brother answered, then said to me, "It's (whoever)--he doesn't sound too happy." My mother immediately jumped up, grabbed the phone out of my hand, and said "Hello? This is his mother. Is there a problem? What's going on?" Talk about embarrassment!      Another time, I was talking on the phone, and I said "Well, that was pretty sleazy of him to do." My mother immediately muted the television set, picked up the other phone, and listened in.      If I ever get a letter, she opens it, reads it, and asks questions about it. Or if I'm out and I happen to run into someone I know and we start talking, she'll come over and stand next to me as we talk.      I gave up writing poetry because she always demands to see what I'm writing, like I'm formulating a terrorist attack. And worse yet, she'll ask me to explain the writing, and why I feel that way.      Another time, I was at a neighbor's house visiting with the teens there, and the mother called the police to report a theft from her yard. Minutes later after the patrol car pulled up into their driveway, my mother pops up saying, "What's going on? Is my son involved in something?"      I really can't take this anymore! I *am* 15, don't I deserve a LITTLE bit of privacy without Mommy Dearest butting in and demanding the full scoop of who it was I waved to on 3rd Street, and how I know him and where I met him? Christ!      How do I deal with this?

20090226143722AA5HufI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have a boyfriend, but I still have feelings for another guy.?	I know that sounds horrible. Okay here it goes, I use to live in washington and there was this guy I feel for...HARD. I have never had feelings for another person like that. The thing is we never even dated, he didn't like me like that. Well actually he told me he did but he couldn't because his friend liked me and blah blah.      Anyways he broke my heart and I cried over him so much. Well I moved to a different state and I haven't seen him in like a year. I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 months and I really like him and care about him, but at the same time I haven't been able to get over that other guy and just get him out of my head. I don't know what to do...Should I tell my boyfriend? Should I just wait it out and hope that soon he will become a distant memory? I just want to get over him and go on with my life, but I am not sure if this will become a problem in the future...

I hate when ppl do things like that... that wasn't the question. If u don't like the name just don't answer the question. I think it's cute.      but anyway, what are some cute, not so common middle names that would go nice w/ Roman. I thought of Emanuelle or Isabella or Sasha (but Sasha doesn't rlly sound right) but for some reason I can't think of anymore rlly good ones. please help.      btw, it can't rhyme (like Jaidyn or Katelyn). and i think longer names (like Emanuelle and Isabella) sound better with it than shorter names. and please don't let it be one of those names that everyone has like Jessica or Ashley.      any other advice, (nice) cmnts, etc. would be appreciated.

Stop judging people for things they HAVE to do in life. I don't need to explain myself to other moms why I need to work or why my son is on formula or WHY he has a paci. Or WHY I feed my son baby food or cereal before he is 6 months, I will say its because our Pediatrician told us its OK!

20090226141701AAAtGBA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Question about working out?	Okay so, well I kind of get picked on in school. I'm 14 and 6'0 tall. Since I already have a 6'0 tall body, why not have a six-pack and some serious muscle to go along with it, I don't think I'll be afraid to stand up for myself anymore. My high school has a workout gym that's free for everyone, so I was thinking of going there and working out during lunch and after school (open until 4pm, school ends at 2:30pm). I am very serious about this, and I'm willing to do anything to make me have a good muscle toned body. I know longer want to be afraid to stand up for myself, I want to be able to defend myself from any bully ever, know how big or small. I want to fight? NO! But if someone's mad at me for no reason, which seems to be a lot lately, I want to be able to defend myself. Does anyone know any good websites that have training tips for Boys/Men. For example, how often to work out, what's good to eat, not to eat, etc. Heck, I've even heard the more you watch or do something the better you get at it, so should I start watching UFC, lol? I want to have around a 2-pack to a 4-pack by the beginning of summer (July), if that's possible. Thanks everyone!

I am on Progesterone..actually just finished it, and I still haven't had a period. I took an ovulation test last month, and it did say positive. My doc said I probably have PCOS..I showed a hormone imbalance. I am trying to get pregnant, so I am getting pretty antsy!

20090226142525AACrcJt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	So what can I do about this? I'm confused. Am I using these girls as fall-backs?	Well, there's this girl whom I dated for about 9 months, then switched schools. I was in love, I know I was. We've been talking ever since, but we decided to just try and get over each other but we couldn't. One day we ran into each other at the mall, and we started getting to real talking again. It was amazing. We planned to meet again at a friends house, and we all stayed the night. She cried to me that night telling me how much she loved me. It was the best feeling ever. I waited on her for a year, and I finally had her back :] Then this other guy came over, and she was all over him, like me and her never happened. She went into a bedroom and locked the door, and they almost had sex. I just cried and cried in a bathroom pitch black. Then we talked through everything, and we decided to just let each other go. It broke me. So I've started trying to get rid of her in my mind. Then the first couple days were terrible. Then an old friend text me and told me to come to her game, so I did, and we got to liking each other. Then the next day I switched schools, and I like like 3 people there, 4 in all! I've never ever done this. My friend says I'm probably just trying to cope and don't realize it, do you think that's possible?

Do people not realize it makes them look uneducated? These words literally drive me insane. I see this a lot in the TTC messages and I really fear that there are people out there who are this uneducated wanting to bring people into this world. Please, at least come across as educated and use proper grammar and the spell check.      I guess this was more of a rant, but why does this bother me somuch?

20090226143152AAispSD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is there anything I can do to stop my relatives and inlaws from telling me how to raise my child?	Ok, So my Hubby and I let our daughter sleep in our bed and neither one of us has any problems with it. We are aware that she may be there for a few years, but that is ok with us. She is 6 mo old and is attached to me. She won't go to sleep at night without me. But she is perfectly happy and healthy. Every time I talk to or see my mom or my grandmother, they tell me I need to stop letting my daughter sleep in the bed with us and I need to stop holding her as much and not pay her attention all the time...they say that is why she is so attache to me (because I do all these things). They tell me to just let her cry...she will get over it. But I don't want to do that. I believe that she cries for a reason. Also (this is what bothers me the most) it seems like my father in law disapproves of everything I do regarding my daughter. He tells me and my hubby that we need to take her out of the bed and MAKE her sleep in her crib..."let her cry, it won't hurt her" he says. Also he tells me and my hubby that I need to stop putting headbands on her (fuzzy) head. I also got her ears pierced and every time we talk to him he lets us know that he thinks she is too young for earrings. Every time he is around and she starts crying and I go to pick her up he tells me "no, don't pick her up, just let her cry". How do I tell my family and in laws to stop telling me how to raise my child and that I am going to do what I want to do no matter what they say, without offending anyone?

Also, another question, once the babies born does the father have to sign paternity papers or something? I read about it online, and Im a little confused. is it just a piece of paper that he signs saying he's the father, or do they do a paternity test on the child after the birth with out the parents consent? I didn't think they tested for paternity unless you request it. Thanks.

20090226141019AAOcoFG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should we wait a little longer?	My husband and I got married 1/17/09. He is 23 going to be 24 soon and I am 22 going on 23. We have been together for 6 years before we married. I realize this decision is ours to make solely but I just wanted some extra insight.    I want to know whether we should wait at least a couple years before having kids or just go ahead and start now. I know how everyone says to wait a few years into the marriage to get to know one another but I have been with my husband for 6 years and lived with him for 2. I'm not saying I completely know everything about him because no one knows every single thing about their spouse.    So any input would be greatly appreciated just for an outsiders perspective.    Thanks!

20090226143137AAIGHiJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Spanking for misbehaving at school?	Ok my seven year old daughter has been misbehaving at school. Her teacher, who is also a good friend of mine, does a card system and when a child gets three cards pulled in a day, she calls or sends a note home that has to be signed. Well, in the last two weeks my daughter has gotten three cards pulled five times (counting today). At first we tried talking to her, and explaining she had to behave at school the same as home. The third time we tried a small punishment, taking away a privelage for the night. My husband told her the next time it happened, that he was going to punish her. Well, Sara (the teacher) called me today and told me she had gotten her third card pulled. Now, I use to teach second grade myself, and I have a respect for what the teachers go through, and I know Sara is not out to get my child, she does expect her to behave though.    All, the way home she begged me not to tell her father. When my husband got home, I made her tell him what happened. My husband explained to her that we had tried everything, and nothing seemed to be registering. Of course she promised to it would never happen again (like she has the other four times), my husband told her that did not cut it this time.    He told she was going to have to be spanked to help her remember to behave. She hates spankings, especially the ones from daddy, but at this point I think we had to do something drastic to get her to understand. My husband told her to come with him, and the tears in her eyes killed me, but I stayed strong and let him spank her. This happened thirty minutes ago or so, and she is still in her room. We are going to have a talk with her and tell we do not like doing that,. but she has to learn.   A lot of people do not beleive in spanking for something that happened at school, what is your take? Was it ok in this situation? I
20090226142356AAy7pVy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	After pos. pregnancy result on home test and you call the doctor, how long do they wait to have you come in?	I just took a test last night, and it was positive. I was soooo excited, I wanted to call the doctor right away to confirm. My husband, on the other hand, is not as emotionally driven as I am and he wants me to wait a week to test again, then call the doctor. I can't stand the excitement of not knowing for sure, I know the tests are 99% acurate, but I have a little spotting. Well, so little you almost need a microscope to see it, hahahaha. Anyway, on the test package, it says that trace amounts of blood or protein in the urine can cause a false positive result. The spotting is tan, not blood colored, but trace amounts means really tiny amounts you probably can't see. So anyway, I just want to get to the doctor as fast as I can to know the truth, since I have to wait and take another home pregnancy test again, I was hoping that the doctor won't make me wait longer too.

20090226143401AAtoU0o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Feeding picky eater ..autistic child?	I have an autistic 8 year old daughter who barely eats anything.  I need some advice on what things I can get her to eat, or any advice on ways to sneak nutrition into her very limited diet. She refuses any food she does not recognize.  She is even picky about junk food.  She will not eat any candy at all (she used to like m&ms but won't eat them not) She will only eat a regular Hershey bar (she will not even eat hershey kisses because they look different)  Here are some things she will eat Hershey bar, oreo cookies (oreo brand only) and chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter only(no pb and j sandwiches) cheezit crackers, goldfish, kix cereal, eggo waffles or pancakes (no syrup-she doesn't like it), pizza (sometimes), cinnamon toast, cinnamon brown sugar pop tarts(eats one with milk and shes done),  She drinks only whole milk and apple juice.  She used to eat grilled cheese and mashed potatos and mac n cheese and even a chicken nugget once in awhile.  It seems like she goes through phases when she will accept certain foods.  Basically she is addicted to carbs.  I tried to do the gluten free diet, but she will refuse to eat if it is not something she wants to.  I've also tried to get her to drink pediasure and yoohoo or at least somthing with vitamins to no avail.  I feel like she must barely take in enough calories to survive.  Her BMI is 13%  she only weighs 45 pounds and her pediatrician wasn't even worried about it.  (Its like their office dosen't know what to do with an autistic kid, we didn't even get to finish the exam because she would not tolerate the doc checking her ears)  I am concerned she doesn't get enough nutrition and it seems like she is getting pickier by the day.  Any autism parents going through this??  I'd love any tips you could send me.  Thanks.

20090226142758AA40NO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any suggestions what to do?	I'm pregnant and the original plan was for me to have an abortion because my boyfriend and I would not be finically stable at this time to support a child, however it is getting close to me not being able to get it done anymore, I spoke with someone today and they said I might just make it, but I might not be able to get it done. Its 100 dollars just to be told if I can even get it done and the whole thing would be over 1000. A part of me does want to keep the baby, so now I have no idea what to do..      Oh, I also wouldn't want to do adoption, because if I did keep it I would get way too attached so its out of the question..      Don't respond just to tell me abortions are wrong,   Don't respond to tell me to have protected sex,   Don't respond to tell me anything of that sort.

I personally think that this was unreasonable, but I've been wrong before, so I want to see what y'all think. :]      Okay, so I'm 13 years old.   Today I was IMing my friend, and my mom was on the phone with me. She asked me who I was IMing, so I told her it was one of my friends, Jamie. She then was like, "Ohh, cool! Email me your conversation as you guys are talking, send me updates."   I then nicely said, "No, mom. I'm sorry but I don't really want to send you our conversation, I think it's a little unreasonable."   She then proceeded to hang up on me.      A few minutes later, I called back to apologize, as soon as I finished apologizing, she basically told me to email her the conversation! She was like, "Email me the conversation. I NEED to know what you and your friends talk about." I then said, "Mom, I'm sorry, but I want to have a private conversation."   She hung up on me again..      Was she unreasonable for doing this?   Or was I being plain stupid for telling her I wanted to keep one conversation private?      Also, sometimes she pretends to be me and texts my friend Jamie, who I mentioned earlier.

Which is okay with me, but it's just weird how it hurt all the sudden. And out of no where I got a bladder infection, and I haven't had on since I was young. I'm 18 now. And I was doing some research and I found something that said pregnant women are more susceptible to bladder infections, because of all the change going on with the body and what not. I haven't missed a period yet, mainly because I'm not due for one yet. But I am really curious if I'm due for something else!

This week I have noticed another surge in biting (perhaps he is cutting another tooth).  The reason, however, is not the issue.  Today, either when he was fussing before his nap or when he was fussing after he woke up, my son was gnawing on the side rail of his crib.

20090226143938AALpViO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My toddler is constantly having "incident reports" for me to sign at daycare...?	I have an (almost) 2 year old.  He'll be 2 in a few weeks.  The last month, it seems that I always have an incident report to fill out and sign when I pick him up.  Two of them were him being bitten by other children, and one of those two incidents he was bitten 4 times!  The other was just one bite.  The other two were incidents where he was injured.        I guess my question is should I be concerned about the supervision level in his classroom?  He's been in daycare since he was about 4 months old and we have never had this kind of problem before.  The biting incidents I was told are from 2 new kids who are having a hard time adjusting.  Which I understand is hard on these kids, but one of them bit my toddler 4 times!        All of these incidents have happened in the last month.       I don't want to move him to a new daycare because, up to this point, we have had an excellent experience with this daycare.  However, I do not want my child to keep coming home injured and with bite marks.      Any suggestions?

Her death is just hitting me and I don't know what to do =[. Can somebody help me out please?

If they get hurt we show them we care, but don't baby them. If they get hurt doing something we make them go back to it unless it's serious.       We expect good gades and good manners. We expect them to eat what is put in front of them and to eat healthy. We expect them to dress descent that means combed hair, clean shirt, pant/shorts, clean shoes and socks.       They are 10 and 12 years old. They still have free time and friends, but we are strict on these things.

Or something else? I have no idea what to think. I haven't called my doctor yet. Any ideas? It's not like your typical discharge, it's very wet and has no color.

20090225113618AA6axS7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby not crawling yet...hardwoods affecting this?	I know I should not worry, but as a normal first time mom, I do. Especially when I get, oh your daughter isn't crawling yet?      My daughter is a week after 8 months old. I live with my parents, and because A) It is their house and I can not change anything, like having a carpet, or B) she has asthma or allegries (too young to tell yet) that having a carpet would be bad for her health, that I believe that having hardwood floors stops her from crawling. I tried putting a blanket down on the ground, but that slides with her. She doesn't lift her stomach up yet, but she will wobble forward and backwards like she really wants to go. And because of the hardwood floor, she can push herself backwards. (she looks like a worm lol) So what other things I could do to help her get crawling?       Also, she loves to stand and is able to hang on to the coffee table well, so I eencourageher to walk instead of crawling? I know that is a dumb question, I just want suggestions. Thanks!      Oh and as a plus, my daughter said mama today! I dont know if she was referring to me, but it was still great to hear!
20090226152012AAV84Vi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Now that I'm pregnant, I seem to be breaking out a lot on my face.?	Before getting pregnant,I had really good skin.

20090226150113AAM0fcH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this immature how I act? *parents*?	So, my mom is supposed to home school me but doesn't. She verbally abuses my dad and I, and doesn't give the same punishment to my sister when she does the SAME thing as me (She's older.) I feel a VERY deep hatred for my mother, so I almost never listen to her. She'll shout at me, and I yell back at her and give my opinions on how my dad is the only one who works while she sits on her butt playing computer all day while the house is a mess. I only listen to my dad, and my mom will ground me for months when I don't do what she says, then she lets me out of grounding. Am I immature, or is it just because I hate her? I'm 13.

About 3 years ago I happened to actually meet a person named Lisette.  She is a friend of a friend.  We are no where near friends, and have actually had bad feelings toward eachother in the past.  It's such an uncommon name that if I use it for my own child, I am afraid that she and others will think I have copied it from her.  Is this what it would look like?

20090226145819AAe9WIy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think I'm spoiling her a bit?	My daughter is about 15 months old.  I do treat her a bit differently than I treated my son around this age.  She and I get baths together, even bubble baths from time to time.  Even before she was a year old I'd slip her bits and pieces of my food, like ice cream.  Even let her suck a small bit of cotton candy off my finger once.  She also learned sticking her tongue out from me.  Her father says I spoil her.  (From the man who, at the tiniest of whimpers at night even now, carries her to our bed and let's her sleep on his chest.)
20090226150740AA6XF8b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Cry it out method.. Please help?

For a while she would only sleep in my bed but now she wont even sleep there.   I have started using the cry it out method which is very hard i didnt want to do it but it was the last resort, the only problem is that she will cry and then she will sit herself up in her cot and wont lie down and go to sleep, i know alot of people dont agree with cry it out but i need some advice on how to get her to stop sitting up and to put herself to sleep.      She is 8 months by the way
20090226150233AA5F0R5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I don't want to circumcise my son, but my husband does?	Ok everyone, I want your opinions. I do NOT want to circumcise my son when he is born because of the fact that it is not medically necessary. Not only that but I disagree with the total procedure, from strapping my little boy down, to tearing the foreskin off of the glans (the head of the penis), everything and I just don't want to put him through that if there is no reason to. I think that because it is a cosmetic surgery, he should have the right to choose whether or not he wants it done as he gets older. If he wants it done, then he can have it done, if not, okay. I also don't care what society says is best, because society is all caught up on looks. Usually the main reason that mothers have it done is because their men talk them into it saying that it "looks" better, and I am not for putting an infant through that just because someone else thinks that it "looks" better. Now my husband on the other hand has a son from a previous relationship and had him circumcised. He's also circumcised himself. So, he wants me to have my son circumcised and his only reasons are that he wants his son to have it done because he did, and he did it to his other son too. Plus he thinks it would "look" better because it grosses him out thinking about an uncircumcised penis. So this seems to be an ongoing battle here and I'm tired of fighting over it. Personally I don't think I could live with myself very well if I let the doctors do that to my son just so his father isn't grossed out by the looks of him. But I also don't know if my husband could live with me if I didn't. So I really don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?

20090225112955AAjwOK1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Stages & Ages (solid foods)?	Ok so my 6 month old is always wanting to eat cookies & chocolate pudding & cheese curls. She hardly ever wants her bottle & when she does she only wants soda! She is already crawling & sitting up by herself, how much solid food should she be eating at this age?      JUST KIDDING! (though my m-i-l would probably prefer it!!)   Thought I'd start out with a bit of humor! lol      But I was serious about the crawling & sitting up. So my question is... Gerber foods "Stages & Ages" say she should be on stage 2 (independent sitter) & eating finger foods (crawler)! I know she isn't ready for finger foods & she's only been on stage 1 for a month. When should she switch to stage 2?    also what ratio of solid foods & cereals should she get? I know she needs 24-37 oz of formula still, but how much cereal should she get? Right now she is eating about 30oz & gets 4 scoops (the formula scoopers) of cereal w/ half a scoop of formula powder for breakfast & for lunch 1/2 a container of baby food & dinner a full container. Does she need more or less cereal more or less food?    BTW she is in the 97% for height & 93% weight, so she is a big girl!

20090226150806AAE9MkX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Your views on abortions?	I'm neither pro-l or pro-c. I'm more Pro-Responsibility.      Approximately 2 million abortions performed annually in the United States, about 75 percent are attributed to matters of convenience (i.e. having a baby would interfere with the mother's school or work), or to financial considerations (i.e. a baby is not affordable at this time). I think that is wrong. And this is not about allowing a women to do what she wants to her body if she wants implants or to cut her hair, let her. It's her choice. But should she have the choice to murder. Of course if the baby is killing the mother she should have to. The mothers life comes first.

I'm sick of not having help, a baby who refuses to sleep and gets hysterical when you try to make him, even though he is OBVIOUSLY tired, having to do it all by myself 24/7. I'm not cut out to be a mother, I don't have the patience, or I feel right now, the love. I don't know what I was thinking.  :(
20090226153140AAryP8Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i pregnant .. Im 16 ?	I am 16 and my boyfriend and i have been having unprotected sex for 2 months now. I had my period january 13 and then I had it again february 1st and today i had a little bit of pink blood in my panties. I have not had sex with him since about a month ago, and ive had my period but still i never get my period 2 times in a month and they weren't heavy but they weren't light. My friend says you can have your period for the first month or two. The past week or two ive been getting pains in my lower stomach and Ive been trowing up for the past few days and ive been feeling sick to my stomach for a few weeks now.      I do not have a way to get a pregnancy test. and plus i don't want to waste my money if im not. so im just asking if you think i am.       ( please dont be mean about this question )

20090226152632AAkDuM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possibly pregnant, despite pill?	Ok, I'm not asking you if I'm pregnant first off - I know I should take a test to find that out. I'm just asking if this combination of symptoms COULD be pregnancy, and I'm asking specifically people who have experience of being pregnant in these circumstances:      I am on the pill (microgynon30) and was having unprotected sex, mostly he'd pull out before he finished but I know that's not particularly effective. I'm never very good at taking the pill and altho I don't often miss it, I'm pretty irregular about when I take it.      Anyway, since then I have had a period but it was a lot lighter than usual, and shorter, and it was very brown.   I've also been having some episodes of feeling quite hot and dizzy, but i was putting them down to maybe getting a cold or something.   I have also had some stomach cramps but nothing major...      I'm inclined to think I'm probably not pregnant, but it's just that with bleeding and being on the pill it can be confusing to work it out at first!      What do you think? (particularly interested if you got pregnant while on the pill)

A 2 year old daughter and a new addition to the family... A 12 week old son.   My son for the last 2 weeks has been extremely poorly and so has been getting alot of attention which my 2 year old has obviously noticed.    Our 2 year old is now getting extremely jealous, saying things like I hate my brother, I dont want him no more, and is even trying to attack him, either by punching or throwing things at him,... Both things I must add we do not condone.

Well so this will kinda be hard to explain but my regular teacher for language arts is on maternity leave and she isn't going to come back until next year. Anyways we got a new teacher starting on Monday and he is such a pervert!       He is like at least 30, most likely older. He gives all the girls the creeps...Ok I'll tell you what he did if you don't believe me.      He gets really close to you when you talk and I have seen him rubbing some girl's backs in class. He will "check on your work" to try and look down your chest. He'll stand outside the window to watch you walking down the hallway even!      That isn't even the bad part though...Well it's bad put this is worse. Sooo I guess he had to "talk to the gym teacher" so he went in the girl's locker room WHEN WE WERE CHANGING! I was in the locker room when this happened guys and I swear he was not there just to talk to our gym class! He didn't even look at the P.E. teacher when he was talking to her. Well, most of us stopped changing and held clothes over ourselves but anyways... The P.E. teacher made him leave...But it was still insanely weird.      Ok and in class today, he was bringing up an educational video and accidentally opened something else (this was on a "smart board" thing it's a screen that hooks up to the computer) and opened a video of girls topless on the beach! He is so weird!      Anyways, how do I get him fired? My mom said don't make a big deal of it... But I feel scared like I'll get hurt...I'm scared to tell the principal. Help me!

20090226095324AAzxelX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Feeling fed up/upset today, help please?	hi,   those of you that have read my qns before will understand this.      but for those that don't i'll give you some history:      me and dh have been ttc for 13 months. been told the problem lies with me as i am not ovulating. i'm seeing an re to get this sorted, but it's such a long waiting list for the next app, and i have to do various blood tests and a hsg to try to figure out what's wrong with me.      i had chlamydia (caught from my husband from when we were going out) i took the tablets, but i was never asked to go back to get checked to see if it had cleared so they are testing for that too.      my point is, my sister in law has just told us she's pregnant again, with her 4th baby. she's 26, and her baby is only 17 months old.      i'm upset today as i know it'll be the subject of conversation with the family, and i know she's not rubbing it in, it just feels like that, as she gets 4 when we cant even get 1!!      i'm so annoyed with it and upset, she didnt even plan it, she was supposed to be on the pill, so it's unplanned, whereas ours is completely planned, and they cant even afford the 3 kids they've got, let alone a 4th!      should i just try to let it go and talk about her pregnancy with her even though i'm hurting inside, and will be watching her bump grow for the rest of the year wishing it was me?   the family (husband's side) will be all over her with it too, without even thinking of the heartache i'm going through.      what should i do?      thanks everyone. i know it might sound stupid to those that don't know me and what i'm going through, but for those that do, a little reassurance would be nice. i havent congratulated her yet as i'm not up to it.

20090226094313AA6iL6j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Hormonal crash at 40 weeks? Labor? Depression?	Hi all. I'm 1 day past my due date. I had abdominal cramps all night, but nothing seemed regular so I'm not sure if it had anything to do with labor. The pain stopped this morning. I woke up with a really bad sore throat, though, which was odd (don't have any other cold/flu symptoms). If you have any ideas about the throat, let me know.      The main question is: can you have a major hormonal crash near the end of pregnancy? I've been chipper and energetic the last few weeks, and this morning I woke up severely irritable and SAD. Sad sad sad. For seemingly no reason. I'm not upset I'm past my due date, the baby will come when he comes. My life is going very well. I feel hugely pregnant, but am not that uncomfortable. But I am feeling SUPER down in the dumps and it's really confusing me. Why am I so sad? Is this hormones? Is this some bizarre pre-postpartum depression?      Should I call my midwife? Sore throat plus moodiness doesn't seem like something they could even diagnose or respond to, but something just doesn't seem right today.      Thanks!

20090226094642AA3RwdX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	When do you usually start your period after delivery?	It has been 6 weeks since i gave birth, and still no period. I had a DNC done at 2 weeks post partum  and stopped bleeding about a week later. So I stopped bleeding all together about 3 weeks post partum, and now it is 6 weeks and still no period. I thought you were supposed to start your period around 4 weeks post partum? Is this correct? Thinking I may be pregnant again, but if i may be misinformed, and still have plenty of time.. So in a picture book when do most start their periods again?
