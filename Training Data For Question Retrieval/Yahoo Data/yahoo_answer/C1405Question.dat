20090227103732AAFT4kT	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The Equal Rights Amendment in the US - would this bring socialism into the US Constitution?	I'm interested in big things going on in the free world so I checked out the US Equal rights amendment.      "Therefore, lawmakers and judges must be encouraged to include equitable consideration of female experiences as they deal with issues of Social Security, taxes, wages, pensions, domestic relations, insurance, violence, and more. Without an Equal Rights Amendment providing motivation, the status quo will change much more slowly."       http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/why....       "....equitable consideration of female experiences"      I interpret this amendment as an attempt by feminists to use the US constitution to guarantee equal experiences for women on for example wages. In other words to use the US constitution to force wage parity in the sexes regardless of free market economics and it's influence on pay rates. If so then the meaning of "rights" will be changed from a libertarian to a socialist interpretation...from equal opportunity for both sexes being a right to equal outcomes becoming a "right". Equal outcomes for demographic groups is usually an expectation only in socialist societies and only close to a reality in communist ones.      Do you think the ERA would bring socialism into the US constitution?

20090227105527AALgMN2	Social Science;Psychology	What could this recurring dream mean - lightbulbs burned out?	I have this dream about once a week - help!      In the dream, it's nighttime and I'm in the house I grew up in.  As I go through the house I discover that none of the lights are working.  I'll go from room to room flipping the light switch but the lights won't come on.   I'll get a creepy sense that something bad is lurking, purposely causing the lights not to work.      I had the dream last night and I remember thinking, "oh no - not this again" within the dream!! ???      What do you think it means?  I've checked online dream decoders and can't find anything.

I enjoyed the books a lot, but ever since I finished them I have been depressed, I have read each book over and over, it seems silly to be so obsessed but I cant stop reading them. Im not upset because there are no more books, but every little thing reminds me of it and I will go from happy one second to crying the next. (I saw a dvd case for the film Casper, this reminded me of Jasper, then in turn the books, and I ended up in a bad mood for the next hour!) I cant explain how they make me feel but I don't know what to do. I have been im being childish but im sure there are others who feel the same. The last sentence in Breaking Dawn hurts me the most.

20090309182319AANfFGf	Social Science;Psychology	What do you do when you need to memorize something?	I'm very bad at memorizing, and I need to memorize this poem by Thursday for English Class:       IF you can keep your head when all about you       Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;      If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,      But make allowance for their doubting too:      If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,      Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,      Or being hated don't give way to hating,      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;                    If you can dream-- and not make dreams your master;      If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim,      If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster            And treat those two impostors just the same:       If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken            Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,       Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,       *     And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;                            If you can make one heap of all your winnings            And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,       And lose, and start again at your beginnings,            And never breathe a word about your loss:       If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew            To serve your turn long after they are gone,       And so hold on when there is nothing in you            Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"                  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,            Or walk with Kings -- nor lose the common touch,       If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,            If all men count with you, but none too much:       If you can fill the unforgiving minute            With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,       Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,            And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man, my son!       * where I'm stuck at at the moment.

20090309182329AA2lCtm	Social Science;Psychology	I'm fearing Brain Injury more than death?	Our Mind is the center of the Brain, we depend on all of the Brain's functions to correctly communicate with a person, planning a New Business, having Perfect Relationships and other things.   So If i was a very smart and intelligent person and had a severe Car Accident tomorrow with traumatic Brain Injury.    What would happen to my relationships and me? Would i ever be able to recover and be the same anymore?     Also what if I had more than one traumatic Brain Injury? How many severe brain injuries does it really take to become dead?   Can we recover from all of them if we're still alive no matter the damage?    I know this is a weird question But i'm more afraid of this because when you are dead, you don't experience anything but with a Brain Injury you would be stuck with impairments for your whole life with a trapped soul      I will appreciate any kind of advise   Thanks

He was just looking at me so I looked at him back. There was no smiling or anything...pretty much a stare down and then I had to look away.      I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.

20090309192242AAQtM1C	Social Science;Psychology	I am serious, I need to know?	We have a new head of school, she is really nice, intelligent, and sweet. I always just want to walk by and say hi or see what she is up to. I want her to recognize me and see how cool I am too. I get happy to go to school because she is there. Is that odd? When you went to school, wasnt there something motivating you? I dont know, I just want to know what to do with myself. Theres only a 10 weeks of school left then Im graduating, how do i make a good impression, and why do you think i care so much? Has something similar ever happened to you? I am a girl by the way, so I kind of see her as a role model. Why do I feel sad then when she isnt at school one day or when I dont see her regularly? Its kind of like when you see someone and wish they were your mom or parent. I have a great mother, and I am not ungrateful, but sometimes I just wish it could be her you know?
20090309193550AA6xPLJ	Social Science;Psychology	What is wrong with me?!?	This will be a super loooong post, sorry.   Please don't reply with "TOO MUCH TO READ"   Then Just hit "back" . I am looking for real answers. This is a serious subject.       I feel embarrassed and ashamed to admit this and ask for help. I can appear totally normal in public, but sometimes I just can't. Sometimes I feel guilty for my actions, but most of the time I do not feel bad or even realize I did something wrong or until maybe later.      I'm 17 years old.       I had an imaginary animal friend when I was 3-4 yrs old. I made up a tragic story about him, and pretty much thought he was real. When we moved, I just "lost" him.      When I was 5 years old I started a fire in the house and blamed it on my brothers best friend.      I stole things from school all the time until i was about 7 yrs old      Was afraid of becoming fat and would not eat in front of others from 7 years old to 13 years old      I started pulling my hair out and burning objects when I was 10 years old      I started bruising myself on purpose when I was 11 years old      I then went to therapy for the hair pulling and bruising , but the lady did not help at all...and she was fired anyways a month afterwards      I'm sadistic by nature I guess. I'm consistently off and on. I'm either this way or I'm not.      I have extreme irritability and mood swings that happen in a snap.      I get very depressed and want to commit suicide.      I don't get close to people really. People like me, but friendships never last more than a few years.      Sometimes I feel weak and gloomy, but at the same time energized with tons of thoughts cramming into my mind. I feel like I'm going insane and find it hard to sit still, but then again, also feel tired. It's a weird sensation.      I used to not believe I had any problems, but I will admit that most of the time I have no empathy or sympathy at all. I just feel nothing.       I can be very manipulative.      I hate to admit these things, because at the time they seem like nothing. like I don't realize what I am doing. A lot of the times I am honest, but a lot of times I consistently just lie. I do it before even thinking. Sometimes to deceive, and sometimes I just do it out of nowhere.      I also have a habit of becoming obsessed with people. I get very infatuated. I don't physically hurt them but I will become very obsessed and kind of internet stalk them and their friends.       I do a lot of insane things...making up aliases, etc. I used to do that a LOT.      I get bored a lot, yet love to be alone and just do nothing but sulk.      I get good grades but I lose interesting when i get in horrible depressive slumps, where I just sit or sleep for hours      I get extremely impulsive, like I just spent all my saved up money, thousands, on an Hermes bag without really thinking about it.      I deceive people by putting on a happy face and being extremely charismatic. i do this especially to people that I believe that I can manipulate or get something valuable out of their friendship      I'm sure theres tons of other things. But like I said...I normally don't feel bad about anything questionable I do and don't care if it hurts others.....but then later on sometimes I will realize that it was kind of insane.      I feel really crazy and ashamed that i have so many weaknesses.      Does this sound like any kind of mental illness? Can i be treated with medication?

20090309205739AAkRdJF	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I so fascinated with researching how the brain works?	I am 14 and I love psychology and the way the brain interprets information how emotions are and stuff like that.  Ever since I was 12 I been researching depression bipolar and other mental ilnesses. I also found out that I am adopted and my bio mom has schizophrenia and was on coke weed and meth when she was pregnant with me. she had hit me in the head with a glass beer bottle and fractured my skull when i was 4 months old I got taken away when i was 2 years old.  My first memory was when i was 2 in court getting my adoption papers I remeber telling the judge that i was adopting my parents. and being in an elevator with a bunchof adults. Is it because of my past that im fascinated with the brain and howit works or is it simply because i have bipolar and depression and ADHD.  I love to help people and well I always have felt that no one was their for me but I got better. I want tohelp others avoid being the way i am.

For example, do you have problems understanding math problems that others find easy?    Do you feel you are stumped easily?

Can an average minded person with good memory be mistaken for an intelligent person because they are able to memorize facts and recite them?

Well I'm a freshman in college right now and have declared a major in Psychology. I am content with the major so far from my experiences with the psych department at my school and with the education I have been receiving. I've taken only two psych classes so far and I have never been so attentive in class or interested in the material I was learning. My ultimate career goal would be to become a Clinical Psychologist, open up my own practice, maybe right a book and def. teach. I'm fascinated with the mind and human behavior but I also love to write and learn about different cultures. I'm considering a minor in Religious Studies. I've just taken an intro class and it's probably one of my favorite classes so far. Would Religious Studies help quench my thirst of learning about different people and cultures or would another minor be better?      Thanks in advance for your input!

20090309203836AAA9qRD	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream/Nightmare Interpretation?	I've had this dream since i was 4 years old, and it pops up about every two years... the last time i had it was a year and a half ago when i had a fever of 106'F.      It always just kind of pops up out of another dream but it's always the same... it's always like i'm somewhere (i never know where), and theirs like COUNTLESS objects all around me on an open field, and i mean like it would make your brain explode how many of them their are. And i can't tell what the objects are, but i know that they are of great importance... like "the life of somebody" important. And as i'm standing in the midst of all these objects, all of a sudden they start to vanish like 10 at a time but about every MICRO second. and i know that once they're gone they're gone forever, and i always want to help one of them but they are vanishing SO FAST that by the time i even look at one or think of trying to help it, it's gone. Completely out of my control. And it's the scariest thing ever when i'm just having a normal dream, and then this one pops up and i know whats going to happen from when i had the frst time, but i always pray in my dreams that it wont..   And then the dream gets so freaky that i just wake up in shock and stuff...      i don't know if you can, but if you could make any sense of this, thanks.

20090309212730AAzNMGD	Social Science;Psychology	How do i stop worrying over things i have no control over?	I am 27 years old and had breast cancer when i was 26.  I constantly worry alot about the cancer returning again because it seems as though everyone who gets cancer the first time always developes it again a second time.      I am afraid if it returns again i could loose my life. I have talked to my family and friends about this and they say i need to stop worrying over things i have no control over.      They say that worrying over having a recurrence won't prevent it from happening so i just need to move on with life. But i am afraid as soon as i move on and start to become happy, that is when the cancer is going to return.

Isn't it annoying when somebody tells you what they think you want to hear instead of what they actually believe?  Why can't people just be honest with other people instead of dishonestly pretending to believe things that they do not?  Why do so many people refuse to talk about complex subjects and instead prefer to waste their time talking about nonsense (such as crappy TV shows)?

Things that are currently screwed,   1) I've kissed  my b/f’s bestfriend  he doesnt know   2) I'm pretty sure I'm in love with my best (female) friend   3) I’ve slept with someone else (b/f doesn't know)   4) I’ve sent naked pics and video’s to a male friend   5) I started organising a threesome with the male friend and female friend from above (it fell through a the last minute, she couldn’t get time off)   6) I constantly flirt with people just to see if they’ll bite         Extra Stuff    I have NO Motivation or self control   I can't say no to anyone who hits on me i just can't :(   I don't seem to have any morals.. and I can justify everything I do to the point where I can lie to your face about it and you wouldn't have a clue, and even I start believing the lie.    I don't know what I want from life    I feel like I'm at a crossroads   I'm overweight and can never stick to a diet   I'm at uni and don't do any work til the last minute and somehow scrap by   I work full time (i do uni externally on top)   I own a house with the b/f   I have only 3 people I would consider friends, but I don’t share much with them.   One of those is male.  I actually get to see him  unlike my other friends, but I'm so worried that it'll turn out the same way any other friendship I have with a male does that I'm keeping him at arms length, and switch between misinterpreting things to seeing how far i can push him with comments i shouldn’t  make to him. (whenever I call a guy a best friend I end up sleeping with them or they end up liking me or something along those lines and it all goes to crap)   I've been engaged twice, i've miscarried, i've been in one physically abusive relationship and one emotionally abusive one, I've lived out of home since i was 16 I've moved back a couple of times between places, i've been oversea's twice. I've been through alot... (oh and i've always worked and supported myself since i was 14).   I dont know if i still want to be in a relationship with my boyfriend, i love him and i love what we have but I feel like im missing something. It feels like we're best friends that happen to own a house together.   I want to be young and have fun (I'm 21) but at the same time I want to be settled and secure and have the life i always dreamed of, the husband, two kids and house out bush...      I  know complaining won't help me, but I am shocking at picking,  then following through on a course of action. I don't even know how my life got to where it is, I just sorta drifted here...      Please help me figure out who I am and what I want :(

I've been looking into it a little but I'm not really familiar with the different types of mental disorders.       He has been suicidal, he talks to himself to the point where he will have an entire conversation with himself he will ask and answer his own questions and he will try to talk to people on TV, he does this thing where he will talk about liking pain and how he wants to have a bullet wound and then he will snap out if it and say something that sounds completely intelligent and then snap back into saying he loves pentagrams. He is an alcoholic and has almost killed himself driving drunk twice. He thinks that the scars he got on his face from his last accident make him look cool. He can not hold a conversation for more than a minute with another person because he will basically interrupt himself and start another conversation alone. He has expressed homicidal fantasies toward his own mother. He is generally very laid back and doesn't seem to be angry toward his friends, he doesn't seem to react to people talking about him or insulting him at all like he didn't even hear it. He makes uncomfortable jokes constantly. He doesn't understand subtlety at all.       It's very clear that there is something wrong with him but I'm not sure what it is and he won't help himself.       Does this sound like anything specific to anyone?

20090309214232AADxdSt	Social Science;Psychology	How can I get my life back on track?	Sorry if this may be a bit dramatic...      I feel like my life is over already, and I'm only 24. I am a complete loser, and my hopelessness has occasionally even made me feel suicidal lately. I used to be so motivated in my life to succeed, and in undergrad I achieved a really high GPA and was able to land some pretty good jobs after college. I feel like the turning point was about a year and a half ago, when I broke up with my long term bf... I hadn't ever had a chance to really be single as an adult, and I just went wild. Since then I spent almost every night partying and all I cared about was booze, drugs, and random sex. It led to me dropping out of grad school (I was able to somehow get a medical withdrawal, but still, it looks pathetic) and I moved back in with my mom because I was in so much debt. But this still didn't stop me from dumbly continuing to make having fun my #1 priority, up until about last month.      So now I am about a week away from losing my current temporary job contract (which is already several notches below the jobs I used to have), and have been rejected from the postbaccalaureate program I just applied to (a program with an embarrassingly high acceptance rate). I feel like I have completely dropped the ball in my life and I don't know how to get my **** together again, because no schools will accept me anymore and I am a weak job candidate in such a bad economy. And I can't be unemployed or just doing nothing, because I absolutely have to have health insurance due to a chronic serious disease. Until I'm 25, I can still qualify under my dad's insurance as long as I'm a student, so I have been taking classes at the local junior college lately. It was the worst feeling in the world when some 19 year old in one of my classes asked "What are you doing here?" after I mentioned I had a bachelor's degree. I didn't even know what to say. It doesn't help that literally ALL my friends are in good-paying successful jobs or grad school.      Now that I know I'm losing my job in a few days, I've been totally freaking out. In the last month I've completely stopped partying and have been taking steps to be responsible again. But I feel like I did so much damage to my life by making all these idiotic choices that it's impossible to come back to what my potential used to be. Has anyone else ever experienced this kind of downturn into loserville, and somehow got out of it? I am so scared that I'm going to be a loser forever, and I don't even know where to start with fixing my life. I know that this is all my fault and I probably deserve this, so I really don't need anyone telling me "Yeah, you're a failure, what were you thinking". I already know that and kick myself every day for this. But I just want to hear if anyone else has any experience/insight on getting your life back on track.

20090309213538AAP5qTv	Social Science;Psychology	Need a theory? help.............?	During my 4th period class of the fall term,  I observed a special education classroom at my high school. This was a sophmore and junior grade level class containing only disabled students. Although they were around the same age and grade level, they were on different levels in certain subjects. Most of these students suffered from learning disabilities as well as behavioral disorders. I worked with and observed the students and noticed that it can be difficult to grasp their attention but once it was attained I realized how bright they can really be. One particular student had difficulty looking anyone face to face, he still understood what people were saying to him at all times. The girls bonded with me quickly because they could relate to another girl their age. There were only five male students out of the fifteen total enrolled in the class. I believe I made a positive impact on my fellow classmates during my time with them. They were always excited to come to school on the days I came to their class. I walked in the room seeing a bunch of happy smiling faces. Sometimes their behavior is unacceptable and they go through difficult times behind closed doors in which I do not see. Based on my observations, I could theorize that...?

20090309233424AAqHhMI	Social Science;Psychology	Can't stop procrastinating?	I'm taking a full load of AP classes, today I had homework in every single class except band and computers.   I have a research paper I was assigned a month ago and I'm doing it all tonight. I've been working for six hours straight and I'm nowhere near done. This isn't a first time thing, I always find myself deliberately putting things off until I feel like doing them, which is never. I do my homework on the way to school everyday, but if I don't feel like it, I don't. I'm brilliant, but incredibly lazy.   I'm starting to stress out, especially because it's not like I'm being productive when I'm not doing schoolwork. I don't even watch TV, I just waste time. I feel like I'm throwing my life away.   I've tried planners, but when I skip one day I never get back into the habit. Nothing seems to be working. Any tips?

20090310010702AAHVBmY	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible for PTSD to emerge several years after an originally traumatizing experience?	I had a very abusive childhood.  Both of my parents were physically and emotionally abusive.  It was worst from when I was about 8 years old until I was about 14.  I am now almost 19 and don't see my parents as much, although I still live with my father.  They have done anything very abusive for a couple of years.      Lately, over  the past few months, I've been remembering instances where I was abused very badly that I thought I had forgotten.  I have flashbacks and I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep again.  I have become terrified of anything that reminds me of my parents and my clinical depression has reached a point so bad that my psychiatrist is thinking about having me hospitalized.  I can't take care of myself anymore because I'm frightened of my future and there seems to be no point in living anymore.  Is it possible that I have PTSD now, and why would it emerge a solid five years after the worst has passed?

They get drunk, do drugs, and have promiscuous sex. Why do they do this? I'm a young guy, but I don't do that stuff. I know that it's not worth the risks. Why don't other people see that? Also, people who are depressed turn to these things for a quick fix. Then they just get worse. When people try to help them, they just want to be left alone. Why?? Why wouldn't somebody want help? Is it that they are unaware that they are depressed, or that they are just morally inept scum?

I feel lonely, somewhat for starters. And angry, and like I wanna hurt something or someone. And every few seconds I think of something funny and I'll be laughing. I don't have anxiety or anything, and I've never felt like this before it's just... really weird.      Also, I always feel like I'm being watched. I know it's not true but even now I feel like theres something or someone hanging over me, watching me. Not mocking me, or threatening me just there. To be there.       This has been going on for about three hours... it's really odd. I'm not tired, I haven't really been tired for about three weeks. It's not insomnia, I can sleep, I just don't want to. What do you think it is?      P.S. Thanks for reading that. Hmm. I still feel all of those things though.

Do you think it is true as the media and feminists pound into our heads that only women are victims of domestic violence?      If you think it is only done to women, would you change your stance if there was way more than a preponderance of evidence that men are can be victims too and deserve protection under the law? or could you at least admit that what we are told about domestic violence may be false?

Ok, I'm 23.. my girlfriend is 20   My girlfriend has a friend, who is very slutty... but not that great looking (Thousands would say she is, but shes not my type)      My dream was, I was in a nightclub with friends   ..but I was not with my girlfriend (We had broken up)      THIS IS BECAUSE, WE'VE BROKE UP A LOT OF TIMES AND ONLY RECENTLY GOT BACK TOGETHER      I spoke to this girl, which i don't usually do (..because I don't like the way she is)   I asked her, for general conversational purposes, if she was coming to the next place with us   She didn't seem too sure, so in the end I walked away saying "ok, well the offers there. You can come if you want"      Immediately afterwards, she said to me "You can have ME if YOU want....."      Being single, I laughed playfully and walked over to her and started flirting      Soon enough, i was leaning in close enough that a kiss was about to happen      ..but at the last second i turned my head to the left, and she slowly kissed my cheek...   ...at this very moment, i saw my "ex" girlfriend (My current girlfriend) standing on the other side of the club, watching me.      She came storming over and I soon realised i'd been set up and it was all to trick me!!   I felt cheated and low (yet strangely attracted to this slutty girl)      The thing is this:   My girlfriend is quite scheming, and cunning when it comes to catching me out, and i've had some bad experiences with it      What else could this mean?   (I know nobody can KNOW, but ideas are always good to hear!)      Thanks in advance, and sexy 10 points if u come up with a feasable interpretation

A little confused.      Here is the problem:   A researcher was interested in the difference between children and adult's motor skills. She asked four 4th graders and four Ph. D. students, who had never used this video game before, to play TETRIS. This game requires the integrative and cooperative movements of eyes, hands and fingers. The motor competence was measured by the highest level of difficulty of the game that a subject mastered. The highest level of difficulty is 5 and the lowest is 1.      Then I have a chart that shows the scores for the 4th graders and for the Ph.D. students.      Thank you.

20090310001948AAQf5vg	Social Science;Psychology	I talk to myself am I crazy?	I talk myself,but my case is a bit different from other self talkers. I imagine that I'm on a talk show or talking to someone of "authority" usually defending my position on something controversial or someone I haven't seen for a long time and miss, so technically I'm not talking to myself. I go through everything from facial expression, hand gesture, I even move my mouth but no sounds come out. I know when I'm talking to myself, it not like I think those imaginary friends are real. When someone walks in the room I immediately snap out of it, and sometime It can gets embarrassing. This has been going on since I was young. So I know talking to yourself with words of encouragement is normal, but talking to someone is that imaginary...is that normal?

I have deep set eyes and some other pretty strong facial features that seem to differ from the typical uk / northern european american. Mostly I noticed most caucasians seem to have eyes set a lot closer to their brow.      It seems like I got my dark wavy hair from my mom, but she has a lot of facial features that I don't share such as I have a thinner sharper nose, blue eyes, lighter/pinker skin tone, and a more defined jaw line. I have no idea what my dad looks like, but given the differences I am really curious now.      Anyone shed some light into some of these characteristics? Is there any way to tell based on my facial features compared to my moms what ethnicity my dad possibly is? The eyes part really throws me since it does not seem like I got it from my mom.

By the time school is over I just want to sleep. Could my amount of dreaming be preventing me from getting decent sleep?

Our Mind is the center of the Brain, we depend on all of the Brain's functions to correctly communicate with a person, planning a New Business, having Perfect Relationships and other things.   So If i was a very smart and intelligent person and had a severe Car Accident tomorrow with traumatic Brain Injury.   What would happen to my relationships and me? Would i ever be able to recover and be the same anymore?   Also what if I had more than one traumatic Brain Injury? How many severe brain injuries does it really take to become dead?   Can we recover from all of them if we're still alive no matter the damage?   I know this is a weird question But i'm more afraid of this because when you are dead, you don't experience anything but with a Brain Injury you would be stuck with impairments for your whole life with a trapped soul. Has anyone experienced something like this?
