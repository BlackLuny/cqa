Once all of the icons are in the folder delete the folder.    If the icons return you may have a line in your registry that reinstalls the icon to your desktop.  Try Ccleaner at www.ccleaner.com

cd835c0dab37eb7fdcb069f1913325c0aa	There is a way to have Windows Turn off after a certain period of inactivity.    You'll have to excuse me for some inaccuracies. I've been using laptops forever, and I can't remember if it is the same for desktops as well.    If you go to Control Panel -> Performance and Maintenance -> Power Options, a dialog box should pop up. I can't remember for desktops, but I think on that first tab, there should be a time setting, and an activity setting. Here, you can choose how long you want the computer to stay on before shutting off. If you are on a laptop, it's on the first tab, but there's a slew of different choices there.    If you are on a laptop, on the first tab, you can choose at what times when or if you want the program to standby and hibernate. On the next tab, you can set the computer to turn off after a certain amount of battery life has passed. On the Advanced tab, you can set the computer to do certain things when the lid is closed.    Hope this helps!|`|1a234af3a41bd4468449392ee952ee86aa	Hit ALT and F4 keys at the same time and it will take you into a screen that you can set up for windows to turn off automatically.|`|d284622d02dab4e3b4d72af0345fd686aa	if you go to control panel, then to power management, you can have it go to stand by mode or sleep mode after a certain time limit|`|95610f03468270037d88f24b2d843534aa	follow as below :    go to : Start menu >control panel > Power optoin > select turn of hard disk > select ur choosen time what do u want.|`|AA10021899	Use software PC AUTO SHUTDOWN  to turn of automatically by keeping a specified time after which to shutdown...

Le trs gros intrt d'un assembleur c'est de pouvoir dterminer une configuration finement, en choisissant pice par pice les constituants de ton pc pour en fabriquer un qui comble tes besoins. La contre-partie, bien videmment, c'est de s'y entendre un minimum, sinon tu ne sauras pas effectuer ton choix, ou tu risque de faire les mauvais. L'assembleur est sens de guider, mais parfois c'est la marge de ce qu'il vend qui lui dicte sa conduite... D'autre fois, c'est le temps tout simplement qui lui manque.    En revanche en prenant un dell par exemple, tu prend un pc cl en main, sans te soucier des dtails (type de la carte-mre par exemple).

Les constructeurs deviennent aussi comptitifs que les assembleurs.      En conclusion, commence par dterminer l'usage que tu compte faire de ton pc, si tu ne rentre pas dans les catgories suivantes : jeu 3D intensif, montage vido, MAO, pc multimdia de salon, pc inaudible, alors tu prends plutot l'option d'un Dell...|`|da68125cf02b3f3877efa4078a83e4ebaa	les marques de pc  actuel sont prfrable les config sont bien tudier qualit prix pour x usage de plus le suivie est bon  pare dell qui est aux usa et n'a pas d'importateur en France|`|bb256c79a25d33df018b37df21b3a9b1aa	j'ai pris une dcision que je ne regrette pas,  il y a un an,  je suis passe au Mac OS X,  et je ne regrette pas le PC !!|`|c48328e082673fe2b0d2c61f46ee87f6aa	Sans hsitation je commanderais chez Dell ou un tout fait chez Medion qui a un service aprs-vente trs correct , ceci tant dit attend quelques jours si tu peux que le programme vista ait un peu essuy les platres ,c'est fou ce qu'on trouve comme erreurs quand on met un soft dans les mains du public|`|c3983c7ea041d9551e24dc92d60b0738aa	le commeander chez dell parce dell utilise la verion originale de windows et chez les assembleurs tes disques dur ton boitier etc ... sont otus des pieces detaches donc il tombe souvent en pane tes matriels de plus il utilise souvent une copie illegal de windows|`|0cc46bd7fe1561de88de554c90cd43f9aa	dell, c'est de la qualit, c'est pas cher, sa dure et sa marche !|`|b68b27ee5ba296a590000f17f6052d2baa	Le mien aussi est un Dell, il est trs bien et pour le service aprs-vente, ils sont trs bon, les techniciens t'expliquent tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur ton ordinateur.|`|rXaUrzO0aa	Achte un MAC et tu redcouvriras le plaisir dutiliser un ordinateur.

You can use the free utility called Shoot The Messenger to automatically disable this unnecessary service.   http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger...

AA10138426	I haven't used Mac editing software, but you can compress video to fit, some with great quality, some with bad. I generally use a program called DivX to compress my video. Although I don't know if it's compatible with Mac OS though, I haven't used it in a while.     Oh, just found a link, just download the free version, it may add a watermark at the beginning of your vid, but it only lasts for something like 5 secs.     If I can learn to use it, I'm sure you can as well, just look for the readme file, or look to see if it has screenshots on thier website that will show you how to compress your vids.     Good luck|`|373638d2c9725b86b45ed96d7fca1e4daa	Many video's in youtube are multiple parts, so you could try splitting it up.  You could also look at googlevideo.

PKADMakgaa	CompuServe introduced the GIF format in 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier RLE format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used LZW data compression, which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonable amount of time, even with very slow modems.    The original version of the GIF format was called 87a. In 1989, CompuServe devised an enhanced version, called 89a,[1] that added support for multiple images in a stream, interlacing and storage of application-specific metadata. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six bytes of the file, which, when interpreted as ASCII, read "GIF87a" and "GIF89a", respectively.    When the World Wide Web gained popularity, GIF became one of the two image formats commonly used on Web sites, the other being the black and white XBM.[citation needed] JPEG came later with the Mosaic browser.    The GIF89a feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by control data, is used extensively on the web to produce simple animations. The optional interlacing feature, which stored image scan lines out of order in such a fashion that even a partially downloaded image was somewhat recognizable, also helped GIF's popularity,[citation needed] as a user could abort the download if it was not what was required.    More detailed info at below source|`|AA11434745	The GIF 89a specification allows for multiple frames. Thus, all GIFs that comply with 89a, which is pretty much what modern graphics programs create, are GIFs, whether they have 1 frame or dozens.    Thus, technically, there is no "technical" difference.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF|`|4efec2c7305f895108324ffa989fb701aa	An animated .gif is a series of still .gifs with a bit of "Script" to replay them over and over.|`|5a1658e14729d7f1521ef9fb5c755cfaaa	nothing|`|8ebadd373b6fc96d2b7fc937e9e81ad8aa	There is no difference in the gif.

AA10787475	.zip and .rar are just compressed file archives. In and of themselves, they are nothing to worry about. However, many virii and other malware are distributed compressed as this will defeat the virus scan performed by many popular websites like yahoo and google. People are extremely wary of downloading .exe files since many of the bad ones will auto-execute.    As far as albumbase is concerned, I have never encountered anything other than audio files, album art and album info files. I'm sure it's happened to SOMEBODY - but the social, paranoid nature of albumbase ensures that any archive containing malware would be hard pressed to have its link hosted for more than a day.    In short, worry about the RIAA, not virii.

effa79c5567a10463ae7886adc920f55aa	How To Defrag Your Hard Drive    Microsoft provided us with a utility to organize the sequential layout of our files on our hard drive. As we either add or remove programs from our computer, doing so can cause our files and programs to scatter themselves all over our disk drive. Then when we try to launch a program, our hard drive has to work much harder by searching many different areas of our drive in order to get that program to load for us. And this of course hinders our computers performance. So Microsofts Disk Defragmenter program addresses this issue by organizing all our programs and files on our hard disk in a sequential easy to search layout. This technical brief will show you how to organize the files on your hard drive.  Scroll below to find what OS you are using.    For Windows 98    Begin by first clicking on the Start Button.    Then, move your mouse over the Programs menu folder until it expands.    Now move your mouse onto the Accessories menu folder until it expands.

Defragmentation is basically making your computer faster by compressing files.|`|AA10576102	Defragmentation is a process (run by a defragging program) whereby parts of data files on all segments of a computer hard disk are taken from their fragmented state (with parts of files spread all over the disk), and grouped together in complete-file segments. This makes it quicker for applications to find the files they need and frees up disk space, making the computer run more efficiently.  What OS are you using? Usually check out the properties of your hard-drive in My Computer and click on the Tools tab.|`|9b9be4721d7c73c766c75eb6e3bbccd3aa	Defragmenting your PC is a good thing. When you install new programs or download files, the data is not always stored in one place. It gets disorganized, or fragmented. Defragmenting just means reorganizing the data---it doesn't delete or hide anything. It will make your computer run smoother.    To start a defrag, first make sure you have plenty of time to let your computer work (a defrag can take an hour or more to finish, depending on how long it has been since you last performed one). Go to the Start Menu, then Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and Disk Defragmenter. Click on it, and a window should pop up with a couple of white bars. The button below the top bar lets you choose the drive you want to defrag (if you only have one drive, it will most likely be the C drive, and this will show up as the default, so you don't have to change anything). Then click Analyse. After a minute or so, the top white field will fill up with little colourful bars, and a window will appear, telling you whether or not that drive needs to be defragged. Most likely, it will say that you need to defragment this volume. If that is the case, click OK, then click Defragment. Then leave your computer to work its magic while you go eat lunch.    If you're curious about the bizarre coloured bars, they just represent the data that's clogging up your drive. Anything blue is organized data, anything red is disorganized (fragmented). As the process of defragmenting continues, you will notice a distinct decrease in red bars.    Remember that you probably shouldn't run any major applications during a defrag (such as a game). This goes for any maintenance task, such as installing programs or performing upgrades.    When the defrag is done, a window will pop up, with an option to view the details of the defrag. Sometimes a few fragmented files will be left over, especially if it has been a long time since you did this kind of maintenance. Don't worry about it, a few fragments is better than a lot of fragments.|`|Z5TnrNgzaa	by defragmenting your pc you will optimize your hard drive's performance.  e.g. :-Think of your hard disk as a desktop covered with pieces of paper or files.each time you add or remove files, you scatter these pieces of paper around your desktop,so in order to find the files your pc has to look through all of them every time.    By defragmenting your hard drive, your computer organizes all of its files and thereby makes retrieving them faster and faster every time.    to do defragment,you have to  1) select start > all programs  >accesories   >system tools > diskdefragmenter    2) then analyze the drive ,then view the report and then defragment it.|`|OGjYxswjaa	Helps your computer with space.

5974ac0d473a6fd62bd5a23ca84c56f0aa	I take it your windows firewall is turned off(if not first add the port to the windows firewall or add utorrent as an exception program) and you have a linksys or some similar router/switch/firewall you have bought or have one from an isp such as ATT.  Basically you need to access the config for that firewall, usually via a website on the firewalls ip.  This is usually your default gateway.  (quoted entries below are actions)  To find your gateway, start...run...cmd.exe   ''enter''   type ipconfig /all ''enter''  Your default gateway should be listed(ex 192.168.1.1), then open a web browser and goto http://192.168.1.1  then get into the router, if you dont know the login and pass goto the website for the router manufacturer and download the manual for your router.  The default login and pass will be in that manual.  In the config for the router(firewall) there is a port forwarding section.  What ever port is listed in utorrent for a forwarding port shoul be intered into the forwarding section.  From port   (from utorrent preferences)  To port (the same)   To IP:  (your machines IP address running urtorrent, you can get this with ipconfig from above)    Add those entries click apply and check your port in utorrent, it will verify if it is bing forwarded or not.
51f1c4d3c6224f7062f8c1f7bfb3723aaa	Honnestly - I switched to my first ibook now 5 yrs ago, I just recently changed to a new Macbook since my ibook was running a bit slower but i've kept it because it still works great.     Anyways, here's what I always say to friend who ponder about switching over to the Apple side... Buy one if you think you need one and when I say need it's not just You need to look and feel cool by having a sexy Macbook on your lap while sipping a latt downtown. I mean you need it for your work: Do you use graphic design software for work ? Do you need to do some websiye buidling ? Maybe you like to work on pictures on your free time (the screen is amazing on the Macbook by the way), maybe you'd like to make movies easily with imovie or Podcasts with Garage band ? You see it's all about usefull things, made easy to use and that work. That's it - it works. Pure and simple. I have never seen an error message pop up in my face in 5yrs !    Now, if you're be doing some text editing, maybe a couple of Excel spreadsheets and PP presentations - oh sure you can do it all on a Mac - but really, if that's all you'll be doing + some web surfing, just go with a plain Dell.    And that's that . :-D

Las computadoras nuevas y recientes usan de litio..    Bueno, las de litio, slo una vez al mes o dos meses, mas o menos, se debe dejar descargar la bateria al 100 por ciento, slo para el hecho de que se calibre la bateria con la computadora, pues recuerden que est se?ala cuanto queda de batera. Porqu, pues porque las de litio, slo tienen como de 300 a 500 recargas, no tienen efecto memoria.... as que si usas tu computadora con la bateria, en el momento en que ests en una corriente electrica, debers conectarte, para que no gastes los 300 a 500 recargas...    Las de cadmio, son diferentes, cuando uses la pila, la debers descargar hasta el mnimo para volverla a llenar, as deber ser siempre, pues tienen un efecto memoria, esto es, que si al llegar al 50 por ciento, la recargas, as muy seguido, la batera calculara, que al llegar al 50 % ya no tiene mas bateria y ya no la dar, es complicado pero as es..    Ahora contestando tu pregunta.. siempre la puedes dejar conectada, pero quitale la bateria, seas cual sea que uses, porque las puedes quemar, sea de cadmio o de litio....    Mtete a google y vers como hay varias pginas dedicadas a lo que te digo.....|`|QNouz1WHaa	Gracias a Aodl por la info|`|bF6UtKs6aa	S, dejarla conectada DEMASIADO tiempo es malo para la batera, pues en ella no ocurren los procesos qumicos necesarios para que funcione bien. A la mayora de laptops actuales les basta con 4 o 6 horas cargando APAGADAS, por que encendidas para que se carguen bien demora mucho ms,     de 8 a 12 horas. Lo ideal es ocuparlas sin conectar cuando se pueda, y ya que se est bajando mucho la batera conectarlas. No la dejen das cargando porque se les muere la batera.

nCZyWMn4aa	I'm assuming this is a high school senior project?    If you like video editing, a documentary or instructional video is easy to demonstrate and show off.  For graphics design you could develop a mod for an existing computer game, creating your own graphics, units, structures and storyline. This could be justified in terms of practicing commercial game development or just building unique creative content, i.e. intellectual property.  You could also make videos to show online. Teachers love educational videos especially much. You could help each teacher make a video on their favorite topic and call the whole thing a Montage of Learning or something.    Whatever you choose to do, make sure to pitch your project as part of a large field or theme. This way it takes on legitimacy from outside experiences and fits comfortably into a place in the observer's mind. People like things they can categorize.
E0MGkUt4aa	Short answer is... it IS possible. However, there are a few things you CAN do yo avoid this a little bit. To start, make sure (and it cannot be stressed enough) you're sharing the connection with a LAN SWITCH and not using a LAN HUB. LAN HUB is your worst scenario. From there, there are some things you can do to avoid your friend from looking into your stuff. But if you don't feel secure, your best bet is buying a second router. Connect your friend to your current router, and connect the WAN-port of the NEW Firewall Router next to your friend's cable. Your home-pc goes on the LAN ports of your new firewall router. He won't be able to get into your computer, but he is still sharing your internet. It's a much more secure scenario. He would need to be a very experienced networking geek to break that scenario...|`|26da3bea24e065f5a6ef06840a60c929aa	I doubt it.

18e27a2fc4d6db64bf1a6bfd2c2fff4baa	The Domain Name System (abbreviated DNS) is an Internet directory service. DNS is how domain names are translated into IP addresses, and DNS also controls email delivery. If your computer cannot access DNS, your web browser will not be able to find web sites, and you will not be able to receive or send email.     The DNS system consists of three components: DNS data (called resource records), servers (called name servers), and Internet protocols for fetching data from the servers.     The billions of resource records in the DNS are split into millions of files called zones. Zones are kept on authoritative servers distributed all over the Internet, which answer queries based on the resource records stored in the zones they have copies of. Caching servers ask other servers for information and cache any replies. Most name servers are authoritative for some zones and perform a caching function for all other DNS information. Large name servers are often authoritative for tens of thousands of zones, but most name servers are authoritative for just a few zones.|`|AA10664226	DNS translates your domain name to an IP address. So you can type "yahoo.com" rather than an IP address.|`|ZPL9WQTmaa	The DNS as seen by a internet user is : "Servers that your browser connects to to find the ip address of the url you type into the browser window." If you type "google.com" into your browser window, your browser will use a DNS server to translate the url into the actual address (ip, port) of the server that hosts the google service, i.e where google is actually located.

I don't know what kind of computer it is but make sure it has at least 1 GB RAM, and lots of hard disk space. But $200's still cheap, I have emachines too, and I got mine for $600.

AA12262106	The best way to find out your real internet speed is to do an online speed test. Type in "speed test" in the search of your browser and select a site that offers free speed tests.<br>    Run the speed test and you will get a precise result. <br>     If you find that the speed test is too much trouble select the dsl/cable at 2 megabits. 10 megabits is very high speed and your Telus connection is more than likely less than that.|`|nGUeZDJcaa	Best way is to call your internet provider...but most high-speed internet is going to fall in the cable/fiber 10M category.  Even if it doesn't, it will be like 7ish and you won't want to choose the 2M DSL/Cable option.  Stick with the 10M.  Good luck!|`|AA10364009	Just to add on to this...

If you cash it and forward it, it will bounce.<br>  <br>  This is a widely-known scam.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	Here is a a few simple tests to help tell if it is a scam.<br>  <br>  Never heard of them or didn't do anything to earn the money.<br>  <br>  Call the bank on the check and see if there is funds to actually deposit it. If you can even call the bank the check is written on. <br>  <br>  If it is to good to be true, it usually is.<br>  <br>  You might want to call the police. They may pass it off to the FBI, but maybe these criminals can be caught.<br>  <br>  Here is how the fraud/scam works.<br>  They send you a fake check. It will clear your bank in the required 24 hrs and they will verify that it cleared if you call your bank. You can now send the money because you at least think you have the funds to cover it. The funds almost always go through Western Union because it is much harder to trace and catch the criminals. About that time, the funds in your account vanish because the check bounced. You are out however many dollars you sent. <br>  <br>  Never send money to anyone you don't know and don't expect it back. Never give out personal information. Never send any compromising pictures.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf

UK0HFbCyaa	It's a fairly safe website. If it was unsafe, it wouldn't be as successful as it is (and therefore wouldn't be important to have a section on Yahoo Answers)<br>  <br>  There are plenty of features to improve safety, like choosing if anyone can see your profile, any inside a network you join (a network is a recognized group, such as a school), anyone who is friends with your friends, or only friends. You can also block certain people from knowing you exist on Facebook entirely.<br>  <br>  No one can see your information unless you have added them as a friend or confirmed their friend request (unless you have set your security option to allow anyone to see your profile).<br>  <br>  Facebook is also very productive. There are many applications that rally causes, such as raising money for North Korean refugees, or feeding hungry children. There's also groups for aiding cancer research, or health in the environment (some applications have sponsors who pay to protect/preserve rainforests as you use the applicaiton). Most of this applications, if any, don't require any personal information.<br>  <br>  It's a pretty good community- lots of students set up groups dedicated to helping each other study for finals, keep each other updated on events, etc. Just don't procrastinate on it- it's very easy to get addicted to it. To prevent addiction/over use early on, think of it as an email service, rather than a network of people, chatting, and games. That way you only check for updates, ocassional talking, and you don't get sucked into mindless surfing on there.|`|soYU9Tk6aa	depends on who uses it and for what intentions and in what ways<br>  i think it is very safe.|`|kUTJ6AzHaa	hey we have the same name!!!<br>  oh and facebook really isn't that safe, but that's all depending on how you use it.<br>  as soon as you get one, you must adjust your privacy settings.<br>  facebook is set to notify all your friends of what you're doing. for example, on the home page it will tell your friends when you have updated your status message, added pictures, wrote on other people's walls, etc. however, you can make it so nothing pops up about you.<br>  <br>  all in all, facebook is the best networking site because it's popular and it's a great way to keep in touch.<br>  <br>  so your question how safe is it? well that depends on how safe you want it to be.|`|wLcQs7jFaa	I'd say it's definitely safe. Just make sure to only add friends that you actually know. Also, there are many privacy settings so that no one outside of the friends you've added can see your profile.

KRTPJP2baa	The only advantage of recorded is in any PayPal dispute regarding non delivery. PayPal will not accept Proof of Posting as Proof of Delivery and a scam buyer (there are plenty of them on eBay) will always win if you cannot show the item was signed for on delivery.

I'm also a seller on ebay on occasion. I have a requirement on all shipments for DELIVERY CONFIRMATION and I add the $0.75 in the shipping total and put that in all my descriptions as well.<br>  <br>  I've had someone come back on me that that same thing sometime back and I looked up the Delivery Confirmation on the USPS site and it gave me the date and time it was delivered right to that persons door. So, I know for a fact she was lying so I sent her a copy of it that I had copied and pasted from the site. Needless to say I never heard from her again.<br>  <br>  It was a nice size order of over $500.00 and she didn't insure so we have to do something to protect ourselves with PROOF OF SHIPMENT. <br>  <br>  The best to you...<br>  <br>  Have a great evening...|`|gdMLw2Q6aa	I, too have had the same problem as the previous person who replied to this post.  I sell a lot on eBay and ALWAYS get the recorded delivery.  The only downside is that it is only trackable once it is delivered.  However, because Royal Mail have been unable to confirm delivery, I was able to make a claim on the two occassions that it happened.  One fellow seller once e-mailed me after checking my feedback left for someone as she was filing disputes with non-received items and he had no come-back.  Sure enough, she tried it with me, but I had proof of delivery so she didn't get very far and it also added weight to the other person's argument.  However, with DVD's, eBay are going to change their policy so that you do not charge for delivery.  It keeps flashing up on my screen when I sign in - so you may wish to sell something else!|`|VhWll8Vjaa	Personally as a seller I always advertise my P+P as recorded delivery, and as a buyer I would prefer to pay the extra for peace of mind.<br>  <br>  If you offer recorded delivery then that you can prove whether the item actually did arrive at it's destination or not, by tracking it online.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, if the item is not worth much. I will have two P+P options, one being standard 1st or 2nd class. The other being Recorded.<br>  <br>  I don't mind, because it's the buyer paying the extra, not me. And afterall, you aren't meant to be making any profit out of the postage costs.

For example, if you were to post the song Hallelujah written by Leonard Cohen on a video then that would be an infringement but if someone who had licensed the right to do that and was paying royalties or simply had permission from Leonard they would be OK. Check out the rendition of that song by Jeff Buckley at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrHaQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrH...</a> Notice who posted the material: SonyBMG. They surely are legal. They own the rights so they can publish it. They don't need permission from anyone. You would need permission from them.<br>  <br>  You say:I'm uploading it again right now but only this time, I changed the video's name before uploading it so there is no mention of the song name, artist or the video content. Do you think that will work?<br>  <br>  It may work but it is still illegal. you are breaking the law.

SJM0rzHtaa	Things you can do to troubleshoot:<br>  <br>  1) Make sure the monitor cable is securely connected. Sometimes a loose cable can cause wierd images.<br>  <br>  2) try a different monitor cable.  If a different cable fixes the problem, you got a bum cable.<br>  <br>  3) try a different monitor (if you have a friend who has a computer, take your Mac Mini and try your friend's monitor).  If the Mac Mini works fine with another monitor, there's a problem with your monitor.<br>  <br>  4) If trying a different cable and different monitor still yields the same strange image, there might be something wrong with your Mac Mini.  You might want to visit  your local Apple store and ask about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Log in to the router Http://192.168.1.1  Use admin and admin for the username and password.  CHANGE the password to something else.  Tape the password and the WPA key password to the bottom of the router.  My p-touch gets a lotta miles on this step.

You will see a bunch of boxes and options, scroll down to the multimedia section and there is a box that says "Show pictures". Make sure that the box is checked and then press OK.

Never use the account for anything else than that,  you find spam is low to non existant if you follow this rule, and even if it does become spam laden, then you  can delete the account and create a new sub account and do all the email updates to ebay, paypal, banks and your  freinds.    finally your master account from your ISP, this one you NEVER use, it's only kept for creating sub accounts since  changing the master account is a real pain.      and if you have a wireless router follow these tips,      1. Use WPA encryption (WPA-PSK) it's less crackable then WEP.    2. Make a passphrase that is upper & lower case and has some numbers thrown in there as well, again harder to crack.  some like mAkE1t5eCurE0rel53 and as long as possible.    3. Use MAC access control so only you or authorized PC's can connect (even if you do have encryption turned on)    4. Turn off DHCP use static addresses.    5. Turn off SSID (and change it) unless your card really needs it (some do)    6. Change username/password of access unit front end    7. Ensure you have the usual firewall enabled on your PC.    8.

SJM0rzHtaa	One of the biggest items of confusion I've seen lately is that there are an increasing number of motherboards coming out with HDMI on-board with integrated graphics.  Problem is, once you plug in an add-on PCIe video card, it disables the integrated graphics and the mobo onboard HDMI.  So if you are using an add-on video card, make sure you are not using the motherboard HDMI if that is your setup.<br>  <br>  Another thing with HDMI is that they also transmit sound.  That means on some add-on video cards that have a built-in HDMI port, it is not active until you install additional drivers to activate the graphics card's onboard sound.  You might want to look into that if you are using an add-on card's HDMI port.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|iTBqOwxtaa	It may be set to work with the VGA cable.<br>  Try that first.

SzK3zRMSaa	You are talking about Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  This is the art, not the science, of making your website more friendly to search engines so they will give you a higher ranking.    In general, you need to do two things:    1. Use title tags on each page that include your desired keywords, and echo them in the text on that page.    2. Have other sites link to yours.  Google assumes that sites with more links to them must be more relevant, so it will rank them higher.

R1NHUuyzaa	I'm not sure of your bios version, but when your computer starts, press the key that corresponds with "Setup" or "BIOS" or something (Mine is F1, but comps are different). Find the Boot order or Boot list.

In the BIOS there is a boot order setting, where you set the priority order for booting.  Usually, it's CD then HDD, but yours is set for USB.  Just put the CD first, the HDD next, and the USB last.  This way you can boot from a CD if you ever need to, but it will be ignored as long as there is no bootable CD in the drive.|`|YK5Mg2wBaa	I don't think you would want to disable the detection because you probably would have to disable more than just the one USB port, in order to get the backup drive USB disabled.    If you don't want it to detect the drive, turn it off if it has a on/off switch, or just don't plug it in to the USB till you want to use it.

Only 9% of office computers are Macs - all the others are PCs. So if you want to work in an office, or just build office skills, go with a PC.    Macs have a higher penetration in certain sectors like graphics. If you are planning to go into design or video production, go with a Mac.    Macs are more expensive than PCs for the same amount of power; if you don't have much money, stay with a PC|`|SFai2Eb9aa	apple computer:)|`|EW9Dgbz7aa	pc are best for office work, mac's are for video editing|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Pick the applications that you'd like to run on the computer, then pick a PC or a Mac based on which one supports the applications that you want.    If you want to write things in Microsoft Word, you can buy either a Mac or a PC, since Word is available for both.  Macs are prettier and a little bit friendlier, but they also cost more.  For word processing, e-mail, and surfing the Web, either type of computer will do, so it's just a matter of your personal preference.|`|RyvKws7Laa	If you're on a budget stick with PC 100%.  Its far more cost effective for what you're describing as the usage.  I'm sure the Mac can do your homework too, but you're paying an awful lot for a homework computer then.    Next, worry about your support network.  Does your friends, family, classmates, and/or local computer stores offer you any support for a Mac?  If no one around you can help you on a Mac, then you might want to stay PC.  Unless you feel you can be very hands-on with troubleshooting.  I'm not saying the Mac will breakdown on you, but its a computer and will likely give you some problem at some point.    If you really feel you want a Mac, you could always get one and install Windows on it.  Then you can boot up in either OSX or Windows.  You can use the same machine for both operating systems.  Just boot up into the one you want for the various tasks you're doing.  This costs a bit extra as you'll have to buy a Mac and a licensed copy of Windows.  But it gives you the most flexibility.  The software needed to install Windows onto the Mac is free and comes with all current Macs (its called Boot Camp).|`|s38AMdbhaa	WOW. You JUST double-posted. Get a PC.

fE7zhp3Caa	I imagine it depends on what kind of IT career you're after.  If you're going to be doing programming, you need a healthy understanding of how binary works and possibly how to do conversions to and from binary.    You don't have to worry about coding in binary or being able to make sense of a random binary sequence.  Binary is a dynamic language that's entirely dependent on context.  For example, the binary string 01000001b (the b on the end says it's binary but isn't part of the number) could be read in several ways depending on the context.  In ASCII it's the letter A, but as a decimal number it's 65, and as a hexadecimal number it's 41h (the h is for hexadecimal and isn't part of the number).    So you'll probably benefit from knowing how binary works, how to convert binary into hexadecimal, octal, and decimal, but it's not something that you'll deal with a lot or be expected to use all the time.  If you do any programming, you'll usually use a programming language that's easier to read and write.  If you do tech support, you'll be dealing with other problems and never get down to the level of binary.    Knowing hexadecimal is probably far more important as something you'll use.  It's a way to short-hand binary (1 hexadecimal digit is the same as 4 binary digits).|`|q0rGhf0vaa	depends what you want to do with your IS career. but jeez, i'm a technical writer, and i have to know binaries.    they aren't THAT hard to learn. just do it!    i'd say you'd probably need them at some points of your career.
AA11963065	Got to the top where it says "Insert" click on it.  A list will pop down.. go down to where it says  WORDART.  You can select colors and styles. You can also make them as large as you want as you edit them.       If you simply want large letters.. in an open document, type the letter you want, highlight it, then under the "Fonts"  select the style you want or not. To the right of this tab are numbers.. make sure the letter is highlighted and pick a large number such as 32.. you can even change the color if you wish.. There is also a "B" to the right of the font size which means BOLD.. Play with it a bit.. if you don't like what you have simply start over.. Don't be afraid to experiment. It can be intimidating sometimes but there is an "UNDO" button on the top  of your screen.. It's two little blue arrows that curve.. the one on the left will undo your last action..

The only issue is, if your PC came preinstalled with an operating system, you may not have the disk (It should be in your documentation if you have it - but I don't know that they give them out any more)    If not, you'll have to either buy a new copy of Windows, use a free OS (linux) or er... acquire a copy of Windows another way...|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Reinstall Windows with a full (not a quick) format.|`|rKZM0GGgaa	go into BIOS menu (usually pressing F12 when system is booting up) find somewhere where it says format harddrive (usually C:) then when its done, insert windows installations disk and that should do it, my take a few hours though, you could always just manually clear everything off it, if its harddrive space you want, if your harddrive is say 120GB you wont actually get 120GB to use youl probably get about 90GB. another thing you could do, is make an account called ADMINISTRATOR in control panel > user accounts. then remove the current ADMIN account and all its files and settings.

I think that something similar happened with your computer, maybe a hit with something, specially if you are used to carry it in a backpack when you trabel on public transportation.    Unfortunatelly the problem is the screen, then your only soultion is changue it, because you cant fix that with any software.

5566e54741a34b8bac019fae7f5857fbaa	Allora, c' un bellissimo software chiamato HAMACHI che permette di collegare 2 o + computer tra di loro contemporanemante. Lo scarichi gratuitamente dal sito (digiti Hamachi su google).  E' importante che i 2 computer abbiano la stessa versione del suddetto software.  Installalo.  Il computer riconoscer il programma come una scheda di rete. Affinch i 2 computer possano comunicare tra di loro disattiva su entrambe le macchine windows firewall ma solo per la scheda di rete Hamachi.  Una volta installato ti si aprir un'intuitiva interfaccia grafica.  Premi il pulsante di acceso/spento in basso a sinistra. Il programma si collegher ad internet.  Clicca su configura Hamachi (rondella in basso a destra) poi su preferenze. Nel men della nuova finestra seleziona sistema. Togli il segno di spunta ad aggiornamento. Poi sempre nel men seleziona sicurezza e togli il segno di spunta a "Blocca servizi Microsoft Windows Vulnerabili". (Stessa cosa per l'altro computer)  A questo punto con uno dei 2 computer dovrai creare una rete: in basso a destra clicca crea o unisciti ad una rete. Inserisci nickname ed una password a tua scelta.  A questo punto con l'altro computer ti dovrai unire alla rete che hai creato.

I called them and after speaking with three barely English-speaking CSRs' (one of them a supervisor), I was told I need to fax my receipt and two cards to them so they can escalate.  Hassle!    I went back to CC and spoke with another mgr and he offered to do a return but their system wouldn't let them issue a refund.  Gonna call Bank of American and dispute the charge now.

Then follow the instructions to set up Windows.    During the install, you can either choose to erase the hard drive or keep the current files intact.  If there's anything you want to recover, you should keep the current files intact.  If not, go ahead and erase the drive.

So, if I have a file on my computer, and you search for that file on all the peer computers you are connected to, you will see my computer listed there.

If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

It is also wise to know how to contact your DNS provider.

It's most easily seen in a JPEG image with all that "blocky" noise you sometimes see.  It's a similar problem with video.    Compressing a sound file reduces the dynamic range.

No matter how you "stretch" an image, it won't look good unless you have a higher pixel dimension on the width & height of the image.

Go on Google Images or Photobucket & look for a larger image, like around 1000x2000 or somewhere in the thousands to get a good-quality, larger image.

How to forward the ports is specific to each individual router. |`|AA10394789	There are two things you can do to increase speed.    One is to allow incoming communications by forwarding BitTorrent through any firewall or router.

This guide will help with speed on both of those programs as they are identical (best to use only one though):  Optimizing Torrent for Speed  http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/...

So, you're pretty much safe. :D|`|9gtkMokKaa	Yep, actually there is. theres sites that are called like, myspacehome.com, or something stupid like that. its just the home page though. it takes you to a page that looks exactly like the myspace homepage, and tells you to log in, and when you do, they have your password,, and theyll log in and span your account. lol. |`|fB7j5nItaa	Yes, mostly they're just spammers however the fake myspace homepages are created in order to steal your name and sometimes put little unnoticeable tracers.

It is easy to install i.e in terms of devices and cabling  2. It is easy to identify faults concerning device problems because all devices use centralized device which is hub/router or switch ...  3. It is easy to add new device/network in the range of existing one as long as your hub/router or switch has empty port  4. Only failed device on the net will not function  5.

You can do wireless USB too (with the adaptor that will come with your device).    For the monitor, you just have to figure out which port the laptop has.  Either it has the standard DVI connection (then you just need a DVI cable) or it has the new mini display port (then you need to buy a mini to DVI adaptor from Apple).  From what I can tell, the new $999 White MacBook does use the mini display port, so you'll have to buy the adaptor ($19)|`|pBajQp7laa	Umm why did you buy a laptop???|`|gYFtQyyQaa	I am not sure about a monitor and a keyboard, but you can buy a usb mouse for your macbook.

If the original document has smudges or the font is not very clear, you may get some strange characters from the OCR, but it will not put the text on the other side of the paper or in weird places.  At worse, it would combine characters because it cannot determine where one character stops and another starts.

RQIQmMpvaa	.mac doesnt. have internet it has safari.|`|2LHgmq97aa	Differences are:   -Macs cost significantly more for less/lower spec hardware  -Macs use a subset of PC hardware  -Less System options on Mac  -Legally run OS X on Mac (can be done on a lot of new PC hardware Illegally)  -Low-Middle end Macs lack expandability      PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..    Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.     Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:    Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    Install at least Free Versions of Avira AntiVir, Avast, Comodo Firewall on the Vista.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:    1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...    4) It is faster/MORE SECURE. Surf the internet and even run some windows programs with Wnehq/Crossover..    LINUX OS  If you are worried about viruses, spyware, security, Try Linux (it is free), I have included some information about Linux and links  so you are not lost if you decide to try it.    Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)    Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and free.  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.  All you have to do is..  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO or get InfraRecorder http://infrarecorder.org/ )  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.

They're 2 different Operating Systems...which feature different things, for example Mac have good software for things like music & video etc.|`|ipfWDGtAaa	The terminology is all mixed up, since really "PC" just means "personal computer" -- a Mac fits this category as well.  It's not your fault though, just years of people using the terms in confusing ways.    But it seems like what you really want to know is: What's the difference between Mac OS X and Windows?  These are the two main consumer operating systems, and the fundamental difference between "Mac and PC".    It's almost a religious debate among the technical elite, but the bottom line is that both operating systems provide all the basic functionality that most people need.  You can get online and take care of basic office needs with the software bundled with either operating system.  Microsoft Office is also available for both Mac and Windows.    So, to actually answer the question, here are some general differences:  * Mac OS X has very few security threats (basically no viruses)  * Windows has a ton of viruses, but Microsoft is constantly working to patch the holes that viruses exploit... still, viruses are infecting Windows machines  * Windows has more software available, but everything that most people need is also available for Mac  * Mac OS X only runs on Apple computers, which are often more expensive  * the way you work with each operating system is a little different; for example, the Mac OS always shows the menu bar for the front application at the top, while Windows puts a menu bar into each window

Try this:    1.Click in one of the numbered paragraphs.  2.Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.  3.In the Paragraph group, click the list box arrow for the paragraph numbering icon and select Define New Number Format.  4.Change the Alignment list box from Left to Right.  5.Click OK.    If you want to adjust the spacing, right-click in the list and select Adjust List Indents from the pop-up menu.    Note that this procedure may change this numbering format on your global template, meaning it will affect future documents and could affect existing ones.     Hope that helps.

Install it on a server, and pick it apart. Open source means that you have access to the source code and 99% of the time it is free.    In general, if you want to develop a site that is more that just a few static html pages, you will need to learn and understand at least one server side programming language (PHP for the Drupal example), and understand the basics of what a database (MySQL is popular) and how to run queries against it using your server side language.    Once you've mastered that you can make it feel more polished and easy to use by sprinkling in a little AJAX where you want certain content on the page to update/reload without the rest of the page doing so (YouTube comments for example), or some javascript (and one of its add-on libraries, like jQuery)) to add in animation, click and drag features, etc.
DCXk0bVLaa	Free - yes. Deepburner.  M3u is a playlist file. Applicable to the program it was created with.  An m3u file can be burned to a disk but without the parent program which created it and the songs available to play it will be useless.  "read CD-R blank disks"?  Do you mean burn to or recognize CD-R?    I've been using Deepburner free for a few years without problems.    http://www.deepburner.com/?r=download    You appear to be unfamiliar with the subject so here's a couple of tips.    Music files burned as wav format files will play on any CD player.  They take up more space so less songs per CD.  Mp3 format files can only be played on more current CD players besides computers but you can get 200 or more per CD.    If burning music files in wav format limit the burn speed to 24x to decrease the chance of errors during the burn process.    Hope this helps.

And then people say Microsoft sucks!|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) OK!! lets take a step backwards here for a moment, you are loading a program for iTunes in Vista basic (your OS) & you are also openning internet explorer too (an internet connection) at the same time. OK!! that should work without any problem but the error message is about DEP (data execution prevention).     DEP is one of those weird features that MS started including in windows since XP service pack 1 onwards & in vista too. DEP is a safety feature that is part of hardening up windows internal security & safety it is designed to prevent viruses & malware getting inside windows itself (malware infiltration, or virus infection running amock).    Itunes is probably seen by Vista as wanting unreasonable access to deep internal (kernal level) processes and as it doesn't understand why DEP has prevented it & caused this error. I would strongly suggest the problem is NOT vista but the Itunes software which is probably not that well written for vista given that it comes from apple corp a rival company to Microsoft? humm!!     **NOP!! I would advise you ditch the Itunes software this is quiet probably NOT vista compatible.    **you may need to re-install quick time too, to fix the further problem.    Kind Regards Ivan    computer veteran, windows user since 1989.

What has happened is that the virus reconfigured your file type associations such that opening folders no longer happens with the default explorer.exe.  A system restore can fix this as it will reset the file type associations, but you should make sure that the virus is gone (there are free online scanners you can use if you do not have your own virus program).

a44742a8d8a2c0a6c7d911fc8f30873caa	Hm.. that is really difficult but here are some ideas. I am not sure if any of them works though.    - The card may have come with a tuning/capture software for the card. I don't know if it actually works but give it a shot if the CD included a program for that or ATI's website can let you download one.    - Windows Media Center. I am not sure if the particular card is compatible with it. Some tuner cards are and some others are not. But Media Center should work if your card is compatible with Media Center AND if the input to your card is either analog (cable or over the air) or an over the air digital antenna.     - Other free programs that seem to work with some tuners with some input signal types but may require extensive workarounds include:  GB-PVR (http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/... and TSReader.    Good luck!

Just when playing the song right click somewhere in the empty place near the play button, select View, then Enhancements, then Graphic Equalizer. Just play with the bars till you cant hear the voices (cant help here, its different in all songs).     You can never officialy get the instrumental alone. The tracks are recorded seperate then pieced together in the editing studio. Even if you master the bars, you'll still be able to hear a little voice in the song.

AA11736483	Watching movies and TV over the internet is dependent upon your bandwidth and to some degree, the resources within your PC.  Adding more RAM does not make your PC any faster, however, if you don't have enogh RAM, your PC will slow down dramatically when all the memory has been allocated. 1GB is sufficient. I have a similar machine with 1GB. I can monitor memory usage at any given time. I am a heavy user and have never used up all the RAM.   Your movies and live TV will run smoothly if you don't have a lot of programs running in the background.|`|AA11303545	If the movie or tv on ur computer then yes if its online it depends on ur Internet connection.|`|AA11514979	With a Core 2 Duo you might as well use 2GB.  There's marginal cost increase, and it'll make your system perform much faster, particularly if you have a USB TV tuner rather than a dedicated hardware tuner.    If you're going to watch HD TV (not streaming over the internet), you will probably need 2GB.    RAM makes no difference with internet streaming.

YCPgsvV9aa	Well, there isnt a button to imediatly close it like that. Unless you make a prerecorded macro to close the program that just poped up. Though if it takes a while to close, you can CTR+ALT+DEL and go to task manager, click the Processes link, select the RIGHT one (Internet Explorer would be iexplorer.exe not explorer.exe!!!) and hit end proccess. It will IMEDIATLY close the program.    Though if you select the wrong one, it'll make you restart your computer, or you can click aplications then new task and enter the name you accidentally closed. Say if you closed explorer.exe instead of iexplorer.exe it will shut your desktop down, and you'll just see your windows and a desktop backround picture. If you do New Task and type explorer.exe and ok then it'll reboot the exe and everything will come back up.

uuDloQnCaa	AVG free is a very poor anti-virus there are much better free alternatives the best being Avast.    Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.

1EN9ngsbaa	well theres alot of things you can to to get more views.<br>  <br>  You should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube.

Other files which are <br>  acceptable are AVI, MPG, MOV and WMV,<br>  which belongs to Windows Movie Maker for <br>  both XP and Vista. (If anyone suggests you<br>  format at 640x480, that is "old news" which<br>  YouTube was recommending in May of last <br>  year.)<br>  <br>  Here is the relevant YouTube help reference <br>  and URL written-out in full -- followed by the <br>  direct link:<br>  <br>  www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / answer . py ? hl = en & answer = 91450<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=91450" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...</a><br>  <br>  If you want your videos to be shown at 16:9<br>  "widescreen" together with the "high quality"<br>  option, you should consider all of this:<br>  <br>  Basically, all digital video recorders (DVRs)<br>  function using 720x480 "rectangular" pixels.<br>  Computers have lots of different resolutions, <br>  but they all utilize "square" pixels. As such,<br>  Flash "encoders" can't always compensate<br>  or properly adjust for the difference. Just as<br>  important, lots of downloaders & converters <br>  render uploaded videos "fuzzy-looking" with <br>  rather large square pixels that look as if the <br>  videos were recorded using 120x90. This is<br>  particularly noticeable when there is motion <br>  in the video, or during slide show montages<br>  when still photos/images segué in between<br>  one and another. Thus. keep your videos in<br>  their original format as much as is possible.<br>  <br>  YouTube's old ideal at the very beginning of <br>  summer was 640x480. It seems reasonably<br>  close to the 720x480 resolution of the DVR, <br>  but YouTube really scales all of their videos <br>  "down" to 480x360 (or 640x360 widescreen, <br>  which is the new size of the player window).<br>  <br>  Because the ratio may now also be at 16:9, <br>  those types of videos can also be uploaded <br>  at 480x270, 640x360, 864x486 or the really<br>  massive 1280x720 -- which is really overkill<br>  for no practical gain. The best option surely<br>  is 640x360. Because the aspect would still <br>  be 16:9, you might get higher-quality videos <br>  by scaling down to the lower number with a <br>  video encoder that's "high-quality", such as <br>  a codec that's H.264, Divx, Xvid or MPEG-4.<br>  This would then accomplish several results:<br>  -- a smaller file (thus faster uploading)<br>  -- YouTube also has less to "process"<br>  -- you control the final scaling of pixels<br>  -- the video gets high-quality encoding.<br>  <br>  The exact same thing is true is you were to <br>  use 480x360 for regular videos because not <br>  only would that aspect ratio still be 4:3, the <br>  height of the new player is 360 pixels.<br>  <br>  I hope that my answer helps you somehow.|`|46OYLEXWaa	All you need to do is continue uploading the highest quality video you have available.

Several of the Windows system files that you use to run your computer are stored in the System32 directory, which is why several of the errors you receive may be led by System32.     The System32 directory won't usually cause any problems by itself, so if you are receiving an error with a System32 file, you need to search for that file to resolve the problem. Go to Start, Search and then choose All files and folders to search for the file that is giving you trouble.    And you need this folder to run Windows on your computer, as well. So, there is no need to delete it.|`|xJnD7of4aa	I second that... leave it alone, if you want windows to work!

7vh5fOeRaa	OpenOffice documents are already compatible with their Microsoft Office counterparts.  All you need to do is make sure you use the conversion utility within OpenOffice to save the file in native Powerpoint format and your teacher will be able to open it with no problem at all!    Here's a nice website that will show you how to properly save files in OpenOffice to Microsoft Office formats.  You can even convert files you've already saved:  http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/510...  (Scroll down to the "Exporting OpenOffice documents" section.)    To put it simply... you basically need to choose "Save As" instead of "Save" when you are ready to save the document and then select the equivalent Microsoft Office product... in your case, you'd want to select Powerpoint.    Another nice thing about OpenOffice... if you wan't you can configure OpenOffice to automatically save all documents in a Microsoft Office format.  If you are typically creating documents in OpenOffice that you find yourself needing to convert to send to friends or teachers, you could make this change so you don't even have to think about doing the conversion.  Of course, OpenOffice will still be able to read the files just fine.  The directions for doing this are also in the same link I sent you above.    Good luck!!|`|79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	when saving it, use "save as" and then select a Microsoft office powerpoint format instead of its own.

cgfE0yyzaa	You pretty much need an image editing program, like Paint (for Windows) for example. Adobe Photoshop is highly advanced image editing program and you can do basically a lot more stuff to be creative.    Most avatars in website forums usually have file size and dimension limit. Most image editing programs should have the ability to crop and resize a picture to the new size you want. The smaller the size, the lower the file size. Some advanced image editing programs like Photoshop lets you do advanced editing and size optimizing, so you can pretty much control the file size and quality in the end doesn't matter the dimension.    Since you only mentioned the file restriction, I made that image into a 100 x 100 px: http://i44.tinypic.com/ekm8pd.jpg (12.38 kb)    It's a good thing to learn a bit about image editing so you can at least create avatars and such in your own creativity.

sSEy6KYiaa	Easy     1. Consolidate your iTunes Library. This is the default setting on the Mac, but not so on Windows. Go to Advanced ? Consolidate Library. iTunes will copy all of your music into your "some_folder/iTunes/iTunes Library/" folder.     2. Open iTunes on the computer you will be transferring the music to. Make sure iTunes runs, etc. If there is anything in this library, it won't be for long. (You can copy these songs in later, but you won't be able to keep their ratings, etc. For the adventurous, seek out SyncOTunes, a somewhat abandonware project that may help you.) Open iTunes' Preferences and make sure that the options "Copy Music to iTunes Library" and "Keep Library Organized" are checked. They'll come in handy later.     3. Close iTunes. Drag its iTunes folder to your Desktop. On the Mac, it is found at "~/Music/", on Windows, "My Documents/My Music/".     4. Move the iTunes folder that contains the library you want into the spot you just vacated.     5. Re-open iTunes. There is a good chance you will see a dialog pop up that reads "Upgrading Library" if the versions don't exactly match. In fact, going from an older version to a newer version is sometimes better as iTunes does some magic to the XML file that contains its library on the upgrade cycle which can weed out old junk.     6. If the iTunes folder that you dragged to your Desktop contained anything you wanted, you can now open it up, open the iTunes Library folder, and drag those folders (which contain the music) into iTunes to copy them into iTunes. Otherwise, trash that whole iTunes folder; you don't need it. (The one on your Desktop, silly!)|`|5dYrLs45aa	First, you want to de-authorize all of the purchased iTunes items on the old machine BEFORE transferring them.

Cddqq9dBaa	No, MP3 and CD is not the same thing. They are different formats. In CD format you can only fit like 20 songs or so on a CD but in MP3 format you can put like 100 or so. Most CD players these days play MP3s off a disc. The quality can be just as good, you just have to check what the file sounds like before you burn it.|`|8qgd8w1Iaa	a cd is a disk for storing info. mp3 is a format used for storing info.   a typical cd holds about 700 mb. quality depends on the original source and method/s  used to convert/play as well as other factors.  homemade cds' can have the same quality as store bought. you should be aware of copy right laws. people can go to jail and pay heavy fines for copy right infringement. you can e-mail me for more info.

Go for a laptop, they aren't much more expensive than a pc in the same performance range.  Most are now upgradeable, but only to an extent. And add on cards are limited to PCMCI and usb.    If your looking for an office computer, something that will be more comfortable for sitting at for long periods, get a desktop.  Most companies you can buy from now will sell the monitor bundled with the pc for a decent price.  Another perk about the laptop is lower cost of parts,  more versatility, and higher performance potential (because of the power requirements)    Then again, if your on the pc all day every day, I'd recommend a laptop with a docking station at the office and at home.  That way you can have the comfort of a desktop, with the mobility of a laptop.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	As the previous poster mentioned, it seems a bit pricey for what you're getting.  Some of that is probably due to Canadian vs US dollars, but a few things to keep in mind:    1)  The most important component in a gaming PC is the graphics card, not the CPU.  A system with a $150 graphics card and $75 CPU has superior gaming performance than a system with a $75 graphics card and $150 CPU.  Extra CPU power doesn't matter one bit when your graphics card simply can't process pixels any faster.  So a Radeon 4550 isn't gonna cut it- you'll want at *LEAST* a Radeon 4670 or GeForce 9600GT.  Realistically, the Radeon 4830/GeForce 9800GT are much better choices- they offer a big performance boost for just $25 more.      2)  There's no reason to spend extra for an SLI or Crossfire motherboard if you're going with a single graphics card (which is almost a certainty in your price range).  Dual-gpu cards such as the Radeon 4850X2 operate from a single slot, so you don't need expensive Crossfire mobos for those either.    3) If it's your first build, don't try overclocking- just buy slightly faster components (like spending $50 more on your CPU) and run everything at stock speeds for maximum reliability and lowest cost.  If you aren't overclocking, 667Mhz memory is all you need for an E7300 or E8400.    Here's a link to Toms Hardware's $625 gaming PC (which after the currency conversion, may be close to your target price)  It's a much better baseline build from which you can customize.|`|kAi14kKxaa	Most of it looks fine. Except for the CPU.    How about an e5200? It costs $104:  http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?s...    It may only be 2.5ghz, but in runs better than an Athlon X2 once you overclock it to 2.8 ghz. It's also cheaper than the Athlon in your build.    As for the motherboard, might I suggest this:  ASUS P5KPL-1600:  http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l...|`|GEY9or2Raa	For $1000 you can get alot better parts than what you have priced out.  I would suggest an Intel build for sure.  You can overclock the balls out of an Intel wafer with proper cooling.  Even if you dont plan on overclocking now, it leaves room for the future.  AMD right now is really only reccomended for a low budget build and HTPC (Home Theatre Computers).      So look into getting an E8400 or an E7200, depending on your budget.  Also, look into getting a P45 Chipset from Gigabyte.  Their motherboard quality has been superior to that of Asus for about over a year now.  Asus is still really good, just second to Gigabyte.  The P45 chipset will give you lots of room to overclock.    As for the graphics card, it will not suffice for a gaming build.  That card is old news.  For a gaming rig, with your budget, I would reccomend atleast a ATI 4850.  If you can spend more, then get a Nvidia 260 GTX Core 216.|`|kfnidL8vaa	nice config dude...it will work out...just be careful only with the graphic card model...bcoz not all games support all graphics cards..so check ur games requirements and which graphics card it doesn support..and buy a 5.1 creative speaker...no joy in gaming without good sound...i am a game freak myself...good day :)|`|LBm2NVCpaa	Scrap your entire build, goto http://www.newegg.com and build you an intel system there. you can pick your parts and get a grand total including tax if your unlucky enough to live in one of the states newegg has warehouses in. i build quad core systems for round 1600. and i can do a system like yours for 400 from them. also dont worry bout your motherboard having SLI compatibilities. as it didnt catch on in the 90's im sure it will soon pass. as the first guy said nvidia is the way to go for Gfx cards. special the gtx series. and 216 core is a nice card its the one im looking at for an upgrade. also min specs for a gaming rig should be something along the lines of.    CPU- dual core 2.8ghz/quad core 2.0+ghz recommended  Memory 2gig dual channel 800mhz /4 gigs 1066mhz (6gigs tri-channel for monster gaming)with a 64bit OS  HD - any size you want long as its Sata II and 7200rpm or more  Video- something nvidia unless u love ati. and something with ddr3 memory and min 200 cores. with 512mb mem  PSU- 650 watts. 1000watts recommended. with 6 and 8 pin connectors for video cards/mobo  Motherboard- should be a 8phase mobo. which is has an extra power connector on the board that takes a 8pin plug. with pci-x 2.0 at 16x   Optical drive- fastest DVD/blu-ray u can fit in your budget. (dual layer 16x dvd burners can be picked up for 50 bucks and less all day.)  Case- thats up to what you like just make sure your case matches your motherboard size. like a case that is made for mini or micro atx wont be able to fix a reg atx board. least not in most cases  i have been dealing with computers since the fastest connection you could get was a dialup 14.4 baud modem. man have we come a long way.

Limewire itself is pretty crappy but if you download torrents they are full albums with cover art and all song info in place. Download Limewire just search Limewire in google its free it will ask you to upgrade to pro just say no.    Then visit thepiratebay.org they have full albums here that download at amazing speeds and everything is user rated so if its bad they will tell you ahead of time before you get the virus. You can also get in movies and more I would only suggest music movies and other programs can be dangerous. Try it out

6meHLJktaa	I am pretty sure you should save that picture to your computer, then upload it to your own photobucket account.  That way you will have it for your own and not lose it if that image gets moved or deleted.  When you upload it into your own account, it will give you an html code underneath the thumbnail to post the picture online.  Depending on where you want to post it, the code will be different.  Like so:      Direct link for layout pages  (MySpace backgrounds and custom websites)   - http://yourphotobucket.com/image.png    HTML for websites & blogs  (MySpace, Hi5, Orkut, Friendster, eBay & more) -     HTML Thumb for websites & blogs  (MySpace, Hi5, Orkut, Friendster, eBay & more) -     IMG for bulletin boards & forums - [IMG]http://yourphotobucket.com/image.pn...    IMG Thumb for bulletin boards & forums - [URL=http://yourphotobucket.com//?action...      And there are a couple more codes for sharing in messenger and email, and flash for websites & blogs.    The codes probably won't display correctly on this answer page, that's why you should get your own photobucket and get the codes from there.  Hope that helps.  :)

Vanf51Pzaa	I'm not going to test your code, its your homework not mine.    I can't understand why you would want to remove the punctuation.    To make the code recursive, write out the core problem which is something like this    function(duck, arr)  {  for string duck and string arr  remove and test the first character of duck against the last character of arr  if they match, call function(duck, arr)  }    now you are calling this code from inside the code.  Each time you call it, the arrays will be shortened.
FbjRnvdAaa	you almost had it. see below for the fixed code.     public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {  str = str.toUpperCase();  char[] arr = str.toCharArray();  char[] duck = str.toCharArray();  int z = 0;  for (int i = 0; i   {  if (Character.isLetter(arr[i]))  {  duck[z] = arr[i];  z++;  }  }  boolean flag = true;  for (int i = 0; i   {  if (duck[i] != duck[duck.length - 1 - i])  {  flag = false;  }  }  return flag;    }    and here is the recursive version :      // this is the function that isPalindrome calls to start the recursion     public boolean test(String pal)      {       System.out.println(pal);       if (pal.length()          // String has only one character so it         // is a Palindrome by definition.         return true;  // BASE CASE.     }          // Get the first and last characters of the String.     char first = pal.charAt(0);     char last = pal.charAt(pal.length()-1);                if (first != last) {      // The first and last letters are different      // so the string is not a Palindrome.      return false;           // BASE CASE.         }         else {      // The first and last characters are both letters,      // and they are both the same. So, the string is       // a palindrome if the substring created by dropping      // the first and last characters is a palindrome.      String sub = pal.substring(1,pal.length()-1);      return test(sub);  // RECURSIVE CASE.         }      }         public boolean isPalindrome(String pal) {       pal = pal.toUpperCase();       char[] duck = pal.toCharArray();       int z = 0;       for (int i = 0; i        {       if (Character.isLetter(pal.charAt(i)))       {       duck[z++] = pal.charAt(i);       }       }       return test(new String(duck).substring(0, z));           }|`|a5ba9ea46c4e20291c9dc9d53a67da7faa	Recursion is very very easy to do since U of Toronto had one class on Scheme/Prolog that effectively put a teflon coating on recursion.    If palindromeness testing is removed to driver code it would be even easier for it is a = reverse(a) thing; pop() java.util.Stack would do nicely on the removal of punctuation marks, so here:      public static reverse(String txt) {    if (txt.equals("")) return "";    else return reverse(txt.substring(1)) + txt.charAt(0);  }    public static main(String[] args) {    char[] str = args[0].toUpperCase().toCharArray();    java.util.Stack orig = new java.util.Stack(str);    String clean = "";    while (orig.isEmpty() == false) {      char curr = orig.pop();      if (Character.isLetter(curr)) clean = clean + curr;    }    if (reverse(clean).equals(clean)) ...  }      But move entire code into isPalindrome() is also a thought.    - AT.|`|QZR6gl96aa	public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {  ????str = str.toUpperCase();  ????char[] arr = str.toCharArray();  ????char[] duck = str.toCharArray();  ????int z = 0;  ????for (int i = 0; i   ????{  ????????if (Character.isLetter(arr[i]) == true)  ????????{  ????????????duck[z] = arr[i];  ????????????z++;  ????????}  ????}    ????for (int i = 0; i   ????{  ????????if (duck[i] != duck[duck.length-1-i])   //This is easier than using another variable  ????????{  ????????????return false;  ????????}  ????}  ????return true;  }

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|aCkXkl4Daa	Apple.|`|OL7Uu8Foaa	Try Lenovo or Dell|`|YVd79cbraa	do not get an Acer.  my cousin and i both got one and his completely broke and mine is slowing down.

Cddqq9dBaa	It's the "UP TO" where they get you. They don't put a guarantee that your going to get 10mbps. It's just so they can make sales. Look over your contract with them and see if it mentions anything about that 75% thing you mentioned.    It's all in the contract that you signed so if they make any guarantees than they are responsible to provide those guarantees by law, if you are paying for it.    If there is guarantees that you are not getting, they owe you free service or money back or some kind of compensation. Of course you would need proof of your problems.    If they don't guarantee anything then there is nothing you can really do except keep calling them, threaten to cancel if your not on a contract.    Here is a link to a speed test.    **EDIT- If there is no written contract then there is a verbal contract which they have stated they guarantee 75% of 10mbps. Ask them what they can guarantee again, and keep asking that until you get an answer. Threaten to cancel and go with another company that offers guarantees. Do you have Surewest or Sprint in your area. Look up Internet Providers in your area.    I would say they owe you some kind of compensation. Talk to a supervisor and demand answers. They are out to get your money however they can. Bottom line is your paying for UP TO 10mbps, that is to make it look like you might get a fast connection through them but won't unless it is guaranteed.    A lot of companies if not all use the term "UP TO" so to the consumer they think they are going to get this maximum number which in most cases isn't even close. Why is this allowed? Corrupted Government.    This type of marketing should not be allowed, but for some reason it is. They are taking advantage of it and purposely abusing it. Imagine if you paid for "UP TO" 10 gallons of gas but only got 2. By law you couldn't do anything about it. But that would get changed very quickly due to violence and theft and you would never see "UP TO" again.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Not much you can do.

For each bump in speed, you must be that much closer to the central station. At 10Mbs you have to be almost on top of it. If you are close enough then it comes down to luck and talking to the right person (who has a clue what they are doing). I went from SBC DSL Pro (3Mbs) to SBC DSL Elite (6Mbs) and it actually went slower then the pro. I talked to maybe 20 people all who had no clue. Finally I got lucky and talked to a lady from the line service and not the tech support for the DSL. She said they had to rip the line (or something like that). It took her about 30 seconds to do while I waited on the phone. I went from 2.5Mbs to 5.85Mbs just like that. She said if it happens again to call this number cuz tech support were idiots. Switched to cable since then, but I feel your pain.

Cddqq9dBaa	You need to format the drive which will erase everything on the PC. So if you have any files on the pc that you want to keep, you will need to copy them to a disc because they will be gone with everything else once you format the drive.    This needs to be Windows 2000 or XP to work. Do you have the original operating system disc for the laptop?? It is very important to have that before you format it. It also will require the product key to install it. On my laptop it is on the bottom on a windows label.    If you have those two things you can proceed to format the drive. Then reinstall your operating system. You may also want to Google your question for other methods.    Put the disc in your drive then turn off your pc. turn it back on and select boot from cd. At the Welcome to Setup page, press Enter. Press F8 to accept the Windows XP Licensing Agreement. You'll be asked if you want to repair your existing Windows XP installation. Press ESC to bypass the repair and install a fresh copy. All your existing disk partitions will be listed.    You want to delete the current partition where Windows is installed. Use the arrow key to select it, and press D to delete it. Press L to confirm. Then, to create a new partition, select the unpartitioned space and press C. To create a new partition with the maximum amount of space allotted to it, press Enter.    Now select the brand new partition you've just created to install Windows on. Format the drive in FAT or NTFS doesn't really matter. Then, follow Windows Setup's steps until it asks you to log in for the first time. Congratulations! Welcome to your fresh new Windows installation.

axoPWEo8aa	This game was actually optimized for more less outdated PC's. The requirements are as follows.      * 700mhz Processor      * 128 mb of RAM      * 64 mb Video Card     Your tiny laptop more than meets the requirements. Should run no problem. But if the game play is a little sluggish tone down your settings a bit. Hope this helps.

Change the passwords on all of your other accounts.     If there were threats of violence at all, print it all out including the email headers, and take it to your local police.

Unfortunately he would then start a new name and harass me under that name . I had to email yahoo and change my info , which he always found . Eventually he stopped bothering me after a month or two . It was really werid and not much you can do but switch your email and report him to the local police.

k5KuYkkKaa	You should make replacing your power supply a priority. Currently it is overworked and underpowered. Even though your PSU may have thermal protection, constant abuse of the +12v rail (video card leg), will lead to it's failure and possibly motherboard or systems damage. It's not a matter of if it will fail, but a question of when, and what else will it take with it.|`|3GmG8uQzaa	The most common cause of computer freezes is a corrupt registry. The Computer registry is a database that stores all of your computer<br>  settings. The computer registry becomes more complex as you use your computer.

Without cleaning the registry on a regular basis it is very likely that your PC will freeze.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the Windows registry improves the performance of your computer and will reduce the number of PC freezes.

1jhJO1QSaa	If you don't know her at all I'm assuming you were impressed with her physically which is as good a reason as any to give it a shot. If your going to go after a specific girl though I would STRONGLY suggest reading a book on seduction/pick-up artistry first. You approach her badly and you're down as a creeper permanently.|`|wLcQs7jFaa	It's really unpredictable whether getting to know her will turn out good or bad. Maybe trying sending a message and see if she responds (if you haven't done so already). Perhaps you can start talking to her that way to see if she might be interested and then arrange to meet her in person at school.
qRx3ynKdaa	You can send the file exaclty like you would send any other kind of file<br>  as an attachment.<br>  <br>  Just attach it using your e-mail client.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to send it from within OpenOffice.org, make sure the OpenOffice.org e-mail configuration is properly set up. Under OpenOffice.org Writer's menu select Tools → Options... → OpenOffice.org Writer → Mail Merge E-mail. Then set up your e-mail within OpenOffice.org, using the settings in your regular e-mail client as a guide.<br>  <br>  When you get that working (and it works fine on my machine), then under Impress you can attach to new-created blank e-mail by selecting File → Send → Document as E-mail.

There are 3 places you can easily change the setting...<br>  <br>  1) View pulldown menu --> Screen Mode --> Standard Screen Mode<br>  <br>  2) At the bottom of the toolbox on the left you should see 3 little icons - a rectangle with a toolbar and little boxes in it, a rectangle with just a toolbar, a plain rectangle. Click the first one which is Standard Screen Mode.<br>  <br>  3) Hit the letter F on you keyboard. It will cycle through the 3 screen modes.

But finding the exact version you need can be very tricky sometime and it takes some patience.  Try out websites like cracks.am or even download.com has some key gens believe it or not.  Just remember when messing with this kind of stuff nothing is 100% and there is ALWAYS a chance to get viruses and spy ware  when doing so.  Good-luck|`|QmwzkNj5aa	At least 80% of the programs downloaded on limewire are malicious intentionally infected with viruses or simply Trojans renamed to fit your search.    I would definitely suggest downloading from torrent sites instead using software like uTorrent, Bit Comet, Bit Tornado or if you don't mind running java software try Azureus, also try installing Peer Guardian to block blacklisted uploaders.    Nearly all the software you download from torrent sites will contain everything you need to get it up and running.

I went through many hours trying to get it working and research, I even installed a new OS and still it is not working.  I have concluded that it is just a hardware failure.  When coming across this on the internet I was hoping it was not the case for my computer, but unfortunately it is.<br>  <br>  You may need to have the manufacture take a look at it.|`|1tRAmnnuaa	Maybe the usb isn't properly connected, not the cord but the port to your motherboard.

AA11124005	First go to power settings and adjust it to do nothing when closed. You also are able to set timers for harddrive,sleep,etc when laptop is being powered or on battery.Then goto video settings like it seems you have set up, and just drag the movie to the HDTV and then have your laptop open or closed. This is a great way to continue using the laptop, and being able to swap the aplications from the laptop to the HDTV or vice versa. Doug is correct.

Open My Computer<br>    Right-click on C:<br>    Click Properties<br>    Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.<br>  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)<br>  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore<br>  <br>  All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.<br>  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.<br>  <br>  Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed.

AVDTZ63Oaa	Yup. Installing Windoz 7 at this untested point is an error.<br>  <br>  You probably pooched your Bootloader. You can use your XP install disk to get to a recovery console and them type<br>  "fixboot"<br>  or maybe "fixmbr" if things are really bad.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario: Install Ubuntu, and use it's built in GRUB boot loader. It will very likely find your windows partition and make it readable again.

AA12145729	Well, you're actually dealing with two problems here.    First, let's deal with your auto open problem.  I'm assuming you're using Safari, but other browsers may have similar options.    In the menu bar of Safari,  go to Safari > Preferences  click on the General tab  uncheck the box next to "Open 'safe' files after downloading"  you can change where your files are saved to next to "Save downloaded files to..." if you want    This will prevent your files from automatially opening after you download them.  You can go back and re-check the box if you want, because we're going to fix the other problem next (hopefully).  Apply the following concept to any file type    Click on your newly downloaded file. Go to File > Get Info (Cmd + I).  It will open a pallette window.  Find where it says "Open with:", where i'm guessing it says Text Edit in the box.  Click on the pull-down and change it to one of the choices, or click other to find a good choice.  The two I have for the Limewire download is DiskImageMounter and Disk Utility.  I have set DiskImageMounter to open all my .dmg files.  Once you have that set, the Change All button just below should become active.  Click that button and it will change all files of that type to open with the selected application, and you're done!    A temporary solution to open a file properly is to control-click (right-click) on the files and select "Open with..." from the contextual menu, or simply drag the file and drop it onto the icon in the Dock.    Hope that works for ya!|`|596796c808915cb160d4c23af8e68f6baa	when you click on  "file"  then to "save as" a window comes out from the top of the screen and thats were you set  were everything goes.!!!   Click on what folder to save it in.  I usually save to documents until i need them. hope that works for you. I'm running OS X Jaguar.

It's a built-in feature in PowerPoint, I believe under the FIle menu.    Pack and go also ensures you have all your Fonts, Embedded and Linked objects so you will have the complete file.    Include the free powerpoint viewer from Microsoft and you can then play the PP on any PC.    If you want a video, I would then get a pachage such as Camtasia. You could then show the screen, and your mouse movements, videos and pictures. You can alos record your voice. When you are all done, it's as if you are giving the presentation all with you there. You can even include a sub-window with your face talking if you like.  VERY useful tool for this.|`|WL4SrHW4aa	You have to convert the powerpoint presentation to video file first.    Try this website: http://www.newfreedownloads.com/find/ppt...|`|rv5E6BIQaa	well on my dvd player it doesnt...but hey there are so many more newer makes and models that it might! try it!|`|ea392d5d9822c349745646a8c25d1a4daa	some player support jpg files,but i dont think any player will support powerpoint presentation|`|CjtfNi5aaa	It depends on the model, but MOST models now accept the powerpoint format, and it's been that way for a few years now. Your best bet would probably be to try it out first, or if you know that the DVD player you'll be using is fairly new you should be fine. A good sign is if you see the "DivX" logo on it. DivX has nothing to do with powerpoint, but if it's new enough to be compatible with it, then chances are it'll also display a powerpoint presentation without a problem.    Good luck

It depends on how much information is traveling throughout the line.  A single strand of fiber in a fiber-optic cable can be as thin as a strand of hair,(but not likely because of bandwidth restraints) but most fiber-optic cables are groups of many strands of fiber (glass).  A fiber-optic cable can be as thick a CD (when looking at it as a circle) or thicker depending on the information needs of the company.
