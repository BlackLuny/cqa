Do not be too quick to judge someone as a friend and give them no hope of a future with you, remember that person might just suprise you. Sometimes the greatest love of all, is the love that we'd least expect.     I for one never thought in a million years that I'd date the girl I'm with because she was a friend and nothing more, now we have our problems and for some reason she is mad at me right now... but it's great and we're gonna make it.     Patience, understanding, and wisdom are the keys to happiness in life, and taking a risk is the key to love.|`|AA10042617	I am sorry to say that we all have the ability to be Jerks from time to time.  Like I am sure that if you looked at yourself you could say that your halo might be a bit tarnished.    If your really interested in changing the guys that you date, then look at what attracts you to the men that you do date.  Chances are, the thing that gets you going is the same thing that makes you call them a jerk.  You like a guy that can flirt, but hate it when it does that with someone else.  Chances are he did not learn on you.    Your best bet is to go after the guys that are quiet and aren't chasing the latest bit if tail.  The ones that are studding at the library or at the coffee shop by them self's.  Check out Barns and nobles and start talking to a guy that is not with someone,  you never know.
6ro28YqSaa	Maybe you shouldn't call him for a while.  See if he calls you.  If he does, then talk to him about your situation and ask him what he wants.  Let him know that you don't deserve what he's doing, and you're not going to deal with it.  You said you were in 1 relationship that you were happy in, don't you want that happiness again?  Obviously he's not making you feel that.  Why waste your time, or his?  It's not that you're doing anything wrong, it's just that it takes time to find the right guy, and it may suck, but you have to go through all of the wrong ones, to find the right one.  In the meantime, try to just have fun, and don't really look for something so serious.  Love happens when you least expect it.|`|AQaNqugOaa	don't call him for a while and see if he calls you or even notices.then if he does talk to him and tell him exacly what's on your mind.good luck|`|z2J3uZivaa	You are doing nothing wrong. He is just immature. He probably enjouys the sex but cannot connect on an emotional level. Get out while you can. Don't call him for a while and see if he makes contact to you. Odds are he will wait a couple weeks then call you once...maybe.

TtZhVhldaa	A lot of religious people talk bad about anybody that thinks, acts, or looks different then themselves. You're right they seem to pick and choose what to believe and when to believe it and miss the main themes of love and forgiveness.|`|pIVzPIcyaa	Some religions do not allow that either. (They are all insane)    Roman Catholics are not supposed to use birth control of any type.    The Bible states that it is a sin to "Spill Thy Seed"|`|vTkAre7zaa	birth control is also prohibited dude.....|`|PeUwTTDaaa	never follow religious doctrine, it screws with your head... it closes the mind to all the possibilities... ;)    and let's face it, those in religious circles have NO rights to dictate others actions... look at the catholic church and the abuse of CHILDREN!!!    so, according to them, it isn't right for people of the same gender to have sex, but it is okay for the clergy to abuse small boys??? then threaten them.. and the church will cover it all up... hmmmmmm!!!    how many religious figures have been caught with their "hand in the cookie jar"??? especially when it is someone elses "cookie jar"... or those who have sworn celibacy to be sleeping with their parishoners???    HYPOCRACY!!!    homosexuals are just as entitled to have a fulfilling sex life as much as heterosexuals... only the bigoted and close minded would stop that...|`|35fdfcc942da772e22a482dd20b5e9b9aa	Religion is a method of imposing control over the masses with the threat of eternal damnation.  It has also been traditionally used to subjugate women to do the bidding of the men.  There are many religions where this abhorrent practice is still very much alive.  It is nauseating how religious people try to shove their misbegotten beliefs down everyone else's throats.  Not only that, but how many priests have been caught molesting boys?  That is not only homosexual behavior (which, just because a 3000-year-old book says is wrong doesn't mean anything), it is socially deviant behavior, and it leads to the destruction of a young life.  Religion is so rife with hypocrisy that it seems ludicrous to me that anyone would blindly follow the tenets of any religion.      If you believe that abortion is the road to hell, then don't get one.  Don't push your belief on those who do not share them.    You cannot legislate morality.  Whatever happened to "judge ye not lest ye be judged"?    If you don't believe in premarital sex, fine.  Practice what you preach, and don't shove it down everyone else's throat.    Holier than thou is the sign of a mind rife with pride, one of the sins considered deadliest.  Yet how many outspoken religious people have that attitude?    If you think homosexuality is wrong, then DON'T PRACTICE IT!  Creating a constitutional amendment to "protect the sanctity of marriage" is sheer stupidity.  Marriage is not sacred.  If it were, the divorce rate would not be as high as it is, with people breaking the "till death do us part" covenant as though it was nothing more than mere tissue paper.  That whole "till death do us part" business was nothing more than a life sentence forcing women to remain faithful to their men via the fear of God no matter what kind of vicious bastard he turned out to be.  The husband, not God.  :)    Your point is well taken in your question.  It is an excellent example of the ridiculousness of religion with respect to reproduction.  Humans are animals, and religion is an attempt to hide that fact with ritual.  Humans will still yield to their baser instincts, and then simply pay lip service later on to their "beliefs".  It's like how Right-To-Life proponents are usually advocates of the death penalty and against social programs.  They will fight for your right to be born, but God help you after that.  I feel that if Roe v. Wade is ever overturned, it should be required by law that Right-To-Lifers should adopt the unwanted children who were born because abortion was not an option.  They wanted the kid to be born, so they should take care of them.     |`|kPNnfjNSaa	I understand what you're saying. Most everyone was born with reproductive capabilities, but sex isn't just for procreation.   By their standards, wouldn't that mean that sterile people having sex is unnatural? Would it mean that foreplay, costumes, dirty talk, role-playing, and various positions are unnatural?    Face it religious peeps; Sex is just about sex now. Sometimes about procreation, sometimes about love, but mainly just about the pleasure of sex. Get over it.|`|WeBllB8Naa	In marriage sex is fine, between a man and a woman. Birth control that prevents conception is fine too. Sex between a man and a man, and sex outside of marriage is technically a sin. "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life".     Everybody gets to decide what they want to do. Go to heaven or go to hell. What fun!!!|`|kEeUsdnYaa	Sex is the process of creation. Im not saying we attain god-like status during sex lol (maybe I do haha XD sorry couldnt help myself). God doesnt condemn queers. He condemns the act of homosexuality.    Somewhere in the bible it says that what goes on in the bedroom is sanctified as long as its a marriage between a man and woman!|`|gIaQ7Y4oaa	Religion has too many flaws.|`|5cdcfcc3f5c2abfa924130226fa7cc2daa	yes and in islam too birth control is forbidden !|`|f30a644f2db709d91dc82cc4ef48c9fcaa	Birth control is a temporary measure .  Sex between same sex couples can never produce children.  And not all people who say queer sex is unnatural are religious, or Christian, or use birth control.  Would you say that if 6% of the population defecated through their mouth, they were natural?

Per esempio non credo che le discoteche o i locali siano posti giusti. Oppure non mostrare subito interesse per una ragazza. Con questo intendo di non buttarsi subito addosso come se fossero l'ultima nel mondo intero. Prima parla con lei senza soffocarla e poi se avete parecchi interessi in comune, invitala a prendere qualcosa da bere o un gelato. Comunque qualcosa di non impegnativo.

Y8kAVOwoaa	The first time you have sex is different for everyone, but usually there is some discomfort. You may find it stings and will be a little sore afterwards, but a nice warm bath helps. You dont always bleed, so dont panic if there is no blood, because you can break your hymen very easily, during sports, using a tampon during your periods or any heavy work. If you do bleed, its never a vast amount, usually a little speckling.  You will find the more sexual intercourse you have it will become less painful/uncomfortable and more enjoyable with time and experiance. Your first time is really important and it can be a little daunting, just relax, take your time and take it one stage at a time.     Remember though! Never be afraid to say no, and make sure your over 16, sure its what you want to do and use protection! Be safe|`|sxG1sXivaa	It hurts a lot.  But then it gets bigger and then it won't hurt.  Also so much pleasure beyond your wildest dreams.|`|uE38Phx4aa	well for me i don't think i even bled but that may've been because I've already used tampons for a while and that has broken that thin layer spoken above.  It was exciting and felt ok but he had to stop and leave it because it was too big to go in too far at once.  I just lost my virginity so I guess I'm a good one to answer.  It hurt after a certain point but next time we do I think we'll be able to go in all the way and enjoy it more.  Of course wearing a condom even though I'm on the pill :)|`|AA11827424	You are no longer considered a virgin. That's about it.|`|RLWHEgqraa	For me there was a sharp pain at first and then it stung and I bleed a little. It was bearable though and the 2nd time it felt much better, and now it feels wonderful!|`|zeGVUDs7aa	if you mean sex, then the first time can often be painful. remember when you have sex for the first time you break your hymen (thin layer of skin) and that causes some pain or discomfort. you may also bleed a little but that doesn't last long|`|hHTB5dsTaa	for me, i didnt get too much pain, i felt a small sharp pain, and bled afterwards, the 2nd time didnt hurt at all, everyones different, it helps if the girl is totally relaxed and is properly ready for intercourse to determine how much it may hurt, some of my friends said their first time it didnt hurt them

0FUSQ8JGaa	Allora in questo caso ci vuole un film che la faccia tornare a 9 anni... a che serve crescere? :(  In questa fase lei  pi attratta dalla trasgressione che dalle regole, ma in cuor suo  ovvio che lei preferisce ancora le cose da bambina, ma ha vergogna...   Io proporrei di andar da lei con 2 film: uno che sia per bambini, divertente, tipo COME D'INCANTO della Disney, e un altro invece da adulti, tipo IL GRANDE KAHUNA (il mio film preferito, con Danny De vito, Kavein Spacey..  un genere teatrale tutto dialoghi ambientato in una stanza)...  Magari lei preferir il film per grandi, guardatelo insieme ripetendole che ti stai stufando, appena anche lei dice SI IN EFFETTI E' SCOCCIANTE, metti subito su l'altro film per bambini ^^'  Magari si rende conto che ha ancora 9 anni e deve rispettare la sua et >.

And stick to it.  If she persists in contacting you, or begins to escalate, call the police.      Stalking Behavior:  An aspect of stalking behaviors that needs to be explained is that such behaviors can be produced by individuals with very different backgrounds, motivations, and psychological disorders.  In other words, a stalker who harbors delusions that the victim is in love with him performs behaviors that are often similar to an ex-partner who seeks revenge for being rejected.    1.  The first thing one should do is to tell the unrequited person that no further contact of any kind is allowed.           a. As early as possible, tell him/her that the relationship is over.          b. Be as firm/assertive and direct as possible.          c. Avoid using tones or phrases that could be misconstrued as implying a second chance or playing hard to get.   Oftentimes, when the victim tries to "be nice" and to "spare the feelings" of the person being rejected, the unrequited lover sometimes perceives mixed messages.          d. Be respectful    2. Discipline yourself to avoid contact with the stalker: This includes ANY and ALL contact (calling to ask for someone else's phone number, counter-harassing, sending letters back) which could easily be misinterpreted by the stalker.    3. Documentation is one of the most important aspects of stalking threat management.  For a copy of a documentation form, click on the following hyperlink to view the Logbook.    Are you being stalked?  There are several signs that are good indicators of stalking behavior.  It is also important to consider the intensity of such behaviors.       1.   Persistent phone calls despite being told not to contact in any form.       2.  Waiting at workplace or in neighborhood.       3.  Threats.       4.  Manipulative behavior (for example: threatening to commit suicide in order to get a response to such an "emergency" in the form of contact).       5.  Sending written messages: letters, emails, graffiti...       6.  Sending gifts from the seemingly "romantic" (flowers and/or candy) to the  bizarre (dog teeth, a bed pan, a blood soaked feather) (Dietz et al. 1991b).       7.  Defamation:  The stalker often lies to others about the victim (claims of infidelity, for example).       8.  "Objectification":  The stalker derogates the victim, reducing him/her to an object -- this allows the stalker the ability to feel angry with the victim without experiencing empathy    more information here:  http://www.stalkingbehavior.com/whatnot....|`|5ySW0lT0aa	Report her to the police.|`|1qb8WYkYaa	call the police|`|uUHIBX3laa	go with the flow if there wasnt anything will effect or do anythin in ur life.. its all experience jus be smart all the time..|`|AA11827424	Notify the police and get a restraining order, if necessary.|`|ktbamF53aa	suck her boob|`|L4gKvdIHaa	ring the police

Yep, eBay.  Why?  Because the gowns are not only beautiful, but also cost a lot less.  These gowns are made in China...the same place top US designers are having their gowns made.  Avoid David's Bridal like the plague...seriously.     A great book I found was "Bridal Bargains"...loaded with lots of great information and research.  You can borrow it from your local library, if you choose not to buy it (I did).  They have an on-line site, too: http://www.bridalbargainsbook.com.

Would you want to come in the way of those obligations she has? Respect her wishes and let her do her thing and as far as the way you feel goes, you'll feel much better after some time goes by. Whenever there's a break up, people usually always think about that person and wonder all kinds of questions like what they did wrong or what they could do to get the person back.

Thus spake Aristotle in his late 30s and it never became obsolete since.    There still are more independent, unmarried and wealthy men than there are women and thus the competition for employment as personal female cookers, cleaners and breeders is less fierce than that for male ones. Males thus of course prefer becoming professionals and thus eventually generate more pfcc&b employment.    And as good and moral we regard, as Nietzsche asserted, the most profitable choice.

fkpAunlMaa	No one can answer this question for two reasons.    1 Its a little short in detail    2 Only you know him. He could be under extreme pressure and been left withdrawn and depressed. He could be a con man or anything really. Only you can find the answer.    Good luck|`|AA11706291	well you need to both see a solicitor and see if there are any errors in the contracts that could get the loans written off. See if there is a government initiative to get any of the debt written off, see about a controlled loan maybe.    Either way you both need to sit down and sort out exactly how much is owed and what can be done about it.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Sounds like you are going through some tough times:(    You need financial counselling, and you need marriage counselling. You can find both either free, or inexpensive.  Ask around.    It sounds like your husband could have a gambling problem or something along that line.  You do need to find out what is going on there.    Call the people you owe money to. Explain to them you are in financial crisis, and work out agreements with them how to pay them back. Do NOT wait until they are demanding money from you. Call them now.    I got into issues with my mortgage a few months back. The moment I knew there was going to be a problem, I rang them up. I explained the situation, we agreed I would miss one payment, pay just interest on another, then go back to paying the full amount plus an extra 50 a month to catch up on the past due.    I also had trouble with the electric bill once. I rang them, and they allowed me to make small payments on the outstanding balance every month for six months. I had to pay the new bills, but the past due I paid off over time.    Your creditors have heard it all, they won't be hearing anything new from you. They do want their money, but most realize that pushing you to give them money you don't have isn't worthwhile.  Most are happy to work out alternate payment arrangements.|`|Zca1PGERaa	You need to sit down at the table and think about how much is owed and if its possible to pay it back. It sounds like he isnt really managing to accept that there is a possible fiancial problem looming in the near future. The bury your head and it will all go away syndrome. I suggest you both go to the citizens advice bureau together or you go alone and try to get some arrangement in place with the creditors.    I dont think this has anything to do with how he feels about you you must remember that.|`|WvpG9Omyaa	Woa woa is me|`|tqJeFCYZaa	You need to get an investagaor & find out what else he has in other names.

SERIOUSE IT HAPPRNS TO THE BEST|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Sit and talk it out,i think you know each other well by all those years you have been together,so talk it out and solve this.|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Accept my heartfelt sympathy.  Your family life seem to be revolving around money and bills. This is the source of your problem. The husband and the wife have different roles to play in a family and marriage relationship. When the roles are not properly played, marriage and family may not work well.  Stop playing the role that does not belong to you as a wife. Let your husband play his own role too.  The man should love his wife by providing for all her needs: shelter, food, clothing's, jewels, Cosmetics, sex, leadership etc.  The wife should submit to her husband and reverence him. She is the home manager; managing the resources provided by her husband. She is the home guide; guiding her household in the path of righteousness. It is your husband's responsibility to pay all bills and also provide money and resources for you to manage. So: stop paying bills that you don't owe; stop worrying over things that do not concern you. That way, you will not feel ill and betrayed and alone. Your husband will no longer be a stranger.|`|xYgFcEfwaa	husband suppose to secure the house and his wife.  cant believe ...  anyway, if you can save the house then go for the house, get rid of him , as this is too much of a mess.  he got into some bad habit which he wont tell....  best of luck

8401a3eb17a43a2379e1ef13a1d9b671aa	My bf (who i've been dating for almost 4 years now) and I had some issues with this about a year ago-my fault.     I was having major issues w/being insecure and totally clingy and didn't like him to do anything (outside of working) w/out me. It caused alot of tension and grief in our relationship.    I've been through counseling (both alone and with my bf) and have learned how greatly important "me time" is for us both.     I feel that ALL relationships (married or not) need this. they won't survive w/out it. every single person has their own hobbies, views,etc and using time alone to enjoy these things help relationships thrive.     I can't wait to marry my bf and personal time will be a normal part of our marriage. for example, my bf flies rc planes as a hobby and every wednesday (along with every other saturday) he goes out to the rc flying field by our house for a few hours on these days. this gives him a chance to unwind from his busy work week (it's very calm and relaxing at the field), do what he enjoys most (fly planes),and visit with his friends he doesn't get to see all the time.     I work on those wednesdays but he's usually gone when I get up. I use the time he's gone to watch tv, workout,and do my cross stitching which is very relaxing and unwinding for me.     we have alone time even when we are both in the house together. he'll often go out into the garage to build his rc planes or be on the laptop in our room for a while. I'll cross stitch in the living room, take a jog, or watch tv by myself. I'll also take a walk w/the kids or take them to the park to play for a while so he can take a nap or work on stuff in  the house.     things have completely turned around for us since i've learned that being alone sometimes is healthy not only for our relationship but individually as well. we are alot closer now!!    hope this helps!!|`|eVRDj7o3aa	When my wife finally allowed me to have my "me" time.    She was constantly "smothering" me and wanting to be with me 24-7.  So I let her.  I needed to find a part for a car I was working on, so instead of calling the junk yards, I decided to take her with me and make the rounds.  After 4 hours, and walking 6 yards, she had had enough.  She sat in the car at the next 2 yards, where I finally found the part.    Now I am allowed to have all the "me" time I want when it involves cars.    I try to balance it, though, with plenty of "we" time, too.|`|AA11496842	It's very important to me. Sometimes people get on my nerves. |`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is not harder to do in marriage. It is very important that you both have time to yourself. It does work wonders, doesn't it? We both have things that we like to do and we make sure we do them. |`|512xRg3Kaa	It has similar importance to air. Your relationship wont survive without it.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I think it is very important and crucial to a relationship.  I too would feel smothered if my hubby wanted to be with me 24/7... that's is NOT healthy.  I like to have time to myself to reflect, to read, to do whatever... by myself !!!  And I give him all the "alone time" he needs as well.|`|w1aIuIzmaa	You're married, but you're still 2 individuals and alone time is vital. You have a night out with the guys, while she has a night out with the girls. Drinks, see a show, a fun activity, anything that interests you is good, time apart doesn't have to be the whole day, a few hours works too. Hope that helped.|`|AA11827424	Extremely important. No couple is joined at the hip, neither should they. Of course it's harder in marriage, with all the common duties, but it's even more vital then. Each one naturally enjoys some things the other doesn't, and giving them up is simply not an option. Husband doesn't drag me to the golf course or 20/20 cricket, and I don't drag him to yoga class or shoe shopping. We're both happy.|`|pH7CmzOIaa	Your alone time is crucial to a relationship. To be together too much, as you realized, isn't healthy. It can be carried over into marriage very easily. You can get out with friends or just spend time at home doing different things. I have to have my alone time to reflect and grow as a person. Good Luck, it sounds like you are on the right track with this girl.    |`|JXsMr8UYaa	It don't matter how much you love someone or if you're married or not, you still need some me time as you call it, it is massively important.  everyone needs a break from each other.      It aint any harder when you're married, the wife goes shopping to get a break from me and the kids and I walk the dog.  It don't have to be a long break just a couple of hours.    Good luck to ya Mike.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	It all depends on the week we're both having.  I do alot of shift work at a hospital, so most of the times I am gone 4 days a week to do 12 hour shifts and we will barely get to see eachother then and we are desperate for eachothers attention and I miss him incredibly but after 2 days off together we start to want our "me time" again.    On weeks I don't work too much I really enjoy a few hours to myself while hubby is at work.  I like to play video games ^_^  and I usually need a couple hours to get stuff done in them.  Hubby and I play them together also, so it is kind of like "me time" even then because we're in our game world.  I've agreed to let him play his game solo once a week for about 5 hours straight and he says thats all he really needs.    I am 26 and husby is 30, I find the older we get the more we enjoy more time together.  Most of our friends are ours together so we hang out quite often.    I think alone time can be very important in a relationship that has one partner who is too clingy, but when you find someone thats a very good match suddenly me time is not so important anymore.|`|3HmNEO5Gaa	alone time is necessary in any relationship, and more so in a marriage.  it takes organization and efforts of support on both man and wife but you will need to recharge every now and then.  its wonderful you two were able to sit down and have a calm discussion and outcome that you both can be happy with.  great job.
AvhJoL5baa	This is a generalization, but I think there's truth in it for a lot of people: women need to feel close in order to have sex, but men need to have sex in order to feel close.  It is true for me.  I would say that having sex once per week would be the minimum amount in order for me not to start feeling miserable about the distance.  Twice per week is much better, and three per week makes me happy as a clam.   However, bear in mind this is just me - some men need more and some need less.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Sex helps to keep that intimate connection that couples need to have a healthy relationship, some need it more than others.  My wife and make a point to make that connection at least once a week, usually more, but you get the point. |`|4qevcGUNaa	Lets see...  3 times per day x 7 days = 21 minimum.  5 times per day x 7 days = 35 normal.|`|ImiMtrcqaa	My Dear Wife and I have sex when ever we feel like it.   With us the emotional connection has to be there first.    If we did not have to work, we would have sex at least twice a day.   BTW, there is no "barely enough." We both enjoy each other and sex is better because of the connection.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	varies with the person.  There is no one absolute average.  What is right for some is too much for others and not enough for someone else.|`|ndVFMJbuaa	I find there are too many men, or rather, boys, who put sex as priority in their relationship and it's no surprise that those marriages all usually fail.     Personally my wife and I have sex more than 2 or 3 times a week but if it was less I'd still feel the same towards her, I didn't marry her for sex. There is more to a relationship. And if she's not enjoying it then neither am I, it's a mutual thing, I think it's sad how it ruins so many relationships to be honest. A 5 second orgasm with some stranger is more important to some men than their own wife is? Sad.. I hate cheaters. |`|K8C14P7Caa	There is no quota...I find intimacy with my woman in many different ways...and sometimes for her it is not sexual at all...a drive in the car...a sunset...a walk in the woods. The key is happiness between both of you...and never feeling pressure to perform....whatever you do, do not forget she is your partner and her happiness is your happiness...keep it real|`|JXsMr8UYaa	cool question!  Don't know really.  I guess you kinda find a level that is good for both of you but their is a massive amount that gets in the way, work,kids etc.  Personally I have quite a high sex drive while my wife's is relatively low, we still get on great.  It just means that sometimes i'm a bit more frustrated. lol|`|uacuUJZ7aa	I like it every 3-4 days at least, but it's not so much that. For me, if I feel like I could have it almost any time that's enough. If I feel however, that something is forcing me to not have it when I want, that's when I feel like the connection is getting lost somewhere.    I have been through periods of really high stress with my partner where we didn't have that sort of contact for weeks, yet I didn't yearn for it, because I knew it was just a hard time and not something between us.    For most guys I would say once every 2-3 days at least is sufficient to satisfy anyone. Personally I don't mind more than that, but some guys will get irritated if you want it too much.  It's hard to say precisely, better to just sit down and talk about it.|`|sZjCrIZqaa	I know this wil sound strange but its not always about the amount of sex. Sometimes its more about the quality. Personally I would like it everyday. Women are different. That being said, any man should be happy with 2-3 times a week. The amount of sex in a week shouldn't affect your emotions toward your partner. If you truly care for them, just being around them should make you happy. Sex is just an added perk.|`|AA11092541	sex? my relationships are built on communication... not sex.|`|8MEfSwGmaa	it varies widely.   I would say normal goes from twice a day to twice a month for men under the age of 40.    Less than that may indicate poor health or lack of interest in his partner.  More than that could be considered a problem because it would interfere with daily life.    I read somewhere that the average for healthy couples is 2 to 3 times a week.    I find that physical intimacy with my mate to be extremely important to my relationship and the more i am with her the more close i feel to her.

Altri pensano che il bacio sia una sorta di parodia di quello che le mamme primitive facevano quando non c'erano gli alimenti per l'infanzia di adesso: svezzavano i figli con cibo masticato, passandolo a piccoli bocconi via bocca, (come gli uccelli con i loro piccini).secondo molti studiosi, il bacio deriverebbe proprio da questo atto materno di nutrimento della prole. Freud diceva "il bacio , per animali ed esseri umani, portatore di cibo: se non baciamo chi amiamo, a livello simbolico gli togliamo un nutrimento fondamentale, il nutrimento dell'anima". quindi per farti l'importanza dei baci!!  |`|9QYlHMrMaa	beh di certo non puoi baciare in un occhio...|`|dTu32veTaa	beh, non solo, io ricevo baci anche altrove :D|`|2kHf4SLRaa	Perch secondo me  l'unico punto in cui il bacio pu essere reciproco...se bacia uno,lo fa anche l altro contemporaneamente...Mentre se baci...boh,per dire...una mano...L'altra persona non pu fare lo stesso gesto.

KWeU8LJtaa	Honestly, like others have said, it depends on your girlfriend.    Personally, I'd want the diamond. That way she'd get to choose what kind of style she wants, making the ring exactly as shes always pictured it..Remember, this is something she's going to wear for the rest of her life..asking her opinion about what it should look like would be nice.     However, if you want to completely surprise her, maybe ask her mom or someone close to her what type of rings they think she would like..or if she's ever mentioned the idea of wearing your family's ring, you know?     :)  I think it's sweet that you're offering her your name..but to me, an engagement ring is the promise of a strong love..a NEW chapter in your lives where you put each other before anything.     New start, new ring    Just my opinion :) good luck!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I understand your feelings about the signet ring and whilst it may be a compliment for her its usual to give a ring thats got some diamonds in it for an engagement.  Cant you wear the signet ring as a symbol of your engagement ?  Trust me you need to be thinking about some gem stone or a diamond.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	i'm not a diamond kinda gal so i would love the signet ring.  the history and family tradition behind it would mean a great deal to me!  but as i said i'm not a great fan of diamonds - to me they are cold and sterile looking.    i'd marry ya!  lol  good luck sweetie and come back and let us know how it goes.|`|bBRsQaRWaa	Depends on the girl... I would rather have the diamond.  Remember the girl wears this ring the rest of her life it needs to be danty and something she can wear with everything!|`|QJslTCUBaa	Get her a diamond ring.|`|AA11603291	Signet rings are a little... i don't know...much? I would get her a vintage style diamond ring with your family name engraved on the inside though. That would be really romantic and it would have the family name too.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Diamonds. My fiance is all about his name and coat of arms as well but honestly, I'm not that into his family history. It's a nice gesture but the coat of arms belongs on a tapestry wall hanging, front doorknocker or family tree. If she has a reason to be into the signet ring, then that's a different story.    Good luck either way!|`|jAc4X5eVaa	You know her best. What falls more with her line of thinking and her tastes. The family signet sounds very romantic in the idea that you are offering her yourself. However, think of how it would look. Even if she says she doesn't want anything fancy, a small diamond even is good for "oohs and aahs". I would vote for the diamond as the engagement ring. |`|xKZzScJ8aa	You could always give her a diamond for the engagement and the signet ring for the wedding ring. Since she won't bare your name until the actual wedding.|`|84d2ee0139a6557092dfc2736e3eadb8aa	Diamonds all the way. I know that sounds like a typical "girl" answer, but I also love what diamonds represent. They're the chosen rock for engagements and weddings because diamonds are the strongest of all the precious gems, signifiying the strength of thye relationship.    Signet rings, to me, are just not attractive. But what do you think your girlfriend wants? That's the true question here.|`|kOIHSXLgaa	Of course most women will say a diamond ring. I would say to base your decision on your fiance. What kind of person is she, what are her likes and dislikes. Is fancy Jewelry her thing.. She may love the ring that bears your family name because it has sentimental value to you. Maybe speak with people close to her. |`|fRYQfvNaaa	yes it depends on the girl but theres a much better chance she would prefer diamonds|`|AA11827424	Women don't wear signet rings, ever. Period.|`|TwrMTctKaa	I agree with the last post.  I would go a vintage style diamond ring and have my family name engraved inside.  Then write her a poem that asks her to accept your name.  Save the coat of arms for the living room.    Here is a great site for vintage rings:    http://www.diamond-jewelry-masters.com/j...  |`|3wInjkTraa	I'd go for the diamond. What if she doesn't like the ring that bears your family name and coat of arms?  Every girl loves a diamond..|`|809686f3e6f6a5c6bb5efd8ec223ceeeaa	Go for the diamond. All girls like diamonds. You could always use the ring that has your family name and coat of arms as part of you wedding set.What ever you choose im sure she will love. |`|ucVJHDoBaa	For me it would be a signet ring for a wedding proposal because that's romantic to me. I like the hand in hand kind of thing, YESSSSSSSSS! |`|rSG2B4LPaa	  you know her best- and should know what she would truly want.     maybe try to think of some way of combining the two in a new and different way.     good luck. |`|fNAU0OL6aa	even though I love history I would go with diamonds all the way
fc4NOCp3aa	Well you could apply that logic to just about anything worthwhile in life.  Why go through the time and effort of college when most the time people don't even use their degrees?  Why have children if you go through so much turmoil to raise them?      Look, everything in life that brings unimaginable happiness has the potential to also bring you pain.  That's just the way it is.  There is nothing in life that's guaranteed to bring 100% happiness 100% of the time.  The key is finding someone who takes marriage as seriously as you do and someone who perceives marriage in the same ways.  Too often these people who cheat in marriages should've never gotten married to begin with.  They married for the wrong reasons or were young or whatever the reason may be.  So, it's important to make wise decisions BEFORE you marry that person.  Alot of people marry someone even though they see a million red flags beforehand.  Why people think someone will magically change when you say "I do" is beyond me.      Marriage can be a wonderful thing that brings you a lifetime of happiness and blessings.  OR it CAN be miserable.  It's all about knowing yourself, knowing what you want, and finding that person who sees love and marriage the same way as you do.  Then the best you can do is commit to working hard every day.  Alot of people think marriage is just easy.  It takes WORK to not let the everyday things take all the romance out of your marriage.  You have to actively do things for one another so you both feel loved.  People who say "i do" then go into coast mode don't make it.|`|AA11827424	Then why get into a relationship at all? Cheating is cheating even before marriage. Relationships are work, and being with someone because you don't want to be by yourself is the wrong reason. Concentrate on your one partner and never mind what 'most people' do. You don't sound ready for commitment at all.|`|hH6kGUvBaa	Not all folks cheat. Take your time and don't fall in bed right away. Get to know a person. My husband and I are not totally perfect, but we know each other's passwords and we giggle at each other's funny e mails together.  We only take separate vacations when we visit our adult kids from our prior marriages. Sometimes we meet up. Cheer up! There are many happy marriages out there. Before you marry get pre marital counseling whether through your church or with an elder counselor that specializes in marriage counseling. Don't let other people's drama get to you! Some marriages break up over jealousy of careers and other things besides cheating. Don't create imaginary problems that are not there. You sound like a young person hurt by a divorce in your family. Concentrate on your education because if a marriage were to fail, you can support yourself. My husband and I are on our second marriage and we are from the same religion and we are soulmates. We lived 3000 miles apart when we divorced our spouses and never knew each other then. his former wife is a nice lady and they simply drifted apart. When you meet someone take your time and examine their lifestyle. Many relationships with young people that start too quick ends up in pregnancy and the wife never gets a chance to develop herself as an independent woman and ends up being co-dependent.  Take your time because you can't look for a relationship because it happens without you realizing it.|`|aZIkOkSwaa	It just depends on the person. I've seen a lot of people cheat but I have friends that I have known my whole life that have never cheated... men and women. It depends on what they believe is right and wrong.  My personality wont let me be a player. I just cant think that way and Im glad I found a husband that has never cheated on anyone either and hope it stays that way ;D|`|jdRKZe18aa	First of all "MOST" people don't cheat - and second of all - you can't pick and chose who you love.  Love is always a risk and haven't you read before "it is better to  have loved and lost than to have never have loved at all?"  Well I for one believe that because when it is RIGHT and good and devoted and committed it is one of the greatest things we can experience in this life.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Is marriage just about biology? Marriage is a social construct; it's not just about mating or producing children or receiving sexual pleasure - most of these things are done all over the place by all kinds of creatures who don't need marriage for any of that. Marriage is a social construct, and it only makes sense if you view it as such. The society bestows you with certain rights and responsibilities depending on your status, so all societies have certain rituals to mark certain events in people's lives - birth, puberty, marriage, death etc. You are right - there's nothing magic about marriage that would prevent you from enjoying sex with someone other than your spouse. Also, you don't have to get married to stay in a monogamous relationship and never have sex with anyone else. Marriage is about way more than not having sex with another person ever again. Yes, you always run the risk of having your feelings hurt when you enter a relationship; it doesn't have to be marriage - it could be any relationship. The only sure-fire way to safeguard from that is to limit your exposure to relationships and remain alone and unattached for the rest of your life. It's entirely up to you if you choose to do so. In my view, some risks are worth every bit of it, tho. I would rather risk being hurt over and over again than resign to being alone for the rest of my days. So yeah, I take the risks. In my mind, it's worth it.|`|16vMIGPiaa	Human beings are monogamous by choice, not biology.  Yes, statistically about half of all married people get involved with someone other than their spouse.    But marriage is not about sex.  Asserting it is completely misses the point.  The point of being in a committed relationship is to grow up.  Nothing does it better.  It demands much of us that simply doesn't happen if we're single or dating with no intention to commit.  Recovering and redirecting after an infidelity can actually be a powerful growing experience for a couple.  I know of several whose relationships had deteriorated so badly that an affair was pretty much an expected result.  In most cases, the ones who were really serious about being in a partnership hammered out a NEW relationship with their spouse that turned out to be rock solid.  And - I've know people who slogged through years of monogamous marriage, deeply resenting their spouse because "I've been faithful and everything, and you haven't been a good partner."  (whatever that means).|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	theres always a chance u will end up with someone who doesn't cheat.relationships are a risk, but in order to find true love u have to trust someone. just get to know them well before u marry, find out how they treated others in their past, because the past is a good predictor of what a person will do in the future.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	I don't agree, I think that both parties have to work at it.  I was loyal to my wife for 12 years, tomorrow is our anniversary.  She passed away in the summer and I get pissed off at guys and gals who do not know that marriage is a commitment.|`|90877616d47129b0c2c87f6d63b53f65aa	now a days people don't have patience anymore for love and they give up to easily... loves not worth fighting for anymore because temporary love is found everywhere and anywhere..   people never know what a good thing they have until they lose it and need it then they want to work it out... in the end those with the weak and greedy hearts|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	most adults don't cheat!   find a new crowd to hang with or someething!   |`|EzZk2pyNaa	Most people don't cheat.

Why risk any good thing? Because the good usually outweighs the bad. |`|VSVQHKwKaa	The truth is, there was a time when 95% of the population would never cheat.    These days, we've made marriage a circus and the idea of fidelity a personal choice instead of a God-given commandment.    So people aren't afraid anymore. If you get cheated on, you just go get a divorce and have a messy year in court. All the stigma has been taken out of it.    Expect things to get worse before they get better. |`|Pu2tk1Leaa	when  people get married that go in with explicit trust that the other won't cheat. Unfortunately cheating does happen more frequently these days but I suppose its a romantic idea. When you see an old couple walking down the streets holding hands and they've been married for a longgg time. I know I want that. Men cheat probably because they feel like they have been stuck with one person for far too long and maybe its time to move on.. than when they cheat and the wife gives them the boot they realise that their wife is the only person who understands them and knows what they want so they try to crawl back.|`|fguZQZcaaa	It's something to do when you get you get bored with being single.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Honestly Karla,   You could also ask why we live if we're just going to die, or why we try to be good, since we know we're going to make mistakes and hurt others.    That's the key, isn't it? Yes, people make mistakes.  And yes, monogamy maybe too much to ask for most people.  I think the expectation of perfection is probably just asking to get shot down.      Now, having said that, and freely admitting that I've done stupid things, as has my wife, we are still very happy together, 20 years married, and 17 years after making those stupid mistakes (we both cheated once).  What disturbs me more that the fact that most people cheat at one time or another, is that so many people are willing to walk away from their marriages for a single act of stupidity.  |`|KMnQbzqFaa	AMEN KARLA BUT I DON'T THINK EVERYONE CHEATS.|`|RPT80gpWaa	First off, not everyone cheats.  Secondly, if you think that you have a shot at lifelong happiness with another person that seems to have the same level of commitment to you as you have to them, then it's worth a shot, IMO.  Some people don't need marriage.   Good for them.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	"Most" people don't cheat.. "some" do.    That's just like saying why should I eat steak, some people choke on steak!|`|KI8WMaVoaa	Personal maturity is not based on age, gender, or marriage vows.  Once a cheater...always a cheater.

I've been married twice.  The first time is what I thought was love (I was only 19 and naive).  The second time was when I was in my 30's and I knew what I wanted in life and in love.

I have too many examples contradictory to yours to even start listing here.

I know my husband get the break of the century when he married me. I work full time at my own job, part time fro his company, and take care of everything in our home. He works very hard, too.

MEN HELP COOK AND CLEAN??????????????????????????????   I want to live on the planet your living. I want to go NOW!!!!!!!!  WOW MAN>>> you are so off base. GEEZ?????? STAY SINGLE!!!! Your mind is WAY TOO WARPED to EVER get married????  p.s.  By the way?? Hows the weather on your planet??? is it anything like it is here on EARTH???????|`|TEX1iYQgaa	Stop whining and grow a pair.    This is what happens when you refuse to step up and be a man ~ you get all emo and then you try to redefine all men's roles so that you can find a way to still feel good about yourself. It seems to me that you still need a mommy so that you can hide behind her skirt.    In my household, if someone is going to sacrifice ~ it's going to be me. If someone has to bear a burden ~ it's going to be me. I'll gladly work longer hours in a job I'm weary of, get less sleep, eat smaller portions so that everyone else can get their fill, park in the driveway so that my wife can park in the garage, and a million other things so that i can give my family the best life possible.    That's what men do, and we feel good about doing it. So stop your snivveling, trade in your tight little girly pants for a pair of men's jeans, let your two-tone dye job grow out, take out your earrings, then roll up your sleeves and get busy with becoming a real man.  |`|JCLZjuzraa	Thanx for venting, what was the question?|`|WiycCxpzaa	Hahahahahahahahahaha    I am not sure what marriages you have witnessed or been in.. but that is faaaar from the truth.    My husband does not do housework, he does yard work. So while he has to do it once every other week, I have to clean every day.    My husband wants to go back to school and I am going to support him and work while he goes for his education and dream job. How selfish of me.    My husband is never expected to be less emotional... in fact as his wife I am his back bone, I take care of the emotional things and support him through everything.    My husband is the head of our house. Why do I say that? That's what our beliefs are. He is the head of the household and I am his backbone. And that works for us. He has final say in everything, even though we work as a team if he does not want something it does not happen. And he gives me the same respect.    Honey... you need to relearn what marriage is REALLY all about.    Add**  Lets see I work 40hrs a week... plus 7 hours for cooking dinner every night... two hours for cleaning the house twice a week... two hours for doing the laundry twice a week... so in total I work...51hrs    My husband works 40hrs a week and maybe an hour of yard work every other week... so we'll say 40.5hrs.    Wow yeah.. I see your math, my husband needs to be doing some overtime here or paying me for mine.|`|JXsMr8UYaa	Buddy, when you find the "one" you'll know the answer.  And 37 hours at their job??  Please, if I do 60 hours I'm having a quiet week lol.    Be good.|`|ndVFMJbuaa	STOP GENERALIZING.     Not ALL marriage are like you just described.     Its up to the couple themselves to decide who does what around the home, who goes out, etc... not your business |`|Z3vKuGQLaa	Marriage isn't for every man. Who said "you HAVE to get married." If you listen to those statistics ofcourse you wouldn't but at the end of the day love makes you do crazy things. And there is many examples that contradict what you are saying . For example every man I've ever been with I make more money then them which isn't a problem for me but sometimes is for them. Why do men feel like less of a man if the woman has more then him? It works both ways you know I think men like to make more money and like to support their wife. And in a crisis I highly doubt that I would expect my man to be strong and I sit and cry I've always been the rock of my family. Don't always listen to statistics you'll drive yourself crazy. The average size of an erect penis is 6.5 now that's depressing lol.|`|dN3Ik6fPaa	Awww look at how the nasty world has jaded you. What a sin. Go buy yourself some big boy under-roos and suck it up princess. Women don't always take more than they give. Don't be so stupid. Maybe all the whore-esque ones you choose have ... so make better choices in women. Don't blame the whole gender for your failings in being able to make adult decisions. For the record, I was the one who supported my partner when he went back to school. I sacrificed MY education to stay at home with our children and take care of the house and him while he went to college. He is now college educated and I just have my highschool diploma ... and it will be that way until all our kids are in school full time. I was the one who sacrificed. And the fact is, that's the norm, not the other way round. I won't even address your other points ... they are so laughable it's not worth the effort. You have a f*cked up perspective and I do hope you get some help to change that. |`|AA11827424	Do the world a favour and don't marry until you get it in your thick noggin that marriage is not about giving and taking, but about giving and RECEIVING.

Maybe you should suggest counseling. But if he already made his mind, I would let him go.   Love yourself and take care of yourself first, we can`t make someone love us if they don`t. It may be a midlife crisis, and he might be back tomorrow. But think about yourself now. Get together with friends, do therapy, and put yourself  first.|`|8MEfSwGmaa	he doesnt want you.   you cant force him to stay....  let it go....|`|klTgOEcpaa	i learned that u fight for the person u love . i have faith that everything will work out just pray|`|JpXVuU32aa	This happen to me to there is nothing you can do.

Don't be afraid to tell him the things you wish were different as well.    The grass isn't always greener on the other side.  And if you're both willing to work to close the gap for what you both are missing, this is what a successful marriage is all about.

c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Scusa se mi intrometto essendo io una donna....  a me piace pensare che anche i ragazzi a cui non interessa avere storie serie, pu capitare che si affezionino alla ragazza e si innamorino di lei.(forse in maniera un po' troppo romantica...)    E' difficile dare consigli in questi casi, perch sarebbe scontato dirti di provare a "non dargliela" e vedere se ti cerca lo stesso, ma so che se tu sei innamorata un po' di questo ragazzo, piuttosto che correre il rischio di non vederlo piu', continueresti ad essere il suo giocattolo.    Io proverei a fargli capire che mi interessa oltre l'aspetto sessuale(non so, mandandogli messaggini dolci...), provare, anche in modo scherzoso volendo, a capire se in qualche modo tiene a te (domandandogli se qualche volta ti pensa o cose di questo tipo...).  Vedendo queste cose, se ha un po' di cuore, chiarir la situazione con te, dicendoti se potrebbe esserci o meno qualcosa di serio tra di voi.    Naturalmente non ti devi "esporre troppo", perch se  uno str**** totale, potrebbe giocare su questa cosa (e se vedi che ci gioca, lascialo perdere...).    Comunque bella domanda!

Then kindly tell your parents you blew up bc your stressed about school, this is a big change in your life, and they are just coming at you with all these negatives like they aren't happy for you, or don't want to succeed (last parts optional but it makes you seem like your bareing your soul to them). Then act like your interested in whats up with them and what they like etc.. depends on your parents you gotta know how to work them. Then when they have all their paper work n tax stuff ask them to sign or whatever needs to be done. Just try being nice to them and grit through it until you go your stuff all done.

AA10065812	He needs to file a motion to modify his child support.  If he is current in his support, he can do this by making a request for a modification at the child support enforcement office.  If he is in arrears, contact the clerk of the court and request forms for filing for a modification, Pro Se.    He will need to get a copy of the child support guidelines and worksheet to determine if he has cause.  There needs to be at least a 20% difference in his payment.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.

UnMramoWaa	Im 26 and my man is 32.  We've been together for 5 years and moved in together about a week after we met.  At first we fought like crazy, almost every day, but I think 2 years in we settled down.  There were many times where I actually felt like I hated him, and then there were times like I could never see myself without him.  The trick is to pull your weight when it comes to household chores.  My man hates cleaning the house so he has his set of chores (trash, mowing the lawn and sometimes the laundry).  I do the rest.  As for emotional issues, at first I made the common mistake of trying to change him, and always dictating how he should think, or making him feel dumb for thinking differently to me.  I realised that I had the problem, because I had always got my way being the youngest and only girl in my family.  I had to work on giving my man physical and emotional freedom, and it was hard.

I personally don't like those cutesy little names, but that's just me. You have to ask her. If you stop calling her those names, she might wonder why and think something is up. Or if you keep calling her the names, and she can't stand it it will cause tension between you. So ask!|`|Fr29Bteaaa	most girls love it.

Lots of girls act like they hate it, but most of them secretly like it inside. It boosts up their self confidence and makes them feel nice.    Just don't call her "Princess" or whatever in front of her friends, (That might embarrass her), or in front of YOUR friends. (To me personally, that makes you sound like some player.)    Make sure you joke around with her when you're calling her something like that, and don't call her that when you're having a very romantic moment.    Pet names are usually left to jokes.

M7r7gHNGaa	You're fortunate that you can admit you are not ready to commit when you are so young. Getting married right out of high school is not practical because you really need to gain some life experience and date other guys in order to know what you want. Marriage is not just a matter of love as you know it in high school and sex. It also includes the maturity to love and support each other emotionally and financially. Both need to be willing and able to go through bad times together. Have children and raise them responsibly.    Go ahead and date this other guy and others before you even consider marriage. Don't become sexually active during this time. Just enjoy your youth and dating. This really doesn't have anything to do with a long distance relationship. All this would pertain to you and any guy attending your school|`|xQlCxeEWaa	find a new hobby.|`|spkpQ2C2aa	well what the other guy wont know wont hurt him go with your inner feelings we all made little mistakes like that we learn in do time|`|N53oHiwNaa	hunny they hardly ever last....but your did....take it farther|`|LcHg1UqJaa	your young you dont want to get tied down in a marriage u have your life to live meet new people|`|jrl6d9g7aa	Well first of all...there's nothing wrong with the fact that you want to date other ppl b4 u get married ur young! But i do think that if ur not ready to be in a SERIOUS relationship with this guy, y play with his feelings? If u truley love him then u won't play games with him!|`|RJynYf6aaa	well i dont think the distance is the problem. i think its the fact that you want to date other people. then youre not really in love. therefore you should not marry him. you cant marry someone unless youre ready to committ to that person for the rest of your life.|`|atCP6jrGaa	the question you have to answer now is, if you did go and marry him would you  regret not having dated other people first? If so, you need to be a little be selfish and break it off. At least temporarily. If he really loves you, and you really love him you will figure that out through dating other people. But if you go into a marriage with regrets and doubts that will always taint the relationship.
Boc1Buuwaa	Sometimes you gotta put yourself before others. I mean, you dont want the girl of your dreams with a prick do you? You never know, you might be with this girl forever and this could depend on your future and how happy you are in life. I say go for it man! Its obvious she likes you cuz her friends say your name a lot. That means the girl you want talks about you 24/7. Just go up to her and say hey.... you wanna go to the dance with me Friday? And its either yes or no. I got faith in ya buddy!
kWZsHztwaa	I'm a guy and I think your man is a tool for putting up with you. You want a guy to knock your teeth out, so you can be on cops, get spotted on TV, and start an Illustrious career as a porn star. If your only mean to him off your meds let this guy go so he can marry someone who gives a **** about him. If you find yourself being mean to everyone take drugs, and then let this guy go so he can marry someone who gives a **** about him.      P.S. This guy below me talking about god is also a tool in my book.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	first off you are living in sin... god loves you and your bf and wants what is best... get saved and follow god or your life will go from bad to much worse... he sounds like a great guy but if god is not your focus you are ... out of focus and depression and anxiety are results... i know from personal experience and am not pointing fingers...its worth anything and everything you may have to let go of|`|zdpp7cubaa	Maybe you just don't love him anymore? Also, did your doctor take you off your meds are did you decide to on your own? I think in some cases medication is needed.|`|iTtxlvZcaa	he will only take so much he will not always b there 2 put up w/u  if u cared 4 him & u love him u will seek other ways on dealin w/ur issues...u acknowledge tat u treat him like crap tat means u no wat ur doin is wrong.....depresion is serious at times but dont make it an excuse..focus on t/good in ur life including him a kind word or a hug can go a long way|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Sounds like you have one amazing boyfriend.  If I were you I'd get on some meds or do anything to change my attitude.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like that.  He sincerely unconditionally loves you and you don't find that too often.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	I believe its the way he treats you.  When a mate kisses your ***, you basically loose respect for them subconciously.. Its hard to want to love someone when you do not respect them.  He needs to start taking control of the situation and you more often.|`|qjcTW2vJaa	Maybe he is TOO sweet and nice - and you fell out of love? Sometime that happens but you don't realize it since he is "such a gem". Guys that do everything for the woman can lose their charm ...nothing mysterious etc. I've had it happen before. Good luck - maybe take a break from him for a month and see if you miss him (that might be hard since you live together but maybe you can go away at least for a week, see if you miss being with him?)
Nccikaemaa	There is no particular way to act, as long as you are being yourself then you will find someone who appreciates that and believes you are the best girlfriend he can find,    You cannot keep doubting yourself that you're not good enough.  It only makes you weaker, and less attractive.  Men like confindence, and then again modesty,     :)  Just let the right guy come along, and im sure you will be fine.|`|2z4aPm0vaa	Well that first answer is a load of crap. If you want to be a good girlfriend, get a boob job! Every guy will like that!|`|UNGM6Xk7aa	http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Good-Girlfri...|`|JDRj44xMaa	-Be yourself.   -Do what's in your heart.   -Take it slow.   -Enjoy the relationship.   -Be honest.   -Treat him the way you want to be treated, vice versa.    If that's not good enough, then too bad, right?! ;P

oBLfCideaa	ummmm...  YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    but don't be all up on his face being all preppy and fake..    be yourself.. and smile. but not like a creepy stalker way..    so yeah.. ..     ...  ..    bye..|`|xnVMXi6Gaa	Yes of course.|`|5RkMDOYDaa	If you think it is a good sign then yes, but if your crush is just talking to you as a friend then you guys might just become friends and no more then that. But it is a good sign if you guys are talking more.|`|IWiGNXPkaa	yes it does mean its a good sign. take it slow get to know one another|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, it is a good sign, because it shows that you effort has paid off somewhat. How he or she reacts to it is another matter altogether.|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	it's a good sign, i mean if someone likes you they're going to want to generally interact with you more|`|C4WZpghIaa	no it means your desperate hes probaly trying 2 avoid u caus your ugly.|`|L2RqeYedaa	Yup, its a good sign. Isn't that the whole point?   As long as you aren't stalking them, and freaking them out, its a good thing.
0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Let it ride. Let him do the calling.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Some guys just like to take it slow and spoil a good thing.  A good relationship takes time and patience. You can not starve him from a romance, but instead embrace it and kinder to him.    In time you will see that patience does have a virtue and all good things must come to pass.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Give him his space.  Let him call you.  Good Luck!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Singles & Dating.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	call him and talk with him about it|`|LknYI7FFaa	give him a call, tell him how you feel. I'm also 40 and not getting any younger. you'll never know unless you make that call, this could be the last good thing you'll miss out on. pick up the phone and call now, don't wast any more time. and no need to thank me, just be happy.|`|Ne7xr36Saa	Fess up! Call him and tell him what you are thinking and take it from there. He might not be a very physical guy. No game playing....call.|`|zItCp7Whaa	He hasn't kissed you and you think he's a keeper?

He also was probably caught off guard, and embarrassed by the situation and think you don't feel the way you do about him. So call him back and let him know that you care about him and help him get manly again.|`|gVwqxDMQaa	Give him a little bit of time. If he is into you he will call. If he doesn't call, he isn't into you. Any man worth having will go after what he wants.|`|yCSgswltaa	why are you in such a hurry to be kissed? several dates tells me you have been on about 3 or 4 dates. he is being a gentleman and treating you with respect. slow down and get to know each other a lot better.too many people want to jump into a serious relationship after only a few dates and this is what he might think you want after the kissing comment. you can call him and tell him that you are sorry if you scared him with bring up the kissing and that you are not used to being treated like a lady and with respect and you hope you can still keep on seeing each other. it will however be up to him if he wants to continue to date you.|`|zDeFibxzaa	first ,you screwed up,you talked about it,now hes not ok with things  second ,you really like him and dont want to loose him,right?  3rd,you shouldnt talk so much and kiss more,even if it is you first!     get it?|`|cLDbxtARaa	Sounds like he dont like your Breath try a mint|`|hs793CCxaa	Leave it for a few days - you're probably not the only thing he has to think about (said nicely!). Set a day/date with yourself to phone him, if he hasn't phoned you. You could always just text him - "what's up doc"? or "What's happening"? You should get some sort of reply, which will give you a guide to his thinking. Good luck.
D6nu55wlaa	as men we are not always very smart... and we all let the good ones get away.|`|cdXMQai8aa	They lied.?|`|8kp2S7I8aa	You look like a boy. Get a different haircut|`|OhqMdODUaa	umm,  you're o.k.    a new haircut, and you'll have boys all over you ;)        ii pinky promisee :D|`|k5wqvI42aa	wow you are pretty and you look a lot older than 14. just wait until you get a little bit older and guys will start to appreciate you more. i promise.?|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	you are pretty!  but that's not what will get you a boyfriend. the best way to get a guy to like you is to get to know him, and let him know you as more than just another pretty girl.|`|VF9ocPGWaa	prob bc your younge. once you get older the boys will run after you. your a pretty girl and right now at your age boys dont want a pretty intelligent girl. They want to look at boobs, and a s ses. When you get older and the guys do too, they will end that phase and look for someone real. not just a tool|`|ZrCgkqZ4aa	Your lucky to get said your pretty which you are. Don't expect to get asked out like in movies because, listen, they...are...movies! It's not going to be all lovey dovey or what ever. I get asked out but as jokes. Or one time a guy asked if I would go out with a guy in my science class I can't remeber the name of. Trust me it's problay NEVER going to be like in movies.|`|buggyHGRaa	Your beautiful. But maybe its the inside that guys dont like.  The time will come. High School relationships are practice for college and after for when marriage is coming into play. Dont freak. Maybe they dont like your personality or maybe your not their type or maybe they dont see what you could be like most guys. Relax the right guy is waiting for you somewhere out there. Have fun with your friends. They are more important anyways.ANd now guys want the easy girls. THe ones they know they can catch cuz there afraid of reaching up and grabbing the good ones beacause theyre afraid of falling and getting hurt. There dumb now but as you get older they appreciate girls more and see that your worth it.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	If you want guys to ask you out, you need to make yourself more available. You need to flirt more with the guys you find attractive and your hit rate will go up.     Why do girls act all like they don't care, stuck up, or aloof and expect guys to hit on them left and right.|`|ANC7G909aa	the problem is definitly not your looks, its the boys. girls are liek apples, the good ones that are on top are really hard to reach, and only a few guys are gonna go to the extra trouble to getem. the crappy "easy" apples at the bottom are less trouble and just come and go. you would be the apple at the top, so dont worry your better off. the right guy will come, and you wont have to deal with tons of assholes!! your luckey really!  hahaha my friend whos dating this skank told me that last night=]- i like your question|`|fyXTjMQdaa	I think you're very pretty. :)  It's a kind of beauty I haven't seen much, but I like it.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	You're definitely a good looking girl no doubt about that.    I'm guessing you're not very approachable, you are giving off vibes to guys that tells them to back off.|`|GmRMniJSaa	I'm told I'm pretty as well. I always have the ability to become great friends with guys, but I rarely get asked out. I've only been asked out twice in my life. Doesn't bother me really. But it IS something I've thought about.|`|AgTwJMcNaa	You're very pretty. Maybe you don't get asked out because you're shy?|`|suoY5vxbaa	Yea i think you are pretty! Maybe if i could see you in color.. lol|`|18lbiKlVaa	ahh i understand.most likely its your personalty.sometimes guys might think your too much for them to handle or something like that.mabie you tend to be in the "friend zone".and it could be your friends,if there always with guys making it all about them.put yourself in the picture and take control.and you will land a good one.just keep your options open.|`|QiKFQDEvaa	come on seriously you are 14 you should be decorating your english book cover with hello kitty stickers not worrying bout boys at this stage they are all acne infested and weird anyway! so enjoy the innocence you have chill with your girls pass notes in class ohemgee bobby is sooo cute 2day |`|6cc43cf6baab57a5607c1b71f2ef806daa	Contrary to popular belief, most guys actually like to get to know a girl before they ask her out. Just because you look nice doesn't necessarily mean you are a nice person.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Right. Biggest problem I see there is your age.  You're 14, sis. At that age, guys don't really go around asking girls out simply because they're too busy with other problems at the time.  Wait it out. Life's different when you're 15; you start worrying about other things, and then you realize how fast time is going by.|`|lXVwGgHmaa	i got the same problem. try to get closer with more guys it opens up the playing field more|`|SorcFv62aa	uhh im not gonna answer this dont wanna look mean
1poSSvTdaa	That's certainly an interesting story, and you have a very interesting way of spelling it out for us.|`|sLtmg9xzaa	85% of the students stood up as the professor ask them to stand so if they consider themselves as "good".     78% of the students raise their hands as the professor ask them to raise their hands if being "good" is something you have to do in life.     After an intense battle of being grouped in different countries, waging war and market battles against each other, fighting to survive, feed your country, earn more money, create waste and death, destruction of our environment, and lied, conned, stole, kidnapped from each other countries. We all had a small thought in our heads... "perhaps we're not as good as we thought we are". Of course, we all had our excuses, "but we needed to do this because we lacked resources...and we didn't had enough people... etc etc..", they've been all heard before... but it's true... within our inner souls lies a beast inside regardless what you may say.     Nietzche is a brilliant man, he left a realization to us all.    So, to answer your question, yes, you can potentially be a bad person if told often and based on your own judgement and will from what society may find as "bad" or "abnormal".    Also, human beings' values, beliefs, and attitudes are, in fact, relativism, it changes, it depends on time era, and it depends on location as well.     You are not a whore.

Go for it!|`|Q3eORl9Yaa	umm yeah r u attractive then heck YEs !!!!|`|PixwhRR1aa	i find that to be cute and charming!|`|ne2SVhMsaa	oh lol  no i wouldnt think it was weird   i thot you were a girl the whole time until the end haha|`|nydwnlT7aa	ummm.. i would be like.. haha okay maybe (if you're cute) if not i would say maybe later|`|2vgK8pTgaa	i would exclude the part "i usually wouldnt ask anyone this but".. it kind of gives off a weird vibe|`|4FrP53Taaa	if a guy i like asked me that i would say yes.|`|CpLLA6Niaa	hmmmm....I would not say "I usually wouldn't ask anyone this" because it sounds like you have NEVER asked anyone on a date. And, the "sometime maybe" sounds weak.      How about just coming up to her and saying something like, "ya know I've been wanting to meet you.  You seem interesting because _____________.  Want to go get some coffee?  if she says she has another class, then say something like, that's okay, is there a better time?  and go from there.    Good luck!|`|QkKXX6igaa	i'd tell him that i don't know him, and if he persisted i'd go along with it as long as he was cute and let my friends go.|`|k1FenuRLaa	weird. no guys i knew wud try that|`|1lOTFK9Faa	I would say, "im sorry but i'm not gay. please dont ever talk to me again." cause im a guy so you know, not a girl.|`|7XbXvsNHaa	no maybe, jsut say it bluntly.  "would you like to go out sometime?"    ...."HIT MEH UP CHIKA."    jk :-p    yes, she'd say yes, unless she;s not interested.  have more confidence!|`|MQCT1FXjaa	it i had a boy friend it would be awkward, but  other than that depending on who you are/ appearance|`|OikNR8Ufaa	depends if i fancied you, i'd probably prefer it if you'd chatted to me and become a friend first, but if you were really cute i might say yeah...actually i might say yeah anyways if i didnt see it coming and couldnt think on my toes of a way to let you down gently...and I'd probably end up hurting you :P|`|VDvdrCjmaa	Confidence is key. But I'd blush and say yes and give him a try[:|`|drzN1kkuaa	id be like, uhhh i dont even know you.|`|MI6Ds5lwaa	maybe if we get to know each other a little bit more.|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	I have had that happen to me. and i said no only cuz i didnt know him at all. i would try talking to her at least once or twice and then not asking her out but like inviting her to some party that u will be at and u guys can chill there.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	If you were cute i would say yes or give you my real phone number.|`|kG3AfXvsaa	If he was cute, and seemed decent, (example if he held the door open for me maybe) then I might consider him with certain conditions. For example, I wouldn't meet anywhere with him totally iscolated since I didn't know him.|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	I'd say "Sure, why not." And thhen if I don't like you afterwards I just won't call you anymore|`|ReH5EoR0aa	I don't get who is who here.      You are a guy and a girl said that to you?   If so,  I think that is very good and the normal thing to do would be say,  "Sure would!"    If it works out, great.  If not, you made a new friend.|`|eocYAzeraa	depends if its a shy girl or not. you don't want to scare her away. but in truth, this sounds shallow, but it depends how cute you are. cuz if you are coming right out and ask her before you know her and your asking her based on her looks, she will do the same thing. but if you have known her for a while, go for it.|`|EGi2Xqvaaa	It would seem unmeaningful and like your trying to hard but its worth the try every girl is different..!!|`|fhJtB39Taa	I'd be surprised....would considere it....depending on the guy off course hahaa|`|MwwW1eqTaa	if i liked him i would ssay yes duhh!!!(:|`|1Foz82Mqaa	" uhhhhh......"    (wasn't expecting that).    then probably a halfhearted "sure".|`|FhtE5UvKaa	id tell him no, ive seen it happen on movies but try to talk to her at least once before you ask anything|`|YTOE91wlaa	i'd say what the hell - i may not know you but that doesn't mean i wouldn't like to.    i think it's cute :)|`|w5Dd7Dtfaa	If he was cute, I'd probably say yes. But even if he wasn't, I'd give him credit for building up the courage to come up to me.  =]|`|vpHcS3Suaa	Definitely cute. Your showing someone that you would like to get the chance to know them.|`|i3TIW7vtaa	It depends...  and I'm being totally honest... but I would only say sure if I had been checking him out beforehand.    also,  Loose the last "maybe" that you said there... it makes you sound unsure!|`|jCZCRguUaa	well i would be kinda hesitant if i didn't know you. i've had a guy do something like that before and he kept trying to talk and walk with me everyday. i thought it was annoying until we became really good friends. so go for it! if you're patient maybe just ask her how she's liking the class or something. lol good luck!|`|uAzToWC7aa	I would (if i knew the boy) say, MAYBE!!  If i didnt know him i would be like, "I hardly even Know U"|`|bfxhpsvzaa	if you've never EVER talked to her before  she might think your some weird stalker and then she wont go near you  if you talk to her a few times first, like,  bump into her, apologise, and next time you see her be like, "oh. your that girl i accidently bumped into, im still sorry about that, im , by the way, *holds out hand*  a guy totally did that to me  it was adorable  (17 months later still dating)
Q8CS0x0Kaa	Nope. I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 14, or 15. Just because everybody else is starting to date at a younger age now days, doesn't mean you have to. All my friends had boyfriends before I did, so don't feel bad.|`|UvJHHpHYaa	no its not weird at ll|`|qKQiqKKHaa	Well i am 14 too and I haven't had a boyfriend yet either so... i don't think it really matters until you are ready any way, wait until everything seems right! Thats what I am going to do!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i waited until i knew the guy really really well and was sure i wanted to be in a relationship with him.  I was 22. He was the first guy i had anything at all to do with, and now we are having our second child (im 24 now).  If u make sure u know u want something, then it will work out much better- and you will be more mature by the time it happens- no matter what anyone thinks about it!|`|jRa5ksWSaa	Not at all. I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 17.|`|f8auCNQvaa	No  I was 16|`|cTqalqv1aa	nope some people dont get bfs until like 17 or 18|`|FmIAKDJLaa	Nope I was 17
ab818faae403168ce0ae59f966d5c284aa	Of course SEX. But the real  question is how would we know if the guy is good at sex unless we approached him and in order to do that he would have to be attractive to us.|`|AA12260728	neither. I don't care if he's cute, and honestly, I don't give a crap about sex right now.|`|AA10716277	Well, if he wasn't handsome, I wouldn't know if he was good at sex or not.|`|AA12058507	It depends if he really hot or just for the pants :)|`|44150305f2e014b275f968c1a218e31baa	handsome! because anyone could get good at sex|`|AA10953000	If prefer a guy who isn't fugly. He doesn't have to be handsome, but I cannot cringe when I look at him, because even if he was good at sex, it wouldn't be good for me. You dig?|`|db9373aaa68346d676e419b17cd416a5aa	I prefer handsome I realy dont care about what he can do in bed cause sex is not that important to and looks are not that important it whats on the inside and how they treat u

AA11690464	I can see why you liked him so much.  Just an all around good guy.|`|82ffb4b89ad9beed5456857456d41299aa	Can you possibly be serious?  Go and get some chickengoatguts, tie them in a stocking and hang them over your bed.  He will come in the middle of the night and talk to you. Ask him anything you want to know.  As long as the guts stay fresh he'll answer!  C'mon lady!  Deal with your grief.  The man is gone and you have my sympathy for that, but whatever he did is irrevokable at this point and you need to grieve and move on with your life.|`|9b3bea4d871c8a462ab9d19f0057a3eaaa	i think perhaps he was just makin sure how he felt about you cause he was confused and came up with the idea if he got off with another girl it would give him an insight. Dont remember the bad times just the good
c2ce662927d4cd7efcd2e43a219156cfaa	Penso ke siano terrorizzati al'idea ke possano rimandarla laggi, anke se avranno accertato violense, solo per questioni diplomatike.    D'altronde la Biellorussia  ancora una dittatura tremenda e negli orfanotrofi ex sovietici i bambini prendono addirittura la polmonite (oltre ad altri maltrattamenti). Anke il Russia sono gelosi dei loro bambini, preferiscono farli marcire dentro dei posti orribili, piuttosto ke farli adottare da altri Paesi, e questo solo perk hanno perso la Guerra Fredda! Adottarli  molto difficoltoso.    Per questo ti prego di non giudicare quella coppia, ke sta esagerando solo per amore di una bambina ke faceva disegni di bimbi legati e seviziati... E il disegno  un modo ke i bambini hanno per comunicare, quando le parole non possono descrivere l'orrore.    P.s. i bambini dell'ex URSS non vengono semplicemente in vacanza, ma anke x curarsi dalle radiazioni cui sono sottoposti dai tempi della catastrofe di Cernobyll|`|e7d1d6ca276146cdadedd9d84484e08aaa	La situazione  un po' controversa, da una parte i diritti di questa bambina di sentirsi al sicuro e dall' altra la situazione di centinaia di bambini che sperano di migliorare una situazione che ora potrebbe veramente essere critica.  Come fare a giudicare in malo modo questa coppia che affezionata alla bambina non le vuole dare altra sofferenza, ma come fare per evitare che si arrestino le adozioni e che un incidente diplomatico non comprometta la finalit pi importante di questo progetto che  quella di portare tantissimi bambini ad un benessere che ora gli  negato?  Spero e credo che la situazione si risolva, ma dovrebbero tutti pensare solo al bene di queste creature, non ai rapporti politici e diplomatici, giusto?
766eaf74c364a65c2b3a7e2672e57fdfaa	Well, did you do anything to lead her on?    I would probably have to say tht you should talk with her let her know about how illegal this entire situation is.This talk must be completely serious. If you can convince her that even chancing your relationship is wrong, and if she is really that in to you she might just understand. I'm not saying that she wont love you anymore but she will believe that you guys will have a better shot at dating someone your own age.  ~I wish you the best of luck~|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Just kindly explain the complications of the age difference.|`|dPQiMtANaa	She's young...let her down easy. I remember being that age and having crushes on older guys. Whatever you do, DON'T encourage her because it doesn't take much to encourage a girl that young with a crush. Just say that you're flattered and she's a really sweet girl but you're too old for her and she needs to stick to boys her own age.|`|EQDcq2IEaa	A 13 year old has no idea what love is.    They just have a crush, that's all.|`|Ek00D5kOaa	wow that's sick!!! she is half your age. tell her you can never have anything with her because its against the law or something. teach her about jail bait ha. that sucks =/ lol|`|Atcw05gnaa	Just say that you are 26 and 13... but that your sure that when she grows up she will be certain to find someone that will "sweep her off her feet". ;)|`|E9ksrxsLaa	Dont break her heart. just say you think shes a really nice girl but your ages dont match up. tell her any guy her age would be lucky to have her|`|jwhbQLU7aa	I'd first explain to her how young she is, and how she has her life ahead of her whilst you are a grown man. You have different priorities and such a relationship could hurt not only her, but you. Girls her age don't understand feelings like these yet. She'll be upset, but she'll bounce back. Don't worry to much.|`|wD7NtKMnaa	shes very young . she doesn't know the meaning of real love.   i wouldnt take it to heart too much but maybe don't be as.. flirty as you may have normally been.     just be careful. you don't wanna get yourself a rep. or her parents after you.
AA12076278	I posted the answer once of justfuckinggoogleit.com and got a warning for "not having an answer of substance" when there were answers of "First to post!" and other garbage like that|`|444c769597327feb33cbc49f23b23ab8aa	i concur. i had someone get mad at me and just report every thing i asked or posted. its so stupid.|`|71eded924ff7b0d1bd13a3c9653ce9e6aa	I think it's getting ridiculous due to stupid questions.|`|d829b15d717790615b9287e5495b09bcaa	All i did was ask an innocent question in polls and surveys and they took it off for no good reasoN! There wasn't anything inappropriet about it either.
sYyNyjwuaa	She wants you to talk to her =)    Ask her for her number, get to know her, ask her out.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	She wants you to talk to her, and is wondering why you wont.|`|zX01mIZnaa	she likes you :) for sure, and she wants you to notice her so next time smile back :) |`|XwPs0Pmnaa	she thinks your hot and wants you to like her !|`|AA11886887	Yeah, I do recommend you going up to her and saying whats up! Or something, because that is a clear sign she atleast wants you to do that.|`|FPLIBcUwaa	heya x  she may like you and be waiting for you to make a move and flirt back! go for it!! life's to short to wonder what would happen! x|`|baVloeL3aa	With a girl, you never know.  She's probably flirting, but doesn't necessarily mean she likes you.  Only one way to find out, gotta ask.|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	shes flirting haha i always do that with my boyfriend if were with a group of people and i walk passed him :]|`|gVJ5bKLcaa	Ok odds are she is very shy and wants you to make the move first.   Tell her you like her cute little smile...UNLESS ur shy I mean if you r like one of thoughs guys who r shy to make the first move...JUST STEP OUT UR COMFORT ZONE.|`|AuWPMH44aa	go up to her and talk to her alittle bit. see if theres any kind of connection or anything|`|L4rghydBaa	definitly has a crush on you but get to no her a bit, then go for it!! like surprise her, make it where she thinks for a little while that ur not that interested, then just ask her out!!|`|CSMqn1Dvaa	it means she might like you, but no one can understand the female mind. a girl did that to me and i talked to her a few days and when i finally asked her out, she said she didnt like me like that. big boost of confidence for me(sarcasm)|`|3Ml7ekHEaa	She really likes you. I can tell because I am a girl. And She wouldn't just smile and stare at anyone. Smiling is to catch your eye and then staring at you is another way of catching your eye and to get you to come by her or talk to her. Hope I helped!|`|UkxhD587aa	That means she likes you. Oh and if shes cute then ask her out...
yfZ5YSp4aa	He totally likes you!     Stop wasting time on yahoo answers :) and get a date with the guy. It's nearly valentine's day, make the most of it!|`|iawB65ltaa	WOW..  mmkay tamika gave you a looong answer and mine is prolly going to be very suckish((:    well i think you should talk to him. it's the *only* way you are really going to know. i've had this happen so many times and it's really embarrassing if someone lies by saying the other person likes you.. >.  but i wish you the best!  [[haha, update me if ya want..]] lolz     -Charleee wishes yahhzz the best!!!|`|Vy6mSjmcaa	Yeah...i think he likes you...make him a present because Valentines Day is coming!|`|PmpbkocAaa	Like yourself. Whether you're goofy, silly, crazy, quirky, smart, reserved, or whatever, how can you expect a guy to like you if you don't like yourself? You've got to show this person how awesome you are, but first you need to know how awesome you are. Build up your self confidence. Now, this doesn't mean you have to be loud, boisterous, arrogant, chatty, or forward. It just means getting to a place where you're comfortable in your own skin. You can be secure, sweet and humble all at the same time. Guys like confident, interesting girls who have their own lives. The only guys who like insecure girls are the ones who are insecure themselves. But who wants to be with a guy who wants a girl to feel bad about herself? That's not healthy, and you deserve better.Get his attention. He can't fancy you if he doesn't know you exist. If you haven't caught his eye yet, then get him to notice you. You've got to walk before you run, right? Say "Hi". Say "Good-bye". Wave. When he reciprocates, is when you know he notices you. Introduce yourself somehow and make conversation. Take an interest in who he is--what he likes, where he's coming from, where he wants to go--and show him who you are, too. While some guys don't like to talk that much, it's nearly impossible for someone to like you if he doesn't get to know you--unless he "likes" you for all the wrong reasons.Crack a joke. Having a good sense of humor makes everything better. That doesn't mean you should be a giggling fool, laughing at everything that crosses your path. Express your sense of humor in your own way. Some people are witty and sarcastic, others can tell hilarious stories, and many people just do quirky things and poke fun at themselves. No matter what tickles your sense of humor, it's much easier to like someone who you can have a good laugh with once in a while. If you don't find something to laugh about together, then maybe you'll discover that you don't like him after all!Do things together. If he loves rock-climbing, ask him if he can show you how, and make a good-faith effort to see why he's so into it. Have an open mind. Find out what you have in common, and include him in your world. If you love a certain kind of music, ask him if he's ever listened to a particular artist and offer to play a CD for him. Finding activities that you can enjoy together can really lay down a bond and further his appreciation of you.Have patience. These things take time. You can't force someone to like you, and trying to hurry things up can ruin the courtship altogether. Give him some space and don't be obsessive. Let things progress at a natural pace, or fade out of natural causes. Eventually he'll tell you one way or another whether or not he's interested in reciprocating your affection. And if he's not, don't hang around him like a lost puppy. Sometimes you might be incompatible in ways that you don't see, and sometimes a guy just isn't ready for a long term relationship. Don't take rejection too personally. It happens. Not everyone in the world is going to like you. Move on! There are other fish in the sea and if you followed the first step, you know that you're a good catch.|`|1Lz0ob3kaa	he likes you
VIULZ4Psaa	Are you a good kisser? He's not the one who knows, really. If a women kisses you longer, yeah i guess you are a good kisser. He could be jealous. It's nice that you wounder about that. You can set up a kissing both. Or ask  your dates response on how you kiss. They will tell you. Just don't have a big ego. Women always go after the hot guy who doesn't call himself hot. This guy i know never shows off but flirts. If a girl says he's handsome he says thanks and says he doesn't think he is. It makes women crazy about him cause he's a gentleman and doesn't gossip. Try it and girls will be all over you.|`|u7bxSrtKaa	i never really analyzed a kiss before.  you really put some thought into it.|`|fArUNIfRaa	if your asking then your not a good one.  your probably gay......thats why girls dont like your kisses|`|AGmZNf7zaa	if you don't slobber it doesn't matter how thin your lips are... it's the saliva that makes a bad kisser... and if you go outside her lips it's pretty discusting... keep it clean and ur good.  oh and if you don't jam your toungue down her throat then that will also make you a good kisser.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Why don't you tell me? Kiss me and I'll let you know :)    Just kidding! It doesn't matter if you have thin lips or not! lol|`|iktuXTQTaa	Thick lips sink ships.|`|ub23m7Praa	Only way to see who the better kisser is is for you to kiss him ^.^|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	kiss each other to find out who's the better kisser|`|AA11441704	no, it doesn't matter............naughty!|`|JaOddaodaa	well i think to be a good kisser u have to hold her more tightly.........the feeling is all..........10 and 90 doesnt matter much

You're really young.  Don't dress up 'hot' until you want a guy to want you for your body (aka whenever you decide to give up education and become a slut).    I honestly think you'll be better off dressing cute.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	If you've already got a boyfriend, why are you trying to look tarty for picking up guys?|`|O0pYOOpAaa	you should be doing your homework.    little harlots these days|`|RJynYf6aaa	dress cute. dont be trashy....plus your only 13 you dont need to be dressing like a prostitute to get your 12 year old boyfriends attention. and if hes a sweet type of guy like you said then he will appreciate you dressing cute and not trashy|`|OhqMdODUaa	for your age? hmm..      'fitting' abercrombie jeans and a cute top would be fine.|`|GQdxDkA9aa	dress how u would normally dress if he liked you before than he should like you no matter how u dress.|`|M1vaxvUZaa	wear a cute tank... but nothing revealing and maby jeans if hes your age he wont want you for those reasons an if he does then dump the doosh|`|hLYUYHOLaa	AWW DNT DRESS HOT HO TUR TOO YOUNG AND U BE COME  A TART B4 YR 14 REPSECT UR SELF FIRSTLY AND DRESS CUTE AND ENJOY UR DAT BUT NO KISSING OPN FIRST DATE THEN THE GUY KNOW U A RESPECTABLE GIRL|`|cq3FtZCuaa	dress cute..but something that would catch his attention. nothing tooo revealing cos you dont wanna come off like a hoe..thats a name that many girls dont want. & plus like he shouldnt even really pay attention on how you dress..he should really be more into your personality. i mean, isnt that why you guys are together in the first place!!? haha well hope this helps & good luck!

8MbbY0Tbaa	didnt you already ask this question earlier.......................weird
fH2Fw4QEaa	She thought that I should and I divorced her for it and after I offered her joint custody, that wasn't good enough so now I'm fighting her for full custody...    She can support herself and the fact that I'm a man does not obligate me to support anyone other than my children, period.    Funny thing, I've paid for everything for the past five years and put her through school. Had she not thought of me as a paycheck, I would have given her everything.|`|KILFoc6kaa	The money that he makes goes into our shared checking account, which we both have equal access to. I do not work outside the home, however if for some reason I did, the same would be with any money I made.|`|jaA4zCEIaa	i give it to my wife when I get paid until cuz she manages the money better than I do.|`|444pPdy5aa	Try this:  It's called English    "Does your husband give you his full paycheck?"|`|1nk8WPrtaa	Only when I dance for him|`|4LM2v3c2aa	yep...he do...(does) lol|`|jOgdFkROaa	yea... and i give him the money that i think he should spend|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	one of them did.|`|P28G0a1Raa	Of course....|`|NZwDZZtQaa	Actually I give him mine he's better at managing money then I am|`|AA11329026	nah it goes straight into the bank account and then i pay all the bills. poor hubby be lost without me... he can't pay a bill to save his life.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	No - his paycheck is his.  I work 40 hours a week for my own.|`|WDBMu6Xtaa	Well, we're not legally married. We live together and we have a son. But yes, my partner does give me his full paycheck and even shows me his payslip to show his deduction if there are any. I never forced him to do that though.. He does it himself and I'm touched by it because it means he's loyal to me.
ZlC654Dkaa	Honestly, you're only 21, so you couldn't have spent too much of your life lonely.  I'm 35 and still lonely, so just get out there while you're still young and meet as many girls as you can.|`|ronomgTIaa	youre 21 go OUT. Go to college parties, play some drinking games, go to bars/clubs go enjoy life. COME ON. Oh if all else fails i guess you could email me through my profile lol im in your age range haha.|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Try going more and meet girls in public maybe bring a friend and smile alot most people you meet online are going to get cold feet so go to singles night and have fun don't concentrate so much on finding someone just be you and have a good time.|`|AA12185428	Sounds like you may be more interested in having a relationship than just enjoying people. This is a good time to learn more about yourself and what you want. Keep searching and enjoy the process.|`|3ijLQe5laa	you will find a relationship. but you have to build your confidence first or the woman that you get with will take advantage of you.. ive been there.|`|f150f01d84493e10842994ccc28e9d6eaa	you'll find one eventually.  don't worry.  that girl wasn't the one.  but the one girl for you is out there.  don't worry.|`|fkgYL6TSaa	Don't do online dating, that can turn out horribly.  Just stop watching love story movies and be happy with your life! it'll happen when it happens :]|`|5YUk0L22aa	Get a dog if your so lonely!|`|hJbcwTMMaa	these things take time, its hard but....    in the end it will be worth the wait, make sure you keep your options open.|`|AA11599430	stay away from online flings they could be hazardous|`|cG7z70Vgaa	Well when you get to the phone numbere exchange, call them and get to know them more. Ask them out and then you are good. Being lonely won't cease unless you either forget about it or confront your problem.|`|sZePlWTQaa	Try online dating. You can meet so many people. Make the date at a coffee shop..it can last 15 mins or an hour!    I am a shy girl so online dating was helpful for me. I met my fiance online!|`|MmIYDoGkaa	If it's still cold after a while ditch the phone thing.Try going to clubs,parks,coffee shop (STARBUCKS),book clubs,ect.Meet as many girls as you can and ditch the girls who's personality are a little too extreme.Making it short, just get some girls and move on.|`|QrUWtvH8aa	Heh, i know exactly how you feel, am in the same position but haven't even got as far as phone number stage. It is really painful but I guess the only way you can get out of it is to stop dwelling on it and stop putting so much pressure on yourself to find your perfect woman - you're bound to be dissapointed if you set your hhopes too high but don't lose sight of what's important to you either. Of course all of this is easier said tha done - as i say i'm in the same boat and can't follow my own advice. Take comfort in the fact that you're not the only one and it 'll alll turn  out alright in the end. Try and focus on something else - study? career? work? etc?  I wish you all the best - you can do it!

qDpFSqn4aa	I think I need a cigarette.    Of course he likes you, that much is obvious.  Next time you go and skate, ask if you can join him.  While you're skating you can talk to him.  The longer you talk the more he's going to like you.  If he doesn't ask you out by the end of the night then you can ask him out, you already have the skating down pat as a sure thing.    Hope this helps, good luck even though I don't think you need luck so just have fun.|`|HVu5YGQuaa	sounds like it...

But here is the bottom line. You have a choice as to whether you want to wallow in self-pity or pick yourself up and deal with reality. It ain't over until its over give it time he may come back.    But if he doesn't there are lots a men looking for a good women. Give yourself time to heal, then have a little fun. After that let your heart take you where it may. As others have said it'll get better, and you will get over it.|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	I think your life lesson is to not open your heart again too quickly and not get too attached. A relationship take both of you to work together, at an equal pace. If he didn't care as much as you did you should've shown you didn't care that much.|`|KUZY05Lnaa	Wow. I'm so sorry about this. It does seem really devastating. If You're going to see him, I suggest you act like nothing is hurting inside. It will just seem as if you're not as clingy. So maybe you should turn to god. I mean, it may sound a little cheesy and churchy, but it seriously works! :] Just tell yourself that things happen for a reason, and that's why you need to move on. We lose people in our lives so that when others come along, that we will be able to appreciate them more. So keep your heart open. :)|`|XzLUA7ataa	There is probably a great deal of truth in his statement that "he can't love you the way your deserve to be loved".  You may think that at age 36 you should be in a secure and well bonded relationship.  Be that as it may, it takes two people to make a successful commitment.  He is apparently not there and you can't do it alone.  If you go separate ways, he may have the time and space to seriously consider what you've brought to his life.  He may then rethink the hurtful remarks.  You are in a difficult spot.  Best wishes to you.|`|2d7e5cc0bc66da2c368bc5cd10c16a35aa	ok! wow well since your 36 years old im pretty sure your smart enough to know you need to eat and sleep. Also i think it was really sweet of him to say that i can't love you as much as you need to be. I am sure he is hurting just as bad. I love that quote " It better to have loved then never love at all" or something along those lines. Obviously it will be very difficult right now 6 years is a very long time and you built a special bond with this person  im sorry if this sounds rude but hes still her he cares about you enough to let you go because he knows hes not good enough for you. I don't know if you Catholic i am but, Everything happens for a reason and obviously he is not the right guy. One of these days you will meet the guy of your dreams and fall happy in love and get married your 36! you still have 60+ years ahead of yourself to make a difference in life to make a difference in someone's life. I don't know you personally and i know your hurting right now but your a great person and trust me i know there will be one person who will be upset if you kill your body I will so please take a vaca or something you have to get your mind off of things and get away im sure counseling at the moment won't help cause your just talking more about him and now how to forgive. hope I help :) smile|`|fzIeGPZYaa	it's one of the hardest things when someone doesnt love you like you love them, or as much as you feel they should.

It's hard for everyone when a long-term relationship ends. An as for your age 36 is a grate time for you to find someone who truely wants to settle down.|`|3iNobwVraa	Maybe your life's lesson is to be willing to be fully open to all situations and experiences.  Stop fighting to protect yourself from the bad ones.  You can't and you SHOULDN'T.  This is part of life.  You have to take the good with the bad.  Don't fight reality.  Accept it.  Breathe deeply, and know you can handle even something that hurts badly.  This is part of being alive.    Check out some books on positive thinking, and start changing your perception of yourself as someone who is victimized by life and people.  This overly dramatic reaction is forcing you to perceive the situation as something you are unfairly being forced to endure.    Try this: EVERY time you start feeling sad and thinking about your this situation, read this out loud for five minutes straight:    "I am lucky to be alive and engaged with life and people.  I know that I can feel happy for _______ to leave my life either for now, or forever, because I know that everything is working out for my highest good.  I will seek and find happiness, and I will see and enjoy beauty in myself, others, and the world."    Continue to do this until you stop thinking negatively about it.  Now try to see if this doesn't positively impact your 'feelings.'  It definitely will, because what you think shapes your perspective, and your perspective births your feelings.  Feelings are nothing other than how you have chosen to perceive and think about something.      This is not to say they are not real.  They are.  And they can be utterly profound.  They can also be searing in their intensity.  But, and this is what's important for you, they are easily influenced by your thoughts and perspective.  Some people like feeling sad.  It makes them feel good to be dramatic and depressed.  We all have moments like that, for sure.  But, happy people yank themselves the hell out of that abyss darn quick.  You could easily rot in there.  I've seen people choose to do so, and maybe you will do the same.  But, make no mistake about it, it is a choice you are making.  It is not happening to you, you are choosing your reality every day.      Control your thoughts.  Even if it means you read prepackaged messages aloud to yourself--it will change your perspective!  What is going to happen will always happen.  Life doesn't care if you are happy or miserable in the process.  Do you?  Really?  Then step up and be an active participant.  Best.
fg2xU6Z2aa	honey today is your lucky day, i have had my fair share of long distance relationships.     first an hour away ain't bad, it wouldn't take that long back and forth and you are getting an education. if he really cares he will go 4 hours to see you, but from the sounds i don't think you have anything to worry about!|`|NZpTh9LAaa	yeah i lived with my bf for like 8 months and right now we're 7 hours apart and we dont see each other a lot. it hurts at first but we call every day and we're going to see each other soon so it'll get better    it'll be okay once u get used to it and so long as u see each other often|`|DwMU437uaa	Kim baby if you move away he will just want to see you more and for a guy we will always want to see out girls. if you move and he doesn't like you moving then hes not a gut because as i said before us guys always want to see our girls|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	duh|`|bZTpK9uVaa	Yep, 95% of the time, it doesnt work.

This girl tried to prove me wrong, didnt work.    that 5% is hard to overcome.

PfE6bg5iaa	I have verizon too.    I only get LG brand phones now, I've had various brands and they've always lasted the longest before breaking!

Good luck!|`|AA11214261	i have verizion and the type of phone i have is an   LG. it is a reg looking flip phone but it is great it never fails. i have no problems with it. its my second LG and now i would only have this type of phone b-c they are good to me.|`|fT3VCjrZaa	Well i have Sprint and there service is great   Free after 7 week days  Free weekends  and i got unlimited text and i dont  have a fancy phone but it have nice service|`|7upShB9Yaa	I also have Verizon Wireless. The phone I have is the LG Venus. I haven't had any problems with it at all. All I typically only text and make phone calls as well. It's a good phone in my opinion.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Check your area- sometimes it's where you have towers.    I had sprint and hate them because they lied to us- hidden charges and and changed their talk time hours when they wanted too....    Nextel- is JUNK- doesn't work anywhere any of the time.    T Mobile is OK but it doesn't work out where we are and has huge gaps in NJ where they don't have towers.    Best by far is ATT, they have the most towers.  I got the LG shine- it was $27 with mail in rebate.  It's worth $27.00 LOL but I won't say it's the greatest phone.  They are getting to complicated for me- I just need the basics not all this other junk.|`|uSZVT4bwaa	i have the env2 and i love it but i do alot of texting.   you should probably go with just a regular flip phone if your only making calls.|`|4POGapREaa	I've had T-Mobile for about 7 yrs now & wouldn't even consider changing.  My phone is a Nokia but I forget the model number.  It's great, never a problem with reception or receiving messages.  My husband bought the big woop Iphone for like $500 and can barely receive a call.  There's no reception, the calls drop, you miss every other word, he might get a message a day after the person actually sent it, etc.
bK9YS2kpaa	Al leer tu historia,por un momento me senti reflejada querida amiga, es que mi historia es un 90% parecida a la tuya.  Hace 3 meses (justo hoy se cumplen) deje de ver a una persona maravillosa, lo conoci en USA,pero yo me tuve que regresar a Chile, todo era maravilloso mientras estuvimos juntos, lo unico malo fue y es esto de la distancia, no se si lo vea este a?o,pero el me dice que esta haciendo todo lo posible por venir el a?o que viene, mientras yo estoy esperando terminar de estudiar para irme para alla.  Yo le digo que no quiero estar con nadie mas y el me dice lo mismo, a todo esto el es 5 a?os mas grande que yo,pero eso no es un impedimento para nada. A veces me desespero tanto por no tenerlo cerca, y solo debo conformarme con hablar por msn, o por telefono con el, de verdad amiga de que te entiendo eso de que esa persona es la indicada para uno y esto de la distancia duele mucho.  Pero te quiero decir algo, que es lo mismo que le digo a l, esto hay que verlo como una prueba de Dios, si el cari?o que hay entre ambas personas, las cosas funcionaran, si no es asi, es porque no estaban destinados el uno al otro.

8HewQkkoaa	1. make a list of everything you need for thr wedding. Include flowers, venue, dress, invites. Everything. If you arent sure, buy a good quality wedding magazine that includes a planner in the back of it. Lots of them to. Alternatively, some stationary or bridal shops sell special wedding planner folders that will make sure you dont forget anything.    2. Figure out how much you want to spend total. The figure out what is most important to you. If you really want a beautiful dress, but you couldnt care less about catering, then allocate more money to the dress and less to catering. Make an estimate for each thing on your list and write the amount next to it.    3. Spend some time looking at bridal mags or websites and jot down idea, themes, fave flowers, fave foods, venues etc that you might like.      4. Make a rough guest list and figure out rough numbers.      5. Start contacting venues, caterers, florists that offer services that match your ideas, and ask for rough quotes...so if you are having 70 guests, and you want an asian tapas style menu, contact asian restaurants that offer catering and ask how much it would cost roughly.  Jot down all the quotes you get, and if your estimates are way off for certain things, adjust them, and make allowances in other categories if you need to.  So if Catering costs $500 more than you had planned, maybe take that money away from your dress money etc.    6. Confirm your venue first, as many of the other details rely on that.    7.shop around with your florists, caterers and get the best deal for what you want.    8. consider putting together your own invites. You can get a rubber stand made with your entire invitation on it for really cheap, then you can by some beautiful paper and some metallic or black ink and ribbon and create amazing handmade invites, name cards, save the day cards and thankyou notes for really cheap.    9. consider all your friends, enlist anyone with talents to help out - if you have a friend who is an amazing cook, they might be able to create a wedding cake for you on the cheap etc.    10. Be creative with wedding favors and make them yourself. Go to craft stores for inspiration, or think about mass baking sweet treats to back in gauze bags as favours, easy and sooo cheap.    11. Early on, take your best friend/sister/mother to the nearest decent sized city and go to every dress shop  you can. DONT try on anything out of your price range, no matter how tempting. You will be dissapointed. There are plenty of amazing dresses at reasonable prices. Dont be afrain to try on really different styles at first, and get to know what you like and what suits you, you can narrow the field later, but you dont want to miss out on that amazing find because you dont think square necklines suit you usually!    FINALLY ask everyone you can think of for help. The more people who you can give tasks (like making favours) the lower your cost will be, and the less you will have to do on your own.    Enjoy, and congrats!|`|vvn5Kfnraa	Hi,    A good place to start is a free wedding consultation with a wedding planner.  They are no obligation events and as you talk through your ideas, you begin to form a picture in your head.  I know of one who even have a DIY bride package. Try www.shoestringweddings.co.uk|`|8kdjvWAxaa	Venue- where you want to have your wedding  Colors- What are your colors in your wedding  Wedding party- Who is in your wedding  the biggest one....  Your budget- How much are you planning to shell out    these are just the starters|`|iOqmoIrcaa	First of all, a big fancy wedding after 16 years and 2 children is completely gauche.  Small, simple, and graceful is more in keeping with your budget and age.  First, have a general discussion with your partner about his wishes, and come to some general agreements.  Pick a date.  The time or day and year will start you on the decision making process.  Then set a budget, and stick to it.  Once you start going over on one item, it's easy for it to escalate.  Make up a planner, and keep everything pertaining to the wedding together.  Ask your wedding party members to participate.  Make a guest list.  You have to know how many people to know how much of anything to get. Pick the wedding and reception sites.  Book them now.  Hire the support people you will need-band, caterer,florist,pastor....  Do not even attempt to do the food yourself.  That is a disaster waiting to happen.   You can do the flowers yourself if you are good at that sort of thing.  Bulk warehouses like Costco and Sam's Club have amazing deals on flowers.  Call in favors.|`|FzFSzilmaa	you need at least 18 months lead time...    you have to find a venue, who will perform the ceremony, flowers, transport, party location, guests....    and spring and summer weddings are more expensive..|`|yoQEs1KAaa	the first two things to do is book where and when the wedding day will be, then book the reception details. then work all the other details around them. you could also ask that no one give you presents as you have everything, but give money instead then you can spend it on what you really need. most larger pubs will give a wedding room free now, because they know they will make lots of money from drinks. lots of hotels now do wedding service and reception in the same place that will save you money.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Congrats.  You already have 2 children and have lived together for many years so it seems a bit odd to now have the full classic big wedding.  Besides you have admitted to having a budget.  Ppl are on tight budgets as it is anyway.    Why not choose say just 30 ppl and go off and do it ?   Why not get married on a cruise ship and incorporate the honeymoon.   Believe it or not Greta Green has been totally revamped and is superb.    Many Stately Homes are open for Civil Ceremonies now - even places such as HMS WARRIOR in Portsmouth - a fab and very different venue.      You have contradicted yrself in yr Q really "big fancy wedding" "Something low key"   the 2 just don't go together do they ?  Just go off as a family and come back married then have a dignified party.|`|7a8db8d183d13feb7759bd9779e41ee3aa	I don't personally know the answer because i have never planned a wedding before, but i found a website that might be of some help to you    www.confetti.co.uk    Hope this helps!|`|0jviPilhaa	decide on what sort of venue you want, what sort of ceremony (civil or religous), and how to cater for people. i.e. buffet or sit down meal. These are your major considerations and expenses, everything else is a personal preference. set your budget now and stick to it. write down every penny you spend, 'cos it all soon adds up. Don't be afraid to do exactly what you want and not what people expect you to do. It's your day, not theirs !!   We were married less than 6 months after I proposed and had the best day of our lives. Look on websites for local venues etc.|`|b1xQKDEraa	first you need to decide on a year and month which you have. then think about what day in that month you want to get married. Once you have this, start thinking about whether you want a church or civil service. If you want a church, then think about which church and approach them with your date to see if they are available, if they are then put down a deposit. Start looking for a reception venue, once youve found it, ensure they are also available and put down a deposit. Then your wedding is officially booked, you can send out some save the dates to let people to keep that date free (it is next year but some people book holidays etc a year in advance). I would then start looking at honeymoon venues and get that booked. Now would be a good time to look for a dress, as this may take you a long time. You can also book your photographer and videographer. Also consider wedding insurance. when you have about 8 months to go, start looking for bridesmaid dresses etc.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Firstly if you are getting anything for the wedding NEVER tell them that it is for a wedding upfront until you have a price. Most business at least double the price if they know its for a wedding. Secondly dont forget that its the marriage that is the important part not the wedding. That only lasts for a day...and is made way too much of in my opinion. Thirdly since you have been together for so long I would go the casual route instead of the big church thing. A wedding in the park can be lovely and I have been to 3 spectacular beach weddings...two at sunrise and one at dusk. The cost was minimal as everyone wore something semi dressy and the ceremony was kept short and then everyone went on to the reception which was really a large party and was the main part of the day. Pass out a disposable camera to each guest and ask them to take pics of the day. Also have someone 'official' who can take nicer pics of the actual ceremony with a digital camera. There is usually someone in the family with a camera and the will to use it. Decide on things one at a time and mark them off your list as you complete them and that way you can stick to a budget easily. Invitations can be printed out on a computer and sent out yourself. You might also find someone in your family who may do the invitations for you or even instead of a wedding gift. Your family is your best way to save money. There is always someone who has a talent and is willing to help you out. Maybe a scrapbooker who can make you a wedding album, the photographer I have already mentioned, someone who can make the cake, someone who may even be able to make your dress and even the bridesmaids dresses. Ask around...you dont get if you dont ask. I wouldnt go overboard with the flowers...they die after the first day and are a big waste of money. Just have your bouquet made up or even buy a bunch of flowers you like and just wrap ribbons around the stems. It is only for an hour after all and it will look just as good. Or buy silk flowers that you can make into a bouquet and it will last forever. Do not have an open bar at the reception...it costs a fortune. Have a breakfast buffet or a luncheon and just have 'champagne' with the toasts and speeches. Dont bother with wedding favours either. Lets face it who really cares about getting a little bottle of bubble blowing mixture or a horseshoe or whatever crud you never use and it just wastes money. Have a celebrant instead of a church wedding which costs quite a bit of money. Make sure you visit the celebrant and make sure they know what you want. The first celebrant liked to write the ceremony and was not happy when I told him I wanted to write my own vows so I got myself another celebrant. Make sure you go through the whole ceremony with them. You might be surprised how many arent happy about certain things you might like such as your children being involved or your mother walking you down the aisle instead of your father. So not their business but best to know before the day so you can change as we did. Dont be pushed into having a lot of bridesmaids etc. SAY NO. If not you will be having every female child from both sides of the family up to and including your husband to be's nephew's girlfriend's sister's boyfriend's niece if you get what I mean. Chose two or three and stick with it. Do not Have children under 5 at the ceremony or reception. They are quite disruptive and nobody can really have a good time if their are children screaming and runniing around. I said under 5 because I am assuming yours are older. Sorry if I was mistaken. I would have said no children at all but I noticed you had them. There is a time and a place for children...weddings arent really the place. And if you have it catered they will charge for each child and they dont eat anything so it is another waste. Yes I know I'm a tightwad...lol But that is what you asked for. Just have fun...dont get bent out of shape about 1 day. Make the rest of your life the focus and have a lovely life.|`|yv4v5dKJaa	I would highly recommend signing up on www.theknot.com!    They give you a time-line, there's a budget calculator, and you can even type in a guest list, etc...and make your own "wedding website"- all for free!  If you've picked a date, they can tell you what you need to be thinking about starting NOW!  If you're having a smaller wedding, you'll be able to check off a lot of stuff rather quickly.  The only setback is that the recommendations on their website- like for reception sites, etc.. are WAY overpriced, so you'll have to get creative on that one!  Ask around as to what other people in your area did for receptions. Fire Halls are always cheaper, and you can really make them your own with home-made decorations/pretty bundles of balloons in the colors you choose...look into those type of options if you want a cheaper reception!      I am planning a wedding from India right now, and it is super helpful to have lots of wedding websites online! Good luck!|`|GTvyBTGyaa	does he want to get married? all i hear is what you want.  just be careful

He moved away and stopped talking to her. Six months later, he shows up at her work and expects her to still be his girlfriend. She basically told him off (she had a new bf by that time) but was really upset and always felt like she needed closure. All I can say is that he was a looser boyfriend from the very beginning and cheated on her more than once. More than likely he is egotistical and thinks he can have any woman he wants. He is a complete bastard in my opinion!   Don't give him the time of day.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	Because his other girlfriend probably dumped him. I know that I'm probably assuming a lot, but that sounds like the only logical answer. I wouldn't trust him. I've been through something like this before.

Personally, I've stopped trying so hard & am just my myself nowadays, & like I said we've now become 'bestest best friends'!

NUU1dJ8iaa	Hmm. I'm 13 and I like someone too. And sometimes I think that happens to me too. (Except for the high fiving me part).  But I'm not sure. Anyway, give him a smile now and then, but make sure not to be too needy. Try talking to him, and don't be too boyish (cause then he might like you as a friend) and don't be too flirty (no one wants that). And one thing that's really important is just be yourself. Show him who you really are, and maybe he'll like you for who you are. :) Oh and don't hope TOO much cause you might get your heart broken. I'm not saying that you can't hope at all or that he doesn't like you or anything. Just don't be so hopeful that something is going to happen (it might, it might not, who knows. again, nothing wrong with that). Okay? :)  Sorry if there's any mistake in my writing. I don't really check.

(:|`|31e85e9ac811c5446c651b02e557f1deaa	Maybe he's just infatuated with you... but don't get too hasty. Know him better and analyze he's moves further...    A guy who likes a girl would like to know her better and wants to be with her all the time. If he talks to you occasionally then your not his type or he treats you just like a friend.    And the looking/starring kinda thing... He really must have a crush on you.  Boys really love to look at their crush anytime they have a chance.

Good Luck|`|Ei5tl9UAaa	Yes its true not all Men cheat. But you have to be realistic about these things people make mistakes. Now it depends if this was only that 1 time. Or if this was a consistent thing. From what it looks like to me this only happened one from what you know. How did you find out? did he tell you? If he told you that changes everything it shows remorse. Many men would cheat and not say anything at all. Obviously, if he was honest it doesnt take back what he did. But dont we beleive that Forgiveness sometimes is important? And that honesty counts for something. He might be worth another chance but it really does depend on the circumstances. You must factor in all of these things and make a decision. Good Luck.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	It shows he has no respect for you....and you need that in a relationship.

VIULZ4Psaa	Well if the baby is still a egg then you can choose the abortion. But if you don't want to, then ask the Dr how to plant the baby in a host mother like artificial insemination. Find a way to get a married couple who can't have kids to rase the child so you know both the child and the couple will be happy. Do you know some women are egg donors? Get her to go to a school away from her family and in secret you can both choose what to do for her, you, and the baby. She won't lose her respect of her family for the absence of that year. You won't loose your wife. And the baby will have a good mom and dad. After its all over you both need to stay away from each other and ask for forgiveness. Don't loose control again.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Better learn to control yourself, and keep it in your pants.

(f.ex. try to find a lutheran or anglican church)  - let Jesus Christ change your life, and admit you did a mistake for him.  - advice the girl to keep her child. Abortion can also be harmful, even for the woman.  - share the truth with your wife, after you talked to a pastor/priest and make sure you have friends around you the day you tell her.  - fight for your wife  - be as much a friend, as much honest, and as much open as you can be to you wife - so she will get a chance to trust you and stick with you    Forgive me for writing so frankly with you.

10b31d7109a360752e8863b0bf89ca6faa	Well, you currently have very little control or say-so in the relationship. Tell him that you want some spending money of your own and your going to get a job. See how her reacts to that. If he seems only interested in what to do with his daughter while you'd be at work or some such, then he's very focused on the service you are providing him rather than the relationship.    However, if he's OK with that, then by all means do it. It sounds like your suffering from a bit of stir-crazy from being around the house all the time. If it seems like an opportunity for a good discussion, bring up that your not satisfied with the status quo. Don't make it all about money, or he may think your after only that! Tell him you want to have some personal freedom to do things and buy things and that getting a job is a way to do that, etc.    Good Luck|`|dfa15239800ae4ef42475d3aee99ac90aa	Sounds like life to me.

ed908d62d6db18cc9e72610af95f2855aa	Yes, guys r yuck sumtimes.    I think women are given more social training, and social training is considered to be more important for women.    Also, women are on average more involved in child raising; which is a compassion  and considerations building constant exercise - making them more mature and socially intelligent.    Boys can be at moody extremes because they are sometimes less trained to ideal, interpret, and deal with there emotions.|`|437e7ffaf9b0c1e5917dbb71b63c6fedaa	Please do not generalize the idea. Some other guys are like that but some are not,though. You can say that girls are senstive and emotional because girls are really like that...some girls are so weak to control their emotions. Weak to hide the pain. In other words, girls are expressive. You can also say that boys dont know to understand because some boys are afraid to show their feelings. Because boys think that they are tough on the outside and ready to defend their loved ones but the truth is...they are just sensitive at heart. They are just hiding it..and for boys,it is such a secret place...the land of tears.|`|665727c4a4712e83fe39fd701d1e0b4baa	i hope they change one day so that they can express their feelings and be senstive.

a5a234cfc70feb5d8fb9a99eec0e0a0eaa	Things like this is getting more and more common today. sometime its really hard to believe that someone who we have been with all this year is doing that to us.  I know exactly how you feel. It happen to me just six months ago, I found streaming sms to her boss which she forgot to delect and confronted her. she told me its over and she will be be truthfull and do a good payback.  But when thing like this happens, may be love is still there but trust is definitely gone for ever. Try to talk real serious talk with her, pour thing out to her if you still love her and the kid. Since she came up to you and told you about the affair herself, tell her that you would like to know what she is going to do from now on, and make your decision based on that. be gentle, and honest to yourself.  One very important thing, after your discussion, if you decide to stay on together, forgive and forget, I know the forget part is difficult, but try, if possible, persuade her to find new jobs and pray. I pray that all will end up well for you. For you happiness and for your kid. of course, for her as well. God Bless|`|AA11780989	That doesn't sound good.  sorry.

If she starts turning the blam around on you then she is doing it.If you are not happy and she isn't happy then ya'll to separate.I know ya'll have a child together but trust me it will be better for the child if ya'll separate.No child needs to see his/her parents fighting or not happy together b/c it will only hurt him in the long run.hope everything works out for you.|`|7c5c27ac0e325a2c52b4acf7fd005267aa	whether or not she is having an affair is hard to say, but the fact that it upsets you so much is a big problem in itself. Let her know that you aren't comfortable with her having any type of contact with this other man and if there is nothing going on, she wont have a problem cutting all ties. If she puts up a fight, your suspicions could be correct and you may need to do a bit of "watching" to see what's going on. You may be a bit insecure also, and this will add to your anxiety about her talking to him. Just be up front about it all and let her know it hurts you to have her communicate with an ex. Best of luck

I don't think so, you just have to go with it.|`|2abf16ccc49f55e8dc58852badcde3d9aa	Well, first off, the answer to this question cant be the same for everybody. This question, and the practical way in which its asked makes me wonder if you're extremely young. No one is ever "ready" to get married. Have you heard the saying "Life happens when you're busy making other plans"? Thats my fav quote of all time, cuz it speaks such truth with such volume. Life is not a boared game that you just move your game piece according to a set of rules, but rather its just the roll of the dice. Dont just deceide to do something like that in life, you need to listen to every single intuitive feeling you have. Come to God he's the ultimate guide in life. This is really too complex to answer...Might as well be, whats the meaning of life? lol. But I tried.|`|AA10408696	I dont know if anyone is ready for marriage,, but I would suggest living together before tying the knot|`|AA11512024	If you are REALLY ready to love unconditionally, trust, commit to, be honest no matter what, and work through anything with the other person. Talk about your feelings concerning having children. It's also important to have the same kinds of beliefs and values, especially if you will have children together. You should talk about what you will accept and won't in order to stay in the relationship.|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	actually it is very difficult to know! I asked my friends around and they have various reasons for doing so     a) they can't bear not to see each other every day. (co-habiting is never an option for her and her bf)  b) it's another stage of life for another friend and her bf who had been dating for 7yrs.  c) pregnant and with no choice    I would not suggest any one of the above. Just follow your heart and ask yourself are you willing to sacrfrice a lot of things of your own to accommodate another person in your life. If yes is your answer, then go ahead!|`|dc8d0d26e59efafa8c6edf6449ac43adaa	When you quit finding Questions like this to stall with|`|be1ae451efaceeb996e82dbf3ee9077daa	I realize that I am ready to get married after a period of extended single experiences. I had plenty of female friends that were all good for one thing or another, and it was great for the time being. But one day I noticed that when I went home I still felt lonely. Then I came across a woman that peaked my interests. She made me want to go for the better things in life that I never thought I could accomplish. Everything matters to me about her. What she thinks and feels. She makes me a better person with her in my life and I strive for the best. I decided that I want to marry her and told her how I felt. I love her so much that I would sacrifice my own happiness to ensure hers. That is how I know I am ready.|`|AA11327991	You probably can never really be ready to get married.

Dreams are those funny things that can have many different interpretations. Some believe its just random neurons firing off in your brain while others feel its fate telling you something. If I were you, I'd keep my dream to myself. If you two are meant to get together, it will happen. Guys aren't that hard to read. If he likes you, he will tell you in subtle ways. Just keep your cool. The reason I say this is cause teenage guys can be really cruel.

f8d4cae714307a0a3164daf34a9bd1f1aa	Don't freak out when I say the title of this book, but at least check it out. It's called, "The Satanic Witch" by Anton Lavey. Are you still reading this letter? Good. It really has nothing to do with witchcraft or Satanism. It is all about personality types, and how women can use them to seduce men. Check it out before you just blow off my suggestion. Although the writer is weird, his concepts actually work. But it all depends on your mind. There are parts that you must reach beyond the words to understand the true meaning. If you learn how to know what a person's personality type is, then you have secret knowledge about them. You will also know how they will think. Not telepathy, just what their outlook on something may be. (happy, optimistic, pessimistic, logical, artistic, etc...)    Try it. You may find it useful.

Aunque dices que es una barrera el idioma, ser la mejor oportunidad para que te empieces a tratar con ellos, que vean que tienes interes en aprender y en entenderlos a ellos. Acercate ms a la mam de l y  procura que vean que a ti te importa tanto tu pareja que estas dispuesta a convivir de la mejor manera con ellos. Quien quita y termines viviendo en Brasil!!. y veras que no es tan feo como lo piensas. En la parte del sexo, ahi si ni como ayudarte, pero procura que si en algun momento estan juntos los papas no se den cuenta o trata de ser discreta para que vean que estas respetando la casa donde estas viviendo por un tiempo y veras que todo va a resultar bien. Lo principal acomidete osea, ayuda en los quehaceres diarios de la casa. No se trata de que tu hagas todo, pero si que vean que tienes la disposicin de no ser una carga.

oGoWz511aa	I'm wondering how long you dated before you got married.  What you're describing often happen to people who didn't date long enough before the wedding.  If you think about it, you probably saw a lot of this in him early on.  Not really affectionate, sloppy, etc.  I suggest you and he get some counseling. If he won't go with you, go on your own.  Even if you find you can't keep your marriage together, it may help you find out what it is you need from a relationship.  Then, wait until you REALLY know someone.  REALLY find out if they can give you what you need , and want, from a committed relationship, BEFORE you commit yourself to them.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	If you want a divorce because your husband doesn't do the dishes and hates when you watch Everybody Loves Raymonds reruns, you really weren't ready to get married.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	First of all, you need to express your frustrations with him.

Don't give up!|`|4wnn2GbYaa	woah! pretty intense question on quite a light hearted site!    i dont know aht to say but hope everything works out..Sooo cliche i know!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Divroce is not the answer. You choose your husband for life, why did you choose hime, ask yourself that. Every relationship sees ups and downs and by making it through the low points it helps you become stronger. Try and get hi mto be active in new things so you can get out of old patterns and communicate. Maybe ask him to join you on a walk around the neighborhood so you guys can talk out of your normal enviroment. The imporant thing is to get onvolved by doing something together, it will help tremendously. Also, try talking to him and tell him how you feel. If this stuff doesnt work last resort is a marraige counslor. I think if you just find something with a dual intrest and do it at least weekly for a hour or so it will help.|`|fQYU96euaa	Why did you get married?

q8vILEpfaa	You should never send pics you don't want th world to see.     You are not a slut, you liked this guy so much you compromised  who you really are. don't do that for anyone. You seem like a together gal, and no you are not bad. Stick to who you are, who says that if you change your morals (thinking) for him he is going to like you?   Stick to who you are and yes it has happened to all of us. If he has a new phone and you don't have the number all he wanted was naked pictures of you and got see your panties and bra then got a new phone!    Now move on, there is some really cool guy out there for you.

RWpSVJtlaa	You should not be anything other than yourself, if she wanted to go out with somebody talkative then she should have picked someone else.....    However, if you feel you want to change then i would just ask her things (girls generally like people to listen.  And if she tells you something you should try and be like..."oh, yeah that happened to me once...")  Try and relate to her.    As far as the sexual thing, she may be inexperinced? shy? not ready for that?  But if she is just complement her - and give her a back rub!
8PvqsOt8aa	There are many reasons that people cheat, I would never cheat on my wife even thou I am not happy. I have had a few friends on line that go a little intense, but it never went anywhere. The reason that I developed the friendships is that I could not get what I needed out of my wife, so I found it somewhere else, even thou I did not look for it, it found me.     In his case he may be so unhappy on the inside that he went with the first women that showed him attention even thou he was married.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	GREAT question.     A married man basically -->> "already has a woman's approval" and because he is MARRIED, he has shown that a woman's approval is important to him.    Single men don't demonstrate that to women - for various reasons.    For relationships and marriages - women prefer men who are more interested in seeking a woman's approval.    I believe this is backwards - because women are NOT TRULY ATTRACTED to men who seek a woman's approval. But women don't always marry men they are truly attracted to.    The criteria for sex and mating . . . . is a much shorter list than the criteria for love, marriage and relationships.    Married men cheat because they are CAPABLE of wholeheartedly loving ONE woman who he GIVES and GIVES to . . . while enjoying meaningless sex from a woman who let's him "TAKE".    That's what LOVE IS -->> an overwhelming desire to GIVE.    CHEATING IS -->> and overwhelming desire to TAKE.    But women cheat (or get involved) with married men because they are a little like monkeys.     They don't let go of ONE branch . . . .   until they have a good grip on the NEXT.|`|RUTQTgCyaa	Learn this now...no relationship is ever perfect. At no point do I ever condone cheating but you never know what goes on in other peoples house. Men and women can be guilty of cheating. It's just one of those things that really can't be explained. I guess at the root of it all is weakness. Problems at home can cause people to stray because they aren't strong enough to handle them head on. Others feel that they may not get enough attention from the one they're married too and when you throw someone willing to give you all the attention that you want into the mix that makes for a bad situation. It's all about, to me, strength to turn away from temptation.|`|spkpQ2C2aa	sometimes the one thats look like they got it together is the ones that falling apart he probaly couldnt take her inside bitching he wanted something else anything but her|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I hate it when people judge others by their outside appearance!   We're all ugly in our own way  and also pretty.    Maybe your friend thought it was the perfect family, obviously it wasn't  or isn't.    People cheat for many reason.  Abuse, no longer in love, money, no sex life, unhappiness|`|91ba808e7cbaa05530f306c80d49a7f9aa	I would not cheat on my wife for any reason!

It's easy to portray or even act like a well rounded family and husband and wife but what actually happens behind closed doors is always different. Your friends mom probably is a great mom and friend, but as a wife she may be completely different from a husbands point of view and vice versa.   Sometimes when people cheat is is with someone who is the opposite of their spouse, usually they subconsiously look for traits that, when around that person make them feel different to when they're with their wife/husband. I have different friends and who've been on both sides and in every case, this is what the 'cheater' has always said when asked 'why?'. I don't know what it is... but the other person makes them feel 'different'. It is a copout excuse though I think. Having said that, marriage is sacred and if they've done this, they will end up paying for consequences in some way or another. They always do!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Not to is the best solution.

1fFn1UhEaa	From some of the people i've known.  Its because once they get married or have been for awhile the guy doesnt make them feel sexy anymore.  Or doesnt do it for them in the bedroom.      So many guys just look at their wife as just their "wife" instead of the beautiful, sexy woman that they are married too.  They dont do all the "little" things anymore to let her know that she is hot.     also guys will just "have sex" with them once they are married.  The foreplay is all gone, instead they just get on, do their business and go to sleep.  Instead of making sure she is satisfied too.  Its like they think that once they are married they dont need to keep that passion and erotic lust in the bedroom anymore.      In turn...making one of two things happen.  Either the woman loses interest in being intimate with him, not wanting to have sex.  Or she has an affair with someone that does all those things that he doesnt do anymore.    Just how i feel about it..|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I have never cheated on my husband.  However, I have cheated in the past on someone else.  When I did, it was for several reasons.  First, he was an alcoholic who complete ignored me unless it was to yell at me.  Secondly, he was an awful partner and father, and although I knew I wanted out, I was too afraid that I couldn't make it on my own financially to leave.  And lastly, because he was constantly accusing me of it (even before I had ever been unfaithful), and finally I just decided if I was gonna serve the time, I may as well do the crime.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Here are the top 10 reasons why women cheat       1)--Not enough sex  2)--Being the bad girl  3)--Self-esteem  4)--Revenge/payback for past wrongs  5)--Lack of intimacy  6)--Feeling neglect  7)--Your emotional withdrawal  8)--Feeling/ignored/underappreciated  9)--Revenge for your cheating  10)---Boredom|`|UPfL37kaaa	maybe if they're unhappy in the relationship, but still care and love their partner.        good luck on your paper, by the way :)|`|L44LBa2Xaa	Maybe it's the same reasons why men cheat.  Maybe women cheat because they're not happy in the relationship because the guy doesn't seem to care or they argue so much, she can't take it any longer but can't leave him.  Maybe they cheat because they want more attention because their boyfriend/husband isn't giving them as much attention as they want.  So they go off finding different men to full fill their desire.  Or because they want to get back at their boyfriends/husband for them cheating on them in the first place.    There's many reason why people cheat on others.  They aren't happy, unsatisfied, revenge, can't be committed for a long period of time and need some changes, not happy with their looks, they been hurt in the past, the list can continue.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	Honestly, I got married and I was looking everywhere for my husband. I could not find him. He stopped coming home, he did not call for weeks,months? It was a long time. He finally calls and says he will be here to pick me up and take me somewhere. He never shows up. He calls back a week later and tells me he is on his way home and wants to ride out to the beach for the weekend and stay til' Monday instead of staying at home. I have not heard or seen him since. I guess maybe if someone would be doing that sort of stuff, then a woman would go out and see whatelse might be out there for herself assuming her husband has done the same. I did, but I never met someone else I would want to spend forever with again. I hope that helps.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	same as men.|`|vM5f3WwNaa	to make the man suffer, to try to make him feel what she feels when she is cheated on. it backfires alot.

Because it's TRUE.|`|UQlfW4sAaa	For the same reason(s) men cheat. Either they are doing it bc they are not having their sexual needs gratified at home, or to get even because they think their husbands cheated on them. Either way, it is not a good situation although sometimes, it is an unavoidable one.     Then there is the nymphomaniac who just cannot help herself. Hubby goes on a 2 day business trip and she's bangin the guy next door just because she needs it.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	i would say its because the person its not satisfied with their partner.  a man should never stop telling his wife she is beutiful.  man sometimes treat us like crap and sometimes we cant get over it, and we want to get them back.  or we might want attention, or maybe the couple dont spend much time together. or the female has to try to keep herself looking pretty for her man and the man has to do the same for his wife...  i think a woman that cheats always has a good reason . i mean we women are more loyal than guys. and guys cheat because they feel like it..|`|MPBRAgMIaa	I dont think there are any differences between men and women as to WHY they would cheat during a marriage.  The difference I feel lies in what they get out of cheating;  I think that while a man may have an affair to prove something to himself - a women is more likely to have an affair to take something for herself.    An example could be the man who cheats on his wife, simply because hes managed to "pull" a women half his age!  For the woman who cheats, its because she spends her entire time giving, to her children, husband, work, friends etc.  Cheating would be a way in which she is taking, rather than giving.

Do what feels right to you and not what a religion (that was created when adultery was punishable by death) tells you to do.|`|oxmkllnWaa	if he wanted to reconcile as a christian you had a duty to at least TRY.    and as a person you had a duty to not intentionally hurt him emotionally.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you're not a christian. you're a sinner.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	Albert Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Your marriage didn't work. You're divorced. Move on. If he's really changed his ways, you could try getting back together, but don't get your hopes up.|`|QtaPF83iaa	As a christian you probably wrong, I don't know your situation.  Me being a christian can only say I am in no place to tell you that after the fact that would only be judging I have decided to leave the judging and vengence to god.  Ask for forgiveness.  God is nerciful and graceful meaning he loves us even when we're unworthy.  Don't SULK in the sin and continue doing it if it bothers you.  It's a good way to  make yourself miserable.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	You divorced your husband, so its non of his business what you do on your own time. Since you are legally divorced, you did not commit adultery.     And about you being a Christian, this is between you and your God. If you think you've done something wrong, ask for forgiveness. Instead of blaming yourself, and thinking if you were wrong.|`|SGCLFbAHaa	well that is unfortunate...are you still with your co-worker in any relationship??  i always believe anyone can have a second change and even tho it may be hard for you which it would be for ALOT of people you should just try to maybe date him again because if he has really changed you should try to give him another chance.      if you want to talk about this more with me then you can email me at taylor.gu@yahoo.com|`|JpjSGtCnaa	You weren't insensitive to him, you were looking out for self as you should have, changed or not you owed him nothing, you divorced him and were moving on with your life, as for his heart being hurt, how did he feel when he was abusing you?  I don't think you were wrong to get yourself out of an abusive marriage, Christian or not, you're alive and that's what matters.
AA10886262	I don't know what "normal" is, but when my husband and I have a disagreement...we never insult each other...don't have to apologize.....but then again, we are older and we have learned over the years that words are a weapon that can never be withdrawn, words once spoken, can never be taken back...you can forgive, but you will never forget......    keep your mouth shut when you are mad, irritated or just out of whack........choose your words carefully|`|AA11538662	Nope, never do we fight like that. Well we barely even fight & if we do, it's me complaining about his driving or him complaining about my driving.     Mary in Camden, MI    PS~  I would not tolerate putting the other down, it's just wrong period.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Only when she gets tired of carrying me.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	It is sadly enough a part of arguing.  Put downs rather than finding a solution..  A solution is what you both want , not an argument. Always apologize for saying hurtful things and learn to talk better.  A marriage brings two together and a potential for said arguments.  However it also offers the same time to use for solutions.  Solutions mean end of arguments.  You both feel better.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Yes, we both put each other down. Lots of times when we aren't even in an argument...like he's driving crazy and I say something like "you're driving like an ___" . He might reply with something like "You're such a b____ sometimes".   When we fight we generally sling tons of insults.   We have been together 14 years. Not only is my self esteem not hurt but I have learned that insults are just peoples way of communicating displeasure and it has nothing to do with who I am inside.  I say it's totally normal and very common.  I do feel the occassional apology is needed but not always warranted.  don't give them unless I have hurt him (not easy to do) and I don't expect them unless I am hurt. Obviously, our longevity and still currently happy marriage speaks for itself.  We need to spout off, it helps us get stress out and is very productive for us. We communicate really honestly and really well.    We do not get violent or make threats towards each other.  I also will not allow myself to be called a c--nt or a tw--t. We do not yell things like "I hate you".|`|oqX0PwQiaa	When I used to fight with my ex, we fought like that all the time. I think that it is pretty common when one of you is an alcoholics.|`|oKYXC6wfaa	The worst I've ever said is "F-ck you! You're being such a f-cking @$$h013!" He deserved it. I'm not sure he's said anything like that to me.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Be careful what you say during an argument. A lot of people say hurtful things during an argument because you want to hurt the other person.  But it is not always easy to forget what is said.  Try to stay on the subject of the argument and not try getting in all the little "digs". That doesn't  help  resolve what the argument is about.  M|`|z5dN9B3Iaa	My husband and I just had this exact conversation tonight. He ALWAYS gets mean when we fight and says really hurtfull things. Sometimes it's not even in a fight but when he is just in a pissy mood. Certain things he has said I will never forget and it still remains in my mind. I even told him that there have been things that he said that I will NEVER FORGET. I can't really say mich else except for the fact that we are the perfect exampe of what you are talking about|`|hOwEGJvoaa	From your question and user name, I assume you are a woman.  Yes, it is a common trend for husbands to put down their wives.   70% of the time, they don't notice it.   They either think it is funny, or simply have no clue that their words are hurtful.   And 30% of the time, they do it on purpose.    In marriage, it is important to express your expectations and communicate to your spouse your feelings and concerns.    When I was first married, I always said this to my wife.  "You are not that fat."   Little did I know, that this words were hurtful to her, but if she didn't express her concerns, I would have never realized that.  Here I thought, I was paying her a compliment.   Another example:  My wife was complaining about her wieght, and I though, I will be nice, and go buy her a book about losing wieght.  Once again, I tried to be helpful, but didn't work, and once again, if she didn't educate me, I would have never known.    So, my advice.  Speak out, and say something.|`|HDFnoglFaa	not normally but it depend on how bad the argument gets, the problem is that alot of people say things in the heat of the moment that they actually mean and just blame it on anger so make sure that's not it
b3yKxCQxaa	you have a pretty good idea, or you can just act concerned and ask if he found anyone to go with yet, and maybe ask about it (like what kind of dance etc.) and at the end just say something like "sounds like fun" so he knows you would be interested in going - Good Luck :D|`|kTvn2Nltaa	just bring up the dance, and if he is still hesitant to ask, just suggest that you guys go together

KPXwwwMMaa	What you are experiencing is called marketing! When you see how many friends everyone has on myspace or facebook, you are supposed to say to yourself "Wow! It looks like a big party on there! I think i'll join too!"    I probably have more than a 100 'friends' on facebook, and can you guess how many i talk to on a regular basis? maybe 3.    When making friends, QUALITY is so much more important than quantity. Make good, solid friends who care about you. If you have 2 or 3 quality friends, that's worth more than 1,000 facebook friends.|`|GmTMVmASaa	some people just have lot's of people as friends, just to like brag or something. because in truth, alot of times they don't even speak to the  so called friends. i am not a my space expert, but i am a friend to lots of people and never even say boo to them. then other people are just so outgoing and friendly with magnetic personalities, that friends just flock to them.

When it comes to being involved in a relationship, honesty builds the foundation of trust.

yptfd3sIaa	Before you make plans to adopt your sister - consider this:  This state of Florida has a family-preserving initiative that works to help improve dysfunctional family circumstances rather than just tear the entire unit apart. If there's a chance your mother can get off the drugs, and become a better mother, that would be great. If she doesn't give clean living and good parenting a chance, then these people will document her negligence and unwillingness and place your sister with the nearest living and capable relative. Which could be you, theoretically. But you need to call the nearest liaison office and get yourself a job. I've provided a link below with all the offices/phone numbers in your state. Good luck!|`|iD4ejChZaa	get her away, 11 is one thing but by 13 she will like boys and that will mean big trouble. or some unscrupulous grown man will take notice that she is neglected and alone a lot, & then make his move.    my son is autistic and he gets SSI monthly,   i am the first name on his acct, and then his name, his money is direct deposited.  talk to a lawyer about you having custody of her, usually their first consultation is free.|`|AA11731307	It sounds like you should talk to an attorney.  Have you talked to your mom?  Maybe make it sound like you are doing it to help her.  Give her more free time.  Sometimes if you make up them they are more willing to give you what you want.  I hope it works out for you and your little sister, it's a lot of responsibility.  Good luck.|`|YArN7X6caa	You need to get all the evidence to prove all of what you are saying and if you can get enough evidence of this you do have a very strong case in my opinion. I would also talk to an attorney who specializes in family law and they can even direct you in the right place and direction. And for a side note i know i cant physically shake ur hand for doing what ur doing but you are so loving and so brave for this i give you a hue round of applause. You and your sister will always be bonded together through this experience. And its truely rewarding for you to have the kind of love in ur heart that you have for ur sister. A lot of people anymore really turn a blind cheek on stuff like this.
Qc2VO9G9aa	A child custody hearing is a serious matter not to be taken lightly, typically you only get one chance at this. Attempting to appeal a child custody decision is not an easy thing to do. It is best to do it right the first time by being prepared.    - Are you prepared to present your case with relevant facts and information? Knowing what is and what isn't relevant for the child custody case can either make or break things in your favour.    - Have you taken the necessary steps to guard yourself from false accusations towards you?    - Are you familiar with how the whole court process works?    -Do you know how to avoid making critical mistakes that could potentially blow your whole case?    i hope it helps a little, it's on mothers trying to win but it might help :D  you can always try to talk to someone who has been there.|`|AA11108018	You must  be able to prove that she not a fit mother and you would have go to family court to seek custody.  If she has never been charged for drug use or had CPS called on her for neglect you will have some trouble.  You go to the public defenders office see if qualify for free legal help  GOOD LUCK|`|kwYxQp0Maa	Would be difficult as you would have to prove your mother is a dirt bag for starters and even then she may not lose custody.  The best thing might be to talk to your mother and see if she will voluntarily give her up.  Unfortunately I doubt she will be willing to give up the money.|`|lsFcvd32aa	I need to know what state your in before I can help. sorry.|`|g3zYUk3raa	I can't help the situation really, all I know is that they give priority to siblings above all else, and with you're sense of care and love you're pretty set. But I want you to know that you're a hell of a person, and know that I will pray for you in this.     God bless hearts like yours.|`|20NZn1YZaa	In this instance, the welfare of your sister trumps you not wanting to hurt your mother. She's made the decision to live her life this way and not take into account you and your sister's quality of life.     You would have to go to Social Services and talk to someone about your rights. But at first, I would do it anonymously. Because you don't have a job, there is a chance they would put your sister into foster care. Ask about your rights as her sister. You may be able to take your mother to court with the help of a social aide worker, collect your sisters check to be able to take care of her, and get custody.    I wish you all the best and applaud you for being wonderful and mature a person as to inquire how to help your sister. I'm 24 and don't know if I would have had the strength at your age to do this.    Do whatever you can for you and your sister and when she's safe you can work on getting your mother the help she needs. Perhaps losing her daughter will wisen her up to getting clean.

This is a perfect example.  Why?    Get a tape recorder and record ALL your conversations.  Save ALL text messages and emails.    Get him to threaten you again and talk about what rumors he is going to spread about you.  Text him and ask him, Why would you spread rumors about me?  I thought we were friends.  Save all messages.  If he starts spreading rumors, you have him confessing and can prove what a jerk he is.  If the rumors are really bad and are meant to hurt you, you can go to someone in authority to stop it.  You have the proof that he intended to do it and did it.    Don't piss him off - try to keep him close so you can keep an eye on him and what he is doing.
XGZBEdAWaa	Yes your right! If this guy was really into you he wouldn't need to have  a night with multiple partners, or have you pimp for him!

If your relationship was more like a booty call, then I'm betting he just thinks you're hot stuff. I don't think he really "loves" you, because if he did, he would probably respect your wishes and boundary lines. He might be just saying that to play on your emotions.  And yes, I think you should get those wild hairs out. Those wild hairs have no place in a serious relationship.|`|EjID9iWyaa	What about used don't you understand.  Ex boyfriends who haven't been around for a while and come back saying they want you to arrange a threesome aren't back because they love you.

If you are very attractive/good looking and mysterious, most girls think those types of guys are very picky when it comes to how girls act. They're probably afraid to make the first move, thinking that they might screw it up & you might think they're a little weird. Then again, most girls are like that with most guys. Don't worry about being intimidating, I'm sure girls would love to socialize with you, but are a little unprepared on what to say to you. Maybe get the conversation going and make sure that they can be comfortable with you and it's not big deal (= Good luck!|`|ZVqOvtf4aa	hmm send a picture :)    heyletstalk@ymail.com|`|4dXcZhuTaa	actually my love, most girls just want the guy to approach them in general, intimidated or not.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	well if your not like out there or talk to much then yea it is a lil intimidating but you should lightin up a lil talk more if you dont! lol but yea you can send me a pic if you want my email is uniqueknight21@yahoo.com

It was very sweet because he's not really the romantic type.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	My husband proposed to me in front of the church we got married in.|`|i27Kmimlaa	During baseball season, my boyfriend and me go to the Dodgers games and I know this is cheesy but I kinda want him to propose to me there on the Big Screen, it happens every other game and I secretly envy those girls getting engaged|`|QSodlfMraa	we just decided that we want to get married, we were laying on the bed, and it came to both our mind at the same time.
yptfd3sIaa	First of all: legally you don't have to go. He cannot legally compel you to visit if you're over 14, court order or not. But this isn't all about the law. It's about feelings, right?    Does he know how you feel about his wife and your half (or step) brother? Would you be more interested in seeing him if it were one-on-one? Like, if he took you out to dinner or for an outing once a week, then would you be interested? If so, let him know that you would like to focus on time with him for now, and maybe come for longer visits later. If he's reasonable, he'll understand and gladly take you up on your offer.|`|n53HeORBaa	well if it court ordered then you have no choice but to follow that or your mom might get in trouble, can you talk this things out with your dad, you just said that you don't feel like going there, did you give him specifics, i think you should maybe doesn't know that you are uncomfortable with their living situation so just tell him and hopefully some things would get adjusted|`|K8OjmMUAaa	It's not wrong of you to not feel like going down there to visit your Dad. It's pretty selfish of you to deny him being with his son just because you don't feel like it and his wife and stepson are annoying, though.     Right now you have no idea what it's like to have a child not live with you. It's really hard, and it really hurts when said child doesn't want to spend time with you. It's not the same for him as it is for you; there are probably plenty of times that he "doesn't feel like" dealing with another person in his house, and I'm sure there are are times when he would rather buy something for himself than spend money on you, but he does these things anyway because he loves you. And yet here you are, denying him spending time with his child just for some petty reasons? Come on.    Your Dad doesn't sound like a jerk to me. Sounds like he really wants to spend time with his kid. I mean this in the nicest possible way, but you really need to be a little more adult about spending time with him. Just ask any of your friends whose fathers don't want to see them, or whose fathers have died.|`|5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	just go this time, but when you get there explain to him aout yout problem|`|ac4ad5d82c9dd155c5c01047517cebc0aa	If you feel that you don't want to go down there then tell your mom. You are of course right. If you don't want to do something you MUST talk it out with your parents. hopefully your  mom will make the right choice!!|`|zka26204aa	Just tell him that you would like to reduce the number of days you go there, because you have activities with your school and friends that you are missing.  Ask if it would be okay if you only visited every other Sat. and Sunday, so that you would not miss out on the football games and be able to make plans with your friends more often.  Tell him that you feel left out because you can't do things with your friends as much.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	hmm well, have you talked to your own mother about not feeling comfortable about going to see your father and his new family?    i think since you are under 18, you have to-unless you have legal reason not wanting to go-and legal reason does not mean that they are annoying.    talk to your mother. good luck!|`|bcVxMHy5aa	You have every right to deny visitations. Let your mom know how you feel. She can have a talk with your dad. I for one wouldnt go if my dad was like that.|`|XmL3RhhYaa	well if you are unhappy down there then you should try to get less days that you go to your dads house and see if you still feel the same way....  i have a lot of friends who feel like that, so no its not wrong of you, he is just afraid of losing you|`|w3w5RMbBaa	This is a tough situation.  Just like you my parents are divorced and I don't get to see my dad much at all so your lucky to have that choice. If you don't like going to his house maybe arrange to go out for dinner for an hour or something different tell him you don't like the choices he made with his wife and that it is your opinion. If he wants to still see you he will understand|`|FUtcuFmjaa	I think it is at 14 in which the child has more of the say in visitation.  I would have your mom talk to the courts and let them know that you don't want to go down there.  Maybe hire a lawyer or have another trial to get the visitation rules changed.  Until the rules are changed you might want to hold to them so that it doesn't reflect off of your mom.  At any rate you are 16 and I know to the courts you are old enough to make a decision in the visitation.  Let your dad know money is paper and your feelings should mean more to him than paper. Yes fatherly relationships are important but there is a point in life where parents have to understand that you are not a little kid anymore, you have your own views and wants. Try to keep it cool with your dad maybe a heart to heart talk would change some things.  Stay calm and explain the situation inside your head.  Show him that you are growing up by being as mature as possible. But, make sure to get it handled threw the courts ASAP cause until you are 18 you are under your parents rules. You don't want your dad to make your life any more difficult  then it is. You also don't want your mom to get in trouble threw the courts for not making you go. Good luck! Hope this helps. =)
Fi8AIi4baa	Yes.  Most of the cons are just in your head; at least the ones that matter.
mHZvOhsDaa	yeah i feel the same when meeting a new girl..    but once you think about it.. you almost WANT to send her the signals :)    but try myspace? or something..    on myspace you can be like  hey r u _______ who sits pretty close to me? she says yes, than you go from their.. and soon you will be good friends :)      help me out?|`|NEEVRp16aa	Start with small talk and don't be pushy about it.  Sit back and see what happens....let the signs guide you.  Have faith.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	start talking to her casually first, or you might creep her out|`|nJ8N5PJMaa	sit next to her and ask about homework from a class that you have  she will say that she doesnt have that class and you can talk to her about her classes and teachers and then go on to other subjects  why dont you want to send her signs that you like her when you do?|`|CYW1wF1Uaa	Just be yourself m8 at lunch time have a laugh with her and her mates|`|EBS8bjAwaa	well if you like her then you should send some small signs that you like her. try to just say hey or something and become friends. maybe she likes you too and is in the same issue.|`|3XKUUf1paa	well... this is pretty hard but you can do it. First try to sit like across from her or next to her. If she brings up some interested subject, like "omg, anyone read this book yet? or have seen this movie before or do this or that?" you respond with something and tell not only her but whoever around you the story so that everyone pay attention to you. Moreover you can like buy candy/chips or whatever junk food and ask if your friends want any. She might want some too, you never know and there you go. start that conversation. good luck .

tmhapTvIaa	the best advice i could give is to ignore him and find someone else.  it sounds crazy but it will usually work.  most guys(if not all) like a challenge.  i'm not sayin u were bein too easy or nething but make him work a lil bit for ur attention.  don't let him know you are talkin to other ppl jus let him find out from someone else or the fact that u aren't talkin to him as much anymore.  trust me, it will work.  if not, it is ur best hope.  showing him affection has stopped working so give this a shot.  think about it.  when u found out he was with ur friend, u probably wanted him even more.  if this is true, follow my advice and let me know how it works out for u

You only live once!!!|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	he obviously has feelings for you, but you dont for him.     thats fine. and the reason hes ascting like a jerk is because you hurt him. he clearly thought yu guys were together, then what you said let him know his place, and he wasnt comfortable with it. he wants waaay more.
SlizbMMVaa	You have been friends for two and a half years.  That is really how long your relationship is.  Saying I love after that long is not too soon.  He is not some stranger you met off the street.  Just make sure you take the rest of the relationship at a comfortable speed for both of you.  No need to rush it now.  Enjoy yourselves!  Have fun!|`|wBxXGASgaa	nah true love girl
f3SyOyMEaa	I'm compatible with most of my friends. There are a couple of them that I argue with a lot, we have different lifestyles, beliefs, etc...but we couldn't do without each other. I don't know if that's compatibility or not! We just accept each other for who we are, and have been friends for years. My very best friend I want to beat on a daily basis, but I love her to death.  I don't know if I just answered that question or not...|`|CWkMRMwxaa	well think about it.  you are friends with people who you mesh well with.  you mesh well because you're compatible.      compatibility fits many contexts.|`|h1XcYcJ7aa	Yes. That is pretty much the Definition of friendship. People who have like beliefs and values. Friends are people who care about one another and are concerned about their friends. Someone that you could call 24/7 and they wouldn't think a thing about it. A friend is someone you haven't talked to for years and when you do you are still on the same page as if it was yesterday. A friend is someone who lights up your life through the ups and downs of life. Unless you mesh with a person can you really call them a friend. You are people of like mind and would leave a hole in you "mesh" if they weren't there.|`|6nrLRKmeaa	I think I am compatible with them as friends, but it takes just a little bit more to be completely compatible with them as far as having them as a life partner goes|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Yes. If you look around, the best marriages are between friends. Not only are they lovers but they are friends and enjoy spending time with each other.
JD57vHYYaa	Thats not changing your personality thats being more outgoing. Talk to people and once you make friends you feel comfortable and become more outgoing naturally.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	If you need to change your personality for people to be friends then it will be just fake cuz that isnt the real you. Just be your self.|`|UwrVK72aaa	You are who you are for a reason. Use your life experience and be careful who you allow in your life. You can be friends with somebody for a long time without actually "letting them in" to your inner thoughts.   Once you truly know you can trust them then open up.|`|6kAAj8hUaa	get over it and just start being friendly to people.|`|fLASTynLaa	change your habits and get out of your comfort zone.|`|BitAsc8daa	You have no idea how much I can relate - it's almost like i wrote that question!    Basically, I beat my introverted personality - even though that was who i was for the past 19 years.    Some was from bullying, and partly becos of my parents being shy aswell.    Pretty much you just HAVE to get out of your comfort zone and strike up a conversation with people.  Not talking to someone gives the impression that you don't want to - and who wants to be friends with someone like that?    If you really want this, you will get it.  But its not easy, and it will probably take around a year of getting out there and talking to people.    This sounds bad, but if ur old enough to drink maybe just get drunk at the uni bar or out on the town one night and ur confidence level will open right up :)    Or just sit next to someone in a lecture and start asking them what course they're doing and where they're from... if they go clubbing much... where they live... what school did they go to etc etc etc    It's all very repetitive when you make friends.. there's no special magic.  Just conversation and questions to get to know them.  Act interested in them and they will respond better and think of you as a potential friend.  Then every time you see them after your first meeting, you can wave and say hi.  Maybe strike up another conversation about their weekend.    And there you have it!  A friend!  :)|`|kyTBaYFlaa	you should try getting involved with some kind of club. you don't mention your interests but whatever they are they are bound to have a club of some sort either through school or in the community at large.    take up a hobby that gets you interacting with other people.    if you want to meet women learning how to dance can be very helpful    you can change your personality but it doesn't happen overnight, continue trying to grow by learning new skills and trying new things     when you enter the workplace you will continue to grow and develop more confidence, as you gain experience you will find newer employees coming to you for assistance and will develop leadership skills    in 10 years you could be in a supervisory role at work, invited to all the parties, dancing with all the girls, riding a harley on the weekend and playing in a band. you might be wondering why you didn't do these things earlier in life. but everything is a process and takes time. some things come easy to some or at least they seem to. the more people you get to know you will come to find out that most of the "cool" people have a lot of problems that you never knew about. you may find out that your are pretty popular yourself.    if you have some friends who don't ever go anywhere or do anything and maybe you all just hang out and watch tv or whatever try to break free of that rut, you can stay friends with them but try not to spend too much time with people like that as they may be perfectly happy but you will not be happy like that|`|CWkMRMwxaa	join clubs.  you'll prolly open up more easily around ppl who share similar interests.|`|mG7VZd5baa	condition yourself|`|LLbOdAqjaa	I think you should take a personality test..    try the Myers-Brigg inventory I am sure you can google it online and find a test you can take and grade yourself and that will show you what kind of personality you really have.    And if you want to change your personality you might also need to change your outlook on life..  .. this always works for me.. if iam feeling depressed ... I give myself a mini makeover to give myself a change..    Also try to hang out with people who are really positive..   try going out to clubs that way when you dance you'll feel liberated     Overall I think you just need change.. change in lifestyle, new look, new hair.. do what your budget allows you.. and people will notice you and will automatically start new conversations about your new look and i guess you can start from there.|`|Pq48dNPUaa	I used to be the same way, if your known for being quiet, just say a few things at the right moment, like a joke when it's appropriate, eventually people will start talking to you and just start talking with them. Eventually the ball starts rolling from there|`|f0a6469eba16ebb4a30fd70ee09d1ebdaa	had this problem all through high school, ya know what you need to come to realize that your just as good as any other person.  If someone trys to bully you just keep the attitude saying whatever.|`|siRilMZ2aa	the same thing happend to me.....and iv been working on becomeing more out going by just making myself talk to new ppl. Start out by just makeing small talk and eventually it will get easier.

Also i agree with the club idea, that will help too.  good luck!
M5oMYc9Laa	I am sorry you are going through such a terrible time.  I feel for you because I went through the same thing with my own sister over a ten year time period while I and my son, only five years old at the time were sole caregivers for my mom following a massive stroke.      I don't know if your sister has always treated you this way but part of her hostility is actually based on fear and grief.  Next, it is also partly based on her own selfishness and guilt.  She now feels obligated to "help out" but ultimately she wants no part of the true responsibility. She doesn't know how else to deal with her feelings so its easier to take things out on you. Since she is calling them "these people" it is clear that she has some measure of contempt for them. No doubt anger with them with she is directing at you for needing to be cared for which is inconveniencing her.    Unfortunately, there is no easy solution.  I think you would be better off if you told her if she is going to come around and be abusive and obnoxious the best thing for her to do is to stay away and let you take care of things.  It's probably not the way you would like for things to go but that is better than putting up with constant abuse.    Good luck to you.|`|yYg4gKwxaa	This is complicated because she is also dealing with the family problem your family has, but then again she's far. There are family members that wants to help but they don't because taking care of the elderly is not the funnest thing to do. Maybe if she shows her weakness to you, it may affect you i guess negatively? i'm not sure. But she's one of those people that are there, but not really because of the circumstances of distance and stress. You should be stronger and not need your sister to assure you of anything (she hasn't been doing that anyway). I guess just cherish the days that you're with you parents becasue that's what she is missing out on. Also, at least your sister is there even though is seems like a snotty person.|`|WTiMxoxFaa	ur in the same boat as me my anti christ sister cut me off from seein my nieces cause she needs serious help|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	Remember that while it may bother you she's cold, it's really up to her what she does so you can really only worry about yourself. If she don't talk to you, then that's it.
mJPYhoDQaa	You say you know how too make your self happy, well do it!...Now!|`|44QPXU5eaa	I am 21yrs old and in a smiliar situation but i did not marry him. We were together for nearly 3 years. I relied on him for everything and thought i needed him to be happy. I didnt have a social life because i pushed everyone away for him, had no money (i got fired from my job and was hard to find another), lived in a house all by myself that his parents owned so i felt trapped ALL the time. Whatever i did or said was heard and pasted on. I seriously thought i was happy with him and when (out of anger) i broke up with him, i realised i was never happy. He went behind my back and texted, sent photos, emailed, called other girls (including his cousins girlfriend and my younger sister). I thought i would never be happy, stuck in the one place, never have a life, blah blah blah all the stuff you are feeling but you have to remember you are only young. I always worried about what my loved ones thought and everyone else thought but I got to a point where i thought that if they loved me they will love me no matter what.    You only have one life to live so do not waste it being unhappy. If you are not happy with your husband then get rid of him. Start doing stuff for yourself to make yourself happy because no one else will|`|AA11391968	Just remember;  wherever you go, there you are.  Don't depend on others for your happiness.  Try getting a part-time job, or take some classes and meet some friends.  You can always go visit your family.  You do not need to live like a recluse.  If it's really affecting your ability to get a job or feel happy, then you may want to see a therapist before you become too depressed.  Talk to your husband, tell him how you feel.  I hope he is your friend too.|`|SL4eEoCNaa	Girl - The most important part of being happy is being happy inside.  We too often look at the external instead of looking within.  That leads us to the tragedy of changing jobs, houses, spouses, possessions, locations, etc.  only to find that wherever we go that person inside goes with us.      Changes may distract you for  a little while and you may tell yourself you are happier but then the inner you catches up to the changes and its the same old thing.      We restart the cycle and blame it on our new spouse, relatives, friends, location, jobs, etc and off we go on the merry-go-round again.      Work on realizing your inner potential and inner joy.  This may mean a spiritual awakening or simply a change of attitude.  It may mean counseling to help you face issues that have not been dealt with.      The main thing is be very careful before you make external changes that can actually delay dealing with the real issues.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	the only wrong thing you can do is do nothing, you need a change obviously, so make one, it doesnt have to be drastic right away, get a job, so you're not sitting at home all day doing nothing, and having a simple little job will also give you human interaction and you'll probably make some new friends. Get a divorce, you are way too young to be stuck in an unhappy  marriage, esspecially with no kids this is supposed to be the prime of your life. Take control, sure you might fail, but is it worth never knowing? you can go to school, date frivilously, and just take advantage of the fact that you're young, healthy and have soo much that you can achieve, stop depending on other people to give you happiness and take charge.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Problem: You have defined yourself by the people around you.

I don't know if you exercise but you may want to start or pick up the pace. You also need to get to a Dr. and discuss the negative/hopeless feelings you have. You should also have a social life. Since you do not have any children to help you connect with other married women, you may need to get more creative or perhaps get a job so that you have an accomplishment and social contact. I was a lot like you at your age (had my 1st baby at 22) but I was really happy. Looking back though, I do think having a job and people to see more often would have been a lot more healthy/gratifying. I also often feel I went from being provided for at home to being provided for by my husband. I cannot support myself and it's not really something I am proud of. I have never lived alone and while I love my husband more than anything, my identity is solely reliant on my status as wife/mother. Having lots of friends and activities these days I do feel a lot more complete and like more of an individual.  You are not alone, many 20 somethings are in the same boat, you need to  find ways to cope and you should be happy inside and out.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    You have to make your own space. You have to Learn to say NO. Luxuries don't make any one happy. You should have piece of mind.  One becomes unhappy when you don't get what you expect. Lower you expectations from others and you will be happy. Be Brave go ahead you say you know how to become happy, Don't be afraid|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well first of realize you will never be "perfect". No one is. You make your own happiness and cannot expect anyone to do that for you. You have to do that on your own. I think you are awfully young to be settled down and expecially if you feel this way. Are you not working? Are you not getting out of the house to live your own life too during the day? Is your Husband much older than you? What does he think? Have you talked to him about how you have been feeling? We all go thru times in our lives where we start to evaluate ourselves and the way we are living.      I suggest sitting down and being honest with your Husband and trying to figure out ways other than material objects to make you truly happy.     Ok I saw your update. The military lifestyle is not for the weak at heart. It takes a very strong couple to make it thru a marriage like that. You are so young. You need to really talk things over.
OuQJYm4zaa	I've definitely been in your situation  and I do believe that deep down inside  something inside of you is not letting you admit  to the fact that you're attracted to this boy.  It's like it's his personality that you're falling for,  without realizing it rather than what most people  do, falling in love with someone's looks and then getting to know them.|`|CyXX3aLVaa	It sounds exactly like you think! you're either a) in denial b) really appreciate having him as a friend. Just think everything over and you don't have to admit that you like him to anyone but yourself. :)
AA12135516	If you are wanting to have sex with him then do the decent thing & break it off with your b/f instead of going behind his back after all you have been in a relationship with him for 6yrs so obviously it is a committed relationship isn't it?

Obviously he does. Im not sure what the age is for you to be having sex where ever your from, but make sure its okay to be doing it. Nothing can happen if you use the right contraceptives like condoms or the pill. Its best to use both. Now, if he says something like "we dont need a condom i can pull out," or "it doesnt feel as good with a condom trust me" hes lying, he must use a condom, for two reasons. STI's, and PREGNANCY.  If he refuses than NO sex for him, try something a little different. But with 'going down on him' you'll still need a condom to protect from diseases.    Hope i helped (:|`|z5m38gHsaa	first of all that dude would be guilty of statutory rape, meaning that even with the young lady's consent he would still be breaking the law and punishable by law.  Your parents may take revenge upon him by calling the cops and his life would be over. so be careful, but he is ultimately responsible for knowing the consequences.  he could serve 25 years for having sex with a minor.|`|d38SeAU5aa	Jail preggo stds or nothing its all your choice
j6RDbnl6aa	you don't have to have friends,  i think you should focus a little more on your grades.    now you tell me, which is more important:  being popular for four years and after high school is over being an unemployed single mother who didn't even finish school because of the low grades and FAKE friends?  or  a successful person with a few TRUE friends?|`|oGZs64FLaa	Part of growing up is learning to balance your life.  So maybe try either socializing at school and studying at home  or studying at school and socializing outside of school.  see which one works for you.    education is really important in this day and age so keep up your grades. then once you have them at a stable position, socialize all you want. that way, you'll be much more happier with yourself and you'll be able to enjoy the time you have socializing|`|8tYKGDy0aa	well u just answer ur own question school comes first.....talking to friends is not an important factor....u can talk to them on the internet or on the phone when u get home or on the weekend when theres no school at all ....ur problem is u worrie about wat ur friends think and im pretty sure those same friends that u try so hard to talk to is getting get grades so i think u should grow up get out of middle school and open up ur eyes honey u are in the 9th grade...i suspect....u have 3 more years....... by u not paying attention now..... u gonna pay for it in ur last year when the year when ur suppose to have fun but instead ur gonna be to busy tryna catch up............so i hope that advise worked|`|R0KEbgJGaa	Well for me I socialize at school, study at home.|`|j43uYuGnaa	well u can do both if u want like sometimes studie and somtimes soicals or do both like u can study for a half of the time than go out coz there both inportant but study is more inportant|`|yLTDUZIDaa	Ha ha, excuses. Wake up early to study, and hang out at school. Believe me you can find a way.|`|RNWSAItbaa	Education should come first, try and get your grades up to at least a B or an A, then once you are getting good grades, that's when you can start socializing.|`|OUtYUT8daa	hang out with people who will let you do your work.  And go for the weird wacky people! they are so much more fun to hang with :D even if you get picked on or teased. lol.    Friendships pass. I dont like saying it. but usually they do....  (Like graduating and moving away)    Keep with your wok and make mates that will help you :P|`|NCy5Oj0jaa	Here's the thing friends are important but you have to think about what's going to help in the long run and let's be honest most of the people you hang out with now will disappear after your done with high school but if you start screwing up it's going to stay with you for the rest of your life. So use your lunch to study and do your homework and make plans on the weekends and after school once in a while to socialize.|`|SFcUnJ4uaa	Easy one trust me.  In the end friends are more important, you're only 13, so you still have time for work.  Like if you fail year 8 or whatever its not like you wont be able to get a job.  Take it from a sad, depressed loser who lost all of his friends because he did schoolwork instead of made friends.  Make friends or you'll go crazy!|`|BEyqvqkZaa	How should I put this?    EDUCATION comes first, but it doesn't mean you can't be social.    Take time to study and finish assignments during lunch but also try to hang out with the smart people.    You'll be surprised how many cool people actually take time to study because they know that their social status won't be much to their advantage later on as opposed to education.    Also, if you just want to socialize, you should consider finishing your homework at home. Clear up your schedule because there must be a reason for why you can't finish your assignments. Make the time you need by clearing unimportant things from your plans.    Limit your out-of-school socializing in order to complete your work. After all, if you want to be social, it's worth it only to the people who you have to see everyday (in school).    At my school, we accept only the top 100 or so that apply but we also have a lot of work. I'm almost certain that the amount of work a lot of schools assign in one week is what we had to do in 2 nights!    Some of us also have to finish homework so we get to school early (around 6:30) and we have about 2 and a half hours before we get to 1st/5th period to socialize and work.    If you socialize instead of worrying about your grades, do you think you'll be popular if they hold you back a year?    Being smart is cool, unlike the typical stereotypes. Give it a try and don't stress yourself with being popular.    Note: If you want to be popular, let the popularity come to you. Otherwise, you seem desperate and it will be harder to keep a social status.|`|4wlwyhvnaa	Find a way to balance it all. Grades are important and at the same time you want to socialize and make friends. Maybe study more at home rather than on lunch. Hope this helps :o)|`|YELasZJOaa	Getting your friends to help you= education + social  ^^|`|rhreN8wbaa	why can't you stay in class one day and socialize the next?  if you can't i think you should put your schoolwork first and socialize after school until you get everything in order again. Eventually you will get back to your normal schedule.|`|qtRa9T1Naa	staying in class you can be social after you are done with education or maybe one week socialize other week do homework!|`|SRxftcuSaa	sweetie you should deff have lunch and break time with your friends...you can study in class and you have to do homework when you get home...socialize with your friends...|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Why dont you study at night at home????? Education means everything.........Enjoy school and study at home..AYour Awesome...............|`|emjxCeFZaa	I think you should try to make more friends at school and then just work a little more and harder when you get home.|`|Pq48dNPUaa	How about you do your homework...at home, then you can socialize at lunch. That way you can have you grades and eat your lunch too.|`|3EBKrVrDaa	Do your homework+study at home, and then you can socialize alot at school.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	You're very young and have plenty of time to hang out and make friends, education is something no one could ever take away from you. Remember knowledge is power.|`|IrahyL2Qaa	think of this.....in five years youll have a lot of friends, then you realize you got low grades in high school and now cant get into college, youll now be working at McDonalds the rest of you life, but hey at least you still have friends.............i think the choice is obvious|`|FdQtgdBAaa	i agree with 21 w/e u can do both and both r very important|`|7f8043a704578fc1b8d7f0f395c95c08aa	You need to do both.  Life is all about balance, no matter what age you are.  Sometimes you may need to pay more attention at school so that you can be a little more social, but the idea is to be social while still knowing when to take care of business.    If your grades are suffering now, take a while to get them back up and then have fun again.      Trust me, if you figure it out now, it will help you for many years to come.  Best of luck!|`|60GmMBr7aa	both take two or one days out of the week to stay in and study and the rest to socialize and also socialize in the halls get in trouble and make some friends in detention jk!|`|J2myCXE5aa	well for me when i was in high school i was VERY social.     i ended up graduating and went to collage and i still don't have **** however im very smart so do both.   you can do it.|`|ia2oWu18aa	study at home n care abt ur grades not frens.....|`|ay2ksWhsaa	you should socialize at lunch, If you become anti social you wont enjoy your life, no matter what grades you get, i did homework at lunch thing.  I wasnt happy.  Now I am much more socialand much happier, do your homework at home after school, socialize at lunch unless you have a test after lunch.|`|BZBEmaAwaa	Be social, make friends. Friends will help you with your homework.|`|9RS0xXhraa	you should insist on socializing as it will help you find out the views and thoughts of others not only on you but also on studies.you will definitely learn something how to deal with your studies.And leave the rest for home.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	I say socialize high school is nothing with out friends to have fun with. But you do need to get good grades. You should see if they have any type of after school tutoring available at you school and it they do then  study after school and that should help you out with grades.|`|31fDBuLjaa	If staying in class will help you improve your grades, stay in class.     Socializing at lunch is lame, and with rare exceptions a complete waste of time.    Then again, sometimes you need to get out in the fresh air for 30 minutes or so, you don't wanna be cooped up inside all day.|`|paHjJrrdaa	Friends come and go.  If these people can't support you in wanting to do better in school then they are not your friends.  If they are, then have them hang out with you and help you!  Education stays with you forever, not all friends do.
SlizbMMVaa	Lets face it we all play roles in this life.  And doing the car work is something most men love to do... Now we women know how to do most things, but really... if its going to make him feel better and all manly, which by the way can be a real turn on, then by all means... Check that oil... fill the water... Also, usually when I head to my car, all I really want to do is turn the engine and go!  I have things to do!  Kids, doctor visits, errands to run and hopefully somewhere in there I can catch a coffee with a friend... Checking the water in my car is not the top of my list.  But for my honey, Its Prime on his!  See and I am sure he will admit some of the day to day junk like PTA and what school assignment is due with what child and when is not top of his list... So we work together as a team.|`|rurfFLDkaa	Same way with my mom and pops. My dad works on cars and he likes to do nice things for my mom. I also check her oil and water if my dad asks me to. Its more so a mans job than a womans job. You should know that.|`|1Q4GTAwdaa	I guess it's a chivilary thing.    In our parents time and before, Men did stuff like that for their partners.  I think some time ago, I guess it wasn't the little woman's place, and she just didn't know.  But as time progresses and women because more educated and self confident it is less and less so.    I am only 28 and my husband does it for me.  He knows fair well that I am capable of checking and changing my oil and water.  I can even give my car a basic service (which I have done on rare occasions).  But he prefers to do it, and he believes it is something he does for me because he loves me.  Fine with me...|`|sfHLcFaAaa	because he is a nice guy who likes to take care your mum, learn from him.....|`|MekUlyGpaa	because a lot of  women do not know how to  check the oil or water in a car i can check the oil and water but i think that is more of the mans job and most men like messing with the car|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Lets try this, why don't you tell use why you always ask this question and why you need 20 answers. Ive seen this question a million times and you always get the same answers, so why do you keep on asking it?   I really want to know the logic behind it lol.|`|63a16c4605f24bcea912a3db99b38642aa	He does it because he likes to get dirty. Actually he does it because he wants it done right and because he cares enough about the car and your Mom to make sure its running well.|`|QzBTtcrEaa	because he loves her
hs793CCxaa	You can help. Women generally think a bit "younger" than men - perhaps less conservatively (like it or not, even with "womens lib", men still carry the responsibility for the family's well being. In some cases it may only be in the mind, but it IS there.) and with that responsibility comes a more cautious approach.     So, mentally, help to slow his "aging" - keep him young thinking. My wife and daughters convinced me to "spike" my hair - I think it looks silly, but they like it and think I look younger, and I get good comments from others, esp. women friends.    Help him select clothes, car, places to go, things to do.....    Aging can have a lot to do with your mindset.

How has his mind changed?
zoMMNwXcaa	well i dont think it would be a good idea to flirt lol. but just start up with hey how are you? then start normal conversation about school, teachers. ask about his day, etc. if he shows some shyness ask him what he likes to do for fun, what he likes to talk about etc. and if he is still shy try telling something funny that happened to you recently. it should give him a smile and complement his smile. it should work. youll be talking to him in no time. good luck!!!|`|zur8kdD2aa	Just say hey, it's not as embarrasing then asking him out. If he doesn't say anything back, well now that's a warning for you to not go any further to him. If he does, start striking up a couple of phrases the next time, then maybe a convo, and then wait for him to make a move back to you.|`|x09r4OVdaa	Okay, I've so been in your situation, and this is what I did...    I did talk to him. But, all I said was 'hi'. You'll know whether or not he likes you on his response. If you're too nervous, flash him a smile and see what he does. If he smiles back, I say go for it and talk to him. If he looks your way but doesn't smile back, or sees you smile than looks away, it's either he's really shy or he's not into you. I'd maybe talk to some of his friends, and ask them if he likes you or not. Or maybe get one of your friends to talk to him for you. But, if you ask a friend, ask one you completely trust, and one that won't say dumb things about you.     Hope I helped! :)  ?Bri|`|Ly0VVzU2aa	im a pretty shy person myself.  what i would do is find out something you all have in common like if you have a class with him walk up to him and make a comment about the teacher or ask him about an assignment, then go from there its easy once you get started. dont worry so much...GOOD LUCK =)
kKuQ6CiKaa	ok he sound like a pervert when he talks about your boobs. but he sounds like he really likes you. im around your age to and my best Friend is having the same problem|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Honey, he just wants to get in your pants.|`|mKVxsOXOaa	About the boob thing, that's how all guys are. Just a normal thing. But the other things you described, it sounds like he might have a crush. The only way to know for sure, is to ask. =)|`|LONHbwOwaa	Urr soooo stupid he realllly likes u but dosnt know how to tell u so he does that to try to let u know but ur not understanding it (boy code) trust me ask him how he feels anf if he wants to ggo out itll make the both of u happy i had the exact thing happen to me but i wasnt sure if i liked him but i didnt want to loose the chance so i stepped up aand now were married!|`|arhbVUtzaa	It sounds like he likes u girly have fun with it!
xvZoOTLiaa	if u wanna pay tons of $$$$$$$$$
ZjM0ghSnaa	thats cute    If she's nice to you, than why not ask her out? you two could have even more in common once you guys are alone. Times square is a good place to go. Maybe take he out to a nice restaurant after walking around?   You'll never know unless you just go and say "we should hang out". but say it when your in a good conversation, and she seems to flirt. She doesnt have to, but either way just go ahead. Dont "not aks at all". she'll be impressed that you have the confidence to ask her on a date. Dont let he looks intimate you, im sure your pretty good looking yourself:) and whatever you do, dont rush it, and dont get nervous. well, i can understand how it can be stressful, but just be confident. girls love that.    Wish you the best of luck!!|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	i would start by driving her around, to get coffee or something...   she has been in the bar seen for almost 3 years,  u got to think about how many drunk guys hit on her everynight...  u will be 21 soon neway, so if u got the game go for it. good lucks,   take her to the mall, get a shirt for yourself and a shirt for her
MR5sRwijaa	just ask her straight out  and if she looks at you weirdly, just say you're keeping it for records...  lol  don't scare her though lol  maybe get her alone then ask? =)    Good Luck!|`|oN7OwnvGaa	well i have guys like ask me over facebook or like at the end of class just be like hey. whats your number?  it works both ways. you really dont have to think to much into it, its just a simple question. you could even find a friend who has her number and just take it out of there phone|`|gv5DsZRZaa	hahaa u can have mine.. :P
SlizbMMVaa	I had problems with my in-laws since day one!  We met for dinner and was told I was not good enough for him.  Our first xmas with extended family I was warned by his aunt that his mother loved to break up marriages, so I am not overreacting to my inlaws for sure. He had problems with his family before I showed up, I was just the first person to tell him it was okay to not be happy with them.  He still had to love them but he could disagree... He had been trodden on to the point he could not have his own political views.  It took about a year and a half of put downs, controlling interference and a lot of behind-my-back talk to get my spouse to stand up to his mother.  His own cousins expressed to him that HE needed to stand up for himself.  I should sit back and let him do what needed to be done.     So my advice is express your concern with your spouse, Always keep talking... never clam up and dont let them do it either.  Allow them to be angry with you too... its not easy but its important that your spouse know that they can say NO to you.  The In Laws love using that one... Let your SPOUSE stand up for themselves... its all part of growing up!  Eventually every bird has to leave the nest.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	You smack 'em up the head.    No, I'm kidding.  You have to be humble, forgiving and kind. Just work on making your marriage work.|`|AA11280073	It is up to your spouse to tell his family to act civil. Otherwise ignore them.|`|AA11496842	Get as far away from them as you can and never look back.
py39L7Wraa	no you aren't over reacting about that. it has happened twice already i don't think you should let happen a third time. look at it this way, if he is unfaithful while you guys are dating each other, imagine how he will be if you guys are married. what you want to do with relationship is your choice. but if it were me, it would have been over from the very first message.|`|zo1lvjLlaa	well, ive been through a situation similar to that before and i ended up leaving him because i couldn't trust him at all and he continued doing things and lying to me about them. he actually tried hooking up with my cousin who i was very close to before, which ended up causing a lot of problems with me and her and we never talk anymore.    you obviously care about him otherwise you wouldn't stay with him hoping he will change after all that. but, if can't change and see how much you care about him then you don't need him sweetie. if you decide to leave him it will be hard i won't lie because it was very hard for me to do and i kept wanting to go back to him, but every time he tried apologizing like he did before i just had to ignore it because i had already been hurt too much and the trust was gone, therefor the relationship would never work. months later im with someone else and very happy, and actually being treated right.    good luck.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	no you aren't overreacting, he kinda sounds like an asshole to be honest.
iMGeSGdcaa	I THINK SO! :D|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	I think so, depending on the time of year.  Red and white together without any other colors involved would be more appropriate for winter months.  I also would suggest a color of white that is closer to a cream or off-white.  This way the two colors together will not look so drastic.  However, keep in mind that this is your wedding and you should choose whatever colors you want for the event.  Take in all of the suggestions you receive, but make sure the end decision is your own and what makes you happiest!  Good luck to you.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	yeah but you need a third color.like black or something.|`|9EkFrApiaa	you mean ARE read and white good wedding colors?  Add blue and make is patriotic!  No, it is awful.|`|P8vt2aLhaa	Yes they have some very beautiful gowns for both the bride and her wedding party.|`|hMavMBo4aa	are red and white.  and yes they are beautiful for a winter wedding.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	If you like them and if you take care not to have your wedding look like a Canada Day celebration they're fine. White goes with almost everything.|`|2C9Mjrxxaa	That's what I'm doing ... red white AND black. :D|`|8Xu0A70Saa	WHITE is the most preferred colour.|`|PZT4wyGoaa	I would choose something softer like a yellow, orange, or baby blue, but that's just me.|`|QaTI0EE3aa	i think its very romantic. nice colors! even red and light cream color would be great too. but yeah i really think that would be really pretty for a wedding.|`|5wfIHHGTaa	I am using Red, White, and touches of Silver. I wasnt originally going to use Red..but i wasnt able to get the color of dress that i wanted in time. (it was going to be wine) but anywho- so instead of freaking out, i changed the color of the dress to Apple Red. No biggie..i just had to rethink the flowers..which now i am using white Calla's and Red Roses. If you wanted to use hot pink, and brown you could...its your wedding day. And for those people who come on here degrading your choices are just down right immature. Its simple to say, "no i dont think those would go togther" instead of something mean, ya know? (sorry- had to get that out) But Im sure you will pick whats best for you. Are you having an outside wedding? What month? etc. those are all things you can think about that should make it easier to choose colors. If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask!! CONGRATS!|`|di6p10Ifaa	I love those colors but I think they are becoming incredibly overused.|`|mdgFAbfPaa	An old wives tale says that putting red and white flowers together in a bouquet is bad luck. It signifies the white bandages smeared with blood from the soldiers in the war....    That being said just don't put them two colours together in your bouquets and it'll look good i reckon. Try alternates like a white arrangement on the bridal table and red on the guests or something|`|wQxVHFgxaa	Do u mean for Decorations?    yes they are good colors.    I suggest you & your future hubby, should decide this.    by the way.  Congrats.  :]
Ir51Eb0Kaa	It's nice you want to be there for her and her son ?|`|UCd6blZgaa	you obviously like her..  start calling her. CALL HER! if she keeps only calling you she'll think you're not into her and loose intrest! ask her on a date or something..  preferably somewhere she can bring her son along.
028xaZCeaa	take it from me, this is the honest truth coming from a grown man he probably doesnt like you but is young and curious and will probably have sex with you if you let him then go back and tell all his buddies that he was finger bangin you and your daddies el camino|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	You just feel it, when he give you small simple signs, like doing or offering to do stuff he doesnt have too, looks @ you more often then necessary...if he wants to be just friends, he will talk to you about some irelevant stuff that friends talk...  Kinda hard to tell @ your age ;)|`|cdXMQai8aa	At least 12 questions like this are posted everyday =[[|`|9vYShoKgaa	if he wants to be more then friends, he will make sure you know. Be careful. i had my heart broken plenty of times thinking a guy liked me when he really didnt|`|i4bKzkHSaa	im a guy so this is easy...if he stares at you and you catch him and his face blushes he likes you|`|22EVxBYWaa	if he smiles at you a lot and goes out of his way just to talk to you.(:    thats really sweet. this guy who likes me did that to me today. i was waiting after skool  for a long time and i was outside all by myself and he came out there juust to talk to me.(: i was like, "aww! ur so sweet"    haha but yeaa OFF TOPiC.lol   just be sure to make ur feelings for him clear as well.    answer mine?? go to my profile && click on da latest question ive asked. plz && thank youu(:|`|B7idbFNVaa	If the guy like you he will looks or notice you alot and tend to act never around you. But the best way to find out if he likes you is through his friends.  Try to get them to confess.     How to get his attend:   Come to class late make sure you're the last person in class.  While walking to take a seat look at him and smile at him.  See if he smiles back at you.  And then later on check to see if he looks at you.|`|8d74IGuTaa	if he is true to himself the its a pretty good bet that he will true to you.... if he like you, you can tell by the way he talks to you.. if he likes to joke and flirt with you... its a sign... or they are bored (go with the first one)|`|FwqBElG3aa	well u wont know intill u like see little things he does around u ...that might help...plz coose for best answer|`|Lgwk35k8aa	A good way to tell is by flirting around with him and seeing if he flirts back. See what your friends think too.  The true, best way to tell if a guy likes you is to tell him you like him. If he doesn't like you back...oh well at least you won't have to worry about it anymore!
BObu4i9saa	really? seriously?  you're actually asking this?|`|ZkRZnMDZaa	well, he should be helping out the family on a regular basis, but if he needs a little motivation sometimes, and that works, well, more power to you.|`|dQ0wIYWfaa	YOUR BEING REPORTED! there are children on this site missy!|`|syWxjxu8aa	not sure what the question is so im going to say yes?|`|W1rCsvTzaa	You are a wonderful wife - you are like my wife - and your husband loves you for it as I love mine for her gifts :) :)|`|IPS3hWweaa	You are very good! All wives should be as good as you!|`|TJiGs8S4aa	How is that a favor?  Presumably you both got something out of that.  But, good for you, that will encourage him to be much more helpful all the time, call it what you want to.|`|hs793CCxaa	Sounds like it.     Gee Bryan, if CHILDREN get that, then they are pretty worldly and it wouldn't worry them and they wouldn't be learning anything new. Lighten up!|`|AA11967247	yeah, just dont get over zealous and chop any wood.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I understand "brought the wood in" but the dishwasher thing really had me scratching my head...    OHHHHHHHHHHH this isn't sexual...dang...where is my mind?? lol      Yes, you are a wonderful wife. :)|`|KT5lWaLaaa	Get your groove on girl. Kids were asleep right??  Haha!|`|E7RhMRKhaa	It is nice to help.  That's what living together should be.|`|CSryVJFdaa	That's team work.|`|eGO6HqAVaa	I doubt that children would get it, Bryan.    "Wood" is a rather subtle pun.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	It was nice of you to show your appreciation. I'm sure if all my husband had to do was load the dishwasher and bring in the wood in exchange for that, he'd do it 3 times a day. However, if you both work outside the home, you both should work inside the home as well. He needs to do his part.|`|1qa4dFVXaa	As long as you didn't burn the wood!!!!
85tAhnM9aa	.......Material possessions don't mean anything. You can't judge your life on how much stuff you collect. After a while the stuff you though you owned, turns out to own you. Don't brag about this man, just be happy with life. A women will turn up one day.|`|abx5VNsOaa	How old are you?,e-mail me if you want via 360.  Money can talk but bullSHYTe walks,lol.  Money can't buy love,it comes from the heart.  Size of wallet is irrelevant,it's the size of one's heart that is important.|`|KVd8aKDoaa	You're probably very ugly and/or socially awkward.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Because only old people are on dating sites!|`|gF26JyzBaa	Bro, you almost never find your significant other. it's always when you least expect it. that said, before sharing yourself with another person you need to learn to love YOURSELF. otherwise you will never have a good relationship with the other person. keep on doing your thing, and it will happen by accident.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	its not really about material stuff, women are attracted to looks first, then personality, if they cant see you, you have to use your personality, are you funny or do you have a talent, a hobby or find some common ground...|`|pcIkr0mqaa	No  because then how do you know If they want you for you and not for your material thingss|`|qaz2y3NGaa	I agree with joojoo|`|z4i5CHuaaa	material isn't everything. It has more to do with your personality and how you approach people. Anyone who is going to date you for your things is dating you for all of the wrong reasons. You'll find someone out there that loves you for who you are and not what you have.|`|f72MDRqKaa	yes,  I mean basically your advertising yourself.  Women arnt all golddiggers and if thats what your trying to rule out i understand.  Women dont want a bum either soooo you should show your dependent, from my understanding thats the point of these sites.  People looking for stability???|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	don't do it ! that's what any of your relationships will be based upon . travel around & hit the social spots night clubs (not strip) concerts,plays etc. while you are enjoying those things someone will approach . BEWARE OF THE GOLD DIGGER . they only know what you show .|`|QPiIRyDYaa	Maybe your putting to much emphasis on everything you have and not enough on who you are. The right person could be twice your age. Love knows no boundries..
Nur24xInaa	As I guy myself, I wouldn't tell some girl that I actually like to shut up when they need help... And think about it, do you know what they mean by Jen Hen? Maybe it is an inside joke that can be very hurtful if you understood. I hope you can make it work with him but I don't think he would go out with you in the first place if he thought that it was "uncool" right?|`|pWnsUHMBaa	aw thats so mean  forget him|`|K2oxUEsUaa	if hes being rude to you hes probably not a good guy forget him|`|GlNlcioUaa	you sound like a slut|`|MXMDTZxvaa	wtf! that person is gay that says u sound like a slut u dont at all.  boys are stupid and complicated. he probably has a huge ego that he doesnt want to mess up. hes just nervous. i suggest that if you guys have cell phones with texting talk to him over that because that would be easiest his friends and ur friends wouldnt be right there|`|vfpJJiNUaa	wow krystal thats not very nice of u but i think krystal has a point ur attitude means that ud take any kind of crap just for attencion and no offence but for guys in the first two mins a silly girl is cute but after a while its just plain annoying that could be one of the reasons that this ryan dude yells at you. try to be more subtle in ur flirting stop making yourself look like a "booty call" and play harder to get. most guys love an intelligent woman who is just slightly out of reach. make him come to u not vice versa.  ps. jen hen? wtf? since when is that a good/cool/nice nickname. tell them to stop or at least come up with something better
vAkHEZBraa	well, nkvlove, i think it's fine jonny is attracted to becky anne.  you know- its a free country.  i think it's great that he got you pregnant- you're adding another person into the world.  it benefits for both me and you.  for you, you get a little kid that you could love for and care for.  for me and everyone else in the world, our population wont be dying out anytime soon.  we don't want the world to end- so males and females please keep reproducing!  if you dont and a meteroid hits the face of the earth, we all go KABOOM and bye-bye.|`|9YLvu9Elaa	seriously get an abortion|`|sebhK7r7aa	Tell him, you got me pregnant now you've got to stay here with me.
33bb7aa73b9d86c8c5ac8d3a05bd35f7aa	I guarantee that her mother purposely tried to come home and surprise you because of her paranoid fears.  Unfortunately you can expect more of the same if your relationship to her continues.     If you love her that much, try to put up with it.  If it is too much for you to handle, it may be time to look for another fish in the sea...|`|klcqgST9aa	I think it would be polite to apologize. You should explain to her mother that you care for her daughter very much, and that you'd do anything to be with her, even if it means complete supervision at all times. (Unless you aren't willing to do that)    Talk with just the girls parents, not with the girl. Perhaps call the house and speak to a parent and ask if you and they could have a talk.     Whatever you say, don't say:  I love your daughter, that will scare parents.  Anything like "You can't stop us" or something that gives the impression that you are more powerful then the parents, because you aren't.    Try to put yourself in her parent's shoes. Tons of boys want nothing more than to use girls, which leave girls upset. They don't want that to happen to their daughter,     Just be mature and polite.|`|dd07d44218c6f0cb9b4e55aae3015401aa	oh wow, yeah i think you should go to her house and have a one on one talk with her mother and apologize and assure her it won't happen again and tell her how much you care about her daugher.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	LOL ...Oh dear I wouldn't say ruined but awkward especially for mommy. Don't worry give it a couple of weeks no one will care anymore or remember.|`|KjzsYV9uaa	your going to have to talk to her mom and gain her trust back if you can|`|MiwvA72Aaa	Relax, and wait to see what your girlfriend says the next time you talk to her.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Just apologize and say its not happening again.  But next time (if you do), lock the door :)|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Her mom is just being protective of her.  Its nothing to stress about too much.  You can def. still be with this girl and love her :]   Just maybe talk with her mother next time you see her and tell her it was a misunderstanding of what she say?   Be positive.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Maybe you should privately speak to her parents about this. Tell the truth and nothing but the truth, and you have nothing to worry about.    Good Luck|`|moeaIZB9aa	smoke sum weed to let you focus better and relax you sound like a *****|`|0F3MreEaaa	Well if your girl really likes you then she'll say that your part of her life and she needs you|`|zc82Q0KRaa	sounds like s porno movie except you bang the mom instead haha|`|PAm7zqFyaa	just go to her mom and tell her that it was not what it seemed.. that you are wanting to wait...hopefully you really are...and that you are sorry and you would wanna ask if they need to sit down and talk and ask her ma if yalls relationship will be ruined because of this, like is she not going to let yall talk anymore???|`|92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	wait im confused, you werent having sex, so whyd she get so mad?  and aww im sure in a few weeks her mom wont care anymore but i dont know what kind of mom she is. just tell her y0our really sorry and that you care about her daughter alot|`|XntSwYezaa	go and talk to her mom and DAD (yes i said dad). Tell them that you are using protection.... that you are clean of all STD's(show them test results if you want).... honestly is always the best answer. If you are honest with them, your relationship with the parents will be better off!!|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Talk to your girlfriend's mom. Bring your mom with you. That'll help.|`|qpkNrn8iaa	u need 2 tlk 2 ur gfs mom and tell her u wernt doing any thing and tell her how u feel about her daughter .. she'll understand|`|7UKJY0v0aa	thats why you dont do things like that at 17 years old. your mom should let you know to wait until you are way older and mature, or until your married.|`|OCNpTC6Uaa	you did nothing wrong! dont worry about it! her mom should chill and if yall arent having sex then there is nothing wrong!|`|8sxffX7Qaa	oh wow dude that sucks. if what you care about is her, then you need to talk to her and ask her how she wants you to handle it. if i were the girl i certainly wouldnt want you talking to my mom but thats just me... see how she feels and what she wants to do about it and then do something you guys agree on. dont do anything without telling her first..|`|723a2R1Gaa	Well first ask the girl.  Then if she wants you to talk to her mom, say exactly what you just said.  "I don't even care about myself, but her. I can't even sleep, or eat."  You have to say that.  You then have to tell her that being around her daughter makes you the happiest you have been.  Then tell her that you weren't doing anything that day and you aren't planning on doing anything.|`|DsIbGLYUaa	first off the fact that you are seventeen gives you permision to do what ever if the person is with in 2 years of your age, second i can see y the mom freaked but she cant just keep her locked up, you see he at school right, well talk to your gf there and tell her how you are feeling i am sure she still likes you and feels the same way, you will figure it out dont worry hope this helped|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	It will probably blow over, don't worry to much about it. You are both 17 years old and are going to make out and kiss. It's not like she walked in on you guys naked!! Just think about how much worse it could be!! Talk to your girl and see what her opinion is about it, ask her if she thinks it would help any if you apologized. You must remember not to take all the blame though, you didn't do anything worse than she did. But if it would help to tell her mom that you didn't mean to disrespect her rules and how much you like and respect her daughter and that you would never want to cause any trouble for her then do it.    Good Luck!!|`|HHcVFFdZaa	her mom is probably worried that you are pressuring her daughter into doing things she is ready for. I think the best thing is to sit down with her mom (even though it may be uncomfortable) and tell her that you love her daughter and you would never pressure her into doing anything she didn't want to.    HELP ME WITH MY QUESTION PLEASE|`|WJWW7NXaaa	She was probably lashing out because she was shocked and a bit embarrassed for walking in.     Give it some time to cool off. You should apologise (even though you weren't really doing anything wrong) and explain to them that you respect their daughter and respect them and would never intentionally do anything to harm that.|`|R65Owmebaa	THis is very touchy subject most parents don't like to think of there children sexually active at all... so she was most likely in shock and mad at the same time. The best thing would be to call and ask to talk to her mother and ask if you can come over to talk to her about what happened. ( you don't want to surprise her by just showing up shes already upset) You need to then apologize and set up some guidelines / boundaries that might make her feel more comfortable with you. Such as possible a curfew when you guys go out tell her where your going what time you will be home ETC...Also tell her what happened will never happen again and that your very sorry and you understand her concern and why she is upset. Try to put yourself in her shoes ....if you had a kid and you walked in on them wouldn't you freak out? just talk to her kid it will be fine.|`|qQu57aWdaa	yeah her mom will try to stop it  if i found my daughter in a bed with a guy   even with full clothes on ill snap her neck  hahha good luck   its partly ure fault but not all  haha.|`|gFQwZRAMaa	If you didnt do anything then theres nothing to be worried about. She was probally just mad that you were there while they were gone.|`|S0oRG1sQaa	Ooohhh...Tough one. So how long have you two been dating? Anyways, first off, are her parents strict? Well, my parents are very strict, dating for me, is always a problem, BUT, whose life is it? You guys' or the parents? Don't put your parents in the hole, this will only make her parents hate you more. Hmmm...I don't think her mom's trying to break the relationship..or at least I hope so, but although she is, don't give up, this will hurt your girlfriend even more. Just keep fighting there pal. Your girlfriend will help you. well, don't fight fight, but you know, hang on there, and remember, her parents are trying to help her daughter not ruin the relationship. they're just trying to find the best for their child. And you have to fight for the position.|`|ebwe0Duzaa	okay!  just read it, i know its long...sorry but it will probably help.  this has happened to me TWICE!!  cept im a girl...and my mom caught my boyfriend at my house...sorry but i have to tell you the story and this might help you...i invited him over cause my sis had summer school and my mom wouldnt come home til she did so he comes over one day and its the first time we had it...that was all good...he came over the next day, that was all good...we say hey, havnt gotten in trouble yet so i invite him for the third day and my mom gets home like way early, and THANK GOD i had locked my door cause she came knocking and i was whispering get in the closet and had to get dressed in high speed and then he left all his crap laying everywhere so i had to keep going back and forth throwing stuff in closet with him...my mom is like open the door!  so i open it when it seems all good and she just automatically goes to the closet and gets to see him sitting there in his boxers...it was seemingly pretty bad...my parents are hard core over protective, controlling, nosy parents.  sooo that didnt fly to well but it wasnt so bad because me and my guy are still together (that was about 6 months ago)  and we are doing great!  we didnt let that stop our relationship.  from the beginning we have had forbidden love, seriously.  my parents + the teachers at my school went out of their way to keep us apart.  it was so bad that if i was even seen talking to him i would be sent to a-school (it is possible) .  but that was actually before the whole getting caught with the sex stuff...but im just saying, it isnt so bad, things WILL get better, trust me...it might take a bit of time, but things will smooth out and yes you really should appoligize to her parents, they would have a little more respect for you...and it really shouldnt affect your relationship that much...besides you not being able to go to her house and stuff...and your right there is NOTHING that her parents can do.  me and him have been together for a year and 9 months now...we didnt do it till a year was over just so you know.  oh and the second time we got caught was actually about 3 weeks ago or so...haaha we were in the shower together at my house...mom came home AGAIN.  she called the cops and we had to talk to one and now if he ever comes on my property again, unless given permissiion by my parents, he will have a warrent sent out for his arrest...but its all good, when my mom picks me up from school he walks me to the car and everything and says high+waves to her...its really not so bad...just appoligize and things will get better with time...if you guys really do love each other then everything should be just fine.  o and (depending on what kind of person her mom is) she is probably going to try to stop the relationship!  but if your in love thats not happening and theres not a damn thing that women can do.  everything should be fine!  nothing is impossible, trust me i would know.  dont give up!|`|v5PafYXkaa	iT ALL DEPENDS OH HOW MUCH YOUR G.F LOVES YOU. TRUE LOVE ISN'T PERFECT, SO IF SHE IS STRONG ENOUGH HER OWN CHOICE & STICK WITH IT, THEN YOU GOT A KEEPER! My boyfriends mom HATED ME in the beg, but she warmed up to me, but now i feel she hates ne again, lol.. LONGSTORY SHORT, he didnt care of what she thought, he respected her for her decision, but he likes me and respects me & is willng to hold on to our relationship, so no matter what anyone says, and what happens, if a relationship can last through the most ROUGHEST & STORMIEST TIME!     you're realtionship will be as solid as gold..|`|9twWLm0Yaa	yea just talk to her mom and tell her nothing hapened|`|6CMX5aIVaa	im a 17 year old girl....if my boyfriend came round and apologised for it id be SO embarrassed...    just go round, then when you got a moment alone ask her mum if she wants a cup of tea or something and slip in then how much the daughter means to you...      and trust me teenage girls mums get over things and once she was over the shock of it, shes is probably just as embarrassed as you were and doesnt no what to say to you anymore..      relax. IT ISNT THE END OF THE WORLD. X
MdXwD2JSaa	Just have condoms always on hand.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Creativity is always the best ice breaker. Safe sex is always a good thing, and because most people know that now, a lot of us have become "creative" in the 'breaking the moment' part. You can make it a part of so-called foreplay. Fantasizing and "play talk" takes the anxiety out of it. For example, I would say to my new partner, "looks like Harry needs his scuba suit again... lol". That kind of thing. It's only an example. Since I'm married, I don't need to do that anymore, but still find time for fun or silliness. There's something about making it fun that takes away the seriousness of the moment. Laughter is still the best medicine.|`|w4ZPaxsbaa	Don't.  Be the first Man in her life!  Far too many people rush the sex part. Too much, too soon and then it's too late. As can be supported by all of the we-had-sex...now what? questions that I read here all too often.  Be a Man.  Take the time to develop the Relationship.  Sex is only a part of it. By working and enjoying becoming more close, affectionate, involved, concerned and Respectful it may surprise you just how important the two of you become to each other.    Take-in the fullness of her response when you honestly tell her "I want wait for sex until I'm married."

9WIbZUH0aa	I think it's fine, as long as you have no sexual desire for her (of course you do, you're a boy, but you know what i mean.  In the not act on your impulse ever way.).  Just be friendly, and become friends, and eventually ask her out.      Just don't kiss her in public very often, and maybe not at all in public, because it might give other people (the gossipy dramatic kind) the wrong idea, but you can date publicly and hug and all that stuff.  Just DON'T even think about ANYTHING sexual with her, NOTHING.  She is too young for you to even think about that.    You will also need to talk to her parents, explain to them that you have nothing sexual for her and you just enjoy her company (this is especially important to explain to the dad).  Tell them the benefits--that you aren't a druggy, that you'll protect her, that you'll be a good influence, etc (if these things are true).  Just explain to them that you really love her.  A lot.  But not in a scary way.    I think this is okay because my parents are 31 years apart (though, trust me, you do not want to marry anyone more than five years below or above your age).  As long as you're not a creepo, and you truly do care about her and care about her enough to go through everything for this relationship (as in gossip, jabs, parental approval, etc.) go for it, but make sure you make friends first (as to not come on too fast).  DO NOT have a relationship with this girl in secret, because if you are found out there could be consequences.      If you can make this work, it can be a VERY GOOD relationship, if this girl is mature and you have the same ideas.  Good luck!

Students are practically having sex in school.     Any ways, have you talked to her? Maybe she is to young to ask out because her parent won't let her or something. But if you are really interested in her you can talk, get to know one another then ask her to be your girl. Going out on a date, well that's an issue.    Age does not matter.|`|i2OERsC9aa	OMGOSH!! that's so cute! ask her if she wants to come over. If she says yes, ask her what day would work. I hate it when guys ask me out, and they don't give a day or time or anything. Don't ask her on a date or anything- just to hang out. Be prepared for any answer, though. She might like you, but could be creeped if a high schooler asks her out!!!!

EHQ0u9xwaa	truth is It scares us or at least me that it will be serious and yes eventually marriage. if you know me i am the most unserious person ever i can't handle that kind of tense relationship, at least not now... this is probably true for a lot of guys and girls it's just that even if she's perfect we are not ready for love. all our lives till now we make plans for the future which most of the time do not include love and marriage but of a carrer and such. it scares us when we see this "perfect" person because it makes us realize that this person might fringe upon the lives we so long have planned for.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	no!|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	No, why would it scare me?

AA11972752	Legally, he can be required to pay child support, and he can get in big trouble if he doesn't pay up then. But I hate to say this - you can't squeeze blood out of a rock. If he has no money for real, then requiring him to pay child support will just get him in big trouble and I can see why he'd think you were doing it to just be vindictive - not that I think that would be your reason for doing it, but the result is the same. Since he is watching the kid while you are working, if you are happy with this arrangement, then I would let him keep doing that... At least you'll be getting something useful out of this guy that way. Sometimes it isn't about what you're legally entitled to, in theory, but it's about getting the best outcome (in real life!) for you and your child, even if that means coming up with a special arrangement like this.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Be practical NOT emotional.

They combine your income and see who makes what percentage. Then, according to state guidelines, determine how much he will pay through the court. In other words, he is going to be ordered to pay eventually. He may as well help now. If he does not, he will be ordered to pay back support. If he is that uncomfortable giving you cash, tell him to buy hard items such as groceries or diapers. Or even a grocery store gift card. Regardless of how, he is going to have to pay support in one way or another.     When you get a support order drawn, order it paid through the court. Do not depend on him to pay you directly.|`|qsPyi6Mhaa	Oh girl! you are preaching to the choir with this one. I was in a very similar situation. What I did is came up with something that is fair as far as financial status on both ends is concerned. I wrote out an agreement, got it notarized with him, then followed that. It is a legal document, so If need be, it will stand in court. If he does not want to sign the document, then he is an *** and deserves to go to court. They will have you 2 go through mediation. And see who has to pay what according to the time spent with the child. That is a final step in trying to have some sort of agreement before having to go to court. Now, regarding the child care, every state in this country has some sort of child-care assistance. Not sure where you are, but just google free child care in... wherever you are. And if you are not married, in instantly will qualify.     I know this is hard on you, trust me, but with the right resources, you and your baby will be fine. Trust me :)    Good luck with everything, many blessings!|`|aN7ueCQmaa	You can only force him to pay once it is court ordered.  You can certainly ask him before you go to court but it's kind of up to him if he wants to pay or not.  YES he should help you but he isn't obligated to financially until it is court ordered.  He is helping you with child care duties so that is nice.  Even once  financial support  is court ordered it is very easy to evade.  All he has to do is switch employers to avoid garnishment.  Sad thing is, even if he doesn't abide by court orders to pay you still have to abide by court orders for visitation.|`|JpjSGtCnaa	Child support is your child's right to have, and no matter how sorry you feel for ex or how bad he claims to have it you should get it on paper legally. Why should you feel guilty for asking for help to take care of your child? Regardless of what's going on with the two of you, it's his obligation and he shouldn't have to be asked or made to do so by a court of law but unfortunately that's just how it is at times! He can endure hunger pains a lot better than his son could, tell him to think of that when he tells you he can barely feed self. Would you go without so that your son might have? Yes you would, now why shouldn't his father also, you Both owe this child an opportunity to survive, to have a roof over his head, to be fed, clothed and educated, you owe him love, nurturing, the sense of security, oh hell do I need go on?
0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	I'm so sorry to hear you have to go through this.   It's important to understand that it's ok to be upset with him for watching porn. In fact, that is the correct emotion to feel. Anger. Because, even though he's not having sex with another actual person, in his heart, he is cheating on you everytime he views porn. Him being angry after he watches it, has nothing to do with your actions. It's his guilty conscience trying to convince himself that his actions are justified. That in some way, he was driven to commit this act.        Yes, it is possible to be addicted to sex, but that's why we get married. So we have a means to satisfy those desires. If he's not fulfilling those desires with you, then why else are you together? I'm not insinuating that you should be apart. What I'm saying is, his sexual need should be satisfied by the intimacy you share between each other. You mentioned you try a lot of different things to keep his interest? That's good, as long as it is within reason, and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. But something to keep in mind may be the regularity of sex, and not just the diversity of sex. If he needs porn all the time, perhaps it means that he needs sex more often. Be mindful to be available when you two have time together. But if it's not enough for him to simply have a regular sexual relationship, there might be a need for therapy.   Indulging him with another woman, is something I wouldn't suggest. Because for one obvious reason, it opens the door for him to cheat on you whenever he is so inclined. And that may not be healthy for YOU. Don't forget that you have needs to. Perhaps not the physical needs your husband has, but the emotional needs that a woman has. And that involves knowing you're the center of his life, and the only woman he wants. Don't neglect your own needs. You're important to! And there's also health risks that are involved with having many sexual partners.        My wife expressed a concern with me spending time on the internet, because her ex was also caught viewing porn. So I understand your fear. I told me wife I don't need internet porn, but what I asked her to be constantly aware of, is to make sure she strives to remain attractive for me, and be available also. My wife can be quite utilitarian. She likes to work around the house and yard and run errands all day long, and she had the tendency to dress like a carpenter or plumber. I told her that wasn't going to work for me. I need her to be aware of her appearance. And she's been much better.       Men are visual creatures. We have the task of being "UP" for the job. But in order for us to do that, it may take visual stimulation. If a woman does not make herself visually appealing, then it becomes very difficult for us to be physically aroused. And over time, this could lead to serious problems. Because eventually we may be walking through a mall, see a beautiful lady, become aroused, and in our brain, we correlate the beautiful lady and our arousal, with a disinterest for our wife. I believe this contributes to men cheating, because their brain has indicated their arousal at other women. In truth they love their wives, but perhaps the visual appeal has diminished. Visual stimulation is important for us. No, not all cases of unfaithfulness are caused by lack of visual stimulation. I'm just pointing out the need to be aware of your appearance.        Above all, you shouldn't have to hurt your conscience to have a relationship. Forcing his desire for internet porn upon you is a form of mental abuse. Yes, he may have a problem that needs professional help. And if so, look into it. But don't become a punching bag for someone who can't refrain from hurting you time and time again. Everybody deserves respect. Yes, you. Your partner is the one with the problem, but YOU'RE the only one getting hurt here. That's not a healthy relationship. Protect yourself. Do what's healthy for you emotionally as well as physically. Listen to your inner voice. Our conscience is all we have to protect us. It's the most important thing we possess. If your conscience tells you not to stand for his addiction, then listen to it, because it's a healthy! It's when we ignore our conscience that it becomes unhealthy, and we suffer for it.        I hope things improve for the both of you. I hope I have helped? Take care sweetie! Be safe!    Peace!!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	No, I don't think he has an addiction to sex.  I think he has an addiction to internet porn that is distorting his views about women and marriage.  It sounds like he's "acting out" after watching - could it be that he's using porn as a way to feel dominant and then verbally dominating you?    Regardless, this porn habit is harmful to you and your marriage.

You should not "go along" because you'll just promote the problem.  You must be strong and stand for what you know is best.  You must insist on standards.  He will rebel, fight, and argue but ultimately he will respect you.    I'm sorry.  I feel for you.|`|F8CSNTQdaa	I am a man and I like a good porno time and again.  My wife and I dont really watch it together that much either.  It is ok to fantasize.  The part about mistreating you is UNacceptable.  You must make this a point to him or leave the situation.

It sounds pretty much like you described. He was constantly lying about it an I would catch him getting out of bed at 5 am to go watch it before work, and then when I jumped in the shower later in the day.     I told him one day, It's our marriage or the porn. He agreed to marriage counseling and the therapist said he could never watch porn again. (Which was hard because you know, he IS a guy...and I never had a problem if it was every once in a while.) But a porn addiction is just like any other addiction. You can't just cut back because eventually he'll be back up to doing it full force and you'll have to start all over. He has to give up porn FOREVER.     That may scare him, but if he values you or your marriage, he'll do it. If he doesn't than I guess it's better that you find out now then later and you can get the heck out of your marriage.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	It definitely sounds like he is embarrassed about it.  I wonder if there is a specific thing he is watching, something that he can't get from you or wouldn't ask you to do. Gay porn, or something really disgusting, that turns him on. I think it's healthily for some things to be private.     You could talk about it some more or go talk to someone, but I think he would really be mad. Me I would put it out of my head, ignore his behavior make sure he knows that I have turned a blind eye to it.  After some time he shouldn't be so mad about it. It's part of who he is, it sounds like you knew about this before you were married, you shouldn't be trying to change him.  Bottom line he is doing you, and if this is what he needs then you shouldn't take it away or try to be a part of it.

Mention group sex, threesomes, anal, oral, sex in public, all the different variations you can think of. Then ask her what she thinks about, oh, say, ever having a threesome? She might not want to talk about it or consider it. but you talk about it just as an idea, does she like thinking about having two guys at once?  Threesomes can be pretty intense experiences. We tried it a few years ago, and the feelings for me as a woman were almost indescribable, but we found it had a tendency to push us apart from each other in intimacy.   If your marriage is good now, having a threesome will not help it. Women see sex as an expression of love, not just a great pleasurable activity. She might feel this request as pushing her away from intimacy. In that case, it would be best to find a different fantasy.  If you do the threesome, what does it do to your marriage if she likes him better than you?   Are you pushing her into the arms of another man instead of yourself? Or do you suspect she might already be leaning away from you, so to keep control of the situation, you have a threesome so at least you are there?  If the sex in the threesome is not good, she will resent you for making her do it, even if she liked the idea beforehand.|`|AA11969451	Yours is a common fantasy.

u5yzxdPWaa	Wow, what you have there sounds fantastic. If you want more ideas, how about a blind fold, fluffy handcuffs, paint on chocolate... the options are endless!     Send your hubby off to pick up something that you 'forget' to get at the shop or something. Ask a friend to call and distract him for a little bit on the phone, or get him set up with one of his hobbies in the lounge/kitchen and let him be for a while.    As far as the kids go - can you get your hubby to take a shower after they've gone to bed? Ideally you'd get someone to take them for the night, but I'm assuming that's not possible from your email.    Put all your preparations in a place he NEVER goes - the boot of your car? Your underwear drawer? The kitchen pantry or laundry? You know your husband best, what are his habits?|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Some time ask him what his favorite fantasy happens to be.

While they are out, call him up and telll him ants (NOT roaches)  have invaded your house and that you need to set off a fogger, that is so potent that no one can be in the house for a few hours.    If he asks where you are, just say you will talking a walk down the street.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	www.lovingyou.com  i think u can find what u need there|`|4wlwyhvnaa	I have this great idea!!!! Take the kids to grandmas house and plan on them staying the night. Take the 8th off and set up while hubby is at work. Now you are going to need to a stripper pole, a 10X10 mirror, black lights, candles and some rose petals. Oh and some cherries, those maraschino cherries. Hang the mirror above the bed with half the mirror hanging over the stripper pole. Replace the lights in the room with the black lights. have candles lit all around the room and the rose petals running from the front door to the stripper pole. Oh place a comfortable chair in the room as well. As soon as he gets home have it all ready. He can walk in the door.... wait... a little note maybe a text message right before he gets home "follow the rose petal road!" Something like that. No note on the door; some freak might come and then I'll see you on the First 48. Okay anyways, he can follow the rose petals to the room when he opens the door you are in sexy lingerie and you start doing a little dance or strip tease with the pole. Make sure he is seated. Then slowly work your way to him for a lap dance and some more teasing. After that have him start taking clothes off and now the cherries come in to play. Place some on your body for him to lick off. The rest is up to you!!!! If you do this your marriage will never ever fail and you will be his goddess!!!! Shopping sprees, fancy cars, beautiful vacations.... its all yours he will be whipped!!! haha well I hope you enjoy and if you do it you rock!!!!|`|oxmkllnWaa	the sexy nighty and the silk sheets he'll probably like... you'll like the rose petals (can be a mess btw... they can stain the sheets) and candles and massage oils...    how? close the bedroom door and don't let the kids in... set it up on the bed (shouldn't take but a few minutes...) and you can change the sheets earlier in the day and he won't notice since they'll be covered.
AA10065812	AS A REMINDER TO ALL SINGLE MEN SHACKING UP WITH A WOMAN.  UNLESS YOU LIVE IN ARIZONA OR CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE   NO (English/Spanish/Italian);  N-O;  NEE (Dutch);  ?? (Arabic);  He (Bulgarian);   (Japanese);  ASSUMED RIGHTS TO, OR SAY ABOUT, ANY CHILD BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.  ONLY THE COURTS CAN GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS.    I REPEAT, SINGLE FATHERS IN 97% OF THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES HAVE NO RIGHTS.   YOU ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNTIL YOU ARE GRANTED THEM.  SINGLE MEN MAKE THESELVES INTO A SLAVE CLASS THAT MUST ASK PERMISSION OF THEIR SLAVE OWNER (THE MOTHER) OR HER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE (THE COURTS) FOR PERMISSION TO SEE YOUR CHILD.  AND EVEN THAN, 60% OF THE TIME, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STUDIES, YOU WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO YOUR CHILD, LOSING ALL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YEARS.    YOU SOLD YOURSELF INTO SLAVERY THE MOMENT YOU TOOK YOUR PECKER OUT OF YOUR PANTS WITH A WOMAN YOU WERE NOT MARRIED TO.      I've worked with divorced and single fathers for 20 years.      You have an up mountain, not hill, battle ahead of you.  In a word, prepare, prepare, prepare.    Get an order enter forcing a DNA test, unless one has already been done.    If one has been done, go to the child support enforcement to setup a voluntary order.  Wait for them to file against you will result in you paying all court costs.      Take a certified parenting course.  The court is going to order you to take it anyway, so by showing youve taken it only looks good to them.    Start keeping a daily journal of all you activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      The court will order you into mediation, so take the lead first.  Instead of hiring attorneys, go to a mediator and try to hammer out an agreement.  A mediator is an attorney or paralegal with certified training as a mediator.  You each have to pay half the fees in order for the mediator to have the appearance of being unbiased.    If you and the mother are civil, consider Bird Nest Custody.  In this the child lives in one home and each parent live there for 3-4 weeks, than switch.  You live with friends, family, rent a room, etc. on the off time.  In this manner, your childs life is not disrupted.  They are not being shifted back and forth.  They keep their own room, friends, school, etc.  It is hard on the parents, but than the child comes first.  This is the form of custody rocker Ted Nugent had.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...    A couple of additional   http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/    Now, Im going to remind you that it is best for the child to have both parents in the home, otherwise your child has a 400% higher potential for early age sexual activity, drug use, criminal behavior, etc.  Without being consider a stalker, do anything possible to keep the family together.

It varies from state to state...but I am certain that not being listed doesn't exempt you from support if she can prove the child is yours.    Good luck.|`|JpjSGtCnaa	Yes. The court will ask if you agree that said child is yours, if you do not repute it, while there are some courts that automatically order a paternity test if there's no name listed on birth certificate whether you deny child or not.|`|sOYUCM1vaa	No, you don't have to pay if you are not the father according to the childs birth certificate.  She can however try and take you to court, if you have any previous cases for example, if you have previously fought for custody of the child or made written claim on the child by way of going through the court to have visitation rights etc.  that would be the only card she could use, but then you could appeal it.  Apart from that and ONLY that, no she can't make you pay child support if she has not put your name on the birth certificate. Nor should she try. If you were together when the child was born, but you weren't good enough to be named the father, why should you be good enough to pay. That;s not right. I hate it when some woman do that. Having said that, they are the minority.|`|AA10876923	If the child is yours, yes.  If not yours, then no.  However, a paternity test may be required.|`|THXn0KuKaa	Yep if she makes you take paternity test and you are the dad then the answer is yes.|`|13uu4bbQaa	the court will most likely send you to take a dna test  which by the way is $650 and you will have to pay   for and once its proven that your the father and she  does file for child support they can automatically take it   out of your check
uYK6Yi7vaa	to answer i'll ask you a question : if you had a daughter would you  not tell her that she was better than this? that she is wonderful and shouldn't accept this kind of neglect from a man? assuming you said yes, love yourself enough then to take your own advice. don't be willing to accept little scraps some dog is throwing to you. you're worth more than that.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	I think he's already let you go..so YOU go on and find someone else..|`|ozwLZwXeaa	This guy is trying to let you down easy. He does care about you and worries about hurting you this way.  He needs you to accept the fact that you are not boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.  You two are just really good friend.

If he starts getting really unreasonable, just tell him that you meant it when you said you were sorry, and that a little girl like that couldnt possibly have meant to hurt his feelings, then put everything behind you. tell the aunt to try to be a little more sensitive. you cant change his height. he will have to learn to deal with this.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	just let it go...he knows he's short and he'll have to deal with it, unless he grows a bit more (males till they're 21)  being short isn't the end of the world.

There are laws against what she is doing.  People are ridiculous.
TR5ntsavaa	If they're really your friends, they won't care if you struggle in school. Or the might offer to help you study. If it worries you that much, don't show them your report card.|`|ia2oWu18aa	if they really r ur frens they won't care abt ur grades...|`|NCy5Oj0jaa	of course not the worst thing that they will do is try and force you to study for your test, not because they want to change you but because they care. I was part of a group that was mostly made of half of the GATE / Honors class and we had a few friends who slacked off a lot in school, we still laughed and hung out but we would always try (not force) to make them understand that it would really help if they tried a bit more
SJDVqxyIaa	It isn't bad...you only do that because you're more comfortable talking to someone online or through texting because you feel like you're talking to them but not really talking to them. You have a guard up and its easier to communicate this way. I was just like you when I was younger. You'll grow out of it. But the only way you will is by forcing yourself to call people you normally text and text ppl your normally talk to online. You'll see its not as awkward as you think it will be and after a few times you won't feel nervous about it.|`|ia2oWu18aa	u shouldn't be shy like dat.....|`|J2myCXE5aa	your shy.    there is nothing you can do.    i am the same way.|`|BitAsc8daa	yes    maybe you have autism?|`|RNWSAItbaa	I'm like that aswell, maybe you're just really shy.|`|emjxCeFZaa	I think it's okay that you prefer to tell your problems to people you don't really know because they don't judge and don't know you. People who aren't directly in your life have a more objective point of view.  but try to talk to more people...|`|DWwv3v9Raa	I can relate because I'm also shy, I don't think there's anything wrong with that
GxbIx2sOaa	If you want to mend the gap between you and your mother the first thing you need to do is forgive her while acknowledging that it wasnt her fault but at the same time believing that if she had known she would have put a stop to it. That would be the thing I think would be most likely to cause the lack of trust you have for her so you need to think about that and then go talk to her about it and explain how you feel and why. You may offend her if you tell her you don't know what she would have done if she had known but parents are usually pretty quick to forgive their kids when they stop to think about whats going on so just sit down and talk to her. Thats the most important part of it.|`|P0WGuq07aa	You should really talk to a psychologist about this. Yahoo is not the right forum to ask for this kind of help.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	You should try getting help or sit down and talk to your mom. I wish you good luck.|`|dzbblpjgaa	You are a fighter, never prepared to give up. I think you are more mature than your Mother, not sure if she deserves you really. What is her trust issue of you? I suspect it is a thing called deflection and her way of coping with the home situation you once had. I would talk to a close family friend about this, or get counselling as the whole family situation has had an effect on you. What is most important to know is you are not blame for her behaviour past or present.|`|43Im2Wqyaa	JoJo,    Sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds like you and your mother are in quite a bad place with each other at the moment.  I think there are a few underlying problems here rather than just the one that can be easily solved. I think your solution will come with your acceptance of what happened to you, working out and accepting why it wasn't stopped and learning to deal with it to give yourself a chance of a better lifestyle right now. You also need to talk to your mum, openly and honestly and tell her exactly how your feeling. Her part is also essential in fixing your relationship troubles. She needs to listen to you and understand why you are wary of trusting her and then you both need to work out ways to spend time together and things to do/change between you both, so you can gain that trust in her.    Remember, you will only ever have one mother, and you will always be her daughter, no problem should be too tough to solve.

But Its how I really feel about her. So on the card I also put alot of positive about her. So she doesnt think I was being negative all the time. So I mix the letter with lots of positive. And a few negative.

a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	She certainly is smothering you! You are almost 18 and in that time, you will be able to legally do whatever you want. You have to also understand that your mother does love you-but she is being very negative and over protective.    I'm 24 now and I am still not comfortable with going out in public. Why? Because when I was younger my parents were never comfortable with me going out in public. They still aren't-but I go places because I want to be "normal".  Your mother is killing you-she is certainly smothering you. You need to be free to do things. She is hindering your chances of personal survival. She won't be around forever and she needs to realize that.    Because of how I was brought up and raised, even at my age, I still don't like to go anywhere. It truly hinders the person if their parents don't let them do anything.|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	Talk to your mother, tell her you love her, but you want to be treated your age.  Since your a only child, she is more worried about you.  When you talk to her about it, be sweet don't get all mad.  Maybe she has no clue she is doing it who knows, nothing will change unless you talk to her about it.|`|GLQL2IEaaa	oh girl, i'm in the same situation. but idk, i guess i've built trust with my mom.    just tell her, i'm almost an adult so i know how things work. and think of how it's gonna be when i'm actually 18? are you still going to hold me back?|`|oSxgDvUraa	My mother treated me the same way.  I'm 40 now and a mother myself.  When I got older I realized that my mother had alot of fears in life.  She learned to be afraid of everything when she was little and it never changed for her.  You need to point out to your mother that her fears are unreasonable.  Dr. Phil once said these types of people always like to play the "What If?" game and it's not healthy, and he says you must play the what if all the way out.  If she is going to always say "what if?" about everything you want to do then she must play it all the way out...as in "what if you get into a wreck?", that's why there are doctors and emergency rooms, they will most likely fix you.  You're mother can not save you from the world and accidents.  It would be smarter if she helped you learn how to deal with the world now while you're still young.

op4gBJRJaa	Don't say you hate your life, your just really stressed out where your at the point where you cant take it anymore, i suggest you wrap up your confidence, say nasty things back to those people at school and tell your sister to leave you alone, Obviously your dad isn't helping this at all, if your family is struggling and you need money i suggest you talk your mom into suing him, not supporting your family when your divorced is against the law and you can take %90 of his money.    Living in a foster home may seem easier, but just think before you do anything, getting fostered can take a long time before someone actually wants you, also getting along with lots of other kids may be just as worse as getting along with you sister.    Don't give up to easily.  The bible says "Only the ones of try may succeed"    Hope this helps you out|`|jIYNDnW1aa	No, no, no, no no, NO!!!! You dont' want to live in a "Foster Home!" For 2 reasons: First being a foster child would make the kids at school tease you even more, and thats no fun. Second your life would be even more stressful! Never living in one place forever, changing schools everytime you get a new family, making friends, ect. I know how you feel in the sense that your mom is divorced and has to take upon the father and the mothers responsiblity. However my dad does pay child support. Also about your mom you sound like a more poor family. ( I kind of am in a way too, Im the higher of the low class though, and you sound like the middle of the low class) When you get home make dinner so your mom has one less thing to worry about, pick up around the house a little. You know just help her out. (if your religious pray that your mom will get a raise and just have a little faith) Now as for your sister.....deal with her. She will act like that because she is probally feeling the same way your feeling, but she lets her feelings out. You should work on that too, im not saying putting other people down, but just let people know your happy, angry, mad, sad, frusterated, ect. Nobodys life is easy, (nobodys) but do the best you can. Tip when you get the chance to spend the clothing money get some cute nice clothes and have a smile on your face and look the world in the eye and say "Hello how are you today?" it shows people you have lots of confindence,dont' let the world stomp all over you! If someone teases you say "Thanks, you too!" (in a nice voice) this will show the person its no use in teasing you because they get no reaction and thats what they want! You only live once so make the best out of it!!! Hope this helps!!!|`|oSxgDvUraa	Sweetheart, you need to start turning your frustration into energy in doing good in school and learning as much as you can.  This is the only way you will be able to make better choices for your own life when you are old enough to be on your own.  Remember that "Knowledge is Power".  You can start working in four years part time to help buy yourself clothes.  Foster homes are not always any better and sometimes worse then your own family.  You should go to the library and find some good books about other kids in your situation and this way you will not feel so alone.  Maybe your school has a counselor you could talk to once in a while.|`|XGrNQGEoaa	I want to say I sorry that u aren't getting your needs met. your feeling are valid and I understand your pain. However as hard as it maybe I know me cause of my own experience raised in some foster homes that is not the answer. You think your family is bad a foster home won't be any better. Some parents only want kids for money and they won't take care of you. also most good foster homes only want babies. You will endure a lot of pain because no one will love you like your parents because they are yours. Now that I said that you need to reach out to your mom and sister, they can't read your mind. you need them to listen let them no what you need. explain to your mother that her love is greater than any material thing I'm sure you will get a good response. And lastly the best accomplishment you can do in school is hold your head high and do well when you succeed you will win. Know who you are not what they say u are.|`|7hZ2yzK4aa	Wow. You need to toughen up a little. Listen. Youre 12. you are almost a teenager. of COURSE the world is out to get you.   dad is a loser? a lot of people are losers. most of my family are losers.   think hate your family? at least you get to see them. i'm stuck living in a separate state because some dumba$$ insurance company wont pay for my former home that is falling into a sinkhole. all my sibs and my parents are spread across the face of the earth because we dont have a house to live in. my grandpa busted his hip and had like 3 heart attacks within two weeks. my mom is going through menopause. my dad is in danger of losing his job thanks to obama's big plan. lawyer bills arent even gonna be mentioned right now. thats been going on for an unmentioned length of time. XP  i've been ignored and made fun of my entire life and i'm older than you.   yeah, puberty sucks. but you're mind aint clear. foster life is a last resort, like as in your parents are trying to kill you last resort. your mom is stressed because she wants to make a good living for you. 'hey mom my life sucks see ya around'. so all her hard work is for nothing? thanks for breaking her heart.    still think your life is stressful? it is. but it could be so much worse. you dont know what you have until you lose it, and you dont want to learn that way. try to help your mom. you have no idea how much she'll appreciate it.   i'll be praying for you.|`|AA11731307	Whoa!!!  slow down.  I am  a single mom with three children myself my oldest is 13.  If she were to feel the way you feel I hope that she would talk to me about it before it got to the point that you are at.  Have you talked to your mom?  As far as the clothes, be happy she can do that.  There have been times that I couldn't buy anything for my kids at all.  Your mom probably is miserable. But not because of you.  If she feels anything like I do she probably feels guilty for not being able to be with her children more. Guilt can make a person pretty miserable.|`|JzcKHQKBaa	Girl, I think you are confused. You *do not* want to live in a foster home. Did you even do any research on what can happen to you in a foster home?! Everyone has a stressful life. I am fifteen years old, living with my eight year old brother and my single mother. My mother is an alcoholic and my brother is constantly out of school for behavioral problems. I've never attended the same school for more than two years, and I've lived in more houses than I have fingers.    I've been in and out of homes, and I've lived in a foster home. Let me tell you, I got lucky. I met a few girls who had been in some really awful homes. There isn't just an infinite amount of perfect homes waiting kids, and especially not for whiny pre-pubescent teenagers. People want babies.     Lots of people foster only for the money they recieve (foster parents get money for fostering children.) Not to mention there are plenty of foster homes with abusive parents. Worse, you could end up in a group home, or a home worse of than where you are now.    You have no idea what could happen to you. Yes, you have problems, and I'm sure things are very stressful for you. Things are stressful for everyone. It's life, they way the world works. Who ever told you life was going to be sunshine and rainbows?    Maybe you should join some activities and try to be out more. Focus more on bettering yourself and less on complaining. How are your grades, how do you treat your friends and family? Ever heard of karma?    Besides, you can't just call up a number and magically get a new home. You can't shop or choose your new family, even if you could. Calm down, drink a glass of water, and try researching foster homes. See how much you want to go there then.|`|b9ce9bf88cd13a60c3ecadf9a1f4ab7aaa	Well spoken Secret.  You took the words right out of my mouth.|`|n4rqmxOzaa	growing up I use to feel the same way you did. I didn't really get along with my siblings either and i had at least 12 of them at the time. I felt like i wanted a new family as well. But if you only knew what goes on in most foster homes you would quickly change your mind. Think of it this way at least your amongst people that love you whether they show it or not. Just try sitting down with your mother and telling her how you feel. I too use to keep my feelings weld inside still do to this day. But you must find a positive way to release your anger. For me mine was writing.

Just do it man.   Grow a pair and tell her how you feel.   BUT   since you two have been friends SOOO long.   She's probably already put you in the friend zone.  So you can take your chances on the whole akward friend thing after you tell her, or chance it and something great might happen.   Just do it.|`|00cAPbToaa	aww, sounds like someone is in love, lol....But anyways, to me it seems that its REALLY hard for you to aske her out yourself , and u really cant get urself to do it, so i know this is kinda middleschool stuff, but just tell one of your friends to ask her out for you, or ask her in a note and then give it to her...that seems like the only way:]  good luck!|`|che6yXYNaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1780845 6dzz5z5... just be cool man...

Just the fact that you can write something like that on a whim shows how real your feelings are.    Im not much of a player, but to me it sounds like this girl likes you for you. You need to just get determined man, and with a girl like this you don't need to do anything more than be yourself when you ask her.     Its like jumping into a freezing cold pool.    once you've jumped you cant change your mind, you going in that water.    get stoked about it, and just work up the courage man, and just be like, hey, do you want to go get some ice cream with me sometime?    or maybe ask her to a movie, or dinner!    dinner works great, plenty of time to talk, and you learn more about what she likes. (I don't suggest a movie yet, your either zoning on the movie or making out pretty much)    She wants to be around you man. U do all this stuff with her exclusively. Like my female friends ask me to go to their games and stuff, but most of them are taken, shes single, and she wants YOU to go to her games, and YOU to study with her, and shes complimenting YOU.    Go for it man, best of luck. I really hope this works out for you.|`|2KDvohPDaa	Lemme break it down for you...    YOU DONT ASK HER:    She meets a better guy whu asks her out, they r in love, get married, have kids, live together..Happy ENding    YOU ASK HER: She'll slap you Cuz"WHAT the hell have you been waiting for, so long????"    You're desperately in love with each other..  get married  have kids  get old  die together      ASK HER MAN........      repeat this to her..: You know its been so long but we've never had  dinner together...  do you wanna go out for dinnner..just you n me??|`|IrahyL2Qaa	if you really cant bring yourself to ask her out, and keep freezing up, right a note asking her if she likes you ( this way you can perfect what you want tyo say and not mess anything up), give it to a friend and tell him that no matter what you say, to give it to her, this will keep you from not giving her the letter, thne see what happens....good luck to you, i kow wht it is like same thing happened to me, i lwas like head over heels for this girl, and i did what i just told you to do, it worked, and we are happily still together after 2 years.......also dont worry about asnything, even if the girl is your best friend, if she finds out you like her and she dont like you back, 99% of the time, it doesnt change anything between you two...........oh and one more thing- DONT TELL HER YOU LOVE HER IN THE NOTE take it slow and see how much she likes you first (which im sure she will)    GOOD LUCK !!!!|`|2uXNtCUlaa	This is just so cute...you seem to be really in love with this girl, i think any girl would be lucky to be with a guy like you. Even if she didn't feel the same way, i would say she was missing out on a good guy, just by the way you posted this question. Ok the first thing you do is try to be confident and think about the best way to ask her out for you. if you have no problem talking to her in person or over the phone then go that route..But if your nervous which it sounds like you are tell her on myspace/facbook it is not a cope out if you do it over the internet. OR you could write her a letter and put all your feelings in it, leave it in her locker or somewhere you know she will find it. You don't have to go all fancy to ask her out, sometimes in life the smallest things make the biggest impressions on people. No matter how you choose to tell her, just be yourself and be confident smile while you tell her what your feeling. Just tell her everything that you just told Yahoo answers, this is just so romantic..i don't even know you and reading your question put a smile on my face so imagine how much she will be smiling once you put it all out there and tell her..Best of luck :)|`|2by2Ujblaa	my advice to you, casually ask her if she's interested in anyone, if she says yes, ask her for details, if she doesn't say anything about a specific guy I'd say it's safe to assume she is a little interested in you. then you should tell her EXACTLY how you feel. However, don't go jumping the gun on the soul mate train quite yet as that will probably push her away.  If you have anymore questions, feel free to PM me on here, as I did have a slightly similar situation.

oxmkllnWaa	gentle anal sex can be fun for both (you might want to bring a vibrator for YOUR pleasure... if he can't deal with you using a vibrator while he's taking you anally then HE's got issues).    but other things that you might not have thought of...    "breast sex" is fun... you kinda cradle him between your breasts... you can mix this up with oral or finish with oral that way.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	2 words:  Kama Sutra|`|JpjSGtCnaa	There is no compromising on something like this. You should never be forced or intimidated into doing something you don't want just to make another happy. If he cared for you at all, he'd respect your feelings and consider anal sex with you a no no. What exactly does he do against his wish to please you? Yeah my suggestion is you buy a butt toy and you do the poking up his back door. Let's see if he still thinks it a good time. If he says that's not his thing, tell him nor was it yours but you did it to make him happy so turn over and return the favor!|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	OH here is the compromise.....

Go to your local sex shops, check out local sex-pos, do some research online and figure out what you like the idea of. Frankly if you don't want to do that, then he should be okay with it. You don't have to be harsh and say 'back off' or anything, just tell him you don't like it.     Also, there's nothing wrong with occassionally doing something for your partner if they like it. As long as you aren't feeling pressured to do it, or its not hurting you. Unless you REALLY hate it, then it's fine that you choose to occassionally do that for him. But presenting him with other options you both might like is definitely preferable.|`|hj1qszQtaa	I agree with, "always seeking knowledge."|`|KPnHxU03aa	be brave and tell him to insert carrot in his *** first and ask his experience.. n his emotions too..|`|pKzH1cFHaa	If you don't want to do anal, then he needs to respect that.

FfLq56Yfaa	My husband and I went on a road trip.  We took a week off from work, drove a few days one way, then back.  We stayed in a different (cheap) hotel every night, took in local sites, tried local restaurants.  And spending that much time in a car is a great way to 'test' your marriage!  LOL  Good luck, and congrats!|`|b4kKbT3Daa	MAUI!!!! Went there on my honeymoon and cost us around 2800 for everything hotel car food resort condo!!|`|Whlvlbmmaa	write a list of interests you both have and what you would like to experience on your honeymoon (apart from the obvious) and adapt that to where you want to go, eg if you like swimming and snorkeling well most tropical place have that, if you like historical stuff try Greece, Italy or turkey or even think your own country.  go to any travel agent and tell them your going on your honeymoon and  ask what deal they can do.  my friend went to book her honeymoon this week and was told most places overseas offers discounts for honeymooners as a gift so she ended up being quoted $1000 less for a package for 2 then regular holiday makers would pay.|`|eTxk4lSxaa	Try some of the cheap cruise websites (google cheap cruise) since a lot for the Caribbean leave from Florida, you save on airfare. A last minute booking often sees you get reduced rates and if you don't care about which exact ports of call (it's a honeymoon, why would you?) you can go for the cheapest. When booking mention it's your honeymoon and ask if they will do a freeupgrade.   Hawaii is another beautiful and affordable option, websites like whatif and last minute show the cheaper rates for hotels|`|mXIVMmPSaa	...I hear the Florida Keys are nice-? Plus it's local. Rent a small yacht or houseboat or something if it's affordable.  Or just go hole up in a rustic B&B somewhere. Who said honeymoons had to be expensive, fancy extravaganzas?  Cuba?  Jamaica?   Caribbean?   They're all fairly close to you. Look into average cost of hotels and restaurants there. Sometimes the plane ticket cost is worth it if everything else is cheap. Try to go off the beaten path a bit.   Book hotels and car rentals online. Luckily this is the off-season (for the US) so most things will be cheaper. Look for airfare sales as well, that's usually the most expensive part.  www.tripadvisor.com is a good resource for trip planning, check it out.|`|KOYZfaDkaa	Stay a few nights at the Don CeSar aka "The Pink Hotel" that's on St. Pete Beach! It's beautiful and they have honeymoon packages.

Have fun!!|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	I would seriously think about postponing the honeymoon if you can, because you'll pay top dollar right now for anything in the Caribbean plus you'll be right in the middle of Spring Break.     However, if you have time off now, why not think of somewhere a little off the beaten path for February, like Quebec City or New York?|`|4wlwyhvnaa	1 Oahu- Waikiki Beach I've been there 4 times and it is absolutely beautiful. I've been to Maui, beautiful but not as fun.  Waikiki has beautiful beaches, great night life, great shopping and tons of activities. Waikiki Parc is a cheaper hotel right in the middle of everything and you can get it for a good price.    2 Jamaica- Never been there but I had a friend who went on an all inclusive honeymoon there and said it was unbelievable. Not too sure on the prices.    3 Puerto Rico- If you know Spanish it is great. Absolutely beautiful. You might not enjoy it for a honeymoon if you don't know Spanish though.   Hope this helps if it was me I 100% recommend Oahu and Waikiki beach. You wont regret it.

You should talk to her, and say that you don't want her to date him, and say that she's ruining you're life. ha.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Sorry to hear that. Your mother obviously has some serious problems. Often times, when people that age go after much younger ones, it's due to them wanting to "feel young" and of course, a serious lack of judgment and maturity. That kind of relationship can cause a young person serious harm on the long run. She doesn't know, or care, what kind of damage she's doing to him, regardless of the fact that he may be a "loser". He's a kid, she's an adult, and one rapidly approaching middle age. She should know better. I really don't have any idea how to discuss this with her. The best advise I can give is to bust your tail in school, and get into a decent college. As far as cutting off contact with her in the future, you'll have to decide what's best for you.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I think your mom is sick.

I am very sorry she betrayed your trust in this way, but it seems she cannot help it. she needs long term counseling and group therapy. this behavior is probably the product of sexual abuse much earlier on in her life, and she is acting out those traumatic events. she will need the trust and support of all those around her, including you, her daughter. get her professional help, and soon.    even further, does she have any connection with God? does she pray, or have any relationship with spirituality at all?
a0oMhBtUaa	Its unfair she suddenly told u to leave her alone... i would confront her about why, also say how you feel... theres a reason why she told u to leave her alone, once you know that, things might start going back to the way it was...

To me when most girls say leave me alone they really need your attention cuz something is a matter and they need a shoulder to lean on but they dont want to look vulnerable.|`|n53HeORBaa	maybe she is just having trouble during that time and since you mentioned that you did not approach her anymore she might be thinking that she have offended you and now is too shy to approach you, smile at her first then if she smiles back approach her if she ignores you then send her a little note tell her how you missed having her as a company, bottom line try to communicate with her again|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	stalk her|`|EPM8n6qbaa	maybe she doesnt like you anymore because she has a bf?|`|DklyEeTpaa	Well why would she stop talking to you?

Maybe the boss told her not to talk or goof around so much while she was working?  Did she give you an explanation as to why?  If she didn't, then I would just leave it alone because if you kept bothering her, she could say you were harrassing her.|`|IsPlrwiRaa	everyone has issues with people, people are just ignorant!!!!!!!!11|`|GLQL2IEaaa	leave it alone. maybe she's having some issues.  best to give ehr her space.|`|c3eed016f322f33195a03d27536df75caa	maybe you can ask her what's the problem. if speaking directly is not going to work, you can try sending her a gentle email expressing your feelings and asking her what's wrong, let her know you willing to fix things if possible, and that you appreciated her company, etc. (don't make it too pushy, but be sincere)|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	Talk to her, you should always talk.

Unless you have another definition of the word "aunt" in which case I'm curious to know what that definition is.|`|NP7pZiOeaa	still at it are you ? lol
2o3BHgCCaa	Of course it is still a princess cut! Princess cut refers to the way it is cut, the way the fascets are made to give it particular type of sparkle and that square shape.    Having said that princess cuts are square shaped. As you said it is very rare to get an EXACTLY square princess cut, but most are within .5 (generally much less) of a mm of being square.  If your jeweller buys diamonds from a reputable source (ie certified diamonds) it will have the measurements listed on the certificate before he purchases so you can consult with him to see what is available and what you are happy with.    P.S. it should cost you nothing to view any diamond you want before you purchase. ALL companies send diamonds to jewellers to look over and either pay for and keep or send back. They are insured for this so you pay noithing for the service.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	square and princess cuts are the same thing.     If the dimensions are disproportionate and it becomes oblong, it is put in the radiant category.|`|HEvSVMeVaa	I would think so.    http://www.thediamondbuyingguide.com/pri...
OE8r1VtRaa	Yes it can last, but eventually it wears off and thats when the arguemnts start... but believe me, it CAN work and does work... ;)|`|5V9Ie89Xaa	i wish my relationship was like that!!!!!|`|etHWfGBFaa	Most definitely yes. I met my fiance when I was 16 (I am 22 now) and we had intense passion for 4 years before we even had sex. We lost our virginity to each other when we were 20 and have been very passionate since. That doesn't mean we haven't had our ups and downs and sometimes there are periods of time where the passion isn't as intense but we both know our true love will never fade. :)|`|ZA11WBR2aa	The relationship will last but the intensity goes down after a while.|`|1poSSvTdaa	Of course! That's what every relationship should be aiming for.
EhA66gzcaa	If you seriously want to change urself, not only think positive, but, also do positive steps, like, focusing on ur studies seriously...be friendly and yourself, u dont need to imprees anyoneelse, becoz u have ur own unique personality...remember,  If u want to succeed...be DARING, be FIRST and be DIFFERENT!!!!          good luck!!!|`|ujXdjG1gaa	Think positive...Don't let any obstacles stop you from where your goals. Get where you want to be..and **** everything else.    seriously!!
pIKPFpbiaa	This is an essay not a question.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	no|`|6lfm228eaa	Yeah i believe you can THINK your in love with someone that you haven't met but when you meet there is a high chance that love would fade    sorry x|`|vGWD8Zncaa	What you're talking about is not really "love".    Colloquially, that's more what you'd describe as "being in love with the IDEA of love".    Sure, you can like some of the qualities you see in him but you don't really know him well enough to truly "love" him.|`|SnpP6dGFaa	Yes, you can fall in love without meeting someone.  Although, I think what you're talking about seems more like a crush.  You've never even seen a picture of him. And if your sister is going out with him then chances are he's around her age - especially since he was in her phone.  And you're probably the younger one.  How old are you?  I'm guessing 14 -15 by the way you talk.  So it wasn't love dear - far from it.  It was a little crush.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	oh sweetie im going through this right now.    but no sister involved.    i don't think its anything more that just wanting a person to give you that kind of affection    like for me right now im in houston and im talking to this guy who lives in a city close to my town back home.    and im secluded up here and when he started messaging me it seemed as though i had "actual" feelings for him but im realizing now that its because im vulnerable and my emotions are on high and alot of other things so my advice to you is just let it go.    hes dating your sister now and if he had actual feelings like you did for him he wouldnt be dating her now would he?|`|AA10682405	Of course you can fall in love with somebody you haven't met in person if you know them. Love is an emotion, and if you can have an emotional connection with somebody, you can love them.   Love takes knowing somebody very well, and being emotionally connected to them, not seeing them and being physically connected.  Anything that people do physically or in person is meant to compliment the love you already have for them. It's supposed to be an expression of your love for them, and not something a relationship is built on.  An emotional connection is an emotional connection, no doubt about that. And love is an emotion, completely not based on the physical, although of course having a physical attraction helps. But you know what he looks like, that's enough.|`|og3Tmn0saa	I've done it twice...|`|Pk02ucx2aa	I have one time. I got to know someone on the internet & there was a STRONG connection & all ways possible of communication. The love was there from both of us. He fell in love HARD for me, more then I did for him,but I did fall for him. We met later.    It does happen, but NOT always.|`|UyITmoH7aa	what?|`|5O3JD29iaa	Well some people (Like yourself) can and will fall in love with people they've never met. I think maybe the whole time he has liked you, but maybe didn't know how u felt about him so he didn't tell you. He might be one of them guy's that are just going out with your sister to see what u'll do or see if u care at all. I think u should just get over him thou because it's not worth fighting over a guy exp if he's dating your sister, and long distent relationship's never work for anyone. Plus once u meet him your feelings might not be the same. **True me ... I've went on and off with a guy for 3 years and just finally we now got over each other and realized its not ment to be right now, but he lived near me then moved to FL wit his family then just recently came back on his own and when he left n came back our feelings were the same, but were just not ment to be together.** So I think maybe u should just try and get over him before u hurt yourself or ur sister. Plus not to sound mean, but I think ur confusing love with something way diffrent. It takes alot to actually truely love some and really know them. I mean yea there may be feelings for one another, but I really think u should just try and move on! Hope I helped!! Good luck!!|`|HPCetoNkaa	Trust me on this no and says alot about the guy if he's seeing your sister and texting you. ??? Cmon hes a guy how do you think you look from his point of view? Don't depend on a guy to make you feel good you got you and that should be enough. If anything you should be offended hes still texting you just friendly or not it aint right|`|oEfnqmp3aa	Love is not something that exists because of physical contact. All the religious people and their love of their various gods is a definitive example of that.    I know from years of handling internet communication that a person must realize that regardless of the medium, human-to-human communication is still interaction between humans. The presence of a face or body does not change the form of identity. Even if one attempts to behave differently than they would in person, that is still attached to their identity just as when someone in person trys to act differently.    All the traits that are important to a human, personality, can be conveyed just fine through words. I'm sure blind people are experts on this matter, the lack of a connection between a person's face and getting to know the person.    All that exists between humans ... exists. The medium does not matter. Yes, it can be true love even if you have not yet been with him.    Furthermore you have indeed "met" him. To meet is to encounter a specific identity. And you have certainly come to know the identity that is him. Your heart no doubt has the same experience and sensations that could define the act of meeting someone.  So quite simply you should try speaking differently in that regard, specifying "physically" or something.

ohUm00RYaa	Tell her how great Morocco is.  Never really been to Morocco, I myself am from algeria (south of wuh'ran) and would run into morocaans all the time.      From my understanding morcoo is one of the most western countries in africa. Its not a bad country and an educated western can make a good living in africa.  I'd convince her that morocco is better and tell her all about how great morocco.  I come froma rural area where people basically do whatever they want, so I'm not familiar with the typical moroccan major cities like al-rabat but I'm sure its nice from all the stories i hear|`|afkygHMgaa	Nobody who lives in the states is going to want to move to Morrocco.|`|rQfzifT7aa	Talk to her about it before you get married. Take her over there and let her see how beautiful it is.|`|CPvv9vWxaa	"How do I ask her to move with me to Morocco after we marry?"    Be straightforward and honest with her before you marry, and I don't just mean 2 hours before the wedding ceremony!!     Tell her as soon as you can, so that she will know what to expect from the marriage, what life in another country and culture will be like for her etc.   Its is important for you to be honest with each other right now. You be honest, only then can she be honest with you. Good luck.|`|2MVG5StDaa	You tell her your desires about moving back to Morocco before you marry the woman.  She may not want to move to Morocco.  So be upfront first before you marry the woman otherwise you might find your marriage ended quickly with an annulment.|`|FgVvTnyOaa	this is not something you bring up after you marry!! it is possible she will be excited to move there with you, how exotic ! and, no, it is ignorant to say that "no person living in the States would move there"  I would, for the man i love! The key is to give her time to adjust to the idea, the more she thinks about it the more she may like the idea. Well wishes!|`|i557GwTuaa	Take her there on vacation first and then you ask her. Maybe that would help.|`|tqJeFCYZaa	Open your mouth and ask.

70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	The media. There's been a moral shift in society in recent years. TV shows that glamorize promiscuity and sex is mainstream. It's all around us.|`|zka26204aa	They are not truly dedicated to their partner.  It is a way to cheat with permission.  They should never have married in the first place.  Marriage is a commitment to partner with one other person for life.  Cheating is cheating whether you have permission to cheat or not!!     A verbal commitment to a partnership is the same.    It is like saying that you will be each other's steady booty call, but you will have other booty calls too!  How can you call that love?  That is in no way represents a commitment to a relationship.  Why even bother?  Just call them when you feel like seeing them.|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	What is really sad is that a recent poll of the sexual activity of European nations showed that Britons were the most likely to be unfaithful to their partners. Results showed eight out of 10 women and six out of 10 men admitting they had cheated on a long term partner.    The medical explanation for open relationships is  that, according Dr Robin Baker, a leading practitioner in the physiology of sexual behaviouralism, "we're unfaithful lies with our reproductive strategy. This is the method by which we assure we get the most opportunities to breed with the best possible partners."    However, the behavioral viewpoint is  as follows. Dr Ruth Norman, a behavioural psychologist with an interest in polygamy, has an unorthodox view on the subject. "Monogamous or polygamous behaviour is an intrinsic part of our sexuality in the same way that homosexuality or heterosexuality is. Some people are naturally inclined to polygamy in the same way that some people are naturally attracted to members of their own sex. It's just that society in general is prejudiced towards those sexual types."|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Easy, they don't want to get bored and unlike the rest of the deceitful or self depriving public, work well staying together. Sex and love, not always the same thing. Try it--it really brings you closer together in a kinky and fantastically fun way! You must be careful though that your marriage is strong, secure and emotionally mature.   Most cannot handle that. But then, those are all the same ones who end up divorced too! Have fun with all that. My husband and i don't ever lie, we don't ever cheat and we certainly are not promiscuous. We do however, have a sex life and a darn fun one at that!!! It sizzles between the sheets in our home...but maybe that's why we also have sex with each other much more frequently than most couples after well over a decade!|`|2af0846f15f70079f1cd48b8e6d1218daa	I think they most have very little work ethic for everything including making themselves or other people happy.|`|EOdbrMkmaa	because after long time it become very borring, and in that time you need extra satisfaction in your life.|`|DM6bTcx9aa	i believe they are bored,it can only lead to a breakdown in the relationship,what happened to trust and commitment, if the relationship lasts there will always be guilt and mistrust|`|vjT4E9TPaa	Its not that they are bored they are looking for that special someone that can do it all. mental, physically, emotional and financially .  I think they are stupid|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I have no idea why but its something that my husband and i would never do that's for sure.|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Hold on! Aren't you an advocate for open relationships?     |`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	Seriously it depends on who one is hanging with... most people I know do not swing.... but like minds......|`|AA11993638	Didn't know they were as I do not know even one couple who is doing this and I know a lot of people who are in relationships. I would guess if this is happening in your area it is merely a total lack of morals this country and the world are turning to and accepting as normal. Sad to say this will probably be a part in the downfall of the human race.|`|rQfzifT7aa	after so many years of the same thing day in and day out. Instead of one party cheating on the other one and the other getting hurt and getting betrayed. It is so much easier just to do it out in the open. There are so many women on here that are so hurt by there husbands affairs and it breaks their spirits. And men too. They are hurt that their wives have done the ultimate deal breaker.     I don't care who you are after 10-15 years of the same thing it does get boring. I don't care how much you try to spice it up.    It is so much easier just to have everything out in the open and there is no cheating, no betrayal.    The key is knowing that at the end of the day your spouse loves you and you love your spouse and you are going home together. If you don't have that bond, then that would not be the best lifestyle for you    I know the lifestyle is not for everyone because not everyone has the right mindset. And some men and women don't want another person touching there spouse but I would guess 90% of those people have had some sort of an affair.     There are to many girls out her pulling there panties off for any and everybody. And men too.. It is just to easy.    So, in my opinion it saves a whole lot of hurt and everyone who can handle this type of relationship and wants it, I am happy for them      Just my opinion|`|0mhcCyE5aa	I could never do that!!!!!    I think it is because they refuse to end things and think that might help!!!    I could never allow my man to sleep with another woman, nor would I want to sleep with another man!!!!|`|rH4eUC9Baa	I wish I knew some of those people.|`|9sejOjSGaa	I think its interesting  you should see this episode of the Tyra show  where they had a open relationship|`|ib10oHUZaa	insecure ..|`|QDrAGIOeaa	Must be pretty lame couples.

51Ib0kxVaa	you obviously have doubts. 2 weeks in a foreign country sounds like too much to me, especially as you don't really know them that well.   I know I'm the cautious sort, but I think if you were ok about it you wouldn't be asking on here.  On balance I would say decline because I feel if it didn't go your way it would be hard to get home quick.

wZ2HrJeJaa	Actually, I am Agnostic.    I would prefer Agnostics and Deists over anything else really. Because most (not all) religious people that ACTUALLY FOLLOW their religion such as Christians and Catholics are really not my type, because we usually have different view points on a lot of "things".   Furthermore, although I am Agnostic, religion is very important to me in a relationship because religion describes a person, not wholly, but it still shows some aspects of a person's personality and I cannot deal with someone that believes in something that isn't reasonable to me.     But overall, it really depends on the person because I judge on personality other than religion and attitude; I might also make a few exceptions for religious people because I don't discriminate against religion nor race, etc., it's just harder to get along with someone I am going to spend my life with if we don't have that in common.  Plus, the main reason why people that follow a certain "religion" whether it's being an Atheist, Christian, Buddhist, or Catholic are extremely annoying because most of them are contradictory and don't even really follow all the rules to their religion, they mainly just pick what they want to believe in and follow it, and if you're a true believer, then you would follow all the guidelines according to that religion.    pss. This goes for Atheists too, because I believe that "god" cannot be proven to exist NOR not exist|`|DZB0WCmmaa	I don't care about any religion, but since the boy is religious, it is more likey that he wouldn't date me.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	I'm an athiest... well, more agnostic and as long as him religion didn't affect our relationship (for example if he was saying he didnt want to have sex until he was married) then I wouldn't find, also as long as he didn't expect me to convert.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I think I would be with anyone EXCEPT for an athiest. I would not want someone that wouldn't believe.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I think it's easier if they are the same. They have essentially the same beliefs and same views on certain things.|`|l973fSEqaa	definitly, the guy i like is atheist and i could really care less  (:|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Yes.  I am more interested in the type of person they are.  Being religious or not, does not make a person a better or worse person.  Each person is different.|`|wE2etBzbaa	I'm a guy, and I don't want religious freaky chics to be interested in me.  Religious freaky chics are for religious freaky jerks.    Edit:   And no you religious freaky priests, you also not welcome to be interested in me.   Hear it Haggard-fans     Moderates and open minded is ok though|`|4vv1ElyJaa	I would date someone of a different 'religion' to me (if he was fine with it) and if he didnt go on about religious stuff and accepted my beliefs...|`|kfNBVZH6aa	I really don't think that even matters at all!|`|8IIVBPwkaa	No I would not. I used to be a Christian, and the Bible specifically says that you should not be with anybody who is not a Christian. This is because God is supposed to be put at the centre of your relationship, which is not possible if one of you does not believe, or believes something different.    Now I am an atheist, and would not date someone of a faith because I think if you believe in a religion you have to take it seriously and put your god first, and I would not want this to come between myself and the person I was with. It would take up their time, e.g. a Christian at church on a Sunday, it would mean differences in opinion on topics like sex before marriage, how to bring up children, etc, and I think it would be much too difficult.     Of course, it depends on how seriously you take your faith. If you are nominally a Christian, for example, because your parents are and you have always gone to church, but you don't really believe in the Bible, etc, then it probably wouldn't matter if you dated someone of a different faith (but it might annoy your family, which could make life difficult).|`|0dbwA1dVaa	It depends. Dating and marriage are two different things. I think I could date someone who was an atheist or of a different religion, simply because I want to let my light for God shine. I would like to be a good example in their life of a Christian and what Jesus can do! I don't know... it's a really loaded question.     God Bless!|`|75SSAFsPaa	No and No I take the religious question as fundamental belief system because I do not care for RELIGION but I strongly believe in God.I would have a friend as such but not if they try to push their belief system or non belief system on me..you see those who do not believe have the tendency to do the exact thing they accuse believers in doing Judging and pushing.but then get all upset when we want to share how we feel..I really do not need that crap in a friend.or a lover|`|rl11rrqVaa	A very good move u have made!|`|nGR3IfgXaa	sorry he's gotta believe in jesus christ .|`|FaLJJii4aa	kinda depends a=on how long we get along and if there is any problems. not really any problem wat religion u are just hhow good u ge along|`|Q9jumG7qaa	i wud date them! i am an agnostic n i went out with a catholic!|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	dating yes.. marry no.. and depends on which part of the world you are in..|`|Q0ZzFakfaa	I am catholic but not at all very orthodox. My family is quite lax about religion.

I would date someone with a different religion because you might even be able to convert them to your own. am i right?|`|lc9nus8taa	yea i probably would but i would prefer if he belived in Jesus    but i wouldnt if he was like a devil worshiper or something lol|`|e0urnErUaa	no|`|DITBVWjPaa	All religions and even atheist...really..how much you love and cherish and respect each other as a person..should matter..those that use religion as an "excuse" is wrong..we should respect and learn about each other...that is what makes or breaks us.    Mutal Respect for what you believe in..its either compatible or mutual.|`|TUEuQIJuaa	If i really loved him, nobody in the world would stop me from seeing him. but in the end it's all up to me. even if his religion is weird as long as he's not... well i wouldnt date a morman.... that's crazy....or be in a colt..... yea|`|lgNomnqpaa	I would go for a man who's very similar to me in most ways, especially religion & his religious level.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	Im going through the same thing..the guy i like is an atheist, but i like him so i would date him anyways. Dating people of different beliefs can put a strain on the relationship especially if you have strong convictions on your faith. I think the proper thing to do would be slowly introduce him to your religion, don't force it down his throat,and if he refuses then it is up to you to decide if you guys are compatible. And if you can still handle it, and the two of you don't get into fights a lot  then you still have a chance of a healthy relationship despite the fact of difference in religion.|`|ZuD07BKNaa	Religion is important, but I would date a guy whose religion is different than mine.  I am very open-minded and not that serious when talking about religion (like I wouldn't try pushing my religion onto someone), so to me it would be just another interesting conversation.  Same goes for an atheist.  It's the guys life to decide what they believe.   But I know there are some girls where this would be a deal Breaker...|`|wJ45gsyZaa	Because my relationship with God is such a big part of my life, I couldn't be with a guy who didn't understand that or have it for himself. It would always be a separation in our relationship, a place where we couldn't understand eachother. Too much for me. I need to be all in.
jTV6rLX3aa	It doesn't matter. There are a million things you can do on a first date. If you guys are both cool enough and if the chemistry is there, then it doesn't matter what you do. I am assuming that you will have ample time before/after the movie to talk about the movie or grab some coffee for a chance to talk.|`|tGebSk1Xaa	i met the love of my life by taking her to Gigli, with Jennifer lopez. i told her that i like to pleasure myself while thinking of ben affleck and she fell for me right then. i think the key to the whole evening was that i brought my own popcorn, unpopped, i like the kernels. she said that the crunching noises that i made were annoying to the people around us but made her very horny. now when we make love i chew popcorn kernels as loud as i can and our love life is amazing. they can make you gassy though, so make sure you have an escape for the gas out from under the covers to the side, it kills the mood if the smell comes up by your heads and you are breathing heavily and get a big whiff of popcorn induced flatulence.|`|749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	It might be bad because there are few chances to talk (during the movie).    It might be good because there are fewer times to have to talk (such as during the movie).     I know a guy who took a girl on a first date... to see... none other than... the Jackass movie (I think it was part II). VERY awkward...
eT9cRbgFaa	because you dont get to talk to your date! considering its your 1st date,  you will want to get to know her better and find out her interests ETC... but if you feel the evening is going nowhere, take her to the movies afta dinner or whatever!     1st dates should be fun and enjoyable, take her to mini golf, or the theter or something she enjoys!!!!! the movies is FAR to common and its as though you put no thought behind it!!!!!|`|zka26204aa	Because you are not able to talk and get to know each other.  A nice dinner, or something that allows for conversational interaction between the two of you, is better.  That way you can learn more about each other in order to see if you are both interested in seeing each other again.|`|dhG4Fffbaa	Its Not lol thats what happened to me and i've been with my girl for 2 years lol and shes the one that invited me and paid for my ticket|`|vSAQqGa8aa	its not a terrible idea, its just over played and I think boys take girls there because they feel they have a chance to maybe getting a kiss or a make out session.

If you take me to the movies I want to actually watch the movie.|`|09DE4NG3aa	It's not a terrible idea, but you won't be able to talk to each other or find out anything about each other.  What about meeting up for coffee, or having takeaways on the beach?|`|KE1L1ZY9aa	If a movie is the ONLY thing that you're doing, then it's a VERY bad idea.  The simplest reason is that you can't really talk during a movie.   One would want time to talk to his/her date to get to know them better, which is much easier on a lunch or dinner date.|`|DyuWvcgjaa	well i think the first date is about communication.  u dont really get to talk during a movie, do you?|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	The reason for a first date is to get to know each other. We can't get to know each other if we're both staring at the movie screen. A movie date would be better for a third or fourth date..|`|NEfezEUQaa	Because you're not learning anything about your date.  all you're doing is sitting side by side.  Great way to get to know someone.|`|afkygHMgaa	Well...it is not the BEST idea since you do not get the chance to talk and get to know eachother. A movie AFTER dinner somewhere would not be bad but sitting in a theatre the whole time is just not a way to connect.|`|L9MDzufnaa	If you don't know the person, you're stuck sitting beside them for several hours without talking. - NOT a good way to get acquainted.|`|KBtDdsNAaa	cuz on a first date you wanna be able to communicate and socialize|`|oGzcWDNeaa	In the movies, you cannot communicate like you would be able to at dinner. if you got to the movies, of course the movie will be playing which means there is about 2 hours of not being able to get to know one another. also a movie is very generic and some girls could get bored of being taken to the movies so often.
bIimm8fSaa	LOL  You will never know!  I hit my husband the other night, in the middle of the back.  Not once, but twice.  I honestly didn't do it on purpose, but it could have been my conscious.  I work night shift, so he sleeps on all sides of the bed.  When I'm home he crowds me.  I was aggravated when I woke up and could barely move.  He likes closeness he says.  So do I, but let me have my space when I'm sleeping or you may get an accidental black eye!  j/k|`|GbwLZ28maa	LOL this is seriously funny, I'm sorry.   Give her the benefit of the doubt.  If she does it again well bring her to the doctor for some sleep problems.  I'm serious.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	leave b4 it gets worse got to a safe shelter|`|hxG4zLX5aa	threaten to dream of punching her and see how well she sleeps|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	Get a piece of steak and put in on the eye.... to avoid a shiner.... before going to bed at night monitor what your wife is watching......     Something like that happened to me.... Hubby hit me in the face... he was dreaming he was on Jeopardy and when he hit me that was him buzzing to answer the question..... hubby was forbidden from watching Jeopardy after that and never got hit again.....|`|JnH9X34Taa	It may of been a dream..  But my thoughts lean towards the "did-it-on-purpose" thing. lol|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	If she is not one to hit I would say she was dreaming my husband does this stuff in his sleep sometimes ,he don't hurt me but he has smacked my back or leg before no big deal.I know he loves me and never hits ,|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	rofl this is teh funnniest thing ive ever heard. She might have been dreaming...|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Um    Give her benefit of the doubt. If you wake up with another one, put socks over her hands when she sleeps|`|KncPJwIaaa	shake it of man if she do it again shame on you|`|Y8zivPXBaa	i would believe her. i remember when i was sleeping next to someone, i dreamt i was karate-kicking people in my dream. when i kind of woke up, i caught myself kicking the person and the person yelling at me. =)|`|rQfzifT7aa	It really depends on how you feel.. If this is not something normal, then I would say she may be telling the truth.     However if you believe she is abusing you, it could fall under domestic violence laws and you could have her arrested.     Go to your local law enforcement and tell them you want to sign a warrant for domestic violence during business hours|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	Jag her tonight while she is sleeping.Jag her deep and under and tell her it is a dream. Jag the ****.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	If you trust her than let it go, it could've been a dream about the fight where she hit you, lol. It happened during the night when you were asleep, let it go and trust her. If she says she didn't do it on purpose don't sweat it. let it go and just brush it off as a freak accident.|`|6DWJAaSeaa	my husband has never hit me nor hurt me in anyway, but the other night he had a dream and hit me in the shoulder in the middle of the night.. it wasn't hard nor did it hurt so i'm guessing your girl had a worse dream.. but hay it does happen...if it happens again then i would be concerned!|`|ccp0fmQcaa	sounds like my wife|`|Y0zNfd19aa	GET HER *** IN JAIL!|`|AenRh1eRaa	good right hook|`|C9th0daNaa	thats not cool|`|znvx2NMQaa	when you go to sleep tonight keep your right eye open that way u will see her if she tries to abuse your right eye aswell.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	She not only did it on purpose but probably ruined your shirt too. Perhaps its time to have a talk about what you did to make her so passive/aggressive. Maybe you don't let her get her feelings out and start yelling at her during disagreements. Maybe you think you are always right and hold everyone else up to a higher standard than yourself. I don't know, I am just thinking about my husband.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Maybe she had a dream that she punched you in the right eye.    You may consider sleeping with a pillow between your legs......those night terrors can make one scream out in the middle of the night.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I've done this to my partner a few times - once I kicked him really hard and twice I've punched him.  It's a sleep disorder, but I don't remember the name of it, but it's kinda similar to sleep-walking.  The body responds to something in a dream and you act it out without being consciously aware of it.  This can show up at various times, often during stress but can sometimes just happen.  It's not that unusual - the body can have strange responses while sleeping, think of talking in your sleep, some people even get up and eat and aren't aware of it until morning, if at all.    Trust me, if your wife just wanted to punch you she wouldn't wait till you're asleep to do it.    EDIT:  It's known as REM Behaviour Disorder - look it up and believe your wife.|`|fArUNIfRaa	you should do her in her sleep  that way if she says "what the hell?"  you could just say you were dreaming too.  lol|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Just tell her its wrong and you dong like it,she shuold apologise en see ifit will happen again,i wonder how one can hit someone on a dream|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	i've hit my bf before. (even in a few places where it hurts.) He laid a good one on me one time while he was sleeping too. It's just natural i guess.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	eh, she probably hit you in her sleep. sometimes aggression comes out in your sleep.   i kicked the crap out of my husband the other night in my sleep... but I had been irritated with him all day... i had dreams that i was in a fight and ended up kicking him right in the shin|`|Sfxzrjaoaa	OK, so you find this erotic? Take out a restraining order against her...that will pay her back. It's the only cowardly thing to do! You'll really enjoy it!|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	Okay..she was sleep and just so happen to attack you in her sleep...and she was able to land a perfect shot on  your eye..hhmm..If your writing to us than obviously you don't believe her yourself...lol..I think that she is trying to pull a fast one on you...and what can you say that was a great lie...but it is not unlikely true.......so yeah it was the shirt that still upset her hun....So next time wear a face guard to bed after a fight...or next time it will be your jewels...oouucchh!!!    Oh, and try not to go to bed angry at eachother....do your best to eliminate the issue before going to bed.|`|PlUmrtnXaa	good for her|`|e5FoLh2Paa	You're not still whining about that damned Izod shirt?  What are you 7 or 8 years old.  You need to grow up buddy!!!|`|Xp2YN4eOaa	Ive hit my boyfriend in my sleep and vice versa. If she really wanted to hit you because of an argument don't you think she would hav done it while you were arguing. I mean who hits someone while they are sleeping. And I would be laughing too don't be so sensitive.|`|tsQoCzuMaa	just wait a see how it plays out|`|kIU3iGwNaa	Only you can trule answer this. You know your wife, is she the type to actually hit you in your sleep?    You said she has never done this before so chances are that it was an accident. If you have been together for a long time, you should know her well enough to judge whether she is lying or not.    It is a perfectly reasonable explantion about the dreaming thing. And an argument over a shirt is hardly worth the effort.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Did you turn the other cheek ?|`|Fjm7RnD2aa	Laughter is nervousness... it certainly sounds suspicious whether it was subconscious or deliberate. If it happens again you will have to start sleeping in separate rooms!    A woman scorned..... is a dangerous woman.   Replace your shirt and watch your arguments!|`|mpc0ex2Uaa	That's what you get for coming home so late...drunk as all hell...smellin like cheap cigars, Pabst and titty sweat.|`|qUyusUf0aa	Try Hiitting her
DyuWvcgjaa	we all know that at some point or another all guys behave like that,   it isn't right but its a fact.  ''comparing'' is natural with them,  its gross no doubt.  hopefully they'll grow out of it...    when they tell u about their girlfriends though.....that's different...i mean....look at us girls...we ALWAYS tell our best friends all about our boyfriends and stuff..how romantic they are..bla bla bla...the works....so maybe when they tell u stuff....its obviously not about comparing but about being able to tell someone about their girlfriends in the non ''my girl is better'' way but the way we talk about them.    i mean...when ur happy and in love....u want to tell the world about it...and u see that rarely in guys do they get a chance to talk about it because their friends will only kid around abt their girlfriends.....    so i think ur like a gift to them! ur the only person they can talk to ....ask advice maybe....|`|S6Trp9xSaa	Those guys are just immature. I'm sure you'll meet a nice mature guy someday!|`|hZuq2XT9aa	guy's are like that even my boyfriend is open about our sex life...  The thing that peeve's me off is when he tell's me about other people's  it's disturbing|`|AA11093967	guys would be guys... no matter what age, what type, what upbringing they had. guys would be guys.. just like gals are still gals. whatever the gender is, we all love to make silly remarks and boast of being better than the other.    thing is, being their friend doesn't hold you back from defending them. you still enjoy their company.. and them, yours.     so just as long as enjoyment is shared between friends, let it pass... a li'l blank ink would never cover a whole canvas... spoil it, maybe, but majority of the canvas would still not be bother by a li'l spot.    ciao...
EemUvfwgaa	to my best friend. she sometimes make mistakes that i want her to realize on her own without me telling her. like making me worried sick by not calling or sending me text messages for like 1 week. and when i ask her why, she'll said that she wants me to miss her. hell. so i'll avoid talking to her and ignores her until she apologize for what she did. i don't usually talk about what i really feel. sometimes i usually just ignore little mistakes. but i hate it when someone makes me worry and then tell me that they did it on purpose. i do it just to let her know that it's not always okay with me since i'm not even talking about my feelings.|`|hwQoOSfRaa	Yes to my kids.  My daughter is stealing constantly, and won't stop.  At the moment, just from us, but as we all know, if she carries on it'll progress.  So I asked a community police officer to have a chat with her.  Cruel yes, but necessarily.|`|2EklweZEaa	My friend ran away from her foster home, and at midnight, a policeman came round to my house asking me to tell them if she contacted me. A few hours later she phoned me. Unfortunately, I decided to turn her in. She thanked me later, as it was the right thing to do.|`|r6OQkyIGaa	You've told her she's FAT, you lose.    Anyway, to answer the Q in full.  Last Christmas day just after dinner I noticed 'that' look on my pet dog Tiger. I let him outside to do the business.  After some minutes he returned, but the look was still there !  Trapped wind.    Remembering an old wives tale I began kicking him in the belly !  He yelped non-stop.  We had to tie him to the gate post outside as his crying woke the baby upstairs !    2 hours 20 minutes later. With the sweat pouring off my face, he finally let 'it' go.  He collapsed soon after.    Sometimes its good to be cruel, to be kind !!  :)
YoswmsWKaa	to be totally honest it depends on your current relationship with the girl. do you already know her? is she a friend that you would like to be more than friends with?is she a girl at school? generally the closer friends you are the harder it will be to turn her into something more than friends, however you cant really go around asking girls on the street out because then you will come off as wicked creepy, but that's getting into a whole other problem. as for the first date itself i stay away from places like the movie theater where you cant talk to get to know her. personally ive always like cheap quirky first dates. a favorite is taking her mini golfing or ice skating. both of those allow you plenty of time to get to know her and talk about whatever you want but they aren't as awkward as a coffee shop would be. especially for a first date dinners and coffee shops tend to feel like job interviews because there isn't a whole lot of things to keep you engaged and will force you to face the awkward situation that you are both in. i would save coffee for a 3rd or 4th date maybe a week when you are both pretty busy and only have 10 min to spare for a quick drink and chat.    also i cant stress this enough be sure to let her know that it is a date. if you just ask her to hang out you will get put in the friend zone and that is a horrid place to be. if all goes well you should be standing at her front door giving her the first kiss|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	i don't like the idea of a movie on a first date. it takes away you getting to know her.    if you only have 3 hours and you spend half of it watching a movie, you 1/2 as much as you could have if you didn't watch the movie.    i like the idea of an ice rink, because if you both suck, or if you're really good, you can HOLD HANDS, assuring her that you won't let her fall. that builds trust and later builds a bond.    i think ice rink is best... followed by.... a bike ride because it's both free and a nice gesture to show you like being outside  and maybe on a third date a walk along the beach AT NIGHT (granted that you have a beach) otherwise, i'd say go somewhere where it's ABSOLUTELY PACKED. that way, you HAVE TO hold hands. and if you don't let her go. she won't stray away. it builds trust and a bond.    so    1. ice rink  2. bike ride.  3. beach stroll at night or super crowded area|`|zQQd2wPRaa	It all depends on the person's interests and personality. Does she know  you like her? Does she know you want to be with her?    I think that clearly any female  would get the impression that you liked her if you asked her out without any one else around.    Coffee is not too casual-especially for the first time. A quiet place is perfect for getting to know someone.|`|yB6Vg65Daa	After the coffee, you could take her to a movie or go for a walk in the park. That should be simple, but good enough for her to know that you're interested in her. Good luck!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Why not make it a movie and coffee after.|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Coffee shop is a great idea!  I agree and you should note the word 'date' when you ask her out in order to make it clear.  My boyfriend and I went out for coffee on our first date and then a walk around town, which you could also do, weather permitting.  Other ideas are bowling or skating.      Avoid going to a bar as it can be too noisy and the setting a bit ...less romantic in my opinion.      Rememer to bring breath mints after to avoid coffee breath!|`|h99Mcg6taa	Sports bar?  Dinner maybe?  And give her subtle hints that would let her know that it's a date, look into her eyes, smile, be a gent...  Oh, and coffee is lame, that's something you have w/ a coworker or a blind date, in case they're hideous.|`|SLiGpyoqaa	Make sure you mention the word 'date' to her. If you don't, you'll give her the wrong impression. Yes, coffee is fine. Find a quiet corner, though!|`|saG3rgnzaa	1st date should be simple n relaxing.     I'd be really happy if the wanted to take me into a small cafe. Or a walk near nature, where theres water and trees n such.  Like, so it's easy to chat. Movies is a really bad 1st date in my opinon. n' some girls might be creeped out if you asked her to visit your home. So, just simple is the best.|`|6o6Ao1Paaa	Well yes. But not every girl have the same answer. Maybe she don't.|`|EU25Jvtqaa	u can take her for coffee at a quiet place..  after the coffee.. u can go to a some place in ur town from where the city looks beautiful in the moonlight.. don t try anything naughty coz of the ambience.. just tell her u love the place n wanted to show it to her..  i hope she likes it.. n u both are able to see the glitter in each others eyes..  all the best!!|`|nC8GRKxhaa	Movie screams ITS A DATE. Coffee is maybe more suttle. If she is smart (surely you want that), she will judge if it's a date by your actions. Not by the setting. I mean if you are takign her to coffee, you pay, you ask her questions, you show her interest, you touch her leg or hand under the table. She will absolutely be into that, and probably be thinking more along the lines of 'i have scored an awesome guy, he is into me' rather than 'is goign to coffee really a date?'. I woudl think of it as a date, but make sure you display that to her. Don't worry about what looks liek a date and what doesn't - thats too subjective.
p0ioXUM2aa	porn makes guys horny and we need to c*m so no problem even if a friend is there - more unusual  if they were watching porn and didn't jerk themselves off - have fun and go with him next time|`|olMVfnljaa	Eeeew, guys just don't do that together. If you have any doubts of him being straight, and think he's weird (he sounds it)! Dump him!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Actually, it's not that uncommon at all.  Many guys will jerk off watching porn together, or go to adult cinemas and do the same thing.  It doesn't mean they are gay, it simply means they are typical horny males who don't have some of the issues other men have.    It doesn't mean he's NOT gay or bi either-it doesn't really mean anything at all other than his libido works pretty normally.|`|6yO76ySNaa	Errr id be worried too love.   kind of screams out gay to me :/|`|9ko5WUFkaa	It's not exactly normal, but it's not that unusual either.  Guys don't always feel as uncomfortable as girls about these kind of things.  It doesn't mean he's gay - if he jerked his friend off then maybe you've got something to worry about.  Some guys just do this - I can't explain why but they do.  I wouldn't worry about it...|`|AA11436843	I wouldn't worry too much about it, it doesn't mean he's gay.  I've heard of this before, even to the stories of how far they could 'shoot' lol  Sounds to me like a bit of fun, blokes - the same as girls - sometimes experiment together....it really doesn't mean their gay though|`|KBtDdsNAaa	ummm yeah thats NOT normal, any guy would never joke around that much!|`|We6rY8ynaa	I really don't think that guys do that together -  my friend right now is telling me there is no way 2 guys would do that together. Is it possible he could have been joking? If not then there is a real problem. His problem - not yours. I really hope it is not what it sounds like. You would probably have a good indication if he was gay though. Good luck.|`|Qks0PQhAaa	well hes either gay or is very open with his friend i didn't think guys would be able to jerk off in front of another guy that's like saying a woman and her friend playing around in front of each other lol that's not normal you do things like that in privacy :)|`|ACXoLn2daa	nothing strange for young lads that. Lads don't need much encouragement to grab it and bash the living daylights out of it. more so when watching exotic movies. So unless they are doing it to each other don't worry. As a male in his fifties myself I can assure you its a life long hobby. You need to worry if he did not do it.|`|op55FtqYaa	Stop trolling....he's gay.|`|MNevmpQAaa	ya, he's gay|`|O2SszNzUaa	I think he was probably taking the mickey, kinda thing some guys do tbh.|`|RX3U4bw8aa	NOT normal.|`|430hwnLqaa	Very worried|`|gOm09Bqsaa	eughhh typical guy!  my ex did this too, i think they are just trying to impress you and feel grown up - he wont be gay, dont worry :)  x x x|`|7opKKQyVaa	yeah guys really dont jerk off together....  change ur guy n plzzzzzzzz get a life.......|`|x2ykq6ePaa	Uuuh, that IS weird, but i have heard of guys comparing penis's with each other.  but that just crosses the line, keep your eye out, and make sure to use protection! :o )|`|PJKB5QIqaa	yes you should be worried, that is seriously messed up.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Nina;  Your friend is taking this far too seriously.  He is probably not gay.  Here is a test you can do;  Start going commando.  Wear a skirt and blouse and nothing underneath and sit so that he has a clear view underneath.  Men usually get the message then.  If he does not, you can know that he is gay.|`|GEigVt7Waa	I dont think boys ever do that together!! They might have watched porn but if they are both straight then i doubt that they jerked themselves off...well whil in the same room anyways...  just talk to him and ask him about how u are feeling, tell him you didnt think that boys did that together and just see wat he says :) good luck  x|`|lFcwzrDFaa	He could be trying to come out to you...  or it's just what he said a group masturbating session.. handle the situation with extreme caution|`|5V9Ie89Xaa	wouldn't def say he was gay but its not completely normal to jack off together.  I've heard blokes do that before together tho|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	did they jerk off together, if so then that isn't normal and you should be worried.    Good Luck|`|K7sDPIcZaa	Boys do stupid stuff, this is one of them.  Don't be worried about it. Men like porn so they would wack off together.  x|`|JVPt99Hxaa	wtf that is nasty man|`|3LPTLUczaa	That doesn't happen. Troll or your boyfriend was joking.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	Ughh.. guys don't jack off together wtf.
OXcApjPzaa	well you have to first learn the law of manhood. Males love females of all ages but when it comes time to take a wife to have babies and live our days with someone til death do us part......... if you are ONE year older than us... your days are mostly likely numbered.  Not definitely so, but, just most likely so.      For example. My sister's boyfriend was 5 years younger than her. She was always saying "we are going to get married and have babies and blaaa blaaaaaa blaaaaaa" and I said "sis, get real. he is going to dump you and end up married to someone younger than him. Why cant you females ever acknowledge ONE human reality that your eyes see?". She scoffed. That was years ago. My forecast came true. What I told her would happen EXACTLY happened. It just took longer than I thought it would.    but to answer your question.. nah its not wrong. its barely noticeable.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	No, it's not weird. Susan Sarandon is 12 years older than her guy .....|`|aLyJe1b3aa	look at chris brown and rihanna|`|qy07K2k5aa	Not, it's not. 1 year is very little anyway.|`|bzfXbM4raa	It matters less and less as you get older.  And people in highschool are dumb.  Ignore them.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	No.now dont be silly. What difference does it make?|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	There is nothing wrong with your ages, 16 and 17 have everything in common     Good Luck    God Bless|`|1bfo3ujzaa	i dont think so most girls do like older guys though|`|og3Tmn0saa	People are stupid; ignore them. If you like him, that's all that matters, to hell with the rest of the world.  P.S. The girl I like is 7 years younger than me. People think THAT is weird.|`|zN1TyLMPaa	no its really fun.hehe|`|iwXs65h2aa	What the heck, 1 year?!? That's nothing, maybe when you're younger it's a big deal..but it really isn't.    Take the Chinese New Year Calendar for example..they suggest that each person marries or gets along very well with someone 4 years younger or older.    1 year is nothing, age really has nothing to do with it..all though I'm not sure how some people can handle being with someone from a different 'generation'..    and out of randomness I've dated girls 2 years older than me a few times in a row now..I dont' think it effects the actual feelings between eachother.|`|BuSicwDqaa	A 1 year difference doesn't matter. Its just that normally the guy is older than the girl.|`|J7QO7zj1aa	I think three years is my age cap, but that is me. My mom and dad are almost 10 years apart, i think   1 year gap is perfectly fine no matter which of you is the elder
AA12135516	I wouldn't say you are a scumbag & going to hell but you sure are confused! I can understand you stopping it when she was young but what was wrong with a relationship when she was 17 & you were 22? You obviously had strong feelings for her or you wouldn't have cried so i can't see what your problem is.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Yes|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Ok this is very confusing, you rejected her because she was coming on too strong and you felt you were too old for her that I can understand but this has been going on for a long time and if you have feelings for her you should tell her.  I think you like her or why did you cry for weeks and lose a lot of weight ? it doesn't make sense to me - either you want to be with her or you dont.  The age difference is still 5 years but as she has got older it seems to have narrowed down a bit, yes at 14 she was jail bait and you were right in not encouraging her, but at 17 and you at 22 surely there is nothing wrong in dating if you like one another ?  I still dont understand what your problem is, as for going to hell no I dont think that will happen but you seriously need to sort your head out about this girl and if you like her then date her, wheres the harm in that ? (Dating is not sleeping together if she is underage.)|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Yes|`|qTBwonQ4aa	if you just got over her, then why are you still wondering?    well... i wouldnt want a guy to write me a letter saying to stop flirting with him, i think you should have manned up and said it to her face honestly. a letter seems a little immature to me.
ZyXpGLl4aa	Two months isn't a long time at all but you can start speaking to him.  If he even has some money and doesn't spend at all on you it isn't a good sign at all. It means that he's selfish, isn't a giver, expects everything to just come to him... Know what I mean? A guy will treat you in the manner which you allow them to... and in no way am I telling you to be a spoiled brat...    Many guys (but not all), especially if they really care for you can be trained, meaning that you need to be clear with him.  Tell him in a very intelligent,nice manner that you'd appreciate it if he'd step up and it'll hurt you if he doesn't.    Tell him that you just expect him to do the best he can, but to make an effort, he may not have seen this within his own family. It's very important to be a giver in life and you should do the best you can as well.. I mean, set an example.. Get him a card and maybe a small gift.    If he doesn't step up thereafter, dump him!|`|Q5eUUbB4aa	what do you buy him?|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	what does it matter? as long as he is paying attention to you and being affectionate... why does he need to buy you things?|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	do you buy him anything? relationships work both ways miss..|`|dAGrmSFvaa	Your relationship shouldn't be measured by purchasing objects.    It's about if he or you are there for one another.|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	are you buying him stuff,     what makes you think you just deserve stuff    yea i buy my girlfriend stuff because i have a twin sister that was very vocal about how she hates how her boyfriend dosent,     how is he supposed to know you want stuff,    let him know youd like something cute    and maybe he is just a scrouge    and then maybe he just isnt into wasting money on pointless things like cards, flowers, and teddy bears,    i think girls fail terribly to see how much that stuff can add up,    i think cheap roses are like 5 bucks a flower in season    so let him know what you want  and dont expect to much|`|a9eWbAMGaa	maybe he is just a guy that buy stuff on occasions.|`|w1p43HbCaa	yeah i do, but that's pretty stupid has anything come up like birthday/ or something|`|UezXqDF6aa	One if all you are worried about is wether or not your man will buy you anything then in my eyes you are doing much better than most relationships all over the world. Look there are people fight over their kids and home and if you are worried about wether or not he is in the right or the wrong then you need to step back and take a betterr look at why you are with him and wetherr or not you are ready ot be in a relationship.|`|JbeQoMvTaa	Don't worry about it.  Maybe it's too early.  He might just not be romantic.  Try not to worry about it.  If you really liked him, the material objects wouldn't matter,      Take care.|`|XNc7BU1caa	what do you buy him?|`|fPS5f5Ipaa	How do i put this..... hes not "smooth"  One of the key things you can do to a girl to make her happy and like you is get her stuff but he obviously doesn't know that so i guss you could say hes "stupid"|`|R5Cteuy6aa	Well there are two likely causes for this:  1. He's broke (no job)  2. He's dense    If it's 1, then I'm sure you understand. (Then again, cards aren't THAT expensive...)  If it's 2, then ask him straight up (in a not-greedy sounding way) or make obvious hints like "Oh, I wish I would get at least one flower for Valentine's Day this year..."|`|d4dhoawDaa	that crap is not really important, what is important is that when you are together does he treat you well and you have a good time together. the more he gets the less you will appreciate it. does he take you to the movies buy you lunch,does that count for anything?
ICjBorriaa	USe your imagination and fantasy! use visual words that describe that you want your boyfriend to really want you. Say him things like " I want you to slide into me " it's mostly to do with you describing having intercourse.  say to him " I want you to pump me etc " That kind of thing or say to the guy " you are making me feel so wet " etc or just letting him know you want him to jump you really so much "f ... me real hard"|`|uRcWfZYPaa	Ok well me and my wife do this ALL the time and we are fairly good at it, we both find that the best dirty talk is when you tell him exactly what you want him to do or telling him that he is doing a good job and keep going use dirty words though of course, P&%$Y, C@ k, F& K,.  For example things to say is F&%K me baby, I wanna S&%K your C& K, eat my P@$$Y. that sort of thing it works for us basically use those words as a basis be confident and sound in control or submissive either way will work ask questions and tell them him what you want him to do or that you like what he is doing just use the key dirty words or whatever else you can think of, tell him when you *** too or that you where you want him to ***.  Well thats pretty much to get you started the rest should fall in|`|SupWrLRIaa	Tell him what you want to do to him, or what you want him to do to you. Tell him how it feels when he does things. Ask him questions so that you have something to play off of. Just say things that sound titillating to you, things which sound naughty or taboo.|`|wE2etBzbaa	tell him that you want to shove a McDonald's burger in his butt, and then eat it.     that should be dirty enough, isn't it?|`|zN1TyLMPaa	do nothing sleep and talk wat u like|`|xsoqMzxDaa	WATCH PORN WITH HIM...OR WATCH IT BY YOURSELF AND GET SOME TIPS...IT'S THE WAY YOU SAY IT AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAY IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT...YOU HAVE TO FEEL CONFIDENT AND SEXY WITH YOURSELF TO MAKE IT BELIEVABLE AND NOT SOUND DUMB...|`|lyOsZa6baa	Bring a dictionary to bed with you guys. He'll love it!|`|qF5fZquuaa	Start by using words that you wouldnt normally say (but are comfortable using) in the bedroom.   e.g. instead of your v*g**a you might use p*s*y or instead of his "thing" you might say "let me s**k on your c**k"   This is classed as dirty and a bit naughty so it will be a turn on for him because these kind of words are usually taboo and only used by guys around other guys, or between actors in porno movies.  Im not saying you need to be vulgar or foul mouthed just use some terms that might get his attention.    Next you can start saying stuff at what would usually deemed "inappropriate times" (like in the grocery store or out at dinner) you could whisper in his ear:   "I want to s***k your **** " or  "I cant wait to get you home so you can put your **** in my**** "    In the bedroom instead of saying will you kiss me 'down there' you might say "I want you to e*t my p***y " or   "I wanna feel your **** in my **** "   Basically you need to say things your comfortable with and "feel" the situation so you can suit the mood. If you are comfortable together he'll probably let you know if it works and you can always ask "Do you like that? when I'm talking dirty for you? and I bet he says YES
S85ux209aa	I like eitherone :)
sLLgERQWaa	Private...somethings aren't for public viewing...  ...and any guy who decides to propose in a public setting deserves whatever he gets if the gal says 'No'.....and I question why he does it in public....either he's getting off on the idea that his proposal is special & unique ( it is, to the gal-anyone else is of no consequence), he's an attention seeker, or he wants the assurance that she won't dare refuse him in front of so many people.    My response would be "No, not until you can propose properly...and that means privately". Fortunately for me (and him) my husband made his proposal a private one...just the two of us as I feel for me it should be. I am not about any kind of public spectacle when it comes to intimate situations......good luck.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I would definitely prefer a private proposal or at least private enough to where I didn't know my family were around or watching. I don't like a lot of attention, even in front of my family so, I would feel weird. Not pressured, because I would definitely say, "YES!!!", I just don't like the spotlight.|`|gO9KyIrwaa	I think it depends out the relationship. If you have a more open relationship with your family and friends then i'd say it's no biggie to do it in front of everyone. when my fiance proposed we were with family but he took me off to the side and popped the question. :)
AA10949589	a few?  well if shes 90 then no way.  i'm 22 and wouldn't mind just a one night stand (to be honest) or even an honest relationship with some 30 yr olds for example..  age is just a number..  so what?  whatever makes YOU happy.  forget what everyone else thinks.|`|ZleVRevVaa	Well i don't know about others but i don't really have any problems. I would like to date older women as well as younger women. No issues.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	good there is no problem to date any older women..it will be cool forever.. cause she love him all the time she know he is my first and last men ..|`|jTV6rLX3aa	Um, by the time you're thirty, a few years is nothing.    Anyhow, I think it depends on the guy. Some guys like it because they think it makes them hotter/more desirable.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	wouldnt get myself into it in the first place its just totally wrong, and remember the longer u stay together she gets older too so yea lol|`|JaOddaodaa	nowadays guys seem to be more interested in dating elder women(WOMEN R NEVER OLDER)    guys are like, they wil love,live and sex, and they dnt want worries.  they seem to handover themslves to a more aged and matured lady, who will take care of them in a more motherly attitude.  think they want motherly kinds of lovers.|`|qIDBrSmnaa	Its cool as long as she is cool with herself... if not... then problems... big ones|`|lFcwzrDFaa	if u score with an older girl in highschool your considered the (man)|`|og3Tmn0saa	I liked a woman 3 years older than me. I currently like a woman 7 years younger.  Age... not a big issue with me I guess.|`|FzFSzilmaa	it has NOTHING to do with age... it is all about chemistry and connection... that transcends the age gap... once you are legal, age just becomes a number...|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	there is no  problem with it as long as you like each other its all good|`|7opKKQyVaa	YUMMY :)  coz i myself m attracted towards older women...  de r hot n sexperienced ;)|`|KvmjaU86aa	Once we hit over the 30 mark age should not be a concern anymore but everyone has their preferences. Me it don't matter as long as the attraction is there. Alot of women I date are a few years older than me anyways.|`|VhTD7npRaa	If she cool, he's cool. so don't think so much cause if they're in love, age is doesn't matter anymore!!!
2uXNtCUlaa	sorry to hear this, death happens when we least expect it. You are strong and will get through this. Do not be afraid to cry and let your feelings out, talk to someone about your feelings do not hide your secrets.|`|HHQEkv3Yaa	dude, this isn't a question. next time ask a question ait? well anyways, i know its hard. just try to forget about it. if you cant, go find another man.|`|uPL3e3tyaa	Problem solved. Next time you want something, don't wait; life is too short to hope and pray that the 'love fairy' will float along on a cloud and bestow the perfect man on you, then ring your bell!|`|Q5eUUbB4aa	this isnt even a question!|`|We6rY8ynaa	I am so, so very sorry to hear your terrible story of lost love. Please find comfort in knowing that he really did care for you and that I believe you will see him again one day. God bless you and may your heart be healed one day.
cLfIJgudaa	omg sorry to hear. Maybe you should write a journal?? I don't know if going on yahoo answers is going to help at all.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	Wow...that's terrible, what are the odds of that happening? At least you knew that he cared about you too. Can you Imagine if you had been still crushing on him, and then he died? At least you know he wanted to be with you. Allow yourself time to grieve, calling to hear his voice on his answering machine is normal. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I would suggest collecting anything (books, pictures, movies, music) that reminds you of him, and make some sort of remembrance thing for him. It will be a good thing for you to have later in life. One last tid bit, don't be afraid to share what your going through with people that love you, because there is no way you are going to survive on your own. Chin up!|`|351bdQNRaa	He's dead. Don't linger on the sadness of it. Remember all the good times and try to not let it get you down. Loss of a friend is one of the hardest things to get over.|`|e0urnErUaa	ouch im so sry but dont think about it    write! its helps take out emotions|`|Npi4QR7Maa	That's horrible. Whatever gives you closier in your life is always good.   But you need to remember to move on with your life and don't think about the past to much down the road.|`|AA10529198	Check the facts.  Maybe your mom is lying.  Seriously, this has happened.
oVIrSxZnaa	You could get appointed legal representation by the state for next to nothing if not free.  Is it possible for him to declare emancipation from your mom?  That would probably be the best option then she has no legal claim to him.  I would check with child services, but beware of giving too much personal info.  It could backfire and he could have to go into group living or a foster home.  I'm not sure what the laws are in that state for him to be immediately transferred to an out of state relative.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Get in touch with Child Protective Services. You are legally an adult & next of kin so I don't see any reason why you couldn't get custody. Hang in there. I will be praying for your family.|`|2tLswGNuaa	it is possible !! TRY YOUR BEST!! don't let your mom ruin your brother's future
KWeU8LJtaa	I love them! Especially the last one :)     It doesn't matter where the ring is from or how much it costs, what matters is the meaning behind it|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I'm just not a fan of the princess cut - the first.  The marquis - second one - is pretty. What would you do for a wedding band though, to accommodate the cut of the stone?  The third is quite nice with the different setting - however, since it's not a set, I would wonder what type of wedding band would fit/match -  I would think for a marquis, it would be best to purchase it as a part of a set, with the wedding band.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I love the first one, just love a princess cut, so simple yet elegant. it does the job without being too over the top. But they are all beautiful. I love the idea of not wasting a whole heap of money on a ring too!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	1 and 3!!!! Good luck!|`|HEvSVMeVaa	I like the first one! I think it's really classy.|`|cLfIJgudaa	i like the first one. Too bad u couldn't put it on credit and get a more expensive one lol|`|5RJsOCJBaa	Love the first one!!! it looks identical to mine  goodluck  xx|`|u23sua9daa	I like the first one.|`|zoJmDBpUaa	I like the first one. It's cute.|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	I noticed everyone said the first one but the middle one...the marquise diamond gives the diamond more of a length...it is beautiful and when you get the band or bands than it will define the diamond shape...and it also looks bigger....the last ring is not so modern....and the first one is classy...go with uniqueness and choose the second one.      Congrats!!!|`|zdpp7cubaa	I think they all are very beautiful. Just choose the one that you would want to wear for the rest of your life. =)|`|haCssg2Laa	for me personally?    the first one, its timeless, classically beautiful  the 2nd one i would perhaps get a bit tired of looking at  and the 3rd isnt my style at all    the 1st one though, i LOVE!|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I like the first one! I don't care for the Marquise cute and the last one has too much going on.|`|znq808AKaa	My personal fave is the first one. Simply because I love princess cuts and because you can always wear a wedding band with it :) Good choice!|`|xsoqMzxDaa	THEY'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL!!!   THE FIRST ONE IS MY FAVORITE.; PRINCESS CUT & SIMPLE.  THE PRICE OF AN ENGAGEMENT  RING SHOULDN'T MATTER ESPECIALLY WITH THESE HARD ECONOMIC TIMES WE'RE GOING THROUGH NOW, BUT THE TRUE MEANING AND LOVING FOUNDATION BEHIND THE RING. =)|`|00f9b13066000aa39eb7b7036e571513aa	i like the first two best
48ZW7O3Maa	lots of hot girls, but lots of uglies too, just as any country
OXcApjPzaa	the ratio varies from country to country but in general there are more females than males on earth.   thats why its really weird that there are more male inventors than women inventors.|`|5uFXCBpraa	That might be true in Alaska, but not in Canada.  It's 1:1 or so.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	if this is true i am moving       there are more girls then guys on this planet in general but like by 1 or 2 %|`|qeLikL8Haa	no its same as any country higher girl to boy ratio|`|1bfo3ujzaa	sign me up|`|qRwmWmDBaa	Yea it is 10-1 but you still wont find a girl....lol|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Maybe, but Canada is cold.|`|nvowgvtzaa	Yes. I think it's actually closer to 11:1
iqsgBSFkaa	Ya sure. But you have to make it very apparent that you want to be friends, or not friends. Which sucks..|`|PAY58zPNaa	of course, why not?|`|UXuSI6EZaa	of course, silly!
s1leABaSaa	if she wants you to chase her she will give you signs that she likes you but not so much that she makes you think you like her.    if she doesnt have any interest she will totaly ignore you or put you in the friend zone|`|qy07K2k5aa	You should be able to tell by the tone of her voice when she talks to you.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	The first time I talked to my wife she told me to go to H***.  It took me almost 18 months to get her to go out with me.  Now we've been married for 16 years.  My point is that you don't need to know.  What should matter to you is if you're interested.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	did you both have a connection when you guys met?    if not and shes not talking to you shes not intrested    oh and remember body language
J0RJ3MS7aa	look deep into her eyes, and it has to be serene. the longer you look into her eyes, the slower and closer you move. you look at her lips, and then pop back up into her eyes. move in a little closer. look at her lips again, and back at the eyes. move a little closer. look at her lips, get closer, look at her lips, get closer....    at about 5 inches away... you look to see if she tilts her head forward, purses her lips. looks at your lips, looks at your eyes. get closer JUUUUUUST  a little bit more. but that's it.    she has to make the final move.|`|ZKw46efXaa	you should watch the film 'hitch' explains everything! lol|`|1poSSvTdaa	Yes that could make you look a bit of a buffoon. Wait until you are somewhere you won't be distracted. get yourself facing her, don't chatter, just pucker your lips and move slowly in for the smooch. Should work a treat!|`|dwiuV0Hvaa	start by looking at her lips 4 like 10 seconds then slowly bend and plant a kiss on her lips. if she gives you the green light grab her face slowly & romantically and plant another kiss on her lips then slowly give her a kiss then u can now increase the speed depending on how you like it.    good luck|`|ub23m7Praa	I usually just grab my girlfriend's face all nice and sweet like and kiss her slowly then crawl on top of her and go from there
zka26204aa	Just tell your sister that you love her, but her husband has become family to you also, and that you do not want to get involved with their problems.  You do not have to flaunt your friendship with him around your family, but make it clear that you are not going to take sides.|`|xCLX9Aczaa	I would definitely choose family over him.  Being with your ex brother-in-law will only further your distance between your own family.  Yeah, you had a talk with him and of course he is going to have a different story, but he's not going to admit everything.  There were obvious complications between him and your sister that you probably don't know and you shouldn't in the middle of it.  The only thing that you should be doing is totally backing up your sister 100% and supporting her during this hard time.  I'm pretty sure she would do the same for you if you were in the same situation.  Sometimes you just have to let some people guy.  It's for the better.  Hope this helps!
oGoWz511aa	Television show, video games (with his cousin), and playing on the computer..  You crying because he doesn't spend enough time with you....      My advice is, don't get married.  You're both too immature.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	Depression  By, David Watts    Depression grips with icy claws  Tearing painfully through flesh as it eats steadily towards the heart of its victim.  Depression goes from a feeling to a way of life as easily as a narcotic becomes a habit.  At least its something to feel.  Always there, to be relied upon in times of trouble.  Almost the antithesis of comfort yet comforting in its reliability.    Depression does not know joy or contentment as it smothers all.  Conquering and pillaging through a persons mind in a ferocious onslaught.  It is so very hard to fight and so easy to succumb.  It wants us all to give in.  It wants us all to let it control, destroy.  Until a person becomes a shell.  Walking flesh going through the motions of daily life.    The habitually depressed are the joyless.  Trying so very hard to obtain some feeling of happiness.  A small tidbit of glee from this icy grip of reality.  Booze helps a little but the bottle runs out.  Drugs help a little till the dealer gets busted.  Sex works as long as it works.  When its over, the vice of choice has run its course  its there.  Its always there.  Snickering.    Peering through the darkness.  Lurking in the shadows awaiting a soul to devour.  Stalking.  Trying so hard to break free.  Every kind word helps and every bit, even the tiniest sliver of negativity can send a roller coaster of pain.  Outside the wall is up.  Strength.  Stability.  Even honor.  Inside emotions and worthless mind banter reign in self destruction.    Peace is more important than understanding.  Others dont have to understand.  Just accept.  Help.  Please help.  Oh God help.  Or leave us alone.  Just dont make it worse.  The depressed are vacuums, sucking in all the good times  Trying to hold on in anticipation for the next one.  Hoping for some form of adoration that never comes.  Loosing hope    Love isnt real.  Joy is a farce.  Happiness is nothing more than a brief lean on a crutch.  (Depression cant mess with a high junkie.)  The roller coaster makes frequent stops.  Not sure where the end is.  Want to get off.  This ride isnt fun anymore.  It hurts.  Make it stop.  Must have peace, at any cost.  Dont have enough to buy it.  Peace.  Priceless.  Unattainable.      Observing others.  Lemmings.  Dont have any REAL problems.  Grandma said our pain is bigger than anyone elses.  Its a gargantuan chasm.  An ocean.  Space.  Big.  Depression is bigger than we are.  Thats why we are powerless against it.  Depression goes from a feeling to a way of life as easily as a narcotic becomes a habit.  What a way to live.    (I was inspired by the blogs)|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	he got you where he wants and is now taking you for granted.    review the relationship.    consider pulling back.|`|cLfIJgudaa	because he is being distant from you, something is serisouly bothering him.

You need a real man, call me. You look hot !|`|xCLX9Aczaa	Not to be mean but he is probably bored with the relationship.  You can probably try spicing up your love life and do new stuff with him.   Sitting at home playing cards would bore me as well.|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	You keep mentioning his cousin. Are you sure he's going out with his 'cousin?"|`|Fjm7RnD2aa	Don't worry. It is normal. First the man makes the woman give up her whole life so he can't get jealous. Then he has to fill his life with stuff he loves doing. He loves you dearly but just get yourself something to do, start talking to your family on the phone again, maybe go on the computer and play some card games or something. You can get a few interests and he will soon start wanting to spend that time with you again. If he is off out with his cousin then let him know you are going to pop up the shops or something.   The only reason he ignored you when he got back was because you were emotional and he didn't know how to deal with it so he thought if he ignored it you would deal with it and he wouldn't have to.   Decide what you want out of the relationship, he has crushed you a bit by making you give your family and friends up, he is controlling you and has rocked your self esteem.   You are worth so much more but if you love him just start with small changes like when he is busy make yourself busy.  If there are a lot more indepth problems then sit down and talk about what you both want.   Good luck|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Now that the pig has you exiled and under control. Hes not interested.

So first let us hope that.   And if he is TRULY with his cousin, then I think you need to plan to show him what he is missing out on when he is bonding with his guy friends.
dgoZCrt0aa	Buy him a shirt or a hat. We guys don't really want gifts we just want to see ya happy and for ya to spend time wit us and show us that you love us. A kiss and a big hug would be great.

zka26204aa	Your brother watched over you in life, and he is still with you in death.  Anytime you feel the need to talk to him, do so.  He will hear you and he knows how you feel.    When my mother died I took it extremely hard.  I did not want to live without her.  About a year late II was sitting on the side of my bed crying and saying out loud how much I needed my mother because of what I was going through.  All of a sudden I felt a hand on my shoulder, and a calm came over me that was just like I felt when my mother helped me through my problems before she died.  It was the most wonderful experience to know that even though she can not be here physically, she is still spiritually with me.  Suddenly i knew everything would be okay, and it was.    Your brother struggled a lot in life, but now he is in peace.  Just write down what you are feeling, or say it aloud, and your brother will know.  He has already forgiven you.  Remember he was like a parent and always gave you unconditional love.  He knew how much you were hurting to lose him and why.  He just felt that you were going to be okay, but he was not sure if your mother would be okay.  Wasn't that just like him--to always be there for everyone else that needed him?  There is a place in heaven for someone like that, and I am sure he is in a better place now.|`|xLPNpHLRaa	forgive yourself|`|AA11731307	You know something that I have learned.  I have learned that even though people say things out of hate and anger the good times are what is remembered.  As long as you love your brother in your heart he does know.  REMEMBER AS YOU SAID HE WAS LIKE THE PARENT.  WHO TRULLY KNOWS YOU INSIDE AND OUT?  He knows you love him.

If your parents bring up the subject talk with them honestly.  Sexual desire isn't something that is easily dealt with when you're growing up.      You might tell your mom privately that you really don't porn surf all the time (she'll be relieved), but were curious.  I think she'll appreciate your being honest with her.  Depending on how ok she is about talking about sex, it could be a good opportunity for your relationship to grow up a little.  It's hard for parents too, to realize that their 'little ones' aren't quite so little anymore.    Relax...   and do your homework!  :)|`|5d32Q1Craa	Ask them where they hide their porn collection :) You might be surprised!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I can understand that you feel embarrassed and nervous. I would act as if it were nothing until your parents bring it up. How old are you? It is NORMAL to be curious. Are your parents highly religious/strict?    I think there is nothing wrong with it as long as you don't let it take over your normal life.|`|NnPizqKNaa	Act as nothing has happened because ur mom understand that ur a teenage boy at hormone peek and she dosn't mind :)|`|ICOmnGIUaa	your just hitting your hormones where you get a lot more interested in girls so if they ask just say something like that...|`|qqm78P2Saa	Don't be embarrassed or ashamed, its apart of life! You can brush it off and act like it never happened if you feel talking about it is unnecessary but if this is truly bugging you, then I suggest you say something so you can clear your chest. But no worries, this is nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone has these same feelings you do!|`|yptfd3sIaa	Are you a guy? A girl? Either way, curiosity about all things sexual is totally normal. Frankly, I think it was pretty lame for her to bark at you that way. Maybe get some magazines, instead? Talk to your Dad.|`|38a19e43adce9f975557b388faf72103aa	You are only human. Who isn't curious about sex and the human body?  How is your relationship with your parent(s)? If you have a great one that allows you to talk about most anything, then you should talk to them as soon as you can. It might be better if you talk to your Mom since she was the wont that found you peeking.   Most important be complete with your feelings and talk about the fact that you are curious and its true that you should of been doing homework.   Next time your peek make sure you lock the door for your own peace of mind. People should knock. It's only respectful. My parents always did and I did for my kids too.  PS.... clear the history off the computer if you didn't already.
0AYPgUQIaa	It could be any number of things.    - he is still in love with you  - he is the kinda guy who treats his exes right even after you broke up    But all you described here let me believe that he is still indeed in love with you. Maybe there is a crisis in his relationship with his girlfriend and he sees a chance to get together with you again before his relationship goes wrong.|`|TGMUFytraa	Boring. Too long to read. Shorten it up.|`|zka26204aa	He just finally realized how close he felt to you.  It does not necessarily mean he wants to get back together, however.  Sometimes when two people see each other for long periods of time, they become like an extended member of each other's family.  The love and concern is still there even when the relationship is doomed.  I still have that kind of feelings for my ex of 12 years.  I do not want him back.  I left him, but I have brought him food and medication when he was ill too.  I also call him about once every week or two to make sure he is doing okay.  I would not call as often if he lived with someone else, but until then I will keep in touch.  He is still part of my extended family.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	I've seen this before or I'm crazy.|`|Fs4fAwfwaa	well,    thats actually more or less typical for an ex.    One thing you should know is that for guys and girls no matter how the breakup was the person you loved will always be special to you. Feelings or no feelings can differ from person to person depending on how the situation was that led to the breakup but I think the feeling only get covered up by the pain.    So yes, you are still a special person to him even though that chapter in your lives has ended. He may even be feeling guilty about the breakup so thats why he has this "protection-instinct".    But all this does not necessarily mean he still is in love with you though he certainly still remembers how that felt.    Dont worry and let you life's go on.    Good luck!    Caleb
GCw0QZ7Saa	people seem to be more open when they are texting or messaging each other. It's a easier way to talk. I'd rather text my BF then call him. So it's normal, as long as you do talk in person, and it's not shitty.|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Why dont you call her then?|`|nvowgvtzaa	Next time you see her, tell her you'll call her. Give her a general time of day (afternoon, evening, night), so you don't look like you're sitting by the phone waiting and DON'T forget. If it's a first conversation on the phone, it can be awkward, so have an excuse to hang up ready. Aim for 10 minutes, that's normally a decent success. If you can get past about 13, you're golden. If it's less than that, just try again later.    Take small steps, but keep taking steps.|`|e0urnErUaa	thats fine|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Its okay if you and her never really have phone conversations. As long as you're both speaking to each other, that's all that matters. Texting, Instant messaging are pretty good as well. You have nothing to worry about.|`|dAGrmSFvaa	If you feel comfortable talking through text or IM, then its fine.    I think that if everything goes well and the topics get more serious, your conversations will transcend to telephone calls.     If you want to talk to her through phone, then I say you can call her or text her saying what you want to talk needs to be done on the phone.    Othern than that, I don't think there's anything wrong with texting or IMing.|`|oTtH2ENHaa	idk about this girl, but I would be nervous talking on the phone for the first couple of times...im just not really a PHONE person.. maybe if you guys hang out more often you can call her once in a while to talk about what you guys are gonna do that day..or just call her to say hi, and ask her how her day is going..|`|cKSbZBt8aa	If you want to talk on the  phone call her.  You sound like its all going well anyway.  Who said the first step is phone call?  You are talking face to face and what better way.|`|zhs5Cy5vaa	I think it's all right as long as you actually talk to her outside of the texting/instant messaging.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	it does not matter how you guys Communicate as long as the two of you do|`|wwEnL5tBaa	You dont need to call, if everything is great as it is and you're not phoning eachother at the moment. Remember not all people like to have phone calls.|`|NoIVF09raa	Some people are just more accustomed to communicating in one of two extremes--and these are necessarily bad. the first is text and instant messaging with no really clear cut emotions or range of expression, the second is one on one talk with visual emotions and vocal tones. Perhaps after the first few dates she didn't feel compelled to convince you to like her as much, and now that she's more comfortable she doesn't feel she need to call you all the time. I've been there a few times, and I know the feeling. Don't panic--if she was losing interest she would be gone.|`|Q9jumG7qaa	omfg i am going thru the same thing...except im a girl....i hate it! when we are in person its great but i dont get why he never calls me :S
saG3rgnzaa	Hum, I guess I would be kind of suprised at first, and then think" hum, does he really mean it?" And then, how ever, I guess I'd feel happy, because it's nice to know that people likes one.    How ever, if I would like that guy, as in love. I'd get pretty shy, really shy. I might wont say anything, or just a short respond.    If I just see him as a good friend, I wound be happy, and maybe as, if he really meant it. :D|`|vcykdwNBaa	Definitely would've been creeped the fack out.   Sorry, but sometimes that type of  .. statement from one 'friend' to another is kind of alarming and over-whelming.  Tone it down a bit.|`|6zgwIEP3aa	What he said is nice, but a little bit too late. Why didn't confess that to her a week before she leaves?    If he really wanted her he would've said that before, so he could get his chance. In my opinion, he's either stupid, or he doesn't love/like her as much as he claims.    If I was the girl I would be in shock; I'd like it but I'd also dislike the fact that he confessed a lil too late.    Good luck anyway :)|`|qxgkhN8aaa	I'm BANGED to the head by the answer from Twilight Lover!  I couldn't simply cut a long story short, but I'm not chicken!  I believe, we guys will always says something or similar to that,  but it is ONLY the WOMEN and not girls I supposed is actually freaking  out when they heard us mention all this Lovey-Dovey sentences.  As they couldn't believe that we're sincere.|`|u4rHgRWdaa	I think that is like abit weird, but cool. I mean, when would a guy EVER say that to a girl. All the guys in the world are to chicken.|`|o1ibwPKPaa	Well if I didn't like the guy back which if I did I would have made previously evident then I would be extremely creeped out and try to limit my time with the guy to the least possible after he said that.|`|0HFL3vocaa	id think that was very sweet, how did she reply?|`|zadtCE1paa	no stop dont
3ugIfMiRaa	Yay Spain. I'm Spanish... but a girl. So can't answer your question. Sorry. Just curious about the answers x]|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I was with a spanish catholic guy-trust me-most guys are all the same-jerks!|`|ZldKA17Iaa	lolz
yRRnbNqXaa	She's definitely just being very jealous of you and wants to make you feel the same by posting all those comments about her sleeping with him and stuff. Some women get like that when they are really frustrated and don't really know what to do, so they think it'll make them feel better if they make someone else just as miserable.    You've definitely shown you are the bigger person here by stopping commenting on her outbursts. Keep that up and she'll get tired of it eventually. It's best to not show somebody like that that they're hurting your feelings, just ignore her.     But, trust me, their relationship won't last long because there's definitely too much jealousy there from her side. She won't be able to let this go. Right now I get the feeling like she's with him just to spite you and even though she's posting all that on my space, they probably keep having arguments in private. It's a facade.. if the feeling are genuine, one doesn't feel the need to expose them so dramatically (especially at 22). She sounds like she'd just want to convince HERSELF how much she loves him..    Anyway, you just keep the good job of minding your own business and this too shall pass :D|`|qBkJAlQ1aa	I think you should forget about your boyfriend and that girl. Raise your kid well. Don't allow yourself to go down to their level. I don't see a bright future with you and the father of your son. Forgive me, but I think he is a scum bag and will be a heavy yoke on anyone.    This ain't the end of the world for you. Prove to him that he's not your loss but you are such a big loss to him. He's such a loser..|`|5d32Q1Craa	You did the right thing at 1st by stop getting involved in the drama on myspace..But you messed up by going back and peeking at her profile only to get more upset when you saw her mood comment.. If she wants to start drama with you, block her profile, you have no need to see it..She can say whatever she wants, and it's only going to bother you if you REALLY care what she thinks.. Only way she can rub anything in your face is if you place value on it.. You just be the best mom you can be, and if he wants to participate as a father then great, if not, move on.. Stop worrying about what she is doing and think about what it's doing to you every time you care about what she say's..|`|IiKBLjIpaa	At this point, I would just say screw them both and take the father to court to get as much money for child support as possible. Usually I wouldn't say this, but they seem like a bunch of jerk faces (for a lack of a better word) and you might as well get some support for your baby.    Let her say what she wants. You know that they probably aren't going to last long, anyway. If he was on your as s about being immature about the situation and him "getting caught in the middle," you should call him out on it and point out that the new girlfriend is carrying on about it.|`|oVIrSxZnaa	Let her be with the guy- any male that doesn't have enough pride to claim their child is a loser.  Be glad that you don't have a relationship with someone like that.  Maker her jealous- take him to court for more child support- hit them where it hurts.    Stop using myspace, yahoo answers is much better for you|`|dTPuctm7aa	you need to have a long talk with your bd about his gf and let him know it's suppose to go both ways.he don't want you saying nothing so he need to let her know that she need to stop saying **** too or he's no real man.cause what real man let someone talk about the mother of his child.as for her tell him if she's gonna be a part of his life that she needs to stop all the messy **** and be on her grown woman and stop being a little girl.the reason why she's on myspace all the time cause they don't spend a lot of time together and she just want you to fill like their relationship is the true,but it's really not.she wants you to say something to her but by not saying anything he's looking @ you like damn she acting more adult then she is.and he shouldn't base not talking to you because of anyother female.so just have a little conversation with him letting him know that you're trying not to say anything ot her but he needs to tell her to stop doing the same thang.hope that works out for you.|`|VYWh9iyjaa	she's loving the attention it's bringing her, some people get off on other peoples misery. this just says one thing about a person like that and that is she's insecure. others who make others feel bad do it to make them feel good. i'm telling you she's not worth the effort and you know it. however, I can understand how it's hard to just ignore what's going on cause it seems so unfair and unjust. the two of them need to do some growing up, your fella is just ridiculous, you have his baby and he treats you like that. I think you're being very patient and putting up with too much sh*t.     you need to stop once and for all going on myspace if you don't read it, it can't hurt you. find something better to with your time cause while you're waisting time with this, you're not living your life. hang out with friends, meet people at a mothers group or something, join up for a social group-painting, pottery, dance etc.. idk just stop waisting time with these pathetic losers.|`|E2tQCKDhaa	hey, trust me i know what you mean about DRAMA, && everyone is going to just tell you to ignore her. But its so hard when they are talking a bunch of ****, but you shouldnt have to prove yourself to anyone. If you know your not a hoe than dont let it get to you, you dont gotta impress her or any of her friends, just block her so you wont see what she is writing, and as far as your baby daddy goes you just gotta let him know that it bothers you how she is. & that you dont want her around your child. But good luck!|`|6fa3f41b59f3d91473ca29d7ed30c81baa	Wow sounds pretty rough. I am a single dad with a similar problem my baby mama likes to advertise her new bf and life on her myspace.  It really bothered me at first but i just had to ignore her and focus on my daughter.  its difficult because i still had feelings for her but in the end it worked for me if i just ignored it all its childish and its myspace not real life.  Your baby daddy sounds like a total douche if he would rather take his new girls side and im sure he instigates it. i dont know how much help that is but there you go.
iFYDJyIZaa	Yeah. Dated a guy for a year. He broke up with me the day I moved away to college. He said it was because he knew I'd cheat on him once I was around other college students. All through the relationship though, it was all about him. All I heard about was how I needed to change. He broke up with me once before, and told me it was because he didn't know what love was. I guess he really didn't know...    Sometimes it takes heart break to learn a lesson.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Yes, I've had this happen to me.  It took awhile to get over it but i managed.  It happens to just about everyone in life atleast once.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Nope, at least not yet. I've been pretty heartless though to be honest. Lately, I've been a total ***** to men. Haha, I guess because of my past situations..I don't know.|`|dhG4Fffbaa	yeah I have One    OK so I was going with a girl and she was my first love and i was for her as well but  I got cheated On when It was 1 month with her i couldn't break it off so I gave her a chance and as time went on we got Good so I decide To take her Out for a big date You know Took her to the beach then the pier and everything You know rides and everything and then dropped her Off home (this happened on a sat.) so then monday comes along and she's avoiding me so i chase her around for a bit then her friends come to me and tell me its over between us turns Out her mom found drugs on her and blamed it on me and she said that she couldnt see me any more because Of that Not only being cheated On but accused Of giving her drugs  yup thats My story|`|jXQEUxNpaa	Yep, he acted out that it was his parents who didn't want us together so I gave him a letter telling him how I felt, without even opening it, he ripped it up right in my face and shoved it in the bin 
dqZrq7Zeaa	Sorry hon, mine flies a broom too!  Tell her you have to study. Then fake it,|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Hi,    Well just have a nice chat of answer some question here on Y!A..    There is NO escaping possible from stepmothers, it the same as with Mother-in-laws you can't choose     You have to deal with it...    -R|`|Eug52iQDaa	How about asking her to spend some time with you doing something  you like?  Being a stepmother is really hard sometimes.  If she's watching everything you do, consider if you have given her reason not to trust you?  If not, sit down with her and talk about it - don't whine!  Don't accuse.  The more reasonable you act, the more respect you will likely get from her.      If communication is not in the future for you, get some grippies for your shoes and take a walk.|`|QADhk0nFaa	what a brat, tell her to clean her own house!! tell her your not her slave and your clean your own stuff and tell her shes your step mom not your real mom you dont have a choice to have her as your step mom! haha well if your not that mean dont, but its what i do to my step father|`|3VaaU2I4aa	get an after school job and go directly there, then claim utter exhaustion when you get home, then go spend your money at the mall when you have time off (take a cab since you have a little dough)...it's all for diversion and escape plus it'll pad your resume|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Why do you hate her  so much? I think you two need to talk it out! Stop being a brat!|`|P17HujJ4aa	Well, if she is mean, you can only deal with her. I mean she is your elder... Does she treat you well sometimes? If she does, then try my advice...    For one day, be super duper nice and do everything to make her happy. Then you can try to set some "boundaries." Ask her nicely if she could give you some privacy and if she says yes, Hurray! If no, then be super duper nice for another day and do everything to make her happy. Once she is in a very good mood, try asking her to stay out of your room for a few hours, or days...    If your stepmother is the person who cooks, then when she goes shopping, you get some privacy.    Also, if she is in a good mood, you can tell her to get some exercise... I hope I helped a little!
OegheALwaa	yea you should learn more about sports and cars. things he likes so you guys can have a good conversations. just be nice and show him you want to be his friend. dont act to desprate though.
1poSSvTdaa	That's certainly a question that needs both time and space to answer.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	I'm 22 years old and I would be pissed if I found out that the guy I was talking to was only a teenager! That's so gross. Most 17 and 18 year olds are immature and still live at home with their parents. Why would a woman want to talk to a teenager? I'm sorry but your looks that are described as an older guy, doesn't matter. Your personality is what matters the most. Like I said before, Your immaturity would be a huge problem.|`|zzPjs02Uaa	wow i am taking it you are under age and ya liking a female who is over 18 correct?? there are laws that say an adult cant date minors... just relax and chill out you will be 18 soon!! :)
PAY58zPNaa	oh thats pretty sad, but i'm aussie too, and happy bday for tomorrow btw.  but back to the main point:  if possible, you could catch a bus there to the nearest stop near milne bay.   another alternative is that you could ask one of your friends parents to drive some people there as well.     yeah thats about all i can think about right now, hope i helped anyway.|`|R1vos19Caa	lap it! have one girl lay across the other three in the back!|`|J7QO7zj1aa	Have your mom rent a car and or borrow a friends car. or take more than one car.|`|Ve48V97Baa	i am pretty sure 4 of you can fit in the back..or 2 in the front..lol ..|`|ihbPQUjhaa	Maybe one of your friends moms could drive a few of your friends there? Or maybe one of your mom's friends could drive and take a few of your friends and that way your mom could go to the park to and have an adult to hang out with? I hope this works out for you and you have a great birthday :)|`|RmwVC33Waa	Well I think u will probably have to rent another car. In that way, u can even get to have other friends too.
GbwLZ28maa	Ok he's turning to alcohol and porn.  Those are serious warning signs that the next in line might be an affair.  MIGHT BE.  I'm not sure if he is having one now though... but trust your gut feelings.  You feel breathless, there's this deep hurting feeling in the pit of your tummy and you just seriously feel breathless just thinking about it... that's your gut feeling.      If yes, then investigate.  Check his cell records, his credit card bills, his whereabouts.  Call him up at his office number once in a while, surprise him in the office and such.  I'm not kidding you, i do that beucase I caught my husband cheating once by checking our internet history records.      Good luck and please take care of yourself.  Please be ready mentally and emotionally for this barrage of emotions that will come your way.    *hugs*|`|HCWkdk4naa	if you can spend a $100 or so, you can use a cell phone spy device or a keylogger.  either one will record his electronic communications.  however, if he spends all his time watchig porn, it's likely that he is only cheating on you with his hand, not another woman.|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	hey. he might not be cheating.. maybe its because he is sex deprived as u have been pregnent.. so he watches porn to relax.. give him some time..|`|cLfIJgudaa	why don't you just sit and have a talk with him, and ask him what's up. If he isn't cheating, he'll just say, "I'm not cheating".And you should trust him to tell the truth, because if there is no trust there, you shouldn't be with him anyway. If he IS cheating and lies about it, at some point you'll find out, and then you don't have to be with that jerk.|`|NiuOD9wYaa	niiice.  tell him his bros said HIGH FIVE!!  would you mind if he came out with us tonight for a beer?|`|NbU9Nk43aa	if u feel this way why don't.hire a pi to see what he does.

xV4qOG4Iaa	I feel she is just playing with your head, and by sending you photo's of herself  she sounds confused as to what she really wants, or who she wants to be with, if i were you i would move on and do your best to forget her, but then it is up to you, but i think you would be silly to go back with her, as i would say if she met someone else again she would leave you again for him, so just move on.|`|VVC4vEoQaa	You should move on. If u feel that u love her. And what's about so much thinking in that.|`|AA10781209	move on......or not.....maybe....well, i dunno......hope this helps....either way, I get 2 points!!!! GO ME!!!|`|cn9FRj9taa	you answered your question yourself, she's confused about who or what she wants.     i'm sure she's a great girl like you say she is, but you'll have to let her go.     you'll find someone better.
ajgC0KPhaa	Be patient and find out where and when you can talk to him. If things work out, you can converse and eventually ask for his phone number, or maybe he'll ask you for yours.|`|og3Tmn0saa	You can't expect every guy to always make the first move. Sometimes you have to do it yourself. MAKE THE MOVE! Get his number and text him, or just talk to him about not class stuff. Walk with him in the halls.

People can sit there for so long your feelings for them go away. Quite frankly, you should be more than a little scared you might lose him between now and when you graduate. Either to another girl or to your own feelings of him being just a friend this long. I think a relationship is in order. No reason to postpone happiness.
c2YcBbXyaa	if you're both comfortable with it that's all that matters....i've noticed a lot of old couples call each other mama and daddy...not sure why tho|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	well, in evolutionary terms, women DO choose men who resemble their fathers, and men DO choose women who resemble their mothers, generally.    it's probably because you give her the assurance as she would have received from her father    or maybe that you're a man and her dad was a man.    but there is definitely a significance as to why she calls you "daddy"    and all explanations are more than sound|`|BAGxriLBaa	It's sweet...|`|k6CfzHrfaa	it sounds pretty innocent to me. in fact, major props to you for being so caring and protective of your girl. heckuva lot better than what most guys do to women these days.
jTV6rLX3aa	Well, he's with you, so those girls don't really matter. He may need a lot of attention, but that doesn't mean he doesn't care for you.    He may be a bit insecure about how girls perceive him. Be sure to show him that you love him and care for him, and those other girls won't matter.     Of course, if he is pulling away because you have become too clingy (only you will know), then you will have to give him space as well. He'll come back.|`|BBlfetz3aa	that's the main reason. sorry hun.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	If he goes to exercise, what does he look like?  Greek God or Mr Flabby!  You are jealous, and that is not a good trait.  He will feel like you are trying to control him.  Why don't you go and keep him company.
MXYWSsM7aa	Hi Aarti, You said you only know him through the internet, right? Just like the rest of us, you don't really know us. How we are on the internet and how we are at home can be very different. What I'm saying is just be careful not to get so emotionally involved. You don't have to prove nothing to anybody here.    There could of course be something very stressing in his personal life that he isn't sharing with anybody. You could write him and say, "hey, if I upset you then I'm sorry. It's just that you seem to have so much on your mind and I wanted to give you a break." You could remind him that you wanted a one week break not a lifetime break. See how that goes.  God Bless and take care.:)|`|1gFxxJsBaa	ask him why is he mad at u... why does he hates u... and talk about it...|`|ujXdjG1gaa	He's on drugs...and getting emotional...      sounds like a tweeker to me =O     ====O
AG3dYL84aa	Don't listen to the first poster.  But do only go on blind dates that have been sussed out by family or friends.    I think the shorter the better.  That way you have a lot to talk about the next time you see each other.  Anywhere between 1 to 3 hours depending on the person.  Good luck.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, 1-2 hours is perfect when you meet someone in person. I usually just ask to meet them for coffee or lunch, that way you don't have to do something afterwards. And always in public, you can't go wrong with a local coffee house, there are always other people there!    Getting drinks at a bar is a bad idea in my opinion. Alcohol could influence a decision the wrong way.|`|AA12346188	Not more than a week or so.|`|igwoCxYwaa	blind dates are stupid! i see no point in them.   he could be a killer for all you know.
ij9N9r5waa	I'm single now but I was married and the single girls I know have always trusted me their secrets, and dating games, now and then. I guess I'm just easy to talk to, they get a lot of advice and such from me. I think it's ok to get a male' opinion about certain things.|`|slHUNl58aa	I agree, it is inappropriate, marriage is hard enough without the complications that can come from that.   I think if your male friend is struggling in his own then it makes it that much harder for him.  Men in general are a lot quieter about those kinds of problems even when they are in crisis.  Wives could see you as a threat and really ride their butts about that when you aren't around as well.    Men often won't tell you they are being called out by their wives  because it is demeaning and they would not want to embarrass you or themselves.
cl6r8cGBaa	aww.. he seems manipulative huh? well, he's also in danger of his own health, you better report him to a school nurse,teacher or a parent. i think he needs some help-mentally, physically and emotionally- he's quite an attention-seeker.|`|wtIWal7Waa	TELL A TEACHER. Tell a parent. Tell someone you can trust because that's not something Yahoo! Answers can solve. You know about it, therefore you need to help him =/ good luck |`|mb8JSVEraa	Well.... he obviously needs help. You  need to tell him straight out, I do not like you like that you are my friend. If you need me to be here for you, I can. But just because you cut yourself does not mean that is something that will make me get closer to you. Now if you need to move seats then ask to be moved seats. Things like this can worse through time. So be careful. Be aware of him.     Good luck.|`|GfphOIdOaa	speak to his parents. tell them he has a mental disorder that makes him hurt himself. You definitely don't want to sacrifice your own future because he is mentally not well. You could also try speaking to your own parents and have them tell his parents. But do get it out in the open. This boy needs help!|`|nkTEhBTyaa	srry to say this but u should find a new person to like. He sounds kinda mad srry.|`|zka26204aa	He is trying to make you feel guilty.  Do not fall for that.  Go to the school counselor, and tell him/her about this.  This boy needs some psychological help immediately.  Also, ask that you be moved into a different seat in class.    NEVER let anyone guilt you into doing anything you do not want to do.  If a guy gets obsessive over you to the point of making you uncomfortable, report him to the police and let them know that you feel threatened by his presence.  They will tell you how to get a restraining order to keep the guy away from you.|`|Ve48V97Baa	kid is a loser..just ignore him..eventually he'll stop|`|CCqqTw6paa	whats with you youngins and blades these days?|`|ICOmnGIUaa	that boy seems to have emotional problems and you just have to tell him there are other fish in the sea and that you cant always get what you want. Also, its not like it is going to last forever and just say you will always be friends.|`|tdUcDHQ2aa	Tell someone.|`|J7QO7zj1aa	The only person that need's help here is your friend, he needs some psych help. Tell your teacher or his parents that you think he might be cutting cause you saw what looked like scars on his wrists, that will solve your problem of his attraction to you and will also help him towards being not so crazy|`|bS2GSqlSaa	I think you should tell an adult. Cutting is very dangerous. He can really hurt his self. He needs to get help, and talk to someone. Sounds like he has problems. Don't be afraid to tell someone about him, in the end your helping him. Cutting can lead to something worst. I would hate for you to feel like its your fault if he did something stupider..|`|1UrLN16caa	well u've got to b strict with him.. tell him downright where u want your relationship but dont make the mistake of cutting him out of your life like i once experienced.. it will cause more damge on both sides.. If the situation gets worse then its time to c the councillor or talk to an adult u can trust|`|e0urnErUaa	his sick igonre him
7dyzaIWlaa	Wait, YOU got payed for the texts THEY sent?    Or you were just replying to their texts and thats what got the money up?    If its just you replying then you really have no buisness asking them for the money back cause like, you were the one that sent it|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Ugh, I was thinking ok, maybe they sent like one hundred bucks worth or something, but fifteen? Forget it. Just get over it and understand that your friends are turds.|`|Hr2fRVW1aa	let it go ...it will be funny 1 day and u might regret losing friends or over-reacting !|`|hid5HDqfaa	Dude, before I read how old you all were, I assumed you were like 15! Get over it. Sure they went too far but friends forgive and forget.
OXcApjPzaa	if you marry a girl much younger than you, make sure she is religious.  Thats how you solve that problem.    My father was twice my mother's age. Their marriage worked for 3 decades because    1) my dad was successful  2) my mom loved my dad and he loved her and they build a huge family  3) My mom was enormously religious and thus considered marriage sacred.    So... if you want a successful big gap marriage and want to be a sugardaddy... You have to follow those 3 tips.    be successful. Love your babe. Make sure you marry a devoutly religious one.      My future wife (i havent met yet) wont be 50 until I'm 70. She wont fade until I die. So its a non issue.|`|T1jqDKkTaa	this must not done to any body.  in my opnion u have continue the relationship because u have chosen her and u can not spol the life when she become old where she needs u the lot at that moment of life.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	High Five for shallow people...|`|c2YcBbXyaa	you better go for the girl with the personality cuz looks don't last.........|`|t2sTqzu9aa	No, but I'm guessing you did?
Aj99vuqYaa	As sexy and appealing as it sounds to do it on Valentine's Day, I urge you to wait. Not just because I think that sex should be saved for marriage. But you and him already were saying you wanted to wait. So wait! =) Don't let some silly holiday change your opinion. Go to a romantic movie and have a romantic dinner. Then call it a night. You will not regret waiting until marriage, like you want, because it will be so much more worth it because that's how you saw it all along.    Just because sex isn't usually great the first time, doesn't mean you should have it to "get it over with". That's not what it's about. It's about love for your significant other and also for yourself. You might actually end up regretting having sex before the time you were wanting to because that's not how you wanted it to be.     Wait for it, darlin'. You won't regret it. =)|`|1bfo3ujzaa	WAIT! i have seen too many times when people broke up after they wanted to save it to marrage and it end badly. it will be so much more special on your weeding night|`|EgeId6TKaa	I'm not necessarily an advocate of abstinence, but why don't the two of you have sex on a day that is important to you both? Not just a hallmark holiday. Try your anniversary or something. V-day is played out and unimportant.|`|OZrdXQMyaa	WAIT. It will be way more special on your wedding night. That way you will have a good story to tell your children.|`|SL4eEoCNaa	Wait.  Its better after marriage.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	It is always clever to "mark" your first sexual experience.  That way you two can look back at the memory with fondness.  I think you should do that.  For the rest of your days you will be able to commemorate the day on which you had given up yout virginity.  Good plan.  Go do it.|`|jZlLzRziaa	well i think u should wait|`|QMRq8Cneaa	WAIT! Sex isnt right unless your married. Just wait. If your nervous, thats the cue that your not ready for it. Just because its Valentines day doesnt mean that you HAVE to have sex. You can just show him with a coupple unexpected french kisses to show your appreaciation, but no more than that. Dont feel pressured just because its Valentines day. You both already have the message that u love eachother.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	If you want to wait till you're married then you should wait.  Whilst Valentines day is supposed to be romantic, if you don't really want to have sex than and you're only doing it because you think it might be a good idea, then I'd suggest that you wait.   And talk to the boyfriend. See what he thinks and how he feels about it.|`|w9TwPU2paa	do it when you are ready. don't think you have to do it because it is valentines. day. that would be somewhat cliche.  wait until you are comfortable and ready. you have plenty of time. once you do it, you cant take it back. you want it to be special.|`|d2QiTUWiaa	Don't give in ... wait. The only reason would be if you both are truly ready to do this, and by the "we are both nervous about it" I really don't think you are.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	yeah, just wait until you guys get married
QkpytTi4aa	You are in NO way being insecure! If it were me, I would be extremely upset. Life is too short to be with someone that doesn't think every part of you is beautiful. Please move on. You deserve it as a woman :]|`|6vLrk12Faa	I dont think its very nice of him to treat you like this. He should love you and your body no matter what you look like. Move on...find a man that will love every part of you|`|rd5468H1aa	Dump him, if he's constantly looking at other girls then maybe he'd be better off with them. Find someone else who isn't so shallow.|`|Jh6adlvoaa	You already know the answer in your heart. Therefor you love yourself and you need to leave him because the right person is still out there. Don't waist anymore time.|`|ub23m7Praa	Dump that prlck    He should be telling you how sexy your voice is, how beautiful you are. He should be looking into your eyes and holding your cherub face in his hands and saying how you are the most beautiful girl in the world and how much he loves you and all he wants is you.    Dump him asap|`|zRXkkh0Maa	maybe he didn't mean it, you know sometimes when people get very close to you, they tend to offend you without knowing. talk to him to solve the problem out so that you will feel better.|`|GkE1J8kGaa	Did you let him know this? Because he could be playing.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	What kind of jackass do you have with you thats not a boyfriend at all clearly use your head. Why are you going out with someone who is making you feel bad about your appearence its stupid find someone else that would love you for what you are. That guy doesn't even like you (sorry) he just wanted to be with you so he has a girlfriend to show off it could be any random (sorry)|`|MlgxVr0saa	drop him..  i tell my girlfriend she's bueatiful every day and call her gorgeous and when i kiss her i almost always look her in the eye's and say "your beautiful" or "your pretty" or something..    he'll always be comparing you..  find someone who finds beauty in you..    greatest compliment i've ever gotten..  "dude she's hot how'd you get her??"    "i dunno man, i think someone's paying her to date me. . cause she's way to pretty to date a guy like me"    aim for  one of those..|`|5uFXCBpraa	Why are you dating this guy?|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Dump the clown.|`|nvowgvtzaa	He doesn't respect you. Drop him like he's hot. Seriously, it's a dark road ahead of you, and I think you've probably pushed that to the back of your mind.|`|iPlX3P1Faa	No - he just knows the truth- that your current body is nowhere near hot.    It's funny how the truth pisses all you girls off.... isn't it?|`|SQyVBEIwaa	You need to have confidence, and under no way should your boyfriend make you feel any less of a person.    If your boyfriend is talking about other girls and stuff, you need to confront him. It is not fair on you that he does this, especially because he actually has a girlfriend.|`|diAqosiIaa	then the first step you should do is cut him loose. why be with someone who puts you down?? you know who you are and you are happy(if not you got to love yourself and put you before anyone else) you dont need him and you dont need to put up with that|`|9JS8rw5Saa	i can totally understand where u r coming from. i to am not very pretty and my body could look better. i to am insecure. have been my hole life. but i meet a new guy. and that feeling is no longer there. i say he is a jerk and u get rid of the trash and find urself a new good man.   YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES FROM THINGS U DON'T WANT TO SE, BUT YOU CAN'T CLOSE YOUR HEART ON THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO FEEL.|`|AA10044154	You are not being too sensitive.  I wouldn't waste my time with that guy any longer.  I would tell him that either knock it off or get another girl that more suits his "ideal" (good luck on that).  There is no reason to tolerate verbal/emotional abuse and that is basically what it is.  Relationships are kinda like a scale.  If the bad points and negativity outweigh any good points then it's time to call it quits for sure.  If he is far more nice than anything else and you would be less happy without him, then I guess you'll have to ignore that behavior as I don't see it changing.  It'll probably get worse as time goes by.  If it were me, I'd give him a warning to stop or I'd be moving on.  Good luck to you!|`|kL6yQ5s2aa	You should think seriously about dumping him . A boyfriend is suppose to make you feel good like a goddess not make you feel bad about yourself! He is a cunning bastard,he is putting you down so you won't have the confidence to leave him. I bet he makes you feel" no man would want me and my ugly body",when the only ugly thing is his bad character.Don't let him put you down anymore I know it's hard it's happened to me be strong and dump him you will find someone better that will treat you with love respect.
OegheALwaa	haha i feel the same as you.   um man up and try to talk to them. show them you want to be friends.   smile and seem friendly.|`|IWRKbpVGaa	Sounds like something that is meant to be.  A sign, if you believe in that kind of stuff.  My best friend and I were like that.  Work up the courage, say hi.  Laugh about how you must have a lot in common since they seem to be everywhere.  Or maybe something like, "I just knew you would be here... you seem to be everywhere else I am."  That is how I met my best friend.|`|wNKleK4Uaa	Don't let your shyness get in the way of a potentially brilliant friendship. You said every time you turn a corner they seem to be there, so you obviously have plenty of opportunities to talk to them. Next time you see them, strike up a conversation. Don't be daunted, once you get over the all the friendship hurdles, you should be fine. Some safe topics for conversations are music interests, television shows, school subjects - anything you think you and this person may have in common.     Best of luck!
7CmkRkEMaa	You are very candid and honest about your feelings. Very few are like this. However people of this nature (myself included) are the biggest targets for problems, because we can somehow articulate them better than others. Yet when it comes to our own lives, often our house is not in order. The old adage is apropos "The cobbler cannot fix his own shoes." Yet the cobbler is not arisen to high social stature, but could when the wisdom paradigm exists for raising ones social stature not by the sword or pocket-book then.     Still high social stature does not mean these people have solved the mystery of the self. Often, we judge other's lives finding that, in reality, they were not so happy or confident. Yet what makes one happy is the answer and not concern for someone else ultimately. It is a selfish motive initially in finding our way, but once this self-realisation happens then and only then should we turn to humanity.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Tables will turn!  You'll see!  Don't be so hard on yourself!  Going through rough times only makes you stronger!  Think of it this way, how would she handle it?  Not very well, I'm guessing, because she's had everything handed to her!  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!|`|IWRKbpVGaa	It's only natural to feel envious of your friends.  They have a life that you don't have, and you can't help but wonder what it would be like.  At least you are envious of someone you know, not a total stranger.    If you two are still close, talk to her about it.  She would probably get a kick out of it, and maybe be able to let you know why her life isn't as great as you think it is.  (Even the happiest of people aren't as happy as they look.)  Maybe she can even tell you something in your life she envies.      In the meantime, just keep in mind, there is probably somebody jealous of you for one reason or another.
OXcApjPzaa	Thats a myth you are spreading there. Maybe its just that you bring the worst out of females? shrug.    Every girlfriend I have ever dated has had a good personality except the feminazi.  She was so disgusting she could motivate an entire country of males to genocide chicks and just fertilize test tubes.|`|ii0C0tfXaa	I think you are just talking to the wrong ones...also alot of people are only out for themselves now a days...it sucks the way the world is but it seems like guys are that way as well...hope you find a good girl! good luck...|`|ICOmnGIUaa	life is just stupid all the ugly ones are nice :-( ... you just have to find one thats sticks out of that crowd|`|ryh5AslRaa	If I could understand any of what you said I'd help you. Read back what your wrote next time.
4wlwyhvnaa	Wash daily or every other day. You don't have to wait til you have 6 loads to do. If you have 4 or 5 towells just throw them in. If you can get a load done a night it will take a lot of pressure off you. It has helped me and my wife. Before it seemed like we always had laundry. We would try to do 6 loads in one day then fold then put off putting it away. Do one a day, fold it put it away and you get something accomplished everyday rather than trying to do it when its out of control. Hope this helps.... give it a try.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	You never will, I have three children  that are not infants anymore and I still have a ton of laundry. Your priority is to take care of you new baby and get as much rest as possible. You can't be expected to do everything. Throw a load in once in a while and let everyone go through the laundry basket and find their own clothes. Tell your husband you need his help, if he doesn't want to, then he can wear dirty clothes to work.|`|rH33ty23aa	If he dose not want to go dirty then hubby needs to learn how to wash his own undies|`|hs793CCxaa	Not sure how to say this nicely, but how hard is it doing the washing etc? I do ours and do it around other things.     Before I start making breakfast, I put a load on of say sheets, knowing that I will put the towels on after that, and I know that by the time the towels are finished washing, the sheets will be finished in the dryer and the towels can go straight in the dryer. etc. etc.     It's a matter of being organized. Get hubby helping too.|`|paHjJrrdaa	When you figure that out.... let me know!    Seriously though, I find it helps if you do your laundry every stinkin' day LOL!  It keeps it from growing to unbearable heights!  This website helped me alot and it's free info.  Check it out if you have some time. It helped with all my housework.    http://flylady.net/index.asp
pQBjqMkoaa	idk but i hate talking on the phone i dont like it...at all|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	She is probably playing hard to get so you will chase after her. Girls love to do this because they love attention that they get from guys.    Or she is not really interested in you and is just trying to be nice. That's why when you mention hanging out she ignores you.|`|ujXdjG1gaa	I think this girl does not want to go out with you. If she really wanted to, she would reply right away and be anxious to go out with you. Sorry bud, but something just isn't working out.     Face to face she may be nice, because she may feel like it's rude to blow you off. Maybe she is seeing someone else already, and wants to keep your friendship as it is.|`|99d22dd7b7cd8026652a056d4868918daa	some people are not good at talking on the phone
ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	It sounds to me like you did everything you were supposed to do, you let him have the girl, you stepped out of it.  When their relationship ended you certainly gave it plenty of time before you began dating and you were honest with your friend.    I don't think there is anything you CAN do to make the situation better.  Your friend sounds pretty self-absorbed.  It will take time for him to realized that your friendship is worth keeping and no doubt will be back in your graces before long.  If not then he wasn't much of a friend to begin with.    Be aware though that relationships between friends and girlfriends must be held in a delicate balance.  You don't want to neglect one for the other and want to keep things between them good too.  Best of luck, this is a difficult situation but it won't be the last.|`|xCLX9Aczaa	You should never let someone that you like, interfere with you and your best friend or any of your friends for that matter.  I guess you should tell him that you aren't going to talk or see that girl again because your friendship means a lot more.  If he isn't willing to hear you out it's because he needs some time to cool off.  Also, tell him how bad you feel about the whole situation and how much you regret having feelings for her.  It will make him feel bad and want to forgive you.  Hope this helps!|`|bBTJyWtyaa	i wanna friendship with u|`|0fZGrYNzaa	Giveup your ego.Both are equal in friendship.So you ask sorry to her/Him or any other feelings share with me Ok?
WbcHNSUbaa	Trust me it douesn't annoy us. We laugh because we think your cute and silly. When also laugh because it makes us happy that you're so concerned. And we never want you guys to change or stop doing it.just dont go overboard and make us do stupid things like call you every 10mins so you know we safe.well call you when we arrive safe.    It's really not something you should worry about.dont try to change it, because he loves it and you are just being you. And all couples have it.|`|DyuWvcgjaa	i think the guy who answered b4 me said it all.|`|j6pqXCh9aa	It doesn't annoy them they don't understand.  Women feel things on a different level then men. And yes it is quite normal to worry about the ones you love. And please don't consider yourself weak because you show concern. God made us in a special way. we as women are built to love and to nurture and to make hard things a little softer that's our make up.So no worries and also he may not say it but I bet you it makes him feel good inside to know that you do worry about him.  Good Luck to you.|`|50zbKv0jaa	its funny , we know your irrational and non logical , its funny to be reminded how unlike men you are|`|zka26204aa	I am sure that he was flattered that you care so much, but most men do not like to show that they can be fearful of anything.  Most feel that they are supposed to take care of you and themselves, so they do not want you to think they have any weaknesses
5Slqssqoaa	You sound like a great guy.     All you have to do is get involved. Join activities where you will meet like-minded people. Find ways to help others. Get involved with volunteer work. You meet and learn how to interact with all kinds of people. It will get you out of your shell. Who knows who you will meet?    Don't give in to peer presure. But true to your values.     The lovely girl you want isn't going to knock on your door. Get out there, and one day you will find her.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	You sound like you'd be an awesome boyfriend.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	just wait until you go to college.     1. you won't be a virgin. you'll instead want to sleep with every girl you encounter    2. you will drink A LOT. you won't even know where you are when you wake up    3. you will smoke;; black and mild, you will smoke weed, you will smoke crack, you will smoke cigars    4. you will NOT be what you think are|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	i think u would|`|zKc66WSXaa	If you stay that way yes|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I am sold.  Too bad you are 18.  You sound like my perfect man. Um...just HOW sensitive about your feelings are you.  You don't cry all the time, do you?|`|sVrkjixAaa	Doesn't sound like you've had that fun of a life man...    Not a girl, but I do know that not all girls like the same type of guy. Go out there and find a girl that you, for lack of a better word, click with and you'll be a great boyfriend.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	You sound cool but I like someone a bit more... on edge. I do like the quietness and shyness though. Just if you had a crazy personality underneath...|`|AA10246871	You sound like a really great guy.    Some day, an equally great girl will come along and see your beauty, and then you will be able to share your lives with each other.     It may take time, but she will come eventually. Trust me on that.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	you sound perfect to me; like really haha|`|h99Mcg6taa	Yes, you would, but you've gotta stop being shy and a loner, it might get boring after a while.   Have confidence in yourself, but remain in touch w/ your sensitive side (not too much though=)  Good luck.|`|yB6Vg65Daa	You sound like an amazing person. And the answer to your question: of course! You're good enough to even THINK of asking yourself and others this question. Good luck!|`|d2QiTUWiaa	Hey man, I'm not a girl or anything, but I'm like you. I think a lot of girls would like you but they will never know unless you speak up more. Don't worry about getting a girlfriend or something, just try to make friends - guys and girls (but mostly girls haha). If you make friends, you'll find that one girl you can get along with really well and that's when you start wondering if she'll like you as a boyfriend. Chill, when you find her everything will fall into place.|`|hngTcCnKaa	i guess you can stay that way until you go to college.. a lot of changes happen during college years, especially for guy, even for the so called "nice guys". They learn to at least drink or smoke and had their first experience with girls. some would do drugs,but not all. I think you would be a good boyfriend if you will be someone who will have a lot of experiences in life.. try to broaden your hobbies, have more friends and be engaged in more activities, that way your future gf would find you very attractive and she wouldn't ever get bored with you.There is nothing wrong with being plain and simple but for me, I would love to go out with a person who knows a lot about life, and someone who also knows control. goodluck|`|dAGrmSFvaa	Yes, you would make a good boyfriend.     Especially the openness and honesty. Bust also, that your going to school It shows you make an effort to learn new things.    Hope you find a nice girl that can make you happy.|`|lyOsZa6baa	Is this Jack Hennes?|`|Y0zNfd19aa	your cool but if you are an atheist that gets you MANY extra points with the ladies|`|cGazG1Tuaa	Great- a non-smoker and not a person who'd brag.    Speak up more.    Especially to girls.|`|Qe1lSunUaa	of course you do  you are the kind of guy that girls should be dating right now|`|gBc1Z6gBaa	Of course!     What is your number? lol yeh that is the sort of attitude I would want in a guy|`|nGR3IfgXaa	you sound like me LOL|`|UXNXntARaa	Sounds like you would make an amazing boyfriend and one day, an amazing husband. If you find it difficult to get a girlfriend now just wait a few years when the girls your age will be looking for boyfriends with potential to be a husband.  If you really want a girlfriend now just try opening up, and not being so shy. College is all about opening up, meeting new people, and learning more about yourself.|`|QawQ2usdaa	You sound like an awesome guy! i love the no drinking/smoking part!
AHX4wxQaaa	Yes, I would forgive my brother. You will never forget but you should forgive as the lord did through all of our mistakes. Why, notify the police. Your brother probably is weigted down with the quilt everyday especially if he loves you. Turning him in won't bring back your hubsand. Forgive and start mending. It will take some time. Prayers do help.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I would definitely turn my bother in for killing my husband and no i wouldn't ever forgive him for that.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	hard one .. but he is your kin|`|DufCLIMsaa	I hate my brother to bits - so I kick his *** if he did it to my dad.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	    What a strange question,dunno coz i have a child   think that would  make a difference,oh i love my brother loads tho,We r really close..So i suppose id have to forgive him,I wouldt send him to prison,But id never have contact with him again. x|`|AA11496842	If there was a reward out for the murder oh hell yes I would turn my brother in.|`|onbwN4csaa	You asked this two or three days ago.  Your playing with us.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	I would turn my brother in. Murder is murder no matter how you look at it... and if my brother killed my husband i would want him to pay for it.     would I forgive him... maybe in time.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	Face?  Bov vered?|`|NTK4XLuDaa	I wouldn't forgive and prison it would be for him. Crime is crime no matter who commits it.|`|CCqqTw6paa	yes, then you know for sure you can use him at any given moment and he'll stop doing whatever it is at the drop of a hat to do what you want =D|`|RgpK7vVJaa	This is the strangest question! It is an essay - right?     Under most circumstances the answer to this would be simple - murder is the most serious crime and should be punished.      There have been cases though where I think everyone is glad to see the bad person killed and the only victim is the one that goes to prison.  So therefore there must be exceptions to this rule I suppose.    Why did the brother kill the husband? - was he a bad or cruel husband in some way? Was the brother worried about his sisters wellfare?  And how did he kill him - did he kill him by accident or deliberately? Could the death have been avoided?  If not, then this was not a murder.  You say he angrily killed him - does the brother have an anger issue that was not just this once, but he has problems.    I do hope this is the last chapter of a book you are writing and not real life!|`|zka26204aa	I might forgive my brother, but murder is against the law, with good reason.  No one has the right to take another person's life, regardless of how angry he gets, unless his own life is in jeopardy.  I would have to, regretfully, turn my brother in.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i probably wouldn't forgive him too easily ..but i wouldn't turn im into the police.Even though its a crime it wouldn't feel right.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	wow do your parents even know your up this late! lol... get some sleep omg this is too funny! GET SOME SLEEP!!!|`|H3x8tXbraa	All murder should be reported regardless of the circumstances. he might do it again.
167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Its our sexy perv nature!|`|EENUWAP7aa	If you are that easily influenced then you need a spanking once in a awhile.    You know better then that. Why get involved with online relationship with a serious Apple Bite? You know you could end up with a Porcupine.|`|ib10oHUZaa	they need control n power....  just be careful n dnt get 2 attached...|`|JkvlAVX2aa	You think a man who wants more than just normal friendship is a pervert???    Unless he is requesting some unusually sex acts or behavior, he is no pervert.    You are right that he is a player.  However, he may just be a player who likes to try his chances with as many women as he can.      Still, there are players can be respectful...as in he will respect the boundary that you clearly set for him and he will not cross the line.|`|4wlwyhvnaa	I think the problem is men also look for the same thing you were looking for. My guess is he was taken, maybe married. He would love to have someone who is just great and can have a connection with just like you are looking for. I think when men lose that connection with their loved one sometimes they seek to to find it again in another woman. Maybe for him you gave him what his woman doesn't. If he wasn't taken my guess is he loved your personality and what you bring to the table. You have what he wants in a woman. Sometimes men don't know how to seperate finding a perfect woman and putting their penis wherever it fits. So maybe he had the same connection with you but doesn't know how to have a relationship or friendship without it being sexual. I don't think it means he is a bad person but maybe his needs are greater than what you know. Maybe his insecurities make him grab on and try to keep a woman with more than just who he is. I think a lot of men are not comfortable with the man their are and they over compensate by trying to be macho or  trying to dominate women by sleeping with them. For some people it is a sense of accomplishment although it is merely a false sense of relief for them at the time. Don't fret on it..... you will find what you need. You learn something from every conversation you have with someone but you have to figure out what positives and what negatives came from it. Don't dwell on the negatives.... learn from them and flourish in the positives.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	I had this happen with a woman. I thought she was cool and shared the same problems I had. We exchanged email addresses. Over the year that I emailed her it seemed that every time I told her something about my ex husband or about our court issues, he always seemed to know. I still don't know to this day who the person was but after I cut my association with her or was it a him, my ex husband now knows nothing about me anymore. I have had one or two try and be a friend to me but their profiles were so new that I could only imagine it had to be my ex again, trying to pry into my life again.     There was one woman that I met on answers and she was pretty cool. She has a husband, kids, etc, just like me and we are about the same age. We met on the religion section. This was two years ago. We are still friends today and have talked on the phone and we both have a myspace page and have seen family pictures and all that. Yes, she is legitimate and has proved herself. I associtated with her before the second one came along.     Still, ever since the second one I have not let anyone else I don't know on here get too close. I guess I should have known because the second one had a strange lifestyle about her husband's multi millionaire ex wife and she use to brag about money all the time and complain about expensive child support and things like that. Stories that were pretty much made up lies. Also she would suddenly start asking me very personal questions about my marriage and my ex husband and my ex husband really seemed to be her topic of interest. I still don't even really know if she was male or female but I can honestly guess she was a good friend to my ex husband.    I did meet one really cool man on here once though that helped me with some legal questions.|`|2af0846f15f70079f1cd48b8e6d1218daa	Its not all men, its hard for a man not to be a pervert when all he's getting out of it is just a long distance relationship with a girl he still barely knows or sees....plus, if he is as great as you make him out to be in terms of personality (why would he spend all his time on yahoo answers?) when he can be meeting girls he can pursue actively.

GOOD LUCK!.|`|vx0u07ljaa	u r sick and a moron person .......
WWIpMRsgaa	Either that she is cute. Or you are trying to check out her butt/chest/body out. The smile would mean that he likes what he see's.|`|ZoSpdTIbaa	"I wish I wasn't a ***** so I'd go up and talk to her!" At least, that's what most guys think I figure. Hell, I don't know.|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	If a guy does that, he is attracted to you and he wants you to know. So guys do that to make it obvious, and see how you respond. They are just letting it out there to say "I like what I see"|`|V4PA9foJaa	yup, definitely, whether it's the eyes or body, when we stare, remember that we are checking you out!!!|`|99d22dd7b7cd8026652a056d4868918daa	yes yes and vice versa right?|`|IPS3hWweaa	It means the guy finds you attractive, so attractive in fact that he is frozen in place sometimes and all the guy can do is stare and smile. It's total mind blowing experience when that happens. The brain shuts down, being able to form sentences becomes impossible. We are at your mercy!|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	When I stare at a girl it means I'd like to introduce myself to her, but I can't because I'm so shy it's almost a mental disorder..|`|Or1FSQxKaa	I do it cos I like what I see
pwfy6gbBaa	It sounds like he is worried about himself or doesnt take thngs to serious. What kind of sign did he mean? If I was with a woman like you I would of texted back are you ok, You don't have to worry about him as long as Im around, I would try and calm you down, I would want to make you feel secure. I don't think he comprehends ur situation. If it was me and you where comfortable and ready to bring me around your kids I would of come over to comfort you. A good relationship is hard to find now a days especially when kids are involved. Now you need to find someone good for u and ur kids. It could be he just wasnt thnkng before he opened his mouth. Sometimes I find myself saying things before I think and it comes out wrong or a mis understanding. How has the rest of your relationship been going between you 2|`|nvowgvtzaa	Sounds like the guy just didn't know how to react, tried to be funny, and went down in flames. Tell him it's not funny, and you were seriously upset, though to get him to realize that in the future, it's really going to take some work.|`|5RZ4R3Rnaa	I think maybe he was just joking to make you feel better.    If you've spoken to him and he was being serious. Then maybe you should think about being  in a relationship where your man actually has the balls to protect you!    If not, I think maybe you should just accept it's a hard situation to be in for a guy. He obviously cares for you if he's with you and he probably just didn't know how to handle it.    Let him know you have concerns.    x|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Have been in a relationship similar to this. He used to beat her pretty bad.  You have to be careful that you don't force your old problems onto him. I used to get the fallout and abuse from her just because I was a male when she was having a bad time. It didn't last much longer as someone who forces the other to accept their problem and treats them different = baggage.  Sounds harsh but be careful.|`|jTeDpBjlaa	On one hand, maybe he was being a coward.     On the other hand, maybe he's afraid that if your ex finds you with another man, it would be worse on you.    (but mostly, I'd think he was being chicken)    I think you'll have to ask him directly to find out one way or the other.    Good luck, in any case!!!|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	Relax its just a dream but i do understand   maybe your bf was playing around i guess   but right now he should come over to you and comfort you and tell you its a dream and he is there for you   thats what i would of done atleast   he will call tomorrow and probably say he is sorry|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	Well i think it's obviously the wrong answer, maybe he was just trying to be funny and it didn't work.   I would of asked if you were ok and comfort you by telling you it was only a dream.|`|blfxu48Maa	I was in an abusive relationship, I would look at it as a sign that he could have those same emotional abuse tendencies. A guy who really cared about you, would of calmed your nerves instead of saying, "well I'm not going to be there if he does show up, I could get hurt."    I say talk to him and tell him that you felt a little hurt that he didn't care more about you. If he doesn't get it, ditch him. Once you are in an abusive relationship you are more likely to be in one again,  unless you actively look for the signs and leave earlier. I'm not saying you aren't looking,  it's just the sad truth it happens.     You are right to feel he's been selfish, because he is, best of luck to you, i know it's hard to forgot emotional abuse, and how hard it is to still have those nightmares where the person comes back.|`|AlEGoAMgaa	I'm a guy. I would have forgotten about the dream and would not have tried to assign any significance to it. It's merely your own brain thinking what it wants, so the only thing I would take away from that dream, is that you are afraid of your ex. As far as your BF, if he wanted to come over, that would be cool, and if he didn't, that would be cool too.     Basically there's not need to lose your cool over this.|`|4JIku478aa	Lol your bf is a wimp. His response should have been "That makes me glad I'm staying over" so he could comfort you and protect you if needed. Not run away with a tail between his legs. Find someone with some more balls.|`|Pk02ucx2aa	Not sure the dream is a sign but aside from that, I just got out of an EXTREMELY psychological & mentally abusive relationship with an extremely jealous man. I'm running as far away from his soon as possible.    But if yer current man is that self involved, get rid of him, too.|`|S6Trp9xSaa	Your boyfriend is a lame wuss. Sorry, that's just how it sounds!|`|R5vLLS6baa	i think if you really do care about this guy you should tell him how you feel and let him know that that wasn't cool or funny!|`|og3Tmn0saa	Um, I probably would have driven over to your house if you were really worried about this dream, but I'm 6'4" and can dish out a lot of pain to an abusive ex so...  His text back sounds like maybe he was trying to be funny? IDK... If he was serious that's kinda sissy of him and mean and unsupportive.|`|MlgxVr0saa	first of all... i don't care if he was twice as big... i'd defend my girl some how.. they make bats..  but i tell you this..   i'd die before i'd let someone so much as touch my girl...    i love her alot tho..|`|AA10771601	I think he was just joking with you. It was just a dream, not necessarily a sign.  I wouldn't dwell on it, but i'd bring it up again in person and let him know you were hurt by his comments on something so serious.|`|GWna2slVaa	I wouldn't have said that  I'd be like  "Awh babe, it's just a dream. I'LL PROTECT YOU"  And then proceed to go over there with my cape and superman underwear, and try to make you laugh.    But he was probably just kidding.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	Kick that guys butt to the curb.. you definitly dont want him in your life. That was NO way to respond at all. My reply would have been.... Its ok I am on my way over. Even tho it was just a dream it can still be scary especially if it reminds you of an actual occurance.|`|V6BWAWoyaa	That probably wasn't the best way of reacting in his part but he probably didn't mean it like that.  Some guys say stuff just to get you to stop talking.  It isn't a sign he is going to find you.  Hopefully he has moved on.  Dreams come from your subconscious.  Whether you have thought about him or not.  There is always a possibility that he is going to find you.  But don't think think that way.  Keep your head up and be aware what's behind you.  I don't think it was selfish of him to say that but he should have made you feel more comfortable as well.  Of course if I was in your shoes I would feel the same way you do.
Qks0PQhAaa	Attraction is the "chemistry" part of love. It's all about the physical  even sexual  interest that two people have in each other. Attraction is responsible for the desire we feel to kiss and hold the object of our affection. Attraction is also what's behind the flushed, nervous-but-excited way we feel when that person is near.     Closeness is the bond that develops when we share thoughts and feelings that we don't share with anyone else. When you have this feeling of closeness with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you feel supported, cared for, understood, and accepted for who you are. Trust is a big part of this.     Commitment is the promise or decision to stick by the other person through the ups and downs of the relationship.   and that includes best friends or family but when its romantic love closeness and attraction combines together :) and thats why we get hooked on 1 person and want to stay with them|`|IfwpibHqaa	one is lonely two's a company and we need that chemistry|`|QkIfyLdgaa	Its a chemical reaction in the body scientifically speaking.

paHjJrrdaa	Sell Avon together.  You can sell and your mother can sell. There is a line geared just for teans called "Mark".  You could both sign up, but I would just have you mom do it and sell for her to help with bills.  Just don't buy stuff yourself, besides sales tools.  This is a good side job until something better is found. You can sign up online to now.  It used to be only $10, but sometimes they don't have a fee at all.  When you sign up there is lots of info on the avon website to help you get started and suceed.  It really is EASY and if you push yourself you can make an extra $300-$400 or more a month.  That should help for now.     It's so refreshing to see young one's pitching in to help now a days.  You can get thru this together.  Just keep on applying and try to wait it out.  Cut back on phones, cable, ect.  I also found some good books on saving on grocery bills. My favorite is "Dinnner's in the Freezer".

What is right and what is wrong just never really justified to me when me and my buddy got fired from a job over a porn tape that was left in  the T.V in the break room. We both worked at Worthington Steele.    This is what we did. We both had families and we needed a job in the worst way and we got desperate.    We both got a nice clean hair cut and then put our suits on and tie  shiny Black Shoes and had a small white pale.     Taped to the pale was a piece of paper that said,Please Donate, Christian Ministries Needs Your Supprt and on the bottom it says God Bless You. We stood on each side of the Highway off ramp at the intersection.     When the light turns red we run out to all the cars & Trucks and you look for people that raise their hands and roll their windows down in some cases and want to donate a dollar in your pale. Put that pale slam in their window so they can read it.  People reached in their pockets , wallets and purses and donated change and money dropping one dollar bills at a time. I was completely shocked.    Do you believe that by the end of the day we both had collected over $1,000.00 dollars each working in the hot sun in a suit and tie doing what we did. We started at 8:00 Am and quit at 6:00 PM. We both we exhausted it was a wild day/    The only thing was that the money went to our families and we are all God fearing, but somehow God let us have that one day and blessed us.    We never went out and did it again for fear we would get in trouble, but for that one time I received enough money to hold my family down until we both started working at Bartletts Ferry Dam.    True Story believe it or not.    This is America the Land of Opportunity and Wealth.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Listen, I really understand what you are going through. I lost my job recently also.

LOL|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	no|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Yes, and when Merrill Lynch speaks, no one listens anymore.|`|MlweGfaKaa	That is sooo true man lol.. like really badly true.|`|viIAJ4TZaa	It depends on what right/wrong things you do|`|4ccwsEryaa	depends|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	It depends....I choose not to let it bother me...
KB6JsOVtaa	well no. well my close friends are back at home and i go to school 2 hours away from them. but every time i go back home to visit, i make sure i go see them. when one is out of high school we become busy with other things. its not the same thing like in highschool when we see each other every day. people have to realize that we are on different paths and that we wont be seeing each other as much as we did before. If they can't handle it, oh well. If they dont see  and support that you are working toward something to better yourself, then they really arent good friends for you anyways. well, good luck on your masters. just keep with what you are doing and try to visit your friends as much as you can. do not hurt your chances of getting good grades though.|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	beginning of college i did.      Towards the end, apart from classes, not everyday.  Maybe a few times a week.       I'm doing my masters now too and i'm rarely see them.  I'm working too....i'd say once every 2 weeks.|`|g2KhN4rzaa	I don't understand ur question.|`|ib10oHUZaa	did u used 2 hang with them more?  because ppl cnt handle change..takes them time 2 get used 2 it.  just explain 2 them ur education is important but they rnt less important n will try 2 keep a balance.|`|zka26204aa	Some people are not as dedicated to their studies and mature as you are.  When you are making the big bucks, and they are struggling, they will wish they had been as studious as you.  If they are true friends they will understand when you tell them that you are trying to be serious about your studies, because you are working toward a good and successful career.  Tell them you will have more time for fun and games when you are stable in your career.|`|8mTSYmvhaa	are you in town or out of town?  i moved 45 minutes away from college and i'm lucky if i see my friends once a week.  we have to make time for our families and our jobs.  your friends probably have nothing better to do and that is why they are mad.   i think its completely normal to not see your friends much. in fact, every time we DO see each other its a big occasion and it feels really good.
c9df3bd9f369154d93aaff27c1c3b49aaa	Perfectly natural. In fact particularly so for females because of the structure of your pelvis (hip bone). So in a way you're actually supposed to do that. To a certain extent, at least. There's also the fact that locking both your knees for too long cuts off the blood flow and can make you pass out.|`|75WCghuTaa	I stand like that all the time and i don't do it to pose! Standing with both legs straight is uncomfortable...|`|lwXyuS2yaa	It would be better to sit..with your legs wide open..and me between them.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	I stand like that, but I think I go from standing up straight and bending one leg. lol There's nothing wrong with the way you stand.
JwW4UOPFaa	does she have any good quailty ??? ( caring honest funny smart)   did you try to tell her i don't want to know what people are saying about me but she didn't listen ?  if so and you feel comfortable not talking to her then do what makes you comfortable
adetUhXiaa	Only in the shower. He laughs and laughs and laughs. How can I deny his joy?|`|AA11156037	No.    I would never Pee on anyone especially MY WIFE    and yes, I saw Team America.     "I so ronery"|`|LlRAOMq8aa	No no ,thats nasty i can i even think about it ,,Yakk no n no t on me|`|SL4eEoCNaa	No thanks, what is the appeal to that?|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	The movie was made to be a movie....But no that is inappropriate!!! What are you guys doing behind closed doors..??|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I did it to my ex when we both were in the shower with water running down on her.  So, my pee was washed away almost instantly.    It wasn't sexual.  It was just screwing around for fun to show her the "hose" can go up and down, left and right, as well as controlling the intensity and distance.    It was fun for only once or twice.  We didn't do this again.  After all, most women think pee is "dirtier" than semen.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	My wife thinks its funny when I spray full blast into her belly button. She's weird. Only in the shower though.|`|paHjJrrdaa	Hell no that is gross! And yes I seen the movie.  GROSS!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I know that if you have a jellyfish sting then doing that does cure it.|`|SFoMSEpgaa	Are you wanting a whole bunch of yes's or no's to make you feel better?|`|TVz2UoOyaa	yes BUT only in the shower..and its just for fun.. : )|`|AA10771601	been married for 7 years and i have not had my husband pee on me. pee is dirty and a waste product why would i want it on me. plus it stinks.|`|TolGczKOaa	Uh, no.|`|georvDhgaa	If i had a wife, i would not even let her infest my bathroom with her dirty germs. i would summon her to go to the neighbor's restroom|`|4wlwyhvnaa	Haha Team America is a classic!!!! And for me my wife doesn't let me pee on her. I wouldn't want to pee on her..... ew. Haha great question|`|nRtf72u8aa	I was married BUT that whole pee-peeing on ur spouse/partner is freakin nasty & sick. Ive heard of crazy fetishes but that is one of em that I consider way beyond grose...not into that!    Who ever is...ya got problems|`|jvHIqtp2aa	No I don't, its bad enough that he farts at will in bed. Can't he even try to hold it in?|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	No I have never seen the movie and no I would never allow my husband to do something as disgusting as pee on me.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Nope I find that totally revaulting and off putting|`|vsKrGw2caa	good gosh NO|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	why not, it's only what you put in the toilet, why not splash it all over yourself.
AG3dYL84aa	You might have found a secret to the Prom there bud.  But the important thing is she needs to be a good person.  Or this might not so great.    Just by asking her you're in her good books.  But she has to be a nice person.  If she is, even if she doesn't fancy you by the end of the night, she will rave to her friends what a gentleman you are.  She will be you're wing woman (maybe for life).  Not on prom night but later.  I'm still best friends with my prom date and she's set me up with some of the best dates of my life.  Never a bad thing.    But it only works on nice girls.  If she's a beeaach then she may do the opposite.  She will see you as her possession and bad mouth you to every other girl to keep your attention on her even though she will never give it back.    I think you need some peer advice on this.  Not from your male friends but from your female friends.  Ask them what type of girl she is when she's not around you.    On a side note.  The funniest thing is, one of the girls who gives you advice probably will have a big crush on you.  She may or may not give you the right information.  That doesn't matter because she's caught trying to tell you the truth and thinking of your feelings.  Literally look at her face when she gives it to you and you will know which girl likes you.  Then if everything falls apart at the prom don't be surprised if she's the one to come over and talk to you and ask "what's wrong".     Also, another girl may fall for you just by you thinking of doing this.  This is a no lose situation but don't ask any girls who like to gossip.  And try to ask them by not including the fact that you're thinking of taking to them to the prom if you think they might say something.    No matter what, you're going to have a great adventure. Go for it.  Good luck.|`|P17HujJ4aa	its not wrong at all! All couples start out knowing each other. Don't worry, you can do it! Good luck!|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, it's not wrong. In fact, that's what you should do because every couple must start as friends anyway.
RmwVC33Waa	Well I think, the best way is ignoring and avoiding them, after some time, they'll ultimately get the point.|`|5EL12Tjuaa	There is no polite way of saying it because your going to hurt them if it's in a nice tone of voice or nasty, but what you can do is, avoid them and ignore them if that doesn't work then nicely say (even thought it's not nice) 'I really think your a great person but I don't want to be mates, if that's okay, i'm sorry' then just disappear but I think it would really hurt the person.    Or you can just try being friends, maybe you will get to know the person and you might start liking the person, who knows it can happen.|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	You can't. It sounds mean put that way however you do it. I don't know the situation or why you don't want to be friends with them, however, I think if you really don't think you can lower yourself to be their friend, you will just have to tell them.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Ignore them and maybe they will get the hint|`|xsP90gEbaa	Write them a letter|`|7dyzaIWlaa	Of course there is NO easy or polite way at all..  Your just looking for the easy option but the truth is your going to hurt this person's feeling more then you will ever know    Really really think about it    And my strong suggestion is do not go ahead with it|`|VZPiLBVgaa	Say to them 'i'm sorry i would not like us to be friends but i don't hate you' [even if you do]    there really is no nice way 2.  or when they talk groan and say watever. they will get the hint. and in future years you can say to them when they say 'u hate me' "i never said that"|`|gWuJmAHwaa	start giving them annoying **** and bagging them out and THEY WILL LEAVE YOU. AND, all you have to do is piss them off!!  Win, Win situation!!|`|Hr2fRVW1aa	u dont owe them anyhing ....just avoid them.|`|8mTSYmvhaa	you have to have a good reason.
c2YcBbXyaa	i'd definately hang out with you if you told me all that stufff...i'd think it was so cool to finally meet someone who's so brutally honest...i hate the bullsh*t mind games also....i think you sound like loads of fun..you should really try that just for an experiment, it'll probably work and if it doesn't...you really haven't lost anything
LLhmWi2daa	your local court clerk usually does wedding licenses and most have a website you can google. i'm getting married in july in tennesse and mine is $100 for the license. if you just want the title of mrs. then try seeing if a judge or justice of the peace can do it and just wear a nice dress and if he goes in the military he can wear his dress uniform. you will need at least one witness to sign so bring along ur best friend. then when he comes home have a bigger ceremony on your anniversary. good luck!|`|CaPZrWVWaa	google your local area and wedding licence. You can find a number to call to find out the price for a licence and getting married in a court.    Then spend what you will on dress and whatever you need, maybe a small family meal.|`|ObJTgBafaa	Thousands!!!!!!  About the same amount as a deposit for a house!|`|BJeFSlHHaa	It costs about half your stuff|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Probably less then 500. Are you really sure you want to get married just so you can get notified? I mean that shouldn't be your main reason...There area always other ways to find out the new's I hope you know...
cLfIJgudaa	all u have to pay for is the marriage license and a jp then. so i'm guessing $100-$300 depending where you live|`|CaPZrWVWaa	Invitations done at home can cost $20. Hire a printer, its much more.    A guest costs about $100 each. They can cost $50 or $200, it depends on what you plan.    There's the venue; a church can be free to a few hundred, or even a few hundred for a permit for a public place.    A dress can be anywhere from $100-$2000, depending on where you live.    Then there are flowers, photographer, DJ/Band.    Don't forget gifts for those standing up for you, or the in-laws.    And then the license can be between $20-$70 depending on where you live.     Its all about the number of guests, and how many details you want. You can have a wedding for 1k or 20,000k. Its all up to you.
PRUXtYh5aa	Yes and no.  I confessed that some things we did before we got married really are my most prominent fantasy.  She was really into it when we were younger and acted like she was interested when I told her, but when I took action to help make it happen she reacted with disinterest.  It has been over a year since those occurrences and through some reading and sharing I think we are nearing her opening and being willing to try it.  I can email more info on how I have learned to get her to open up if you want more info.|`|dFlc9DVsaa	I like to but I'm hesitant because he's not into it...|`|uoEfoI7aaa	yes...  and the answer was NO|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	YES  And it was not a negative response
qBkJAlQ1aa	Take courage. Just tell them its a choice you made and that its going to make you a better productive person they can be proud of..|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Why should you tell them that?    There is no need to do so..    -R|`|6c0fd27a2a28c7e9360c27270df04d3aaa	It's none of their business.|`|5d32Q1Craa	If they don't have a problem with it, then tell them.. Just sit them down - "mom, dad, I'm bi-sexual" .. The only thing I could say they would have a problem with , is if they find out on their own, then they would probably feel you didn't trust them enough to tell them.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Why do you feel the need to tell them? The only reason to tell them is if you bring a girl over.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I don't tell my dad about my sex life. Unless you want to bring a woman home... why worry about it|`|wwEnL5tBaa	Maybe just sit them down and tell them together. If they wont be mad or anything then it shouldnt be a problem :)    Good luck!!|`|89d5ff1143ba4933930c3f9d4514c142aa	If you know they will be ok about it just do it, wait till your all together and just say mum dad i have something to tell you then come straight out with it, then say anyone for a cup of tea and leave them a few minutes to digest what you have told them, then when you take their tea in just say any questions you want answering im happy to do so, I love you both and know this wont make you love me any less, I just wanted you to know that's all.|`|Ua3rJomUaa	Do not worry because at one day they came to know just tell them because its not your fault.|`|qqm78P2Saa	You know your parents better than anyone on here will ever know. You know how your parents will probably react and what the best situation to tell them any kind of news.    Go with a more relax feel, maybe just sit down privately at your house and talk to them. If not, get out of the house and go for a walk or something. Walking is relaxing and its a great way of having important conversations....at least for me!|`|znvx2NMQaa	if they wont be mad justt sit down with them one day an just say something like    hay mum and dad i got something i need to tell you i like girls as well as guys i hope your not mad at me but i just wanted to be open with you.|`|yptfd3sIaa	Subtlety. Hang a picture of a cute, scantily-clad guy up in your room. Next to it, a cute girl in a bikini. When Mom asks about it (and she will), say, "Well look at her! She's H-O-T!"  IOW, I don't think you need to leap out of the closet with streamers on this one. Just ease them into the understanding that you find both sexes sexy. :)|`|HmQzOLv6aa	don't worry much, take a good chance and time to talk to them and tell them straight that you're bla bla bla and they will understand you if they really love you.
0f3wWfC8aa	yea i think|`|WU4MHq3aaa	ohhh... the guy named ronnie?    i dunno.....|`|zQQd2wPRaa	WHAT?!|`|YyFexhd3aa	how the **** i would know
DyuWvcgjaa	oh god man,  tell her how u feel!!!!    theres this guy who i like....who i'm like 100% sure likes me a lot. we've been friends for ages.     but he'll never have the guts to tell me...he tries to hint...but it always ends up wrong....    and do u know how frustrating that is???!!!!    please just TELL HER!|`|jdJBuKrUaa	dude just tell her how you feel.  if you are the 1 in tears....turn in your man card!!!!!!|`|AA12346188	Your's is one way problem  Unless she is interested in you, you cannot go ahead.  Find another girl instead of wasting your valuable time on an uninterested girl.  Life is short - make it sweet.  Read the book titled: MEN ARE FROM MARS - WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS.  they are very different than men.|`|qRwmWmDBaa	Did you end up in tears or did she? because if you did that's probably why she doesn't like you.|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	well if you really like her just tell her how u truly feel....if its meant to be it will happen...good luck!|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	So do you wanna ask her out or something?    If so just do it, if she says yes, then great, if she says no, then move on.    Good Luck
d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	You should always be yourself in any situation, no matter who you are with.  This whole relationship doesn't sound right, sounds like he has a free baby sitter, if i was you i'd sit down and have a good think of what you would like xx    Good Luck|`|og3Tmn0saa	Why have you become the baby sitter for a guy you hardly get to spend time with? I love a feisty girl that isn't afraid to open her mouth and tell some ***** how she feels! I mean, you gotta play nice in front of the kids, but damn...|`|JaOddaodaa	r u crazy, u r dating a man, who has not gutts..........he shud hav stood beside u, instead of indirectly supporting his ex-    u shud immediately leave him, dnt expect that he will ever support u, not even after u get married to him.
464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	It is only a waste if you think it was. If you remember the good things about your time with him, then you will feel better about the time you spent with him. You apparently shared alot in common with him, otherwise you would not have had so much to talk about. Possibly it filled some need you had at the time, and if you are now feeling regret, this is natural, because you now  for some reason , have changed your expectations of this interaction (from when you were with him) and wished it had been more than it was.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I don't think it was a waste. You got companionship and friendship for a period in your life.    And people are different online than they are in person. This may have been a good thing because this way, if he was different in real life then you won't have to deal with that disappointment.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	My best mate is in the same type of relationship online with a woman and they have never met and likely never will (IMHO). But they seem to have had a very rich, and deep relationship that I feel has enriched both their lives. Not meeting shouldn't detract from the connection you have had with this guy.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Yea, internet relationships=crap|`|C9th0daNaa	yes|`|cGazG1Tuaa	I have the same situation as you.. but it could be safer if you two never meet. You'd never know what sort of person he/she is in real life (maybe a huge crook who acts nice and whatever in front of you). Play safe.|`|NiuOD9wYaa	Thanks!

Flirt, be fun, and be safe if anything happens.  When you get in your late 20's then worry about getting serious.  Your boys will break up with their girls when they get to college anyway.  You're lucky to be unattached!  Good Luck Man!
xNY9sgUBaa	All you can really do is keep your precious children away from their troubled little boy. He is not your problem. Unfortunately, you cannot tell someone else how to raise their children. The boy obviously needs help. It is a shame that he isn't getting it. Please continue to protect your children. They are your first priority.    I would just keep my distance from such people. Your in-laws really need a wakeup call. They will get it...someday. Until then, go about your own life and enjoy your lovely family.     Best wishes.|`|5HwgJHutaa	its good that you and your husband had that fight with them,you protected your children,defended them and are keeping them safe far away from those basketcases. I praise your child for defending her sister.those inlaws and their child are bad influences on your children...every thing happens for a reason...and this is for the better.|`|AA11496842	I would go off on the SIL and Hell would freeze over first before I allowed ther demon son anywhere near my daughter.|`|afkygHMgaa	Clearly there is no problem here. Just keep your kids away from hers. But I must mention that your comments about her kids looks make you sound like a kid yourself. That is truly childish.|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	she sounds like a mental case and her kid is acting out the pain. keep her and him away from your kids. period.|`|3ba3d366710c221dbd1c68c4c6c1b3ddaa	You need to set boundaries because your daughter is too young, Keep them away.
Eug52iQDaa	It's probably not you, sweetie.  I doubt if anyone would have been good enough for her boy.    That she blatantly took your daughter anywhere without your permission is not a negotiable breach.  They are not her children, but yours.  Your DH should be with you when you sit down with her and come to an agreement about what is and is not allowed, and when you receive your apology.  DH should be completely on board with this, by the way.  These are his children, not his siblings.  Different responsibilities.  MIL does not ever have to respect or like you, but she must respect your rules as parents.  Period.    I wish I could be more supportive, but I don't think that I would be letting the children visit without clearing the air and an agreement on the rules (and that apology).  Sorry.  I don't think that if her MIL did the same thing that it would have set well?  :)|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I'd NEVER let her have my kids alone again. That's what I did with my dad and his wife. They understood we did not want our child taken to church and they agreed to that. We are atheists. They then took our child for a baptism without our consent. I forced the church to rescind it. And I never left my children with them again EVER. Not even for LUNCH. NOTHING ALONE.  My parents had their shot "to do whatever they wanted" with their own kids. My grandparents would NEVER interfere like that. And I'm not having it either.  It's your family not theirs.. they have NO RIGHT to disobey you. And with the ONE you're talking about it seems like a power trip. You have to keep it under control or she will do it again.    I even heard my dad say to someone, don't worry we'll get those kids CHRISTIAN... well "those kids" decided as ADULTS for themselves.     and dad did not get his way. but he ripped all adult family life to shreds because I simply didn't trust him with my kids anymore.|`|j6pqXCh9aa	Bravo!!! You did the right thing. Don't let anyone I don't care who it is dis respect you.  I would not let my children anywhere near her because she apparently does not respect the rules you have put forth for your children so she should not be privileged with having them.  Your husband should understand you feelings on this.  I understand that she is his mother but you are his wife and your feelings should come first. if you don't want anything to do with the mother in law from hell then he should respect that.  Stick to your guns and God Bless.|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	you don't need to see her and she has no right to demand seeing your children or to take them somewhere that you asked her not to. she has no right whatsoever. they are your children and your husband needs to deal with the fact that his mother is disrespectful and should not force you to deal with her. just because she's his mother doesn't mean you should suffer. i don't care if she's family. she is wrong and needs to go away. you have every right to feel the way you want and to not put yourself in a place to be mistreated.  i dont think taking the kids to her with dh supervising is going to solve anything. she will manipulate him and you will be undermined once again. i suspect that she would love nothing more than to be the favorite of your dh and your kids. she needs to be restrained.|`|AA11496842	If someone told me that about my kids, there'd be no way I'd allow that person in my life.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I sympathise with you very much, but your DH would like peace between his women.     I think the solution you propose is good, that he takes the kids to visit her and supervises, and you don't go.     I wouldn't worry about how other people would consider me, in this situation. The fact is your MIL undermines you, and you are letting her know in no uncertain terms that you're not having this, and I think the only person who doesn't get it is your MIL. However, if you're not there once in a while, MIL will feel it's possible to undermine you behind your back.     God, what a cow. She reminds me of some relatives of mine, not my other half's!
fb7721ad747d2c6d87fb2b8481cf7ff7aa	They should of told you by now if they weren't coming  that would of been the polite thing to do ,Unless there hoping that the morning  might bring a change in the weather or they are taking  it for granted that automatically you  should know they are not coming due to the weather.

By all mean make stuff  that you can freeze just in case that its canceled and you can get them out again when needed. congratulations on the engagement.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	I think so.

If not it may have cleared up a bit by tomorrow night.    Don't worry and have a great party x|`|HEvSVMeVaa	If you think people will be able to make it to your party then go ahead and start some of the food. Congrats!|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I think it will be dependent upon the extremity of the weather. And also the distance they must travel. I tell you what, why don't you ring a few tonight and entice them slightly, reminding them whats on and also that it will be very warm! I do hope it goes well for you.|`|u23sua9daa	Yes i will be there.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Why don't you call and ask if they are still coming as you need to know for food etc.      You'll most probably find that they will attend, especially as it's going to be cloudy and it's an engagement party.      Good luck.
AuthyG9Qaa	Since this guy has made out with you for two nights in a row you can bet that he is planning to do MORE with you. ;-)     [= sex ]    In other words,  yes you are going to get attached to him BUT since he is "a manwhore" you will have to get used to sharing him.    have fun ;-)|`|EXisORX2aa	Nope this is normal. sorry :/|`|AA10771601	No, sometimes a kiss is more meaningful than sex.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	spare yourself the trouble and find another man start dating someone else!!!   can u imagine if you had slept with him the regret! the shame the missing what you never had.....bla|`|fFnsJ7maaa	Boy, do I feel old. I thought you became attached to someone THEN you kissed.
9ko5WUFkaa	Under normal circumstances I'd say no.  But this is different.  He's bonding with you - something he didn't get the chance to do with anyone when he was younger.  I'd probably not let the sleeping together of a weekend go on for much longer - he has to learn to be independent and he's also a teenage boy and may end up a bit confused about they type of love he feels for you.  It would be better if this situation is avoided.    Right now this is what he needs, and the hour in the morning is fine, but I wouldn't let it go on too long.  Encourage him to spend time with friends and be a normal 14 year old boy.  You're his parent now but that doesn't mean you have to be his best friend too.  He needs to form a healthy relationship with you and sleeping with him all night is not going to help that.  Over the course of a few months gradually ween him off it.  It's not the healthiest arrangement - for both of you.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	This is not healthy and I think you know it or you would not be asking on here. You have had no kids before I take it so dont really know what it is to be a mother - this is meant in the nicest possible way not to offend.  You are acting more like his bestfriend than his mother and you ARE his mother now and you should be setting down boundaries etc.,  Its difficult being a single parent especially with an adolescent teenager and a boy at that so you have to be strong and start being mum and not just his buddy.  Having chats toogther is fine, letting him make tea or coffee for you is fine too, you can do things together without crawling into bed for a cuddle, its wrong, you are giving him the wrong message here, if he were your own son would you allow that to happen.?  He needs guidance on what is right and what is wrong, he needs to feel secure but you can do this in other ways by giving him more responsibility and little jobs to do around the house. It will make him feel needed and thats when his insecurities will start to lessen.  You need to learn about parenting, have a word with social services  and tell them you dont want to come across as unloving but feel this is not conducive to his welfare emotionally or mentally and you dont want him to feel rejected. When will it stop ? he is a young man already.  Good luck and get him a puppy to sleep with.|`|DufCLIMsaa	Woah.  He is year 9 or year 10 and is very abnormal.  Don't let him because he will be dependent on you a lot and he need to be independent.  I'm from the school of thought that thinks it is not a good idea to ever bring your children into your bed with you..it is a hard habit to break once you've started doing so..you make it harder on your children to separate from you..it makes them more clingy, more frightened to be alone, and more needy. Your job is to provide loving comfort and guidance..they are not dolls to be cuddled and "played" with..they are little humans who are going to have to go out in the world and make their own way..being able to do that starts at a very early age..I don't think you should hobble them in any way from becoming independent, self-reliant and confident. :) You cuddle them and play with them when they are awake..when it's time for sleep they go to their own bed(crib)..it's also safer for them. :)|`|Nc8ePm5vaa	i think its fine and ok to be up watching vids together etc but i think he bit old to be  found curleed up huggin u in the morn....but thats just me...i wouldnt think a 14 yr old wud wanna do that anyway....id say we can still watch our dvds on weekends but its bed after and if u get up early it fine to wake  me but we go down stairs and chat over the breakfast table|`|AA11108018	You must be sure to set boundaries.  He is at the point in time of his life where he will be discovering his man hood and what girls and woman are all about. The most important thing to remember is that he is adopted.  There are many ways to bond without him sleeping with you   I am not trying to be a kill joy I just suggesting caution|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I think you really need to speak to a child psycologist about this.    He's a young man, many his age are no longer virgins and are sexually active. Sleeping holding tight to a woman who he actually doesn't know that well yet is not common behavoir.  There does need to be a line drawn.  He's NOT "just your kid", he's a young man.    There is nothing wrong with hugging, lying on a bed chatting, etc. But a 14 year old boy sleeping with his mother, I'm not sure that's a completely healthy thing.|`|ON84EQaBaa	Ok you said he's hard life... but at 14 he needs to stay in his own bed!  late night cuddling are you crazy! at that age nowday they are thinking about sex. (some of them) one day you might wake up a he's bout ready to stick you. don't put youself in that type of situation there's no way you could ever convince no one nothing is going on! Get him a dog or a teddy bear!|`|diAqosiIaa	i dont think that is healthy.....when you turn 15 you start to want to be more Independence and you start to show who you are or who you will become......with that being said i think you guys should go to a counselor and see ways to stop that from happening. let him know you will always be there but you dont need to be by his side ALL the time|`|MdXwD2JSaa	I'd schedule an appointment with a psychologist and see what they have to say.|`|UyITmoH7aa	I'm 14, and to me it usually wouldn't be normal for a 14 year old to be doing this. But I can see why he does this, because of his past. A person who received no affection during the earlier stages of childhood would naturally be like this, as they would not have been taught how to deal with this. Eventually though, you're going to have to stop this before it becomes unhealthy. Also, i would suggest keeping this a secret from the general public, especially his friends. You don't want to embarass him.|`|DyuWvcgjaa	i think its ok.   seems like he loves you a lot!  u should feel important!  maybe for the first time in his life he's truly happy and he's really feeling loved for the first time.  and i think it'll happen naturally that when he's older he won't be so attached. but till then...theres nothing wrong with cuddling is there?!  its so sweet really! Really Really!!|`|p8vFDYhBaa	You must be very careful & make sure he knows the boundaries , I would also keep it Quiet from your Social worker as they can make a Mountain out of a moil hill . I used to sleep in the same bed as my 2 toddlers as they would not sleep unless I was there with them , they were 1 & 2 yrs old at the time , the social workers made it out to be something disgusting , but at the age 14 I was fostered by a lovely couple & they allowed me to climb into there be for a chat I loved it & nothing ever came of that in fact I am still in contact with them at 47yrs old so all I can say is be careful& good luck|`|96af43a6ab3bf4045a9898acf5153bb9aa	His previous life experience has obviously had an effect on him and as you are probably the first person that actually treats him as something special - he does not want to let you go - You will have to slowly wean him off this behaviour but still ensure that he knows that you love him no matter what and that you are there for him - if you do not do this (over a period of time) you are both going to have issues - if you find a partner he will be utterly destroyed and jealous as he will believe that you are no longer loving him and at the same time he himself will not be looking for a life partner - I know it is still early to think of this but at 15 most boys are definitely noticing that girls are quite interesting - go easy on him but wean him off it - maybe get to the point that you can both have breakfast in bed on a Sunday (not sleep or snuggle up) you both get up and get the breakfast ready and then go back to the bed and eat it, talk about things and watch TV - eventually even this will also fall by the way - and that is healthy - my 17year old son - would never dare sneak into bed with me but he does snuggle up to me when we watch TV and he feels bad about something, any other time no way ;-) he has to be "cool" for his pals|`|S6Trp9xSaa	It sounds that he is just truly happy now! Given his history, I don't think it's weird at all!
QzRJ6f94aa	Well to begin with, you both shouldn't be talking about ex's,, there is a reason why they are "ex's".  He shouldnt ask questions if he cant handle the answer either. But: we all have made that mistake.   When you disclose info about a past relationship you need to use caution because your now partner might feel intimidated by your ex, and you dont want him to see ghosts where there aren't any.  We all say hurtful things to our loved ones, not necessarily we mean them, i guess is a way to voice frustration, dissapointment, hurt feelings. You both need to cool off right now, learn from this and move on. One of you have to be the bigger person, take a step forward and apologize for contributing to the argument. Dont let your ex's ruin your present relationship, dont give them that power.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Try talking to him instead of arguing or yelling. Clearly there is a lot you two don't talk about. Communication is key. Talk to him and talk this all out. If you both are still having issues then maybe you need some time apart.|`|faf9e51ca2493862319971e2688bd52aaa	Whenever my bf and I have an argument, we speak in a lower voice than when we just talk regularly.  It really helps not to yell.  Just go to him and speak from your heart.  Tell him that u love him and that you don't want to argue with him, u just want to be happy with him.  Honestly, just say it from your heart.  It's never good to bring up the past because the past is in the past.  The only thing that will fix this problem is if one of you steps forward and just speaks from the heart, and hopefully the other one will do so as well.  Speak logically and don't get angry.  It's possible to make relationships better by promising to respect each other enough that you will not want to hurt each other, and be conscious of not getting angry, etc.  Relationships aren't perfect, usually, but they can be made better by constant communication (the right kind of communication) and a genuine promise to respect each other and try to change for the better.  Good luck. :o)|`|og3Tmn0saa	Tell him you're sorry for the fight and don't want to be angry at him anymore. He's probably feeling the same way right now.  Also, reassure him about your ex being a non-issue.
Fc0ZR1hnaa	I would be upset also for the fact that he didn't tell me. I believe that is a normal feeling. To really trust someone things should be out in the open.    Note: the two other answers are from fellows.|`|oGzcWDNeaa	be upset when he cheats on you. you are thinking too much into things.|`|mfFh1OAgaa	well you got the truth and the truth hurts.    you wanted the truth. he could have lied and everything would have been jolly.    he isnt with his EX he is with you and you should concerntate on that.  he was worried about you reaction as he was talking with his EX!! and he probably likes her a bit as she left him. but he isnt with her. she is married and hes with you.        you should be happy he told you the truth and try not to be angry.  dont leave him.

8l52BsB1aa	You shouldn't stay with a chronically unhappy person; after a while you will find that his bad mood will rub off of you, and the stress of trying to keep both of you happy will end up being too much, and then you won't be experiencing a good, lighthearted romance anymore.  Don't dump him right away, but since it's definitely a breakup worthy issue, address it with him and talk to him about becoming more optimistic. If he doesn't get this, you should break up with him.    Question, does he complain about you? If he does, you should watch it cuz it could lead to a low self-esteem on your part.  Does he say you're his 'only good thing'? If he does, this could be a sign of codependency. It will get too hard to be his one good thing. Too much weight on one person's shoulders.  Even if you really want to help this guy, sometimes there really isn't much you CAN do.   People need to decide to change on their own.    Sorry about the length...|`|444c04688d431c3fed274c1aa7025fa2aa	So everything really isn't OK..is it...and you're really not happy... are you  sounds like your boyfriend has some depression issues that he must confront  and it's not your fault  one thing I've learned is that a person has to be happy/like/love themselves before they can share these feelings with someone else.|`|iI6V7dcgaa	My ex bf did the same thing like yours.     I tried to cheered him up and do the best I can to make him in a good mood. But as time goes bye, it tires me. He became depending on me to cheer him up all the time. It's like suddenly I got a new job as new clown in town and I must act happy every day, even when I'm sad.    And if I'm the one who was down at the moment, he was like, "Just get over it" or "Just leave it" and act like my problems are small and I just exaggerate it.    Soon, I got so sick and tired with his behaviour and dumped him.    My suggestion is, dont try to make him happy. U only waste ur time by doing it. Just be urself. And tell ur bf to control his emo while he's with u. Be firm about that.

oGzcWDNeaa	Im the opposite. i cherished the ground that my gf walked on and tried to do everything to make her happy. it didnt workout because she doesnt appreciate anything did.    anyways. there are guys that are romantic and want to have mature relationships but it seems like the guy you were with is just trying to say something to make you feel sad. dont go for it. you should go out and have fun with your friends and after a while try looking for the guy of your dreams. good luck!|`|XGM0uZFOaa	Hay, dont be sad. Guys generalise about us girls wanting BAD boys all the time. But most of us dont , even though a bad boy does seem appealing (sometimes) hehe. If you are not happy in a relationship, the best thing to do is get out- and to me you are out on the right reasons. But make sure what u do is what you want. If your BF loves you regardless of not giving you affection- he'll want you back but dont go on the same terms- speak to him about the way he makes you feel or doesn't. DONT GO BACK BECAUSE YOU SAD.. And yes you are sad, because us poor woman always put our whole heart in first before using our brain... A man can hold back as long as he desires. Yes and i do speak from experience...

This is so that in a pinch, they can have sex with them.|`|J8uhpecYaa	I'm straight and I have many female friends and love (platonic sense) all of them. There's nothing wrong with us.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Don't worry about what others think. Hang out with people that enjoy having you around. Are you offended by gay people? Why do you care what other people think of you?|`|8THbk2PCaa	There's nothing at all wrong with hanging out with girls. I tend to spend more time with the girls on my floor than with the guys. Anybody who calls you gay is likely jealous that you're spending time with girls and they're stuck with a bunch of dudes.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	I'm straight and I like being around women more than men. So what?|`|nkTEhBTyaa	if u hang with them as friends its sounds ok|`|AA10771601	at least its not a sausage fest. most guys would want more girl friends than guy friends.|`|PE7OS0f6aa	I LOVE to hang out with girls too!  ****.  Since I AM a straight guy I'D RATHER BE with the girls!  To hell with what the hater guys are saying ENJOY IT!|`|VERrlErvaa	I don't see the problem to be honest.  Girls dream of boys like you - ones that are great to talk to, have nice personalities and don't see them as pieces of meat.    I wouldn't say that you are gay just because you prefer to hang out with the girls.  The conversation will be more intellectual than with your male buddies and if the girls feel they can trust you - then they will ask your advice on things.    You haven't stated your age - but I don't think that matters.  Trust me, the other guys around are probably wanting to know your secret - that is: why all the girls hang with you; and what do you have that they don't...    Mate, trust me, you don't have anything to worry about, as long as you continue to respect the girls and treat them kindly, you have it made.  You will learn a lot more in life having friends that are female.  You will learn to understand what it is that girls do and don't like and you can later use that information to build a solid foundation for a relationship that may last you a life time.    Good on you!  Cheers mate.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	Maybe the girls are easier to be friends with than the guys.    Don't worry about your masculinity being compromised.  If the girls are comfortable with it and you are too there is absolutely nothing wrong.  Having a few guy friends wouldn't be a bad idea, though.  But don't do it just for image.|`|123z7Ww3aa	I used to hang out with more girls than boys at school. And now i'm abit confused with my sexuality. But today i'm maybe going to ask this girl out. Who i |`|7u8ZOWnqaa	let's go shopping!    seriously, there's so much pressure on people to be a certain way, usually the people who are very judgemental are just the ones that are afraid to be themselves and jealous. idk. i'd just do what you want, whatever is fun. don't worry about the rest, i'll back you up     if i were one of your girlfriends i'd just flirt with you around the boys at school so theyd just think you're cool for being around tons of girls lol. if anything it will be envy from guys who wish they could do what you're doing!|`|wE2etBzbaa	Simply, because girls make you move.. that's normal. most guys want to hang out with girls.      Just don't let them make you one of the girls, and you ll be fine as a straight guy.  not that it is wrong to be metro, it is up to you.  so feel free to wear skirt , stockings.  nothing wrong with that..  no seriously.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	you better get some guy friends fast or they will just start to leave you and may not accept you back.|`|7tzl0nuhaa	You get along better with girls, there is no shame in that and there is nothing to contemplate. If anything you are just a pimp....lol|`|Q0ZzFakfaa	We have plenty of guys like that at our school. Totally straight too. Actually the more "popular" you are the more "girlfriends" a guy seems to have.|`|w1p43HbCaa	So.. what is your question..?    Maybe you just get along with girls more.. unless you don't care about what others think about you. get some guy friends.|`|JbeQoMvTaa	This is fine.  Perfectly normal.  Some guys get on better with girls.  Some girls get on better with guys.  You don't have to hang out with the same sex.  It dosent matter what sexuality you are anyway.  This is normal.  Don't worry :\      Take caree.|`|1bfo3ujzaa	i dont think its gay to hang out with women lol i just need to hang around some guys sometime so i dont always have to watch what i say|`|qvftqMz7aa	Mate dw bout it im exactly the same, it could be your personality is more like a girls than a guys (not in a bad way!), also if i were you i would see it as a bonus because you are straight, you dont come off as being gay, AND you get to hang around with girls. its all goooood.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	I agree, you are straight and are griping about hanging out the gender you are supposed to be chasing anyway? Since you already hang out with them, it should make the chase that much shorter.|`|nvowgvtzaa	And the question is? I'm the same way, because some guys are just oblivious to the world and annoying as hell. But sooner or later, it's not going to be socially acceptable for you to hang out with lots of girls. If you're anywhere near your 20's, find some guy friends. If you're under 18, girls are great.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	this is a stupid *** ******* question.. what the **** think of a better question dumb ****...there is nothing wrong with you, what kind of guy wouldn't want to be surrounded by all girls..|`|O0wCjnfOaa	At my school we've got lots of guys like you and i reckon they're easier to get along with than the other guys who make fun of all the girls.|`|qJBB4Whpaa	i was pretty much the same way til i hit freshman year at highschool and all the girls turned into drama bitches.     dont worry about it.     girls are more fun anyways.     it just means you have a lower testosterone level probably.     guys are annoying as ****.  so keep it that way.     girls are hot and when you hangout you can fool around .     which is so much more fun than hanging out with a bunch of dudes and playing Madden on your playstation.|`|dAGrmSFvaa	I think its normal for guys to hand out with girls.     Hell I wish most of my guy friends didn't see me as a potential gf when they started talking to me. I would of been glad if some would have just wanted to talk as friends.    There is nothing wrong. In fact, I think that the opposite gender has advise that interests the other. It's a different perspective when you speak with others, so why not take the views of a female friend?|`|5zjwOSe9aa	Totally depends on how you are perceived by them(the girls)    If you hang out with them alot(not always), and they all centre around you then yeah, you're like a pimp.    But if you're just there, and they do thier own girl talk, and your just there to fill in the gap..then man....what the hell are you doing??  This means you're becoming part of the "girl" crowd, and they no longer look at you like they would when the group of guys walk by.    If you don't get it,..  Then think about a girl hanging out with a group of guys. At first she is checked out, and hounded by all guys, if she hasn't hooked up with anyone in that crowd, and noone is after her to keep her around, then what the hell is she doing right?   Guys won't look at her that way anymore, if they did it would've happened long ago.    So if you're number 1..good job man.  if youre number 2...  hang out with guys.|`|Z8WGDv5paa	I think your fine. And you don't have to be gay to talk a certain way or dress a certain way.  If you know you are straight then you shouldn't worry. But, yes people tend to categorize people. It's human nature. But, if your not gay screw what others say especially if you are in high school. When you get to college or even the real world people will not analyze as closely. Do what make you happy and listen to your instincts. You know what you are, it doesn't matter what they say.|`|WT44175Taa	so  i dont really see what the problem is  i seem to have more guy friends than girl friends  and my lady friends dont seem to mind at all  if you guy friends are really bothered by that  then i think they have issues  this is a free country anyways|`|yvXTIR50aa	as long as you still like girls... what ever people say, i'm sure you're not a gay.....
lFcwzrDFaa	teach him with your silence but make sure he knows your ignoring him though|`|tXlvg1ahaa	The break up really caused him some hurt he cannot get over.  Calling you names might be a consolation to him.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	He probabaly still has some bad feelings towards you.|`|tLBcDE6naa	some guys call women that word cause they know it hurt them. not right. but don't fall as low as he is. you are a better person.|`|KBtDdsNAaa	don't do anything, he's looking for that kind of response, you gotta show this dumba$$ your better than that|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	I'm not really following the question, why did he call you a whore? was it because you said you don't think of him anymore?|`|zka26204aa	He is just hurting.  You know how people say things they don't mean when they are angry or hurting.  Just text him back and tell him that you do not appreciate him disrespecting you like that, and if he is going to act like that, don't bother ever calling or speaking to you again.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You didn't give us any hints of what kind of relationship you had and why you broke up so answering you will be a tad difficult.    That being the case, you need to know you will never teach him a lesson on how to respect girls if he really thinks of you as a whore with good reason. He will never learn from someone he doesn't respect.
6GNqMJB4aa	I think that you are the one that is going to be stuck doing the cleaning and organizing of the place. Some people are just slobs and have no shame in being that way.  If you think that you are showing her by cleaning and thinking that she will eventually feel bad, then you are going to have a long wait. She knows that you will clean and she does not mind living with filth around, so it is a lose, lose situation on your end.  As the great Wanda Sykes once told it to women, "If you don't wash the dishes or clean in order to teach your man a lesson, he will just use a napkin for a plate and eat with his hands".  I think that's how the joke went. But anyway, you get the point.|`|zLsA6IAPaa	damn that must suck ay      umm, if this has been going for ages, then maybe you will have be a little harsh.    you could always try doing the cleaning together and then maybe she'll start to get the picture or say 'its your turn to do the dishes' or whatever.    sometimes it helps them get the picture if when you're having a normal conversation with her just be like, 'hey whats ur absolute pet peeve?' and be friendly, then say that your's is having things dirty all the time and drill it into her without letting on that ur asking her to clean up her mess...maybe she'll get the picture        good luck xx|`|AA10192697	Make a chores list and post in on the frig or bathroom.  Tell her that things needs to be cleaner and you two should split the responsibilities.  Instead of plates, can you guy eat off paper plates, or just her?    You might have to get mean.  Like put the trash bag on her bed with a note on it "please take me out".  Put a cute note on the bathroom mirror saying "please keep me clean".  Or you might have to just get mean. Maybe she didn't clean at home and won't on her own. Or maybe she had to clean all the time at home and doesn't want to anymore.  Either way, she is grown up and has responsibilties.  Can any of your friends talk to her for you?    Good luck girl!! I feel for you!!!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	kick her out if it's your place. move out if it's hers.|`|H8w3zQUyaa	Ok here is what you got to do. ....You need to NOT pick up after them. But yet....let them clean it up them self. If they complain about how dirty the house is. Well you tell them....."Well I clean up my side , now you have to clean up yours!"    You can also do this.... Make a chart. Put the days of when she can take out the trash, and the days she cleans the living room or whatever. Have her do thos charts. If she dose not do it. Then don't bother!...Just leave it.     Soon she will start to hate coming home to a really dirty house. There will be bugs, and clothes all over. Plus if she wants to invite friends, she will feel real shame, because the way she lives.     She going to start to hate it. .......Then she will have to make a choice. Eather clean it up or move out.     Try that and see if that works. ............Or if you don't wanna do that. Then do this....    It's fast and simple but yet try it.......... Say... "You eather clean up this mess or you can leave the house. See if that works.     If she does not do anything, with in a week. Then tell her. Im sorry but this is not working out. .......Now beat it.    I hope this helps! =]|`|T6WplPeBaa	Just talk to her, don't yell even if she yells she might get defensive. If she doesn't listen...    Find a new roommate :||`|jyRRMQO3aa	tape a picture of a pig on the door....          she'll get the hint...w/out it being mean : )
domEftoIaa	you need to ask her before you assume anything.
D2g0XSLTaa	This would bother the *&^% out of me.     I wouldn't want to hear it anymore.  I feel the same way.  You keep saying it over and over and over and over and over and over and over,  I don't even want to answer your call or read your text.     He seems very immature and for some reason he feels he has to continually tell you this.  He is also very insecure.  He probably counts all the times he tells you and you don't say it back.   UghHHHHHHHHH.   I couldn't take it.  I'd break up with him before I went nutso.     Just the way he reacted when you told him the truth - he is acting like a little baby.  DUMP HIM.|`|JyvCXRHPaa	Well, if you like to hear it at only special moments then why dont you just tell him what you just said in you post. If you love him, make sure that you explain to him that you really DO love him. leave no doubt in his mind. and AFTER he gets the point THEN tell him that while you do love him you are the type of person who doesnt want the word to lose its meaning or become redundant. tell him that even if he doesnt say it 4 times a day, you still know that he loves you. and tell him sometimes an ACTION expresses love without the words "i love you" being required. Just tell him that just because you guys dont have to say the words multiple times a day doesnt mean you love each other any less. anw, it all depends on the people. some people say it all the time, but at certain times it is more meanigful than others. some ppl like to hear it all the time. it just depends.
pLxi604Paa	Maybe letting him know before or during the snowboarding trip isn't the best time to let him know how you feel.  Maybe you should wait so there is no awkwardness around any of you.  Just enjoy yourself on the trip.  Try not to pay him too much attention especially because he's with a girl.  And you know what?  He knows theres something there, trust me he knows.  So if you go on the trip acting like your all good with the situation and youre not fazed by it, he will notice it, and he might be the one to make the move.  Why would you, as a women put yourself in that position to be labeled as a homewrecker.  Let hm make the move.  =D  im jus letting you know, from a doodes perspective.  and trust me mama, i can consider myself a female expert.  i know how it works.  Hope it helps.  Good luck and have fu on hat trip.    oh and whatever you do, dont feel like you have to make him jealous by bringin a guy on the trip.  Talk about making it obvious lol|`|aaBWUx7Iaa	you should not let him feel that ur soo much interested in him but make sure u show a bit to catch his attention like look at him pass smile be friendly try to stay near him but don't giv him a clue wht ur trying to do
oKuCNVMTaa	It sounds to me like he has built up in his mind what his life would be like from his first time to his old age, he probably saw that he would meet this great woman, give himself to her (possibly give herself to him too) and they would live their lives happily forever, then he finds out you already have a child and realizes it does not fit into his preconceived perfect life.  He will realize that what he had "planned" was not entirely realistic and what matters is the love.  There is also the possibility that he didn't want kids or had a bad childhood and thinks he wont be a good father.  If he does have some mental problems then you will need to carefully discuss the issues and work through them together.  Just ask yourself first, do you truly love him and can see your futures together? if not then maybe its just best to let things go, but if you do love him then fight to work things out|`|jR8yQdlVaa	that's a Classic deal breaker , the not telling him about the kid and all.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	"I have a kid" is a major bomb to be dropped on a guy, especially one that is young and doesn't have a lot of relationship experience.  The thought of possibly having to become more involved with a child like that is a scary thought for men.      If I were dating someone who had a child, I'd certainly be weary simply because I know I'm not ready for that kind of commitment at this stage of my life.  It may come across as immaturity, but it's probably for the best as he's not ready for that kind of relationship.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I don't think you explained enough about "your situation" with your kid.  Is there some reason that you hid this fact from this guy?  You didn't think much was going to come of dating, but you slept with him.  So you just thought this was casual sex.  Let's pretend this happens...You meet someone and fall head over heels with each other.  Things are great.  Ooops, you never told him about your child.  If I was the guy, I would dump you immediately.  Not because you have a child, but because YOU LIED TO ME.    If you lie to me about something as important as this, what else will you lie to me about.  You are not a person I want to get involved with.    My son is the most important person in my life.  He comes first.  Any guy that I go out with knows this from day 1.    I think there is a lot more to your situation than what you are saying.    Don't blame this guy or put him down.  Why couldn't you just be honest with this guy.|`|ryh5AslRaa	You needed to tell him in the beginning not all people want kids, expecially if maybe he wanted to get serious in the beginning.|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	well the mental problem thing explains why he's prolly a virgin at that age. and idk, u had sex w/ him popped his cherry and then told him about kids? i guess that could be harsh for him. he needs to be a man about the situation and stop freaking out though, its not gonna change. basically he's freaking out with you because u didn't fit into his perfect picture of how this would play out for him. harsh...just leave that guy alone for a week and see if he comes to his senses. sometimes thats the best thing you can do is just leave people alone.|`|AGmZNf7zaa	I agree with tatiana... you should tell people you have a kid at the beginning just in case they don't want kids or want to have their own with you.  However if he loves you enough to give up his virginity, then he will calm down and get over it because he loves you.
xeeQ9QkLaa	if she can't accept that your past is real and you are unable to move on then you should not worry about having much of a relationship with her. it could be that you need to sever entirely anyway in order to heal from all of it. if you feel like you can't do that, then try to find a way to move on from the painful memories and know that she is not someone that you can share them with. it can;t be easy to know that you had a horrible childhood and hers was better and that you are not allowed to acknowledge it. but seriously, she sounds selfish. why shouldn't she be able to hear you and support you now after that fact? i don't think you need to worry about her too much. move on with your life and away from selfish people that won't hurt you.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Since you acknowledge that your sister was too young to remember much of what transpired when your life was being turned upside down, there really is little reason to share that with your sister.  Agree to disagree and get beyond it - with her.  It sounds like you're still stinging from the memories.  Do find someone that  you can talk with though.  Friends are great for sharing horror stories about growing up.      It may always hurt that the one person that you intimately shared this experience with doesn't remember it or remember it the same way, but you do have to forgive the difference in perception of a small child vs. a much older one.  Enjoy one another for the people that you are today.  Try to stay in the present with her.    The only one that these memories really mean anything to is you, and how the experiences and memories affect(ed) you.  That you have grown beyond the damage that was done to you is a genuine tribute to your ability to survive.  Brava!  Keep up the good work and look forward.|`|j6pqXCh9aa	If she doesn't want to believe you then that's on her, but its the only way that you can heal and grow and to move on with your life. Please continue to heal and to grow if you need to tell the world that this happened then do so. If its off limits to her then you have a decision to make.  What's more important your healing or her inability to try and understand what you went through? Think about it. Good Luck to you.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	She has been brain-washed, and no amount of talking by you will cause a change in her view. I'd suggest just getting on with your life.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	If you have moved on and it doesn't affect you any longer than I would think of it as just a past experience that you got over. If she honestly doesn't remember any of it, there's no reason to drag her through it even if you think it will help you. If you want to talk about your past with her just try bringing up the good times you remember. You don't have to shove in her face all the messed up stuff her mom did to you. Let it go and just imbrace your sister as you sister, not a reminder of a screwed up childhood.
wyAtVqbOaa	Either a deposit which is non-refundable or the full payment.      If you put down a deposit they will not do any alterations until you have paid and you have to pay the full amount within so many months of the wedding - some places are different but I paid for mine there and then as I had the money and didn't want to be surprised with another bill so near to the wedding.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	I out half down and paid the other half when it came  in.|`|AA11082914	I ordered mine, along with veil, headpiece, and jewelry, a few weeks ago at David's. Since all my items were special order, I had to pay for all of it up front. If you go to David's, apply for one of their credit cards. If you put it on that, it will take care of the up front payment, but they're running 12 months no interest right now, so that gives you a year to pay it off.(Watch this, though- if you get to the year and still owe only $20 on it, they will still slap you with all the interest you should have paid through the year. Make sure that if you do this, you can have it paid off in the 12 months!)|`|LLhmWi2daa	I'm going next Wednesday to David's Bridal. I've been to one consultation already but I never thought to ask that. I'm going to pay right away for the dress but alterations are extra so I'm asking a friend to do my alterations for me.

QkIfyLdgaa	Well bro first of all people that don't have to work for anything they get usually fail when they are faced with that. Second if you guys dated a lot in between then there's defiantly a chance. Just be upfront with her on the subject and hope for the best. Good luck bro|`|qHjaABxxaa	look. looks and material things might seem important now.  but in heaven you'll have everything you've ever wanted.  and of course you're good enuf for her.  bring her to church. get her saved:)|`|e0urnErUaa	waittttt were you really going out with her cuz u loved her or cuz shes rich????? .
5uFXCBpraa	Work out how much time you want to spend together, and what you want to do.  And when you're not spending time together, do something you enjoy, separately.  It looks like video games are not for you, so try gardening or scrap booking.|`|1bfo3ujzaa	have kids so he can play multiplayer|`|blfxu48Maa	You can join in! Play with him, or work out a compromise.

Good luck!|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	nothing you can do if he's not ready. it's just like any other addiction. u can have an intervention but gaming addiction isnt really understood and accepted too well.. it's not alcohol addiction... you could try taking all his games and consoles away but would he just go buy it again? could you offer him something else to do? does he get angry when u ask to stop playing?     good luck|`|gwsC32WJaa	join him or leave him that is the question|`|ETVr1PdRaa	Oh my god... mine (younger than yours, by quite a bit) is too. Honestly, just smash the damn thing.    That or hold out on sex.|`|sVrkjixAaa	Let him play. If he does it way too often, ask him to do something with you that you like every now and then.
qBkJAlQ1aa	hmmmnn.. trick is for your BF to tell his mom he is old enough and that he can decide and be responsible for his own actions, which should be respected by everyone. That he already has a family of his own and that you (his family) should be allowed to raise the family the way you see it fit and your decisions regrding the welfare of your child should be respected too.   However, much as you wanted to be given freedom with your decisions, reassure her that you are not taking away her rights as a mother and as a grandmother, but as she has rights over her son during the growing years, you too have rights over your own son, and the responsibility to raise him the best way you see it fit. Tell her that too much of anything, even if it'ss good at the start, may turn bad eventually. So too much meddling, too much caring, over-protection is not going to do good on anyone. But the absence of these and the likes is not too good as well. Best is to settle with moderation, She should not meddle too much but you should ask her for advices so she'll be re-assured that she still has a significant role in the life of her love ones.    Good Luck..Have a happy relationship with your in-laws...|`|c5anDswjaa	Easy answer.. Get your butts a house of your own! Other than that, I dont think you can stop her from being like that|`|M5oMYc9Laa	As long as you are living in her home there will have to be some tolerance on your part until you and your bf can afford to move out.  That is the only solution. Until then you are going to have to eat the bulls... with a knife and fork.|`|nsVbWXKraa	UR MOTHER IN LAW IS NOT MARRIED TO U IS SHE?

To resolve this - you need to move out (both of you). Also, you can't tell her to mind her own business in her own house. So again - you want it to stop - move out..|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	well the first thing id do is sit her down and tell her that you appreciate all her advice. but hes your child and you have your own way of doing things. let her know anytime you have a question you wont hesitate to ask. with the sweets thing try to make a deal with her about when and how much. with  her bossing your boyfriend i dont want to sound harsh but thats his fault(my husband was the same way with his step mom when we stayed with them for a month). he just needs to stand up to her once or twice and im sure she'll back off. i hope this helps a little bit and good luck.-- i know how u feel!   p.s. get out of there asap!|`|yAYnWHO8aa	The only answer is to move out. Its her house and she is going to say anything she wants and she has that right.|`|dTPuctm7aa	you got to look @ it like this,do you have anywhere else to go first of all.cause if you say the wrong thing to her she might try to put you out and i would hate it for you cause your bf would still have somewhere to go.have your bf talked to her?if not tell him that it bothers you that his mom won't stay out ya'll bis. and you don't want cause no confusion between ya'll,but when you tell her that your son can't have candy then that's what you mean.I'm kind of in the same boat you're in but i live my mom and my bf stay with grandparents and they act like he can't use the phone after a certain time 6:30 is the lastest i can call,he has to sneak the phone.then @ home i have to put with my mom telling me how to raise my kids.and with his mom she can't keep our kids cause she has migraines if they get too loud.i pray you get out that house and into your own so you can raise the the family you want.Or at lease try.GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!

Not saying it's right, they are being immature if they're only messing with you because you're a chick, but I can't say I'm surprised.    Athletes have an obvious tendency to be competitive with people, and thus if their ego is not kept in check will ridicule anything that they deem inferior to themselves, at least when it comes to their sport. This is even more true when dealing with a sport like wrestling, which has long been completely dominated by men (if you were on a soccer team or something, this would probably be much less of an issue). However, the bottom line here is that your teammates are being sexist and obnoxious, and should learn to knock it off.     How do you get them to do this? Well, talking is always an option, but if that doesn't work, then just win. Your point on the scoreboard will say more than any self-righteous speech could. Hopefully you can manage to get some teammates that will respect you, and no, not ALL guys are jerks, though I'll admit a lot of them are. :P
IWRKbpVGaa	Drop her.  Don't bother.  Don't try to talk to her during class or otherwise.  You have to have other friends, talk to them.  IGNORE HER.  Being ignored hurts.|`|u23sua9daa	Yes i would do the same thing.|`|KZEp26vBaa	yes i would do the same

oGzcWDNeaa	yeah you are still young and this happens even when you are older than 16. if the sparks arent flying like before maybe you guys have to think things over. i mean you guys cant love eachother and both be unhappy with whats going on.    if you guys spend more time apart the sparks might fly again when you guys are together, thats if you guys spend every dying second with eachother. good luck!|`|og3Tmn0saa	You probably haven't. Not because you're 16, but because this is your first long relationship and you don't realize ALL relationships end up that way.  Go find some activities to do with each other! It's hard because your parents probably exert total control over your life, but try to spice things up a bit eh?|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Start going commando.

It is a bond between people, and the most important thing to humans is to feel a bond.  Teenagers are at an age that they often feel misunderstood, so it is important to have someone that understands you.  Someone that loves you like only a friend can.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Because they can';t be friends with their parents as they think we are idiots and know nothing of what they are suffering. Probably correct.|`|VVZF3QD5aa	Freindship isnt just important to teenagers.  Its important to everyone.    I find it important to have freindship.  Its someone to share everything with .  When you get your first period or a first bra.    Its someone to be with , someone who you can tell everything to .|`|ACXoLn2daa	It is part of growing into adulthood. it helps to create self identity and self esteem. It also gives a sense of belonging, to a peer group..also it can be a good emotional release to confide in someone they feel they can identify with and trust.|`|Nco7uM0gaa	There is an old saying" No man is an island",which means that everyone needs someone.Friends are someone who you can share your problems with.Humans are by nature social animals with a deep rooted need for companionship.This holds true for adults as well as teenagers.It is important to not have only one best friend,but to treat all your friends the same.Last May I traveled all the way from my home in Spain to the U.S. for a reunion with some of my friends whom I served with in Vietnam,and that I had not seen in 45 years,and I am not ashamed to admit that we all cried.The bond was still there,and we love each other like brothers after all these years.We had always shared our sorrow and joys,and still do to this day.We cried for our fallen friends that never made it home.I don't expect you to understand this now,but as you get older you will realize the importance of true friendship.Sorry this is so long but it is a serious question that deserves my best attempt to answer it.|`|1gFxxJsBaa	it is not only important when u are a teenager it is important trought out your life....|`|bmwTSnBfaa	http://urbanext.illinois.edu/familyworks...    http://fatherhood.about.com/od/dadsandte...

Relationships are needed at every age for us to grow and develop.  However, during the teen years, there is an urgency to be accepted, to find peers who appreciate you for who you are and to feel connected outside of the family.  Friendship is a reflection of oneself; we gravitate to people whom we admire and then take on those traits ourselves as we mature.  Or the opposite - sometimes we mature right out of a relationship, especially as a teenager.  We grow up and realize that true friendship is so much deeper than the fickle relationships we yearn for in high school.|`|lrJQxohVaa	because friends are there through all the support.|`|yIBYbC98aa	its not only important to teenagers its important to people of all ages. Its someone you can rely on and you know they will support you should you ever need it. They wont judge you or say i told you so.
oGoWz511aa	If you owe someone money, especially if you don't have a record of making regular payments, them calling, repeatedly, to get you to pay, is not considered harassment.  Neither is threatening to keep whatever they are holding as collateral.  My advice is that you talk to her about a doable repayment plan.  Then, get it in writing, pay as agreed, and never borrow money from her, or anyone else, again.    Although others have advised you to not admit to a loan, I strongly suggest you not do that.  Simply denying the loan is the first tactic of just about everyone who ends up in court.  All she'd need is a bank statement showing that money was withdrawn from her account, and to tell them that she has something of yours that she's holding as collateral.  If you end up in court, and try to deny the loan, just it makes you look like you're trying to get out of paying.  Not exactly a good way to get the courts on your side.      Just pay the woman.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	if there is no "paperwork" to support her "claim" it won't stand up in court,unless you say "yes she loand us X ammount of $"|`|oxmkllnWaa	go take your property back|`|rQfzifT7aa	She will have to take you to small claims court to get the money she owes. But there is not contracts, how can she prove that she loaned him the money. Unless you admit to it.    She has a right to charge interest but again with no contract there again, she has nothing to stand on unless you admit to it.    My best advise would be to contact an attorney.  And yes in most states you can file charges for telephone harassment if you know who is harassing you.      All you have to do is fill out a report, take it to the judge or magistrate and swear to it. Sign it. And usually within a week to 10 days that person has been arrested.    It will be your word against hers but you swore to it in front of a judge/magistrate.    This may not be the same in your state so check the laws.. Contact your local law enforcement. But they may tell you to contact an attorney but it is worth a try|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Pay her only the amount you owe her and in the future, never borrow money from her again. If you can pay her in full, do it as soon as possible. No, without a contract or proof that she lent you the money, she can't do anything. If she continues to harass you tell her to quit or she will get nothing at all!|`|AA11496842	If you borrowed the money, it's only right that you pay it back. Loans do come with interest.|`|7a51fc18f5c6477f0af393f7851e59bfaa	monster in laws tend to do things just to piss us woman off.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Since there isn't anything in writing, she can't even prove you guys took out a loan.  However, you are paying back what you can.    It's against the law for her to sell property that isn't hers.    You may need to hash this out in small claims court, that is if the amount is under $5 K.|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	I hope that you both learned your lessons from borrowing money from anyone...I am sure you were both at a difficult position thay led you to the loan but I would choose to borrow froma company vs. family. The other news is that she can charge a an interest and you have to look that information up..If the agreement was to repay your mother-in-law "on demand," (she tells you to pay her back), then that is when the statute of limitations begins to run.    I would give something to her to show that you have intentions in paying her because you both don't want to cause any more flame to the fire is there are any at this point..between the relationship.    Make a smart and sound judgement on the right way to handle this situation...|`|V6BWAWoyaa	She is full of ****.  You have no contracts.  She is just scared you won't pay her.  She can try to take you to small claims court buy she won't win anything.  Sounds like you gave her collateral??  She could sell it if the item isn't in your husband's name whatever it may be.  I would have your husband sit down and put a stop to her harrassment.  If she doesn't stop harrassing you tell her you are going to start recording her.  Get an answering machine and don't answer when she calls.  There will be your proof.  Tell her you are going to call the cops if she doesn't stop harrassing you or take legal action.  Best I can think of.|`|4YjsxXnjaa	Hai .   Do not worry ask her to sell that property your husband owns. Do not pay her any ransom. Just leave it.       LIve lion a day than to be a sheep all your life|`|uoEfoI7aaa	If nothing is in writing all she can legally claim is the amount loaned...  without interest!, if she is holding something of your husbands, and you never agreed to pay a storage fee, she can not legally charge you for it.  She could sell the item if you refuse to pick it up.  But if she refuses to release the item, you could sue her.  Harrassment is illeagl, regardless of the situation, next time she calls tell her that you are recording the conversation, and not to call again.

9Oxu5CIoaa	If its someone you don't know and want to go up to them, anything simple works. "How are you doing?", "How's it going?", or just introduce yourself or talk about the weather.

You are large-hearted and sincere, though a trifle blunt. You are somewhat proud and people who ponder to your vanity become your best friends. It is unlikely that you will amass great wealth but money is only useful for the happiness it can bring and of happiness you will have your full shape and more. Regarding money, you have peculiar views. At times you deny yourself legitimate necessaries and at others, you spend somewhat recklessly. You will always give in response to the call of charity. On some occasions, you put yourself to considerable trouble in order to save a few rupees on the price of an article you desire to purchase. You have several excellent qualities. You are highly sympathetic, which makes you a good friend. You are loyal and patriotic and are thus a first class citizen. You are, or would be a most lovable parent. You are, or would be, everything that your partner could desire. Clearly, the good qualities of yours far outweigh the others. more info please contact to me shanoomathur@yahoo.co.in|`|GLQL2IEaaa	what are you even tryna ask?|`|zRmwEFAwaa	Well, spending time with friends is a apart of life.

yptfd3sIaa	So it IS decided that you are moving across the country to live with your boyfriend's parents** and attend school where he is, correct? If so, then what you need to do is go about your plans: sell unwanted things on craigslist, pack your things, plan a good-bye gathering and leave. You: stay calm. This is an a very normal transition and one your parents will need to accept. They might accept it more easily if you are very matter-of-fact with them. IOW - don't play into their drama, or be hurt by their indifference. They will deal with this in their own ways. And it will all be OK. Someday you'll be 30 and they'll be shoving your youngest sibling out the door. They won't remember this. Trust me.    (**I know you said 4 years with this guy, but he lives across the country? How does that work? Also, what's your backup plan? No relationship is 100% safe against a break-up. What happens IF that happens? Would your parents have the resources to help you live in a dorm? Would you have to drop school, get a job and roommates? Just remember that being an adult does not simply mean that you're old enough to leave the house. It really means that you're mature enough to plan for the worst and protect yourself from disaster.)|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	its very understandable the feeling your parents are going through. you just have to sit down with them and tell them your growing up now and need to experience the world for what it is. let them know youll probably make mistakes b/c everyone does. but they just need to have faith in you and trust you. hope this helps a little. good luck!!!|`|UXuSI6EZaa	parents worry about the worst that could happen to you while you're away from them. there is no reassurance that will satisfy their concerns over your safety, so the best you can do is give them something to look forward to on your home visits. they'll eventually get used to it.    good luck|`|oVIrSxZnaa	You need to sit down with them- just you and them.  I would suggest a public place like have dinner at a restaurant.  This will help them be more aware of not making a big scene and perhaps listening to you.  Tell them how you want to move and experience life, college, and relationship.  They also need to realize with two other children- the odds of one child moving away is highly possible.    I can speak from experience, do this while you're young and make the most of it because one day when your a parent you'll see what your parents went through.
0Z4tqTIMaa	yes!   but girls always want someone who is funny.... smart....... cute............ who cares about me.................... did i mention funny.   most girls find guys that do all of the above because their body wants a male who can be dominant. regardless of what their mind wants.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	no doubt man. i spent all of high school being nice. never got laid.    but after high school, i knew this was a dog-eat-dog world, so i became aggressive, and well..... i've slept with over 30 women in just 3 years|`|4vv1ElyJaa	What... most men cheat drink have attitudes and are abusers!??!      ....ahhh!|`|zhs5Cy5vaa	I guess it'd be hard. : /   I don't think most guys cheat and drink, but it's hard to find a guy you would want to spend your whole life with.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	I'm one of them and im yet to be found :(|`|dNhgIMIPaa	I went through quite a few scum bags (party boys, players) and I did find Mr. Right.

PlEEZTRsaa	You are most definitely not a weirdo,you are who you are,and he sees that,.You do need to make sure that you and him have a good time together out alone as well.You sound very mature,and i for one live near Los Angeles myself so i know what you're saying about trust.Just be you,he loved you in the beginning that way so there is nothing "weird" about you in his eyes...or mine for that matter.|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	You're problem is this: He is too big of a part of your life. Having a boyfriend is great, but don't make him the ENTIRE focus of your life. Do other things. Focus on school, try to make friends, take up new hobbies, do things you've always wanted to do.

Your relationship is healthy, 7 months? that's a long time. well done.   -Next point, yes i think you should get a hobby or start spending more time with your friends or family. There is nothing more attractive to a guy then indepentancy in a girl. No guy wants a girl to be clinging on him like a little lost puppy. You should show him that your life is great. And that you know how to keep your self occupied.   -I hope I helped (=
LZs75Ksiaa	Remember, we all stumble, every one of us.  That's why it's a comfort to go hand in hand.  ~Emily Kimbrough    A relationship is a 2 way street, If you care for him and He cares for you there is no reason you cant work it out. Every Problem has a solution no matter how bad or uneventful it is. I dont think he cheated on you, He seems to genuinely care for you even through all the insults. Men sometimes just need a break, he most likely found comfort/solace in someone else since your relationship was getting rocky. If he wouldve cared for the other girl then dont you think he wouldve ran to her and told her the same things he told you. Yea she might be far away but then again he couldve tried making it work. To me it seems that throughout the break he realized what he had and missed it. Yea, It might come with its problems but then again it prob made him happy.      But lets say he did cheat, are you willing to give him another chance? some people deserve 2nd chances(well thats my own personal belief). In the end if he did then it'll be up to you to decide whether you love him enough to give him another chance, whether you think hes the "one", or whether its even worth it? People do make mistakes, its just human nature but its up to one self to look past it and see whether you can forgive or not. But then again you might never find out. Are you confident enough in yourself that you'll trust him completely because if youre not going to then there is no point in the relationship to continue.    What I would recommend is for you to genuinely talk with him without you making accusations, questioning him or him getting mad. Just Sit down and lay down all your cards. The good and the Bad, tell Him his cons and his pros and tell him to do the same. If you cant appreciate the truth from each other then its not meant to be but if you are able to overlook it and learn from it then it shows that you guys are in it for the long haul. To me he acts like a prick as in the sense of tough love, to see if you're willing to stick around. dont get me wrong, thats no excuse yo but maybe he feels like he has no choice but to see what your reaction would be.|`|mXIVMmPSaa	The mature thing to do would be to get out of this relationship and walk away. Obviously it has disintegrated on several levels and there really isn't any point anymore. He doesn't want to be in it. You can't trust him and that will continue to hang over you--- it doesn't matter if he actually cheated or not. The point is that the trust is gone. (And based on his note, it sounds like he definitely had a close connection with this other girl) Move on and enjoy being a single gal in college. And try not to be so jealous with the next guy.     From your post, it doesn't sound like you really love him anymore but are just hanging on for old time's sake, and likewise he doesn't seem very respectful of you. I actually agree with your family that he seems a little manipulative because he is blaming you for everything he does wrong and guilt tripping you, then gets you to agree with him and blame yourself "He always puts the blame on me... He says I drained him... makes me feel awful... gets really really mean... I think I contributed... I pushed him to cheat" HELLO! Guilt trip! It's not your fault if he cheated, that was entirely his decision. He needs to take responsibility for his actions and since he's not, that's a big red flag. Instead, he is trying to twist it around and act like you're at fault. Why are you with him? You are both miserable! Learn to recognize when things are better left to bittersweet memories of the past and MOVE ON!|`|zdpp7cubaa	The best thing to do in this situation is move on. Obviously, he is a very manipulative and abusive person. He places the blame on you about everything, things that you have nothing to do with. Also, in healthy relationships it's never about whose fault is it, it's more about how can we fix this.    You did not push him to cheat. Which I am not sure if he did or not, but he did seem to have quite an intimate relationship with the girl which wasn't right seeing as how he and you were together. But even if he did you do not "push" someone to cheat. Don't ever let someone place the blame of their mistakes on you.    At the beginning, you sounded like me, that's pretty much how my relationship with my fiance started. I was going through a rough time in my life when he and I first started dating and I tried to push him away several times, I was angry with him over nothing most days (I was angry with the world), and I did doubt his love for a while.    The difference between him and your boyfriend is this: where your boyfriend became impatient, frustrated, and mean, my fiance was patient, loving, and kind. I remember on one occasion early on where I was being particularly ridiculous and he sat down and explained to me who every girl in his phone was and anyone I asked him not to talk to any longer, he did not speak with that person any longer.    My point is if he had cared about you it wouldn't matter how much you pushed him, how much you doubted his love, or how jealous you got, he would have stayed by your side and went out of his way to relieve all of your doubts. This relationship just simply wasn't meant to be, that's not a bad thing because he sounds like he has his own issues to deal with.|`|EekQdHoHaa	I don't think you can ever have a healthy relationship with someone you don't trust. Plain and simple. It sounds like you never really trusted him from the beginning. Maybe you had reason, maybe not.  I don't know if he cheated or not but you can't live your life always wondering that. It's not healthy for you or for him.
Uhv0AUfBaa	If they beg you, it instantly means that they are anxious to know and spread it to everyone. I only trust my true friends, when I say true, it means friends that are always there for you no matter what.    When I say where they beg you, it goes like this " Oh c'mon, please, I promise I won't tell anyone" All that is a lie. Do not trust them.|`|IWRKbpVGaa	Don't tell her any secrets anymore.  If she is the only one you told then it was likely her who told.  If I was sure it was her, I would drop her.|`|Nco7uM0gaa	Once revealed/disclosed it is no longer a secret.It is human nature to repeat what is told in confidence.While I was in the military and later while working for the Govt.I had a secret clearance,and even though I am now retired there are things I cannot even tell my family.Most people are quite sincere when they say" I won't tell a soul "but human nature kicks in and it is just like telling Rush Limbaugh.The best kept secret is the one not told.Sounds like your friend is prone to gossip.Now you know to not tell her anything you don't want repeated.You can always deny what you told her.When it comes to secrets you cannot trust anyone.|`|CaKu7gbAaa	By this incident you should assume that your friend is a liar, liars only do back-biting and break promises. you should not trust your friend who gives you trouble and embarrassment in front of your friends.|`|hAFxcxP0aa	OMG Janina who was it?

OQF1HlwRaa	You should first reevaluate why you kissed his friend.  I'm not going to lie, if i kissed one of my ex's best friends after we had broken up and had been so close, I'd honestly be trying to feel like i'm closer to him.  Can't have him but can have the people close to him?  does that make sense.    I do not believe your really like his friend. I believe that you should give your friend time to breath. Maybe a week or two//[i knw it would/will be hard] and just tell him you need to talk and explain why you did what you did.    maybe you 2 could end up getting back together.  if you both want that  because that's how it sounds to me...  that sounds like the path you're taking...|`|AuthyG9Qaa	That guy is soooooo IMMATURE.  write him a note or text him maybe|`|GLQL2IEaaa	tell him like you told us. it meant nothing. it was a mistake and you don't want to loose the friendship you have with him.
zHwSyDNfaa	just come out with it|`|6X1hJeZYaa	Just say "I love you" It won't make him feel weird or anything. Just say it and he will say it back..|`|ZldKA17Iaa	just say i love you there is no right or wrong time|`|78iBfguoaa	if u both have never said it before the first time is a biggie. this is what i did with my husband. I was so scared to tell him, we had never said it. so we were out one day and he made me laugh, as he often did, and while I was laughing, i said, "oh I love you" just like that. he looked at me and said "seriously, you love me?" and when i said yes, he said he loved me too and that was the end of that. so, try something like this and see how it goes, you don't want to make a big deal of it if you are not sure of his feelings. Best of luck to you|`|ia2kz4qyaa	by talking about hearts|`|IQq0wNqQaa	I brought it up by saying it in a way that made it less awkward.     Examples:    "You know I love you to death"  "Wow, I love you so much"    Say those things for a few days, and then just come straight out with it. After those few days, he will be used to hearing you say the word "love" when referring to him, and it won't come as much of a shock or be awkward.

zRmwEFAwaa	Ok, I think that maybe you could buy a door lock for your room. Like you know how front doors, you have to enter them by unlocking it with a key, do that with your room, and lock it, so she can't come into your room. Keep the spares with you too, so she doesn't go looking for them. And about the stealing too, for now, get a video camera, and hide it somewhere in your room, and leave it on, and catch her in the act, and tell your mother, and all, but overall, just telly our mum you know she's stealing in your room.    Good luck.|`|2tLswGNuaa	YOu have a messed up sister, tell your parents and if you have to videotape her in the act and show them to prove it lawl.    tell her to move out or hope you get to move in a dorm. (financial aid)|`|qaazUSHOaa	She doesn't sound very bright, so one thing you could try is psychological tricks. Either look things up online of come up with your own. Whether you can or not, tell her that you can tell things about her by how she acts and other small everyday activities. Ask her to draw a capital Q on her forehead(a real psych. test), or pick one of three colored objects. I do things like this to my family all the time, and most of them are real.    Or perhaps you could scare the sh @ out of her and get it on video; that seems to be mildly to fairly humbling for people.|`|zadtCE1paa	lock ur door/ **** her up|`|AzdAvDW1aa	I no how u feel my sis is a pain!

So my advice get over it and u no what if yr getting blamed 4 things u should do the thinds yr getting blamed 4. Also u should get back at yr sis u no go in her room steel her stuff, u no get even.|`|VYWh9iyjaa	she sucks! what pain in the a$$, it sounds so frustrating to read it would have to be even worse for real. I don't know how you haven't run away or something. (not that I'm saying run away) but boy that's crap. You're the youngest she should be out doing something with herself instead of sponging off everyone, what a no Hope-r.    Wish I know what you should do but you are kinda stuck for the moment it seems. can you move in with a friends family or an aunt uncle boyfriend???     I don't understand why your mum get angry with you is she scared of your sister? she sounds like someone who doesn't mind hurting people, considering what she's done to you in the past as a small child.    Just remember you won't always be 17 and one day you'll be out looking after you self and then you can choose not to see these people again (or your sister at least).     as for your stuff and your sister stealing it, maybe you could get something to lock expensive stuff away like a lock on a draw or cupboard or even your door. Good luck luvi. ;)|`|7bh2Zqrzaa	Get a safe, hide it in a place where no one can find it in your room if thats possible and put all your valuables in it. Tell your sister you know its her stealing your stuff and ask her why?? If she starts getting physicial say something like Ill ask you later or woops gonna be late and leave.             Do some snooping when shes not home but make sure to put everything back once youve looked and eventually try to find out how much shes in debt for so you have a rough idea of how much she needs to steal. (It might not be such a great idea but its a suggestion.)           See if your college has dorms and tell your parents you want to try and experience living away from home without being fully on your own yet.          As some other people said set up a little video camera in the most conveinient spot in your room and make sure where ever you set up the camera put ALL of your valueables where the camera can see them.          Get a job and try and work as often as possible, so you dont have to be home as much, so you hardly have to see your sister. A resturant would be the best because you have to work in long shifts.    Lastly Stand up for what YOU believe in even if you do get in trouble venting your anger helps, ask your mum why she always backs your sister up even if its your stuff going missing and ask her to just PLEASE keep a bit more of an eye on your sister. (Say that when your sister isnt around obviously)    Hope this helps thats all I can think of for now.    Good Luck :)|`|n53HeORBaa	look for a job at the moment and always lock your door and if she gets angry that you are locking your door then tell her that it's your room and you would do anything you want to do with it and if she threatens you fight back don't allow her to boss you around anymore, make her realize that you are no longer that weakling little sis and that you are ready to stand up for your own|`|qBkJAlQ1aa	first, i suggest you secure your things. change the lock of your room perhaps. Next, i suggest you assert yourself, not necessarily going physical against your sister, but if you think she did you wrong, go tell her you don't like it. Be calm and cool though when you do that. no threats, talk in a firm and serious tone. I also suggest you be prepared because she might harm you if you accost here. Best is to train in aikido, that way you can parry or avoid her thrust. If you have the skill, you can make her off-balance and defenseless if she turn physical against you without you turning physical against her. But despite all of this, when you have proven to her that you deserve respect, especially with your things, show that you also and still, love and respect her.     Sometimes, that's all that people like her wanted...love and respect and reassurance...if lacking...that's when they turn bad...    just my to cents worth..good luck...|`|EsnFmcMFaa	put a lock on your door  tell you sister not to F with you    then get a job  so you can make some money  and since you are going to college why dont you try to live on campus|`|9csiuqDaaa	I think you should look for a job. You should also get a new door knob with a key so you could lock it when you're not in your room. Maybe one like the ones that front and back doors in houses use.|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	well first thing is you need to sit down and talk to her and your parents. then you need to get a lock for your door then get a job and work on getting your own place. if it consists and all else fails you could call the police on her. its very drastic but that's 1 way to teach her. and from the way shes done you in the past i wouldn't feel much remorse for her. i hope one of these suggestions help you. and good luck!!!!|`|ANKJdJgxaa	Wow, your sister seems like a real winner. Look, bottom line, you gotta stand up to her.  Your not 8 years old any more, and it seems like you have a better head on your shoulder than she does.  So demand your respect. But also remember, no matter how much of a troll she is, she is still your sister, family.  I use to say about my own sister that I Loved her, but I didn't like her.  My sister had similar traits to yours.  But we manage to coexist until one of us finally moved away.   So hold your ground bro, and stay cool.  Your the better person, and you'll be on your own soon anyway.  But be warned, there might come a day when you'll need each other, so don't sever the kinship completely.  Good Luck|`|xLPNpHLRaa	a job is a good start|`|GLQL2IEaaa	buy a lock for your door and simply try and avoid her. i'd stay in the room as much as i could unless i really needed to get out.     and also, look for a job. so you can get away from her.    don't forget to BUY A LOCK!|`|7mGN5xU1aa	hey  college in a week.  if ur moving out then just be patient  haha

He needs to protect himself from that and yes, you need to help him do that. Whether he likes it or not.     If this gets out of hand hes going to suffer a great deal. Knowing you are able to deflect their nastiness will be a great help to him. They are afraid of you for some reason.  I suspect its because you are smarter than them, and that you are onto them, and not willing to take the crap. Make them go through you before they get to him. Its a wise move.

But if neither of these are possibilities, I say *your spouse* should deal with it. But I mean REALLY deal with it. These aren't your parents. He needs to straighten this mess out on his own, calmly and without your assistance. But if he really, really can't - keep the door closed and the new phone numbers a secret.

I also found out that he is still married to the woman that he cheated on with my mother and I am 32.  I thought about being decietful but quickly changed my mind.  Good  luck with your journey.
jTiHXmpOaa	sounds about right.  women can be manipulative to any extent.  she probably has a master scheme too.      at this point, i'd say your man needs to be sensitive to how you feel and step up to the plate.      chances are he may be giving her the wrong signals (or worse).  for guys, its flattering as all hell and we can't say no to the attention, because it rarely ever happens.  so admit to yourself that it may be flattering to him.  maybe even admit it to him that it might be flattering to him, but he needs to know that by doing nothing he is condoning her behavior and breaking your heart.      if he cares about you, he will step up and tell her to back off.  you can't make him, and you don't necessarily want to force him (it can push guys away and validate the other "suitor"), but you want to try to make him feel exactly what the scenario would be if the shoe was on the other foot.  you want him to feel how it hurts.  because he doesn't seem to be focusing on that and if he loves you he needs to do that.    you have to finesse the integrity out of men sometimes to get them to do the right thing, cuz we love to do nothing.|`|qHjaABxxaa	ask her nicely.  call the cops.  thats harrassment.  ask the family not to talk to her.|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	if she cant take it the nice way.. you give her the HARD way!  dont talk nicely to her... melt her face away!  tell her off! tell her that its not gonna work with her and your bf. its OVER! he dosent want her he's moved on and she should fuckk off and ''get the fuckk away from my boyfriend or i'll leave treadmarks on your face.. ****!!''  >:]
SupWrLRIaa	Blow---job. Srsly. Only thing better would be if there was more than one of her . . .    EDIT:Apparently sucking someone off is now a ********************* word.

MqPUWdXhaa	You know you have a crush if you want to see them naked.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	a crush would be you liking them and NOT going out with them|`|g2KhN4rzaa	Lmao, um no, a crush, is when u like someone, and are not with them, but would like to be.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	You have a attracting with that certain person.|`|GJdPuagzaa	I like this question! "Crush" is something nobody really tries to define. So, I would say a crush is when you feel chemistry and strong attraction for someone, but you don't really know them. You either have not yet, or have no intention to ever, cross into a relationship.  It can also be the feeling of liking someone and wanting them, with the butterflies in your stomach, but you haven't gone out with them and had a chance to relax and see them as a whole person yet.   I would say by the 3rd date you are past having a crush on someone. You know them and like them by that point.|`|N9ygGImkaa	If you have "a crush" on someone that would mean you really like them (probably on the same level as people may say they love someone [people use the term love too openly now]) but it's generally one way (they may have one on you to so I leave this slightly open). The person who is being crushed on may not even know the person who has the crush on them, as well the person with the crush on another may not really know anything about that person either.  Overall it's probably why guys will ask a girl out seemingly for no reason. A crush is based primarily on a first impression, more likely than not (for most) off of looks.  If you're going out, you've probably passed this stage.|`|4rtNX1XOaa	its like when you LIKE someone , but you guys ARE NOT going out.

Damn My girl did that for me 2 years ago . DAAAAAAMN AWSOME|`|u5yzxdPWaa	I have the exact same problem! I've narrowed it down to some funky little gadget at http://www.tesora.com.au/ (he's a hot nerd) or a money clip (he's in to finance). As a joke I'm also getting fluffy handcuffs and a blindfold  ;)      What is your guy in to? Have you noticed he's getting interested in something, or has always been in to something but never had the time to try it out? Has he commented that this little thing needs to be replaced or he needs that but he never seems to get it? Is there some band/TV show/movie he's in to but doesn't own? There's also heaps of sites that have very male orientated presents - read boys n their toys - even if you don't want to order online, they're still a great way to get ideas.    Pay attention to him. Listen to what he's talking about and consciously think about ways you can turn that in to a present.|`|R9apVnbWaa	make him something
UBm9hKWuaa	so heres what u do  first  start a conversation with the grl  say something like  hey, whats up?  or (only works on mondays)  whatd u do this weekend?    then she'll say something  then u try to build up off of it like  ex. oh, i went to the movies and saw unborn    u say  oh, really? heard that movie was really dumb    then keep talkin  and like in the middle of the conv say something like oh, i like your hair, it looks nice today    then few more sentences, then say that you have to go and ask her for her phone number before u leave  (oh, and ask 1 of her teachers for her name)|`|2TiwAfPvaa	you think i have a big weenie?  then you whip out your 9 inch monster...    well it works for me :D|`|2Dmd1f8Laa	well, shes new, so she doesnt know alot of people.. be cool just say hi, ask where she moved from .. n just kinda let the convo flow.... be nice n dont be too flirty
c2YcBbXyaa	they'll notice it and most likely laugh at you...i'm from oklahoma and have the stupidest accent... i hate it..even people who live here mention it sometimes...really pisses me off|`|zWqKuIQuaa	They will notice it but will probably find it charming.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Yeah they'll definitely hear it. I moved to TN when I was 10 from NY and I couldnt understand one word anyone was saying lol. I live in Brooklyn now and I always pick up on people with country accents. But its cool though, you can meet a lotta people by having a different accent.|`|oT2MEcZIaa	well, i guess they will:)   i love accents:)
vn2Lq7hIaa	You would make a wonderful Hooters chic. Really! You're Hot. If for some stupid reason they say no, I'd gladly have you for my personal Hooter chic. ( Did I say That?) Just Joking!!

Good Luck     God Bless|`|m0PVHJIvaa	nah you should be good. if you have a little bit of a stomach, you could wear spanx or something to suck it in cuz those shirts are really tight.

AA11156037	What... Again    Marriage is Outdated?  No it is not.  It just doesn't mesh for YOU.    Please leave your brother, sister and Chihuahua alone!|`|hs793CCxaa	Government needs to define and recognize or not recognize things for legal reasons. You are saying let everyone do what they want? What? Go and eat something......|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Marriage is still recognized as a sacred institution by most people. It's also a legal agreement, hence its recognition by the state. Do you really think man and dog marriage is good for our society? How about brother/sister? Can you imagine the f'ed up offspring?   As far as your insinuation that people get married to get cheap benefits- The great majority of people exploiting benefits from the government are unmarried mothers, not people who get married for that reason.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Firstly, when you marry someone, you do not get benefits, in fact your incomes are combined and in turn you pay more taxes, you do not get tax breaks unless according to the government earn under a certain amount a year, and typically you must have kids to qualify for any of these perks.    Marriage is recognized by the government, you have to get a licence and a certificate in order for it to be valid.    For those in same sex relationships, I agree that they should be allowed to wed anywhere they want in the world, I can see some religions (churches) who oppose, and let them, but if a church or an official shares the same values, then who's business is it if two women or men chose to marry    Now where you get ridiculous, siblings?dogs? that's just bizarre and I presume you have a really warped perception and definition for marriage, my suggestion is to do a little reading up on what exactly a marriage is, if people could marry objects their pets or even their siblings, and call it what they want, it would all be just a shame, now however they have things called a commitment ceremony, some people who that over calling it a marriage|`|CPvv9vWxaa	they should update those marriage vows: "...till divorce do us part". They should include some space for a prenup too in every marriage ceremony .
xq6dnRuhaa	This depends on who answers, everyone is different. I am sure you don't like the same as all the girls either because you are you.    So:  " do u guys prefer brunettes/blondes/red heads?? "  Hair color is not a big deal, and if she takes care of her hair any color looks pretty.    " bigger gurls/skinny/ or medium curved. "    As long as she is not fat (as in CLEARLY overweight not as in a couple of extra pounds ok) is fine for me, so average is good for me, even thin, but no stick thin please I don't like women that are too skinny either.    " big boobs or small.. "    Completely flat chested is a turn-off, but I don't need 2 mellons to be happy or to like her .... I guess I go with a good medium size here, I mean certainly not very small but not huge either. If they can cover my hands that's great :p and I have small hands so really this is not hard at all...    " long or short hair.. "  Definitely long hair, I like long hair in women far more than short hair. That doesn't mean I don't find women with short hair attractive, but yes long hair looks prettier.    " and do guys like loud girls..or girls who r shy,   or gurls who r kinda shy but also say wat they want and dont care too much.. "  I know I am an exception for this one. Nice shy quiet girls who look pretty and innocent TURN ME ON!!! Although I gotta say that I don't like quiet girls who are mute when I talk to them, that makes me feel like they are not interested at all.... so in short I don't care if she is shy, that is not a turn-off for me at all; but that's me, I know not everyone thinks this way.    " do u like skanky girls or classy"  Classy all the way, I don't like women that are obnoxious, loud, uneducated, or with an attitude.    " and do u like when girls make the first moves on talking to u first..  and asking for ur number, and like hanging out first?? "    well, if I like the girl I would be shocked and love it at the same time, shocked because no one has ever done that, I am the one that has to do it, women don't seem to do this EVER, and of course I would like it if I like her too    " and do u like it when girls text u first..or no.. "    why not? if I like her I would absolutely love that ..... watch out though, if I like her but not in that way I would probably dislike it if it is too much texting, so just make sure you are doing this with someone who seems to like you back|`|WU4MHq3aaa	brunettes or blonds  medium-skinny  medium...  longer... but not waist...    kinda shy... not loud...  no comment    classy  yeah.... shows they like ME ... so i don't end up in an awkwward situation    hangin out...    yeah      well answers have been given    also athletic...|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Some do, some don't,  some will and some won't.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Have you ever heard of " She is my TYPE"....|`|EsnFmcMFaa	brunettes  medium curved  medium boobs  long hair    girls who are kinda shy but say what they want  classy girls  yeah i would like it if a girl made the first move    i dont text|`|EKM9AKc2aa	brunettes  medium curved  medium  medium  shy  classy|`|vks73GiAaa	i like girls tht are out going and not loud LOUD it gets annoying also i dont mind the hair color or breast or anything i mean she cant be really big and has to take care of her hygiene also laid back and liekes sports cause im a top baseball picther at my school:) hope i helped|`|QkIfyLdgaa	It always depends on the guy.

CInHTKJcaa	roflmfao  that's hilarious  good luck with your life...... (what's up with the lady avatar?)    p.s. if you are a male, isn't it obvious that parents will have some sorta concern on what your character is?|`|AA10192697	Tell your parents and let them deal with the dad. You shouldn't confront him yourself.  HAve you talked to your friend.  Maybe he hates anyone that's in his house.  SOme people are like that.  Good luck!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	From your photo you look Hispanic or Asian. are you? What race is your friend's father? This guy just seems like a jerk. Just don't go over to their house anymore and tell your friend.|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	He's racist! I mean, there's a chance he may not be, but my dads friend did this to me all the time, and he turned out to be racist.|`|PlEEZTRsaa	No,i think you are thinking too much.|`|jbE1nWqzaa	I think he is trying to be over protective to his kids.He will cool down in sometime.|`|J36Rc5DKaa	how old r u? wat race r u?|`|dffe0637ce0d1fb4a653af444962ca54aa	Maybe he's racist, maybe he's just a jerk?  I've had some friends who had huge jerks for fathers.  They were the same race as me but they, too gave me the "evil eye" and were very rude to me.  He's a jerk either way.  Tell your parents about how he treats you, maybe they'll give him a good talking to.|`|zLsA6IAPaa	damn he sounds like a bit of a prick ay :S    well i spose u could say hi to him every time u go over to your friends house. you should tell ur parents as well and see what they have to say. compliment the dad to if u feel up to it, that should make him feel guilty for being an asshole to nice girl    also ask your friend if her dad likes you|`|UMNzw81haa	You need to see how he is with ur friends other friends to judge that I guess. By the sounds of it he does sound racist. I had white friend who's mother was always mean to me n my friend confirmed that her mum was racist. Dont worry about it too much tho, its just life.|`|T9TXFyqbaa	Lots of people are really really racist thesedays... it's pretty disgusting. Almost everybody I talk to has a go at asian people in some way or another. For example, if a group of asian exchange students were walking slowly infront of someone there's probably an 80% chance they will make a comment about it, however if it was a group of Australians there would be no comment made...  I was born in Australia and my dad is English (mum is Australian) and I find any racism stupid and wrong. Nobody can choose what race they are born into.    Anyway, aside from my racism rant, it depends what race you are and what race he is... ask your friend if he's like that to all their friends/guests or if he makes racist comments about you while you're not there.
qveeTggpaa	he really does feel the same too. so don't fret anymore. your friend already testified(see there's proof!). if you want to get closer to him, then you should do the first move. go back to how you treat eachother as if you forgot the brief moment of ignorance(like for example, you said you don't talk much anymore). talk to him about your daily life again and treat him as a close friend..if nothing more..just like how girls are nice to their loyal friends, only the exception is that he's a guy. for the record, you're lucky..he might actually feel the same thing.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	how will you know if he has the same feelings if you haven't asked him???|`|2fHX3Ss2aa	Diaries are the stupidest things ever. Whats the point! -unless u actually want somebody to read it!
IWRKbpVGaa	You never forget your first love.  No love will ever be quite the same as the first love.  So get over trying to forget her, and get on with trying to form a life with that happy memory from the past.      If you think you can find her, know enough about her, etc, try looking and seeing if she has a myspace or something.  It's always great to contact old friends again.    You can form a life without her, just know she will always have a place in your heart, and you have to deal with it.|`|zKJAS2UNaa	You should forget her and move on, shes a heartbreaker man. Im sorry you had to go through all that.|`|y3gDqFobaa	you still have a cruch wow i was fat now im thin ha they should been nice|`|0WskQuVvaa	Test her out on Valentines Day, Send her your song and tell her your true feelings just be up front man because she sounds amazing to me but if the Valentines Day thing doesnt work than thats it forget it but if you just constantly obsess over her all your life you'll never be successful and achieve anyone else.|`|XBTF1XvZaa	move on with life and forget about her but if you think you can' nt so if there i sany way you think you can let her no pls try and do so.|`|JaOddaodaa	ARE A HOLLYWOOD HERO, WHO FALLS IN LOVE FROM PRIMARY....................

SL4eEoCNaa	Why confront her.  Your husband is the one you should be confronting.|`|GbwLZ28maa	Ok you gotta confront her with  your husband.  Together with your husband.  I cannot repeat that enough.      You have to be in agreement with your husband and he has to stop contacting her.  He then has to tell her that he is now with you willingly and wants to work on the marriage because he loves you and only you.      And then both of you confront her and tell her she really has to get lost.  Say whatever you want, but please remember DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL.  When you lose your cool, you lose your self-respect.  Ok?  I know taht because I was there once and I regret it to this day.  So please handle yourself well and ladylike and be a picture of calm even though inwardly you are raging.        Hold hands with your husband when you talk to her to give her the impression that the bond between you two are much stronger than with her.    Other than that, good luck.  I really wish you that.  *hugs*       Remember, do not lose your temper!|`|EENUWAP7aa	Yes, there is...you turn the other cheek.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Since it's "his" friend, he needs to be the one to confront her and tell her to get out of his life.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	OMG now you want to confront her... you confronting her at this stage of the game is giving her the trophy that she is winning..... is that what you plan to achieve....  Instead of confronting the her I would confront his family.... and stand up to them.... they made a choice to like her better then you... they made the choice not to attend your wedding....   IT's time you tell them where to go and how to get there... that a sons old piece of *** is more important then their own flesh and blood.....|`|rQfzifT7aa	So, she is texting him now.      That would suggest that your husband is not committed to working on the relationship.    I understand your bitterness towards her. She knew he was married but what about your husband. He is to blame too. He knew how you felt about her and what all this has caused. Yet he deliberately talked to her knowing it would hurt you.    If your husband is not willing to stop talking to her then I don't see the point in confronting her but if he does not want to talk to her. He needs to change his number and let her know he does not want her in his life.    I agree you should stand up for yourself, but stand up for yourself in the right place with your husband. Tell him to stop talking to him or pack his bags.|`|ON84EQaBaa	The other woman is not the problem, your husband is, its up to him to let her know she's causing  conflict between the to of you and they need to stop playing games, as far as his family goes you didn't marry them & what they eat don't make you S %@. Don't worry about them they really don't matter! Sometimes it's a good thing they feel like that, they'll stay out of your house. Tell him to go visit them, bet they miss him just as much as he miss them!|`|viIAJ4TZaa	almost in the same boat as you. i confronted the other woman and i told her i am not done with her! and then confronted my husband for separation!|`|AA11156037	Actually, you need to confront his family and your husband.    1. She is just a witch and not worth your time.  2. He needs to get his head out of his posterior and look at you the one who has been there. Tell him, no more texting, talking or anything else with this bimbo!  3. HOW dare the family NOT adjust to you after 13 years!    I'm with WONDERMOM on this!|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	I doubt saying anything to her will make a difference. I cannot believe your husband has such an ignorant family that they would take the side of a whore who brags about one night stands. I would sue this woman for emotional distress that she has caused you and your husband.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	What ever you do Do Not Confront her. It will only make her feel important. She will tell you things it is better you do not know.  Your problem is with you and your husband ,nobody else. I think your marriage is not worth saving, but that is your decision. But keep her out of it.|`|dFlc9DVsaa	Deal with your husband. If he loves and respects you no matter how close the other woman tries to get into your relationship, he will reconsider your feelings.    Stand firm and fight for your rights...He should back off from seeing her because he is committed to you in marriage.    She is absolutely an intruder...     But you know... I befriended the former gf of my husband who keeps on sending signals for many years now... but I make her feel I'm very much present and she can't stand in front of our relationship.  She has to meddle with her own married life. I also made it clear to my husband that he has no obligation whatsoever to that woman... she's not a priority and if  their friendship would be at stake... he has nothing to lose if he completely loosen up their attachment.
uoEfoI7aaa	wow...you have gone over to the deep end!, phone calls alone don't prove anything...now if he had other symptoms like staying out late, making excuses to leave in the evening, being places other than where he said he would be, then maybe you would have a case...but phone calls alone don't mean anything.  Give him the benefit of the doubt, at least until something else happens.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	I understand that you could be paranoid because of this, but he could easily be telling the truth. I've had a female co-worker that I've called just for work. A lot of work is done through phone calls. Your husband actually sounds like he's telling the truth. At any rate, this is not enough to prove that he cheated on you. You should probably apologize and work on your trust issues, or try to get some better proof. This isn't enough.|`|5k7BexD3aa	I would think before you walk away from your marriage and the father of your child, that you would NEED more evidence than phone calls to leave.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you sound kind of psycho. you say you can't stay with someone who cheated on you but you then say you don't even know if he did.  if i were him, i would leave you.|`|AA11993638	In your mind he has already cheated even if what he told you was the truth. I know when I worked for a large company I would talk to several men on my cell phone because I used it for work, this in no way meant I was sleeping with any of them. You sound extremely insecure about not only your relationship but yourself. Why would he tell you he speaks to a girl about work situations if this is how he probably knew you would react. You may believe that once a cheater, always a cheater, the fact here though is that is not always the case, plus you have nothing that proves he actually cheated. You merely assume he did. Since you cannot not fathom that what both parties have told you could be the truth, even if he did not cheat your relationship is doomed. This is something to really be proud of.|`|paHjJrrdaa	To me it sounds like he did cheat and your gut feeling is usually right.  But no the phone calls alone is not enough proof. It actually could have been about work.  I say find a friend that he doesn't know that well and have that person spy on him.  I know it's pretty lame, but you need proof!  I know I would want to know for sure!  Have your spy take photos to that way you have something for court if it comes down to it.  Ever watch Cheaters? Better to know then to be left hung dry!|`|rQfzifT7aa	You are obsessed and you have nothing to be obsessed about. It was a co worker for crying out loud. Just because she is female you are jumping up and down acting all crazy.     You are so jealous that you can't stand it. You are living a miserable life and are only making your own life more miserable.    From what you are telling, I seriously doubt he cheated on you. He would be to afraid of what you would do. I mean you called a co worker of his over some phone calls.  She could have had you arrested for harassment.    How can you live with yourself  constantly wondering what he is doing? That is no way to live for you and it is unhealthy for you and your son.     I cannot imagine sitting and wondering what my husband is doing. I can't live like that.   Please stop making yourself miserable. He is not thinking about it and you are hurting no one but yourself being this way.    Unless you have some hard evidence, you are just letting your mind get away from you|`|rH33ty23aa	The phone calls are not enough, but if he did in fact cheat there will be other signs. Watch things with a closer eye and you will know when something is up. Always trust your gut, if your first reaction is that he is cheating he most likely is.|`|jdJBuKrUaa	the phone calls are not enough. if you know a detective then have him and her  take a lie detector test. call one of those court shows on tv. or call jerry springer.roflmfao|`|QdnH6oyMaa	i think you have already convinced yourself that he is guilty
UMNzw81haa	No rules, just the unwritten rule which is dont fall for any of them.|`|YPRb7s0Aaa	Honestly I think that that is your decision, How do you feel about having sex with them... As for me I dont think I would do it out of morals. RULES you could follow are your basics I guess, use pertection, no calls afterward to avoid ackward moments...lol, and live in the moment for fun if thats what you enjoy...|`|zLsA6IAPaa	if its his girlfriend and shes ok with it, then they're shouldnt be any rules, just be careful that she doesnt get jealous|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	none|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	There are no rules.|`|DIEih5asaa	The friend stays outside.|`|EPki0rwgaa	There has to be rules for who gets to join.     Allowed to join: Girl and me.  Not allowed: Friend.|`|zka26204aa	I would not engage myself in that type of activity.  I have too much respect for myself, than to share my body with with anyone other than a person that I love.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	**** Off Loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... What???|`|lMbYgBtQaa	None!!!|`|P9HPKKxzaa	sex is just sex. nothing more.|`|dffe0637ce0d1fb4a653af444962ca54aa	No cameras, and always use protection!|`|EgeId6TKaa	YOU shouldn't have any rules. You're the object in this relationship. The two of them may have certain rules, but you don't have to abide by any. Just don't get clingy. It's weird.
Bi51WJd7aa	Uhm, yeah?! .. Why would he need to ever go on a dating website? Unless maybe he's being a good friend or something and trying to find someone for his buddy?!?! ... Me thinks not.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	You didn't say WHY you haven't trusted him for awhile. Did he actually do something to hurt your trust, or are you paranoid? If he's done nothing wrong, and you simply don't trust him, I wouldn't blame him for being on a dating site.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Most (not all) men sign up for things like this as an ego boost.  Usually it's innocent flirtation and they never meet anyone.  But I would keep my eyes and ears open just in case.  I would definitely ask him about it and tell him that I didn't like it at all.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	so, your husbands on a dating website and you want to know if some thing's going on?  oh no, of course not. everything's fine. he's just doing research.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	it's time to sign up and see wht's up with hubby.|`|paHjJrrdaa	That's terrible. What an a$$! I would be soooooo mad!|`|ltUzwXZEaa	Yes I would but I would just ask him what was going on and if there was something that I could do to stop him from going on that site.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	I would make up a profile of my own on that same site with a picture and let him find it, LOL!|`|Y8zivPXBaa	yes, i would be very suspicious. guys are really terrible in hiding their tracks. i would really be observant of him & whatever he is doing on that website.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Sure would and I would suggest you to keep it quiet and download a spy to his computer.Then you will have your proff.|`|AA11391968	It's odd that he would leave that open for you to see.  Perhaps he is just trying to aggravate you.  Or, he is unhappy about your current sex life together and it's his way of telling you.|`|4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	I wouldn't think yoo much about it. My husband I think is a member of these websites ...yet,he just wants to know if he still got it...lol...how funny to me..
qBkJAlQ1aa	Hey, cheer up. Ugly ducklings become pretty swans. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Have a good heart and you'll be beautiful to me. What's inside counts best...|`|FwJLD1uDaa	im sure you are pretty, dont worry. :)     everyone is beautiful in their own way.|`|KB6JsOVtaa	i dont get your question.|`|89d5ff1143ba4933930c3f9d4514c142aa	Just because you do not look like your sister does not mean your ugly hun, you are beautiful, beauty comes from within, don't get your self upset over it and if you feel you cant cope talking to someone who is not in your family may help go and see your gp he will be able to arrange this for you, but don't forget everyone is beautiful in their own way.
VYWh9iyjaa	how sad I have an 8 yo I could no imagine how I would feel it this happened to me. I would be a mess. All i can say is give it time and be there for your mum and brother be there for each other and hopefully he'll be ok. if he does get better maybe then you will sleep.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I don't know if you're religious or not but I would pray. If you're not, then I will say a prayer for you and your family tonight.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're dreaming this because your mind is still processing what happened, and you know how close it was ....     As you're falling asleep, remember that he's alright. And it's possible to control what you dream, when you start feeling stressed in your dream, remember that he's hospital and recovering well.     Sometimes our reaction to the event is more stressful than the event itself.|`|YNdcFlulaa	Im sorry.  just tell yourself that he will be fine|`|M5oMYc9Laa	First of all I am so sorry that you had to experience such a trauma and that your brother got injured just be glad he is on the mend.   It sounds like now you could be experiencing post traumatic stress as a result of this incident and that you could use some counseling.  Speak to your parents about getting you some stress counseling.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Yes, if you are a religious person, I would suggest prayer.      From the article, it looks like there are a lot of lessons to learn from this situation and maybe some causes to help bring public awareness to.      It would probably help you to start focusing on positive things & maybe lessons to be learned from this situation.  Your brother is alive!   I bet you cherish having him much more now that you almost lost him.    Ok, my suggestions would be to start trying to think of as many lessons as possible, that you have learned from this.    See if there is some way that you can help prevent this type of thing from happening to another child.    And, thank God everyday for the life of those you love.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Sorry and all you need is to pray for him,he will be ok trust God,if you have  a bibble be reading before you sleep and pray ask God to give you good dreams this works ,and you will be just fine,|`|89d5ff1143ba4933930c3f9d4514c142aa	Im so sorry hun this must have been a terrible shock to you, you need counselling Hun, your gp will be able to sort this for you, I hope your brother makes a speedy recovery and do go and speak to someone about this it will make you feel better and you may be able to sleep too. good luck and god bless your family. xx
klSZoy87aa	Doesn't bother me.    :|`|zQQd2wPRaa	eh..i need a picture!!|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Not that I am into guys, but he sounds like a cute feller.          No homo.  Just to be safe.|`|7dyzaIWlaa	sounds alrite|`|PCcbECdZaa	YOU said cute.  YOU said beautiful.  You described him, so obviously you think he's a cutie pie :) That's all that matters.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	well when you want an answer you want to hear you put your description in a way that will appease your readers and your answerers. Need a picture, but obviously he is cute to your standards so he must be the right kinda guy for you!|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	i dunno but you're an idiot.
0QbAiQwhaa	I reckon if you stop nagging him about it or bringing it up he will sooner. Bringing it up all the time would just ruin the whole meaning of it, stop pressuring him and just let him do it, enjoy the moments with him and just be happy, maybe that smile of yours might make him propose extra early.|`|LBfOsZN5aa	Hey Trudy..  My mom is in your same shoes. Actually I thought with was my mom at first...  He boyfriend only comes on the weekends and leaves on the weekdays. I don't think he is cheating and my mother is a rockstar girlfriend. Personally I think she deserve better, but its her choice.    Some people just don't feel comfortable being married.  Was he married before? Perhaps if he was divorced he would be fearful of marriage.    some people are like Lenard Kinnered "this bird can not be caged"  Free bird.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	He is the only one who can answer that question.  We can all quess, but how will that help you in the end.  You have to talk to him again and explain that this issue is starting to bug you and it's going to put strain on your relationship if not sorted out.|`|vqOkgRnSaa	yo.. basically why buy a cow when you can get milk for free?  i would give him ultimatum and if he doesn't want to marry you still, then i would get out. u don't need to be with that kind of man, he is always ready to run when he gets bored with you!|`|NbU9Nk43aa	u can not force it on him!!!!!!THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH U WOMEN!!u think it's ok to trick him into.marrying u then he regrets it.don't rush it.|`|QdnH6oyMaa	well stop nagging him now... he probably is trying to find the right time... give him 6 months.. if not dump him|`|Kz56BwKyaa	Like the old saying goes "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free"? Honey he's not going to marry you. 8 years? Wtf?     Look at it from his pov, you're living together, sharing expenses, he's getting some, everything's going good...why would he marry you? He's getting all the benefits and commitment without being married.    My advice to you is to have a long talk with him about it. He'll give you a bunch of bs and you should tell him you're moving out (and actually do it). Or if he's staying with give him a resonable amount of time to find another place. When you get your own place focus on YOUR life and your future aside from him. Save up money, invest in your retirement, look into buying if you're renting, go back to school, travel, live your life!    You're probably thinking "what if he breaks up with me"? If he does then good. I agree with the others, some people just don't want to get married but you're clearly not one of them. He obviously has some issues and if you want to try therapy go ahead. But I feel like getting someone to marry you shouldn't be so much work. It should be mutual. He should want to marry you, not just lead you on.     He likes you a lot and might even love you but he doesn't enough to make a lifelong commitment. Think about it.|`|09DE4NG3aa	It's up to you to decide whether marriage is a dealbreaker for you or not.  If you absolutely must get married to someone to feel you're being taken seriously, then give him an ultimatum that either you set a wedding date within the next six months or the relationship is off.  Don't settle for just getting a ring on your finger, because who knows how long the engagement will last.  If you lose him, that's sad, but you may meet another man who is ready for commitment.    If you decide that the relationship you have with him is the most important thing, more important than marriage, then give up the idea of ever getting married, and never mention the topic again.  He obviously doesn't care about marriage, because he's had ample opportunity to do something about it in the last 8 years.  He knows you're keen, but he obviously doesn't feel the same way.    I told my boyfriend on our third date that I was looking for a husband, not a boyfriend, and if he wasn't open to that possibility then he should let me know and save us both wasting our time.  Luckily he was religious and wanted marriage too, we got engaged after three weeks, married a year later, and have been together for 9 years now.  I was prepared to lose him at the start of the relationship if my honesty had backfired, because then I wouldn't have invested much time or emotional energy into it.  I guess the longer you've left the marriage discussion, the harder it is to convince him it's an important thing, as he won't see the need to change anything.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If after 8 yrs of being together he hasn't ask you by now then he isn't going to.    Dont stick around another 8 yrs waiting for him to marry you because its not going to happen.    If you want to get married and he doesn't and it sounds like he doesn't then end the relationship and find a man who wants the same things out of life that you do.|`|Eug52iQDaa	There is no rule that says that you have to wait for him to ask you.   You can ask him!  Then set the date.|`|AA11996507	Since you have discussed the topic of marriage many times, he probably thinks a formal proposal from him is kind of redundant.  As he has not expressed any problems with the concept of marrying you, simply say to him:  "Honey, I've picked the date and it's (fill in the blank).  If there's a problem with that, tell me now before I start making all the arrangements."|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	He should know by now if he wants to marry you. You already live together.    Hes either too lazy or just doesnt want to . After 8 years you deserve a proposal..........|`|iOqmoIrcaa	First of all, men with phobias never admit it.  Why should he marry you?  He has the perfect arrangement.  A woman who dotes on him and he has to give nothing in return.  If it hasn't happened in 8 years, it's not going to happen.|`|ON84EQaBaa	WHY MARRY THE COW WHEN YOU CAN GET THE MILK FREE!|`|HbmeWFTAaa	he is scared of commitment|`|ETVr1PdRaa	Hm... some men just don't like the commitment  of getting married. My uncle told my aunt that if they were still together in 15 years, they'd get married. 15 years later, they got married.
rQfzifT7aa	If it is in your name and your name only..he didn't finance it.. you did. He might have agreed to pay it but the judge is going to look at what you signed saying you would pay for the item.   So there would be no reason to take him to small claims court    If you lived together you might could claim common law married and under the divorce ask that he pay for it or pay for half    Check with your states laws.. But that is the way it is here|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Send a letter of demand stating that you either want the tv or the 900. If he fails to do so, take him to court.|`|AA11993638	At this point if you want the money or the TV you will have no choice but to take him to court as he most likely will not do this of his own free will.|`|lM6vnhEraa	asdasd|`|vjT4E9TPaa	Take him to small claims court or call the finance company and tell them to pick it up|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Is there anyway you can get the television? Try to sell it for what is owed on the TV still and cut your losses.   Since the TV is in your name, there really isn't anything you can do if he isn't willing to pay you, maybe you could try to bluff him and tell him he has two options, to give you the TV back, or to give you the 900 bucks remaining or else you will  be contacting a lawyer, do you have a friend he doenst know about that could make a telephone call on your behalf from a fake lawyers office, lol sounds really cheesy but honestly, you signed your name to the bill, there really isn't anything else you can do. Good Luck

9xgGd9praa	You're never too old to stay over someone else's house.  Either she does not trust you, and thinks you are off out somewhere else, or she thinks she's losing you to your friends.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	There is nothing wrong with staying over. Do your friends parents have a problem with it too? Do what you want! You parents are being silly.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Nah, I don't think its too old.|`|qqm78P2Saa	There is not an age limit to having sleepovers! I promise, I'm old enough and still stay the night at my friends house all the time, whether or not I'm partying.     I used to stay the night at my friends house all the time when I was in high school because they had a later curfew then mine. Parents all go through a phase where they don't trust you and think all you do is party if you're out with friends.    Best advice, if you've known your friend that long, I'm sure your mom knows your friends mother. If she is having trust issues, then have your mom and your friends mom communicate with each other. That will put the trust issue to the side and you won't get questioned anymore.|`|oVIrSxZnaa	My bf and I started spending the night with each other in 4th grade and almost 25 years later we still do, we just bring our own children with us now.  We have always had a blast and as kids in school it was every other weekend we swapped houses, then out of high school one week then we swapped, then we became adults and we have to schedule them and we only do it about once a month now.  Does your mom know your friends parents?  If not, this could be part of the reason she has worries about it.  If she does know them, your mom could know something that she isn't telling you and feels that you could be in danger but doesn't want to tell you and ruin your friendship with your friend.|`|yptfd3sIaa	The answer is: I bet she thinks you're old enough to get pregnant! I'm almost positive her unexpressed fear is that if you stay the night at a friend's house, you might have more freedom there than you would at home (like, if her mother works late, or you manage to sneak out while her mother is sleeping). Of course this sounds stupid! But really, things like this do happen.    Maybe if she could talk to your friend's Mom she would be less concerned? Just a thought...|`|89d5ff1143ba4933930c3f9d4514c142aa	I think you mum is wrong here sorry, my daughter is 18 years old and still stays over at her friends on a regular basis, I don't think there is an age where you should stop staying over, I think this comes down to a trust issue rather than you being too old, If i was you I would ask you mum why she doesn't trust you to stay over at a friends house, and what if you were partying? as long as your doing nothing illegal wheres the harm in it your 16 years old you should be out there enjoying your life.|`|GoEaSOSraa	No you are not too old. Your mom is just weird. Maybe she thinks you and your friend are lesbian lovers or maybe she is just paranoid. Who knows. But seriously, your mom is trippin|`|oTWpoIJdaa	I understand that now you feel you are missing out, that your friend will not understand and you may lose friends over this.  As far as missing out of the fun - as long as you have life, you will have friends, parties, etc.  - some will be better than others.  As for friends: well with your real friends you can talk honestly and they will understand. Real friends are the ones that stay - those you keep. The others who can't see past that are termed "fair-weather friends" which are plentiful and when the good times end, so does their friendship.     Once upon a time, parents did not allow children to sleep over at all.     Speaking as a parent, when my daugther was young I saw no problem hosting sleepovers or having my daughter have a spend the night at her friends birthday/slumber party.  The conditions were: the parents and I were in regular contact with each during school days, we had each other's phone number, etc., and our value system were similar.  Also, our children were either in the same class or grade.      At a certain age (the blossoming age of maturity) sleep overs were no longer allowed by most of the parents.  This is a fact when most girl children grow up to become young ladies.  During this time, they should be given a deeper understanding of their own family values by the matriach of the family.  This is a time of passing on traditions, goals, and expectations within the family hierarchy.      In many cultures separation begins among friends and/or genders very early in youth.  A term called "generation gap" does not exist in many societies except in more "Western" societies which suffers more from a discconnection of the family culture.  The conflict begins when society tells the young person that they are totally different from their parents, that their parents represent the past, that the is obsolete, that the future does things the old way, thereby giving the rational that old obsolete and new is better.  Just like a house of cards or dominoes - the structure is only as strong as its foundation.  History is important enough to teach in school because the study of the past has a profound effect on the future.  There is an old saying, "if you don't learn from the past, you will be doomed to repeat it."  So, if history is recognized as important, then so should your parent(s) history, values, and expectations of you be just as important.  You may not agree with everything, but keep an open mind.  You may find that alot of things said now over the course of your life will make sense later.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You are never too old to stay the night at a friend's house. I don't know why she thinks that.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	you are never too old to sleep over (unless you are a crazy adult who is just staying over because you cant go anywhere else). id say once past college you are too old. 8th grade is sooo the age when its really fun to sleep over at friends houses - slumber party!! ask your mother if people can sleep over at your house instead... i dont know, but good luck!!|`|bUdH8HQ8aa	i think there is an age where you get too old just to go over for the reason of seeing them.. so it depends on your age lol I'm 20 and still stay over at my friends heaps but thats cause i have a reason too..like im out of town or ive been drinking or something like that
2EklweZEaa	I don't know how 'recent' you want it to be, but what about "I'll be there for you" by the rembrants. (TV Friends theme tune).     x
hNHp9woaaa	probably bisexual. if he's gay, so what? does it bother you ?|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	oooooh no, what if he is? Are you homophobic?|`|C9th0daNaa	mabe he is by|`|DmXexkZdaa	He could be Pansexual. That means that he would have sexual relations with anyone regardless of gender without actually having feelings about it.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	could be bi? i personally know a gay guy myself and he wouldn't go with a girl if he got $1m lol|`|GoEaSOSraa	I think you need to mind your own business. Let his girlfriend worry about what to do. It isn't your place|`|CCqqTw6paa	nah  not gay just curious|`|Y0zNfd19aa	he is as straight as a pencil|`|8X8q379kaa	He's on the down low. No straight man would ever get that drunk.|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	That's just it, he was DRUNK.  If you're that worried about it, just ask him.|`|hngTcCnKaa	no straight guy would freely kiss someone who's gay|`|s7PxM001aa	bah, drunks are unpredictable  It's possible though, since he's not thinking since he's drunk.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Bi-Curious.  He's not doing anything wrong, just finding out his place in this world.  Stand behind him, regardless of which way he goes!  He's still the same friend!|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	Um, for starters, I don't think it matters whether you french kiss 'a gay' or just someone of the opposite sex.  If one guy kisses another guy, it doesn't really matter if one of them says they are gay or not.  That being said, does his girlfriend know?  Does she care?  If she does know, and doesn't care, don't worry about it.  Just kissing someone of the opposite sex, even if it's french kissing and the other person is 'a gay' doesn't mean your gay.  He might be gay, he might be bisexual, he might be bi-curious, or maybe he was just really drunk.  (Actually, if he's having sex with his girlfriend he's at most bisexual).  It might legitimately be a concern for his girlfriend, but it really shouldn't make a difference for anyone else.|`|UBm9hKWuaa	i think  he was drunk  dont blame him  hes not gay  hes straight    at the most, hes bi  which is crrepy lol    but then again, he was DRUNK|`|d437e94385cda1ae717de1d9fef19592aa	it dosen't concern me|`|ac32b56debe130d109c4e65dfd5b9cb4aa	me2
4096805786d82743a854305649b974f5aa	The best thing to spice it up is one...Go and spend money on lingerie...or cute underwears with no bra for the night...secondly go and visit a book store and look at the sex books  and choose positions that you are both willing to try out...infact if it is a good book just go and purchase it together....there are lots of fun things to do with the sex books...    Have fun...and think outside the box|`|PRUXtYh5aa	That depends on what you normally do or have/have not done.  Experiment,  Bring some toys into the bedroom.  Is he a lingerie guy?  Any particular role playing he might get into?  One that rarely fails as most guys are into it:  try anal sex.  Most women say they don't enjoy this, but when done with a lot of lubricant and toys (not too big) to warm you up, then go slow and it can be enjoyable for both. Assuming he is like most guys that will rock his world.  Just keep him under control and make sure to go slow.  He can let loose when you are well adjusted and ready for it.  Don't give up after one try.  Could take a couple to get there.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	http://www.cosmopolitan.com/    read!!!|`|DmXexkZdaa	Well... have him enter you from behind while both of you are lying on your sides. It's very intimate and it gives him time to hold you while making love to you.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Why not let him try for a change to make you happy. I say you get a headache for about three weeks. Its a two way street, you do not exist in this world to make his "pants" happy. I admire your willingness, but you are not his slave.|`|R5vLLS6baa	ask questions! seriously...just ask random questions about what he likes and what turns him on. like try "this or that" scenarios. and then occasionally act them out. try different positions. try different places. wear lingerie. have nights where its "your" night and sex is your way for that night and his for the next. get a camcorder. give sensual massages. just have fun with it

A nice park (away from kids yelling and playing)  Bring a blanket, maybe a little snack    An arboretum or garden    Any place near water - a lake, stream    Any place that has some history to it.  Some towns have historical houses that people rarely visit.  If you ask, they might allow you to study on the porch or garden.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	ASK HER OVER TO YOUR PLACE.

6UcJWkUJaa	If she works in the restaurant or bar industry then yes she probably is busy all the time.  If not she is just giving you excuse after excuse to not hang out with you.  She digs the attention she is getting from you constantly asking her out.  Throw it back man.  Give it the old cold shoulder.  Casually let her know you made plans with another girl that night.  Let her know how fun it was.  Chicks like chasing, not guys who chase!  You have to become higher value than her.  Good luck man!|`|xCLX9Aczaa	Move on, chances are she isn't interested.  If she was she'd make one day out of the week available for the two of you to do movies or bowling.  And if she is interested, the relationship wouldn't work if she's unavailable all the time.|`|AA10456284	yeah, if you're interested, you make time. I know people with 2 jobs, and school, and relationships. Better luck next time!|`|Ddfff5psaa	NO find time! It's a college life out there.|`|oKuCNVMTaa	It does sound like she isn't interested, but maybe she just isn't into movies or bowling. Try asking her what she likes to do and then ask her to do that with you some time.  If she still knocks you back then move on, plenty of fish and all that.
SupWrLRIaa	That is a rather complex question. For some, making out is just a long french kiss. Others insist that that is simply 'kissing' and that making out has to involve heavy petting. You know, groping, fondling, all that happy horseshit. This latter is probably the more common. Just explore each others bodies with your hands to the degree you are both comfortable with. Operative word being both.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	How is this a problem?You are only 15! You should not be kissing ANYONE!|`|oTtH2ENHaa	15?? This should not even be a problem!! you are 15 for goodness sake! you shouldnt be kissing anyone at this age..!|`|fArUNIfRaa	making out is everything  kissing over and over again without putting your lips away  keeping them on her mouth and tongue.|`|AA11828697	Yes.

uPL3e3tyaa	I don't understand your problem...you get the girl almost all the time; he comes into town once every two weeks and you get her back for two more weeks. She's giving you everything you want and free time off to do as you please, because she gets the same consideration(she has a BF); you're single with a certified 'booty call' on tap at your beck and call and you can't cope??? Are you insane???!!!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	You are not the other man. You are just a follower. You need to find a girl that is totally single. Grow up!!|`|75SSAFsPaa	you are obviousley not cool with being the other man. tell her since she's too weak to break up with him, you need to be the strong one and cool it till she is free. and i hate to say it since it's been said alot, but how do you know she won't turn around and do the same to you? this is no way to start a relationship.|`|xsoqMzxDaa	REALITY CHECK: YOU'RE ONLY HURTING YOURSELF AND NOT BENEFITING AT ALL FROM THIS SLUT!

What if you meet someone and you start to date and a  video come out on her/him .  think about how the other person may feel it not all about you
cNOkl1djaa	It is just so hard to tell. A player often disguises himself as a really nice guy who is genuinely interested till, well you know. They can be very hard to distinguish until then cause of course the player is the guy you don't hear from in ages (if at all) afterwards and the nice guy is sending you the 'I had such a wonderful time last night, when can I see you again' text. Players are often the guys that are gorgeous (they know how hot they are), they know exactly what to say to you to make you feel good. Spend time getting to know him a bit, nice guys wait players are on a time frame. Must say though normally players take your number rather than giving them yours. They are quite happy to say 'so give us your number gorgeous' Ha ha. So yeah he gave you his thats a good start IMO. Good luck!|`|Rh8hUnvsaa	make him wait three months and if he is still around you know its you and not sex.|`|6NY97OLWaa	well go for it if u have known him for a while u should trust him and if he asks for sex while u are going out with him he wants u for sex if not he luvs u|`|xsP90gEbaa	See if he will see you over valentines day..|`|PHKSoUTDaa	Have sex with him and wait to see if he returns your calls.|`|1bfo3ujzaa	if he always calls you by nicknames he probablly is a player. if you see him close or flirty with other girls he probablly is a player.|`|qJBB4Whpaa	if he acts a little too sexual.     but idk..       if he gave you his number and he seems like a player.    i garuntee hes just looking for sex.|`|fbd0969c78d97eb179c5f5a1966e4abdaa	if he doesnt call you after you refuse him sex then you know!
4vv1ElyJaa	Freaking hell when will people understand... EVERY GIRL HAS A DIFFERENT 'TASTE'    Personally I like tall (very tall) guys with dark (dark brown/black) hair and pale skin. Long wavy hair (like up to jaw line & layered with a fringe thingy) is gooood. I like big eyes too. And kinda slim and kinda toned but not really muscly... just average.. but skinny and toned.. if that makes sense lol  Pretty much described my ideal man... i mean with his physical attributes =||`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Depends on the girl who's doing the liking.    I like tall guys who aren't really thin. Thin men kinda freak me out. But at the same time it differs depending on the guy. Sometimes the guy that I'm attracted to most is totally different than what I think I want but he's got an awesome personality.|`|6gNLzDNxaa	ok here's a poem the i found its gorgeous and i agree with it one hundred percent  http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee4/s...  i know its corny but its true!!!|`|cGazG1Tuaa	High Definition ones.    /JK.

nvowgvtzaa	Tell him you didn't come JUST for him, you came for yourself too. You don't want to be controlled either, do you? If it's not something he's going to like hearing, which it sounds like it might not be, be as nice as you can about it, but be firm and stand up for yourself. Tell him exactly when you'll be back, so he doesn't sit there and fume about it. And don't be late the first or second time, either. Sucking up wouldn't hurt either. Bring him something he wants from the store or something...    Don't argue about it, but debate about you leaving if you want. Arguing is full of emotion, so try and keep it to a polite debate, simply about the ration that you want to do what you want to do.|`|PE7OS0f6aa	Dammit!  Tell him you're dying of "cabin fever" you're DYING to see the sights and maybe can he go with you.|`|NoIVF09raa	Tell him you have things do do, or that you'd like to go out to enjoy some fresh air, walking alone. I'm confident that all countries and cultures at least understand boundaries and the limits of personal space. Stay with your cousin if it gets real bad.

1PJdkEzKaa	1.Be conscious of your appearance. Possibly the most important rule to remember when flirting with any guy! No, this does not mean you need to look like a stunning doll. Not every guy wants a Barbie girl. It means that you should be elegant and clean looking. You dont need to be drop dead gorgeous. Be sure that you shower and clean yourself regularly. You should also wear deodorant, clean your ears, brush your teeth and hair, and you could try to paint your nails. Also, try to wear your hair in a style that makes you feel pretty and complements your facial structure and use a perfume that smells sweet, but is not too overpowering. Being conscious of your appearance also means you have to have some level of fashion sense. You dont need to have millions of expensive outfits to look cute because some simple fashions never go out of style. Try sporting dark, slimming jeans, a simple solid colored tank or cami, some chunky bead necklaces, or a cute sun dress. Or if you wear uniforms, just go with the outfit that hasn't been lying on the floor for a couple of days, and remember to accessorize!   2.Dont go overboard or youll look like you tried way too hard. Also, dont wear clothes that reveal too much, most guys like breasts but that will attract other male attention, aka almost all males, not necessarily men you want to be looking at your chest. This can be awkward and disgusting. Makeup is supposed to touch up your appearance, not hide it. Some eyeliner and lip gloss are all you need to play up your appearance and make you look fabulous. But dont get too caught up in your appearance, there are plenty more things you need to know.  3.Achieve the Perfect Personality.  Whenever you talk to your special guy think of the three Ss: Sweetness, Sexiness and Smarts. Sweetness comes with vulnerability, shyness and kindness. These three factors are especially important because they are what make your hottie feel especially masculine. To act vulnerable and shy try tucking your hair behind your ears, smiling charmingly and batting your eyelashes, but make sure that you practice so it doesn't look like there is something in your eye. When ever you see him in the hall ways, be sure to give him a half smile and a real flirty look. Sexiness is confidence. Remember not to be too confident though. That may come off as self-absorbed and snobby. Smarts can fit into the sexiness category. Being smart is totally sexy. Sometimes, even just knowing the most random, irrelevant facts will be sexy.   4.Act Right  There are multiple ways to act flirty, here are some of the best suggestions:    Compliments-Be sure to compliment them in a casual and friendly way on things that are true. Sometimes people will make up compliments just to talk to someone, but that is the total wrong thing to do. You really should compliment on things you really like, so you sound more sincere naturally. Some times complimenting their family or other things they are proud of works.    Intense Eye-The intense eye is a trick that models spend years perfecting. You must give your hottie an intense stare that is both sexy and mysterious at the same time. BUT DON'T BE CREEPY. Also, try staring at the floor and slowly raising your eyes, looking directly at him. Once you have caught his attention, give him a sexy but subtle smile. You should try practicing the look in the mirror, and if completed correctly you should feel as sexy as a celeb.    Eyelash Batting- This trick is one of the oldest tricks known to woman. It gives you a sweet and vulnerable factor, which guys love because it makes they feel powerful. Remember to practice this if you intend to use this technique.    Hair Flip and Twirl- If you want to catch a guys attention, flip your hair casually over your shoulder, twist it and then untwist it, tuck it behind your ears, or run your hands through it.    Soft Giggle and Smile-According to polls, a laugh and a smile are the sexiest things a female can wear. If you perfect your smile and laugh to be seductive and sweet, you will find some great results. Practice forcing a natural smile and laugh, it can help through awkward situations.    Magic Touch- You can learn to brush a guy in such a way that you send tingles up and down his spine. Casually tap him while laughing, rest your head on his shoulder if youre tired and hold his hand when you're nervous; it will give him a sense of manliness and you a touch sweetie-pie, no pun intended. NOTE: A perfect, subtle way to touch him without just reaching up and grabbing his arm or something is to brush imaginary fuzz off of his shoulder or something, or fix his sweatshirt string, or pick an imaginary hair off of his shirt. Totally subtle and initiates comfortable boundary-crossing in an innocent manner.   5.Approach him and start a conversation, but don't make it too obvious that you like him. If he approaches you, look him in the eyes as a sign of affection and confidence.   Try to touch him whenever you can,|`|AA12346188	Drag him to Restaurants.  Drag him to Resorts near coastal areas.

It's probably best since you guys have only been together for five months and are "in love" to slow down. Don't let your relationship burn out to soon.  If five months in your worried its only about sex tell him, you feel like you need to wait. Don't let him pressure you. Assure him that you want to spend time bonding in other ways.. activities, dates, etc. Be close, and intimate, but not sex or kissing (kissing is ok, but don't get hot and heavy make out sessions when in intimate environments (ie. in bed, or following statements...). Hold each other. Dance. Candle light diner.   I never meant to imply you guys aren't in love, be 5 months is FAST to express that exact definition/feeling. So just slow down. If the feeling is real and mutual then he won't even need to ask why really.  Again, don't lose wilpower and don't let him pressure you. If he tries make him no that its a turn off. Normally when a guy hears that something he did is a turn off for you, they will try at all costs to avoid that action again.   If it doesn't work out, call me at... :P  Good luck.|`|TUEuQIJuaa	if he really cares about you he wouldnt care about the sex.... well he would but he would want to do it when u do.|`|xsoqMzxDaa	DON'T GIVE HIM ANY!

Mom's are always good at detecting who is right for us and who is wrong for us. So, just be careful.|`|UezXqDF6aa	I do not want to tell you not to trust him or call him a lair. but you could put him to a simple test. the next time that he ask to make love or that he wants to have sex simply just ask him to do something else.

Does he only call you when he's horny?  Does he ever take you out and NOT expect sex?  When you meet up with him is he like an octopus with his hands all over you and won't leave you alone until you put out?  Does he only spend enough time with you to have sex, then just leaves you?    If you don't feel like you two are a couple, then talk to him.  He needs to know that you feel you are being taken advantage of.  And if he gets all pissy about it and leaves, then that should tell you that he was only in it for the sex.    Guys can really be insensitive dicks.|`|LBfOsZN5aa	How old are you?

Ql0p690gaa	I can understand what you could be going through...!!! Even I was into arrange marriage. Being outside India, I had the option of seeing only pictures and talking to her 3-4 times and was asked to make decision(as girls side can't wait until Opalina a trip to India)Initially I was scared and hesitant. It took me almost 2 years to find a girl of my choice. I was shown a picture of girl with whom I started talking. In my first phone call , I could see  many qualities es I was looking forward to in my life partner. Very soon we are getting engaged. Bottom line is, try to be frank and be what you are when you meet the girl. You will know for yourself if she compatible. Remember, it is not good to talk more also before making decision|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Sounds like these girls are getting interviewed for a job lol.|`|jp5lfmzTaa	You need tutoring for first night also?|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Yikes.

0LwvDkcHaa	my best advice is DON'T WAIT! The longer you do the harder it will be . It's not that often in life when we get a chance to reunite with our first love or crush if she's a good person she'll understand where your coming from. Just go up to her and tell her how you truly feel. Good luck!|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	i had a girl like this    she always drug me along acting like she liked me and went around dating other guys, knowing that cause i loved her i would always be there, then i finally moved on and she would come back when i had a girlfriend and drive me crazy to    my advice is to forget about her as hard as it maybe because if she wanted you she wouldnt have left you, and she wouldnt have another boyfriend    good luck in whatever you choose|`|PE7OS0f6aa	Tell her how you feel...    Look, that block of ice she's now with does NOT own her if they ain't MARRIED!!!|`|Ddfff5psaa	Just tell her, don't waste time...|`|6xC1kCdLaa	Go for it bro..don't settle on "what coulda been", and think about "what could be"|`|fkwhlZ7Taa	hold on tight ..your time will come .Dont tell her now because it will be awkward and with her having a bf .she would probably disregard you.so i suggest you wait a bit and see how it goes with her new bf
91aDQQ66aa	hmm... nah i think your coming at this all wrong.  you need to use reverse psychology on her.  now that doesn't mean ''trick her into liking you or anything like that.  i'm saying just be aloof, play it cool and act like you dont care.  try to be less needy.  heres another really good tip that i just know will make her curious or even jealous if you have the guts to go through with it but i think you do.  nest time you are on the phone with her say ''hey i've got another call i gotta go''.  if she asks you who it was just say oh its just a friend asking to hang out but be very vague dont tell her who.  if she still likes you she will most likely start to get very curious or even jealous you never know.  but bottom line is you've got to make her think that you don't need her and your happy with out her and give her the impression that there may be other girls into you by doing what i just said.  do this and she'll come chasing after you    good luck :)

If she still doesn't want to go, leave her alone. She'll probably think about it and realize she's being stupid. In the meantime, talk about the party (and how fun it's going to be) to other people while she's around.
b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	The matter about divorce on the basis of cruelty can be considered as her asking for your conversion to another religion while you both married according to civil form of marriage according to the Special Marriage Act,1954. However will this be sufficient to grant decree of divorce only if the court is satisfied that her demand has broken down your matrimonial home completely. In such cases the family/matrimonial counselling is ordered to settle the matter amicably between the parties. Her demand  of change of religion is no ground for her not to continue her conjugal relationship with you as your wife at your place,rather this desertion goes against her interest even in the other issue about the physical custody of the child wherein her obstinate temperament  looked as bad conduct on her part & while deciding the welfare of the child the court may not allow her with the custody of the minor child less then 5 years of age as this conduct may go against the development of the child who learns while in company of the parent such aspects of life that spoil his/her future. In the present case the best option initially to collect sufficient evidence with regard to her unreasonable desertion from your company, her willful refusal to continue her conjugal relationship with you, this all can be done by your writing personal letter/mail to her & preserving these along with her replies with you, let all your personal visit be recorded by you using techniques available & let these record her response with regard to her demands or change of religion etc. Mind you you should always make it a point to provide a regular amount for the maintanance for the child even if the child in her custody now as this conduct will go in your favor while you file for the custody of the child. The amount paid to her for her or child's maintanance should be recorded,hence let it be made through bank draft/cheque & not cash. All these followed by litigation for either seeking restitution of conjugal rights against her or divorce as the case may be & physical custody of the child, but on later stage.|`|XuzOYlgCaa	praise almighty allah bullalah for what he already gave you.|`|NiuOD9wYaa	packed the luggage and ran to her parents house,and i used to console her and bring her back .One day it so happend that she fought with me again and left home and she has not come back inspite of my repaeated requests and visits to her house and more over she has put a condition that i should convert to islam and only then she would stay with me.I never asked her to convert and netheir iam i willing to convert  i just want remain what we are and be more focused on the infant who knows no religion.I have deci|`|R4F05z4Faa	The Special Marriage Act was enacted to provide a special form of marriage by any person in India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries irrespective of the religion either party to the marriage may profess.

Break off all contact, it may hurt but this kind of thing is going to continue to happen. He sounds like a rather unstable guy and doesn't seem to know what he wants. Just stay away from him and be glad that you don't have him in your life anymore.    Spend some time with your friends and just focus on having a good time. A really good guy will come along, one who won't keep braking your heart.|`|T3jYgZsFaa	With your picture you still look young. You have a full life in front of you to go and date and meet more then just one person. In the dating world you get to find out what you truly want and who you are. Your friends know what is best for you and they see what you do not see when you are dating someone. The feeling you have almost everyone goes through it. Just listen to your friends, and hang around with your friends it will help a lot! If he comes back he has the same feelings as you do, and he doesn't know what to do about it besides go back. The best way is to be around friends. Friends are people who help make up who you become as you grow older. So do boyfriends but friends make up a big deal. If you and your boyfriend are ment to be then everything will work out through times. Just in the mean time listen to all your friends. Ask them what they think of him, if he is worth it or if he isn't and ask them why they say that. It'll help you see what your friends see. I hope this helps you! :)|`|gBxY8Svpaa	to me it sounds like your in shock or disbelief...you should know your true emotions in time|`|PE7OS0f6aa	Does this guy REALLY care for you or is he just using you?

I think that if he really loved you, or even really liked you, he would definately not break your heart..Sweetie, he is just not worth it. I had the same situation..in the end, I told him to make up his mind!!! Seriously!!! if he comes running back to you since he knows 99% you will say yes.

I know how this feels..Ive been in the same spot. 2 times actually so believe me, ITs hard, cuz u frickin love the person, and want them back, but that person is NOT worth your love.. at all. its just hard for you to see that because u love him..

The idea that you never actually 'lost' something is starting to gel in your head and emotionally you probably expect him back at some point. The only thing that's really missing while you question yourself is the physical contact...that can be remedied easily. Why don't you find a hobby or other activity to take up your free time and decide what it is you actually had/want from a relationship. After all, sex is as important as emotional support in life, you just have to decide where and when it's appropriate for you.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Absolutely you need to take things slow and make him prove himself worthy of you.

First - - am no cosultant on this. Jus wanted to share something which I ve experienced in my life. see if it matches likewise. I fell in love with a girl and a year and a half later she said she had lost the love for me. I was broken completely. I was moved to the point that I cant live without her and begged her to be with me. She agreed. But six months later she said she cant be with me anymore. To be honest there was more of love than lust which I had for her.        The second time I realised I had been very emotional which had made me submissive. I had convinced and consoled her the previous time. But the second time I applied thought.   DOES TRUE LOVE SUCCEED THROUGH CONVINCING ? DEFINITELY NO !!!!   If it is going out of me , means  it isn worth. wats the point when my partner doesn want me.        She cam back to me again after a month telling that she had been wrong. But I refused. Life doesn remain like how it is today. Love is very important, but it is  only a part of life. Wat if she dumps after marriage ? She had ruined the trust I had on her, which can never come back. So that was my decision. It did pain for sometime. But only that pain mended my heart.          Your situation sounded similiar, which is why I shared my story.    No one can give anyone a perfect solution. People can only give suggestions.Which is why people are called as consultants. If I can offer u a solution I would be called GOD.      I wanted to tell u those above lines coz a lot may say that their view is the solution to your problem. But it can suit only to them in their situation. Only you know the best for your problem.

No matter who it is. Next, do you know his personal life? Maybe something went wrong financially and he can't afford many minutes or internet. Or maybe he liked you, but lost interest. It happens... Not to say you can't bring it back to him. Sometimes I crave having a girlfriend. Then when I don't get one after a while, I kinda just give up temporarily. This is probably the most likely cause. Just ask him what's wrong or at least make sure you don't lose contact with him. Relationships slip away day by day, then you don't know each other anymore. Make sure that doesn't happen at all costs!     If you want to ask more specific questions, email me at nicholasdcannan@yahoo.com

I know for a fact that Washington is a community property state. When you marry a man in that state and have been married for more than a year and have any children from him you are entitled to one half of everything he has. They just split everything right down the middle.This includes any bank accounts, money from the retirement fund, etc. and it does not matter if it is only two years. Also if you have any kind of medical problems and he has been the only one supporting you, you may also get spousal support, along with child support. You cannot obtain any of this unless you are getting a divorce and for all the right reasons and not just because you are tired of it and want out and are trying for an easy way to live. Also if he told you that you get half of his bah or whatever that is then you do. He would know better than anyone.
AA11156037	Actually, sweet heart, there is NO such thing as a military divorce.    You get divorced JUST LIKE a CIVILIAN when in the military, you file through the state which has jurisdiction!    except:   Overall, it's important to realize that the military considers divorce and separation to be a private civil matter, best resolved by the courts. Sometimes military spouses expect too much out of military authorities. They think they can contact their spouse's commander, and the commander will waive a magic wand and make everything better. In most cases, that's unrealistic -- just as it would be unrealistic to expect the manager at K-Mart to become involved in your marriage situation, should your spouse work there. The commander has limited authority in the area of divorce & separation. The military only becomes involved in domestic situations in very limited, specific ways -- procedures which are authorized under law or military regulation -- usually when it concerns pay, benefits, property, etc., which are regulated by federal law. In a vast majority of military domestic situations, the correct procedure is to obtain an attorney, and take it to court -- just like everyone else in the United States has to do.    Lawyers. Military personnel and family members all have access to free legal services provided by the "legal office" (JAG). What most people don't realize, however, is the JAG is of very little help when it comes to divorce and separation. At most, the JAG can give you general advice. They cannot prepare divorce or separation documents, they cannot represent you in court, they cannot file legal divorce or separation paperwork for you. Quite often, even the "general advice" may be of little use, as there is no requirement that a military lawyer be licensed to practice law in the state they are stationed in, so the lawyer's knowledge of divorce laws of that particular state may be limited. For military divorce, separation, or child support situations, you need to ( and I can't emphasize this enough!!!!!) consult with a civilian attorney, knowledgeable of the divorce laws of your particular state.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	same as civilian divorce except you can get child support directly deducted from his pay check. talk to JAG.    *edit...i thought you said you had kids. depends on the reason for the divorce... talk to a lawyer.|`|2MVG5StDaa	I'm retired navy.

It is people as yourself that do nothing but damage and hurt the lives of other people. You should have never played your little games to try to ensure you would get the things that you feel you need.              However if a person were to understand what marriage is under Gods Law, and not the marriage practices that are "acceptable" today, then many things would be different. Technically if you have not lost your virginity, then you are not married to anyone.            The person you lose your virginity to is the man that is your husband, for as long as he lives. A woman can be one of 3 things:  1) virgin  2) married  3) widow      Once you have been "humbled" by a man the two of you are recognized as one in the same.If you are forced against your consent(raped), then you will  become a widow as soon as you make it known.         What it comes down to is you have done very many bad things, however if you haven't lost your virginity then the marriage was never consummated. I think if more women were aware of, and understood Gods marriage laws, then they would probably think a little longer and be more selective before letting a man control the rest of her life.   Are you honestly a virgin?

The thing is you sacrificed something and he has not done the same. It justifies why you are not sure what to do.    Also, I think just because you guys have been together for 2 years doesn't mean it's a guarantee your getting married. Circumstances are different but it's not a done deal that he will be the one.

PaShCpyOaa	I think he does like you.    You should say you like him. Think how much of a compliment it would be to him if he found out how nervous you are around him. I am a guy and would love to find out that a girl is nervous around me, especially if I liked her back. If you told him, he would know that he is special to you.    As for advice on how to talk to him...  Try not to think about him all the time. I have problems if I think about someone before I go to sleep and throughout the day. Think of just approaching him as friend.  Imagine that he wants to talk to you and imagine yourself in the situation face to face with him expect that you are relaxed. If you are positive about expecting good things to happen, it will make you less anxious before you talk to him. And you have a better chance of things going well if you have the right mindset.

ohUm00RYaa	Its not unique to guys there are jerks in every gender, race, creed, culture, etc.    Sounds to me like he was cheating on you.  I know lots of "cheaters" and they all pull the same lines and this is basically it.  They first meet a new girl/guy.  Then they start spending less time with the old ggirl/guy.  They start to "work late at the office" or "hang out" with friends but no one in the office or friends verify this etc.    Next thing you start seeing this person less and less and they move their important things(ie personal document out the house).  Then they say we need time apart.  So they don't see you anymore, and finally they break up with you.   While it may seem to you that he just broke up with you, it probably has been occuring for a while.  People almost never "just break up".  there is always a reason, if there was no other person he would have just told you we should split and spared the bs.    I'd say that 98% of people don't notice anything in a break up until its already over thats why no matter how much you beg or plead they never give in.    As for him saying things like he loves you, he just didn't want you to get suspicious that he was leaving you.  He doesn't love you, he just didn't want you to go crazy and cut up al his close and destroy his property.    I kind of see why he did it this way though, there is no nice way to break up with someone, no matter what they will be pissed off, so many people break up mean so that they can feel better about themselves|`|qeLikL8Haa	they do your with the wrong guys then|`|wE2etBzbaa	Stop dating jerks because of their look, and you might become fine with guys.

aLyJe1b3aa	he probably knows shes just playing,  but talk to him about it.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Text him and say: "hey I have a surprise to you,  you're dumped , and you have a tiny penis too."  that will piss him off|`|x2ykq6ePaa	Nothing, you can not Control his actions, if he wants to go back to her he can.  just try to show him how much he loves being with you, that's about it hon!|`|oEfnqmp3aa	"lol" as a response to something serious is very offensive to some people. I know I can take offense to such a use of "lol". So why don't you just reflect upon the fact that her message was shunned by such an inconsiderate reply.    But a bigger concern than that ... is why do you know? It's very problematic if you've decided to look through his stuff, as that's damaging on your end of trust. If that's not what you did, then just focus on him and not the people he's not with.|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	wow dats someting   well lets say that he does know that you know about them   does it look like you show that your worried? or jealous   cause no lie when a guy gets someone jealous sometimes we take advantage of it   but you should do someting make someting happen you make him realize that you are more important   other then that this last detail should be your last resort but i dont think you should do it but you should probably get him jealous to
gdOFLIjbaa	One things girls don't like is when a guy starts acting really stupid and showing 'attitude' if your friends succeeded in tearing your relation ship apart then obviously you guys need to sort some stuff out.    Some girls do like the whole romantic letter stuff. just be careful about what you say. make sure shes not one of those girls who will make fun of it. If she is maybe send her a text. Try and start acting less angry lol. And if you like her so much then you should be able to talk to her in front of other guys? and maybe she just wants to be friends until this whole big misunderstanding is way over. be careful and good luck maytee(:|`|R0ZWMW5laa	absolutely write her a letter! If your too shy especially. Just let her know straight up, you like her, your really shy, other guys were putting things in my head, but dont go too far as to confess your undying love, No that might freak her out, just be sweet and honest!|`|IWRKbpVGaa	If you are sure you like her, then other people's opinions shouldn't matter.  If you are too shy, then write a letter, but it is always best if you can speak in person.      Say to her that you are sorry about any problems in the past, you were an idiot for letting other people's words get to you.  Then just tell her honestly, you like her.      Keep in mind, friendship is better than nothing.|`|qJBB4Whpaa	just look at her ... and think about what you are going to say.. close your eyes for a second. and say      im just gonna be honest i like you.      just get it over with.       whats it gonna do..    and if it turns out badly.. after the next week just be like.. oh  i dont like her anymore.|`|KPnHxU03aa	dont take a suggestion frm other, who doesnot knw abt luv and just ask to ur heart and feel what u want to do, than step forward, nvr get ur step backward!!|`|cYWM3PZiaa	r they rely ur frends? real frends wouldnt do that they should be helping u with ur relationship.  anyway you should try to just tell her or tell her on msn like i did because im rely shy and it worked. just start by talking about movies and then change the subject and so on.    good luk
5agXk9ldaa	no dont let him make the step ;)|`|dgoZCrt0aa	Ask him do I look cute. He'll prabably say yes so then you ask him if he likes you. You'll get your answer right away. I had a girl ask me if I liked her and I said yes. I didn't make my move cause, now that I think about it I don't know why but I said yes and we started going out. I used to play around with her like he does to you.   Good Luck|`|osoTq2dcaa	go for it ! sounds like he is crushing on you .... totally cute !|`|nvowgvtzaa	Kiss him on the cheek when he's not ready for it. That'll say enough.|`|iLtPf3Ipaa	Sounds to me he's probably interested in you. If you really like him, let him know by doing/saying subtle things. Let him ask you out. But if you can tell he is shy, there is no shame in asking him out or just saying... "maybe you want to hang out sometime?"  Just remember, don't let him float away to someone else because you were to embarrassed or whatever to ask him out. Good luck!|`|WRC0O6tqaa	no just test him .. like this..just tell me that im going to date any other guy..and see his reaction. if he said no dont date any one i will date u then u should understand that he really love u and want to be with u..if he said u can date with that then u should know he dont care about u then let him go..|`|ba2f0ce74fcd876a5c908c65b3bb214baa	Give it a try.|`|1UcAmt8daa	If you like him and you think he likes you; then you should ask him.  oh; good luck ^.^
JbjmUT36aa	Guy's are diffrent to girl's, they think diffrent thing's to girl's too. So if there in a relastionship with a girl and they are not careing about it much they don't really want to be with that girl. but when it come's to breaking up guy's get heap's of feeling's and strange thought's of what to do or not. so he just goes with the flow and see what happend's. Or if he is one of those stupid guy's and  dosn't care about the relastionship and when it come's to breaking up they don't wanna because they might look stupid without a girl friend. Its just a matter of diffrence guy's are guy's they just have didffrent axpect's to us I hope this helped =D|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think you should just tell him exactly and thoroughly how you feel. If he refuses to either break-up or mend the relationship, then try and cut off contact from him.|`|wE2etBzbaa	tell him about that, or break up with him, so what if he hates it, if he doesn't do anything|`|dAGrmSFvaa	When you talk about breaking up, do you mean it? Can you end the relationship and expect him to not run after you?    If you can, then I don't think you should stay with him. If your having second thoughts and he does not put the effort to fix it, then just break up.    No, your not tripping. Good luck with that!|`|UXuSI6EZaa	you're both just going through the motions. better to cut clean & start anew.     good luck|`|8l52BsB1aa	If YOU are not feeling loved in this relationship, and if it seems like he doesn't ALWAYS care about it and you, you should probably break up with him.    If you two have a codependant relationship, this will make it harder to break up and stay apart, or even breakup at all,  but you have to be strong and collect multiple baskets to keep your eggs in. Meaning, don't count on this one guy to do and say all that your heart desires. Get some girl friends. Get hobbies.     I had to do it once. It was really hard, too.    Make a pros and cons list before breaking up.   Stick to your reasons while breaking up, don't let him pull you back if you know leaving him is the right decision.    Hope this helps!
ZuD07BKNaa	That's sweet!  One of my best friends was dating my cousin, and on V-day they bought each other plain stainless steel rings with the date they started dating engraved on the inside! It was sooo sweet, I was jealous! hah.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think it's a really great idea. It's sweet, personal and unique.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	It could be scary if he thinks it may represent a promise ring.  When you give it to him, you may want to include a card that explains the ring or at least tell him organically.|`|pIKPFpbiaa	He wears rings? What is he a diabetic?|`|2uXNtCUlaa	Absolutely not- this is not to much..the two are you are going on almost two years..It would be to much if you guys where dating for 3 weeks. very nice gift if i do say so myself|`|D8R8an2taa	i don't think it is to much i would do the same thing|`|ogudF73uaa	yea i think it is a little much, not to put you down or anything, it would send a huge message to me that you want something more like marriage, its like ok i like wearing rings but this ring in particular is something significant, now if you explain that you knew he liked wearing rings and thought that was a great gift he might easy up, otherwise save the ring
We6rY8ynaa	First of all nothing that you said or did was dumb. Can you honestly say that you have feelings for him? If you can then accept the date (yes it is a date). I don't necessarily believe that his past girlfriends used him - but I don't know. It is a bit of a difficult situation when he has dated your friends and then you see them hurt. I can understand how you would be apprehensive. Only you know his character and if you think that he means what he says to you then go for it. Hey - you must have feelings for him if you can stand to be gasping and tearing up from his smoking! I don't think he dated any of your friends to make you jealous. I hope that is not the case. If you are only afraid he will cheat and there is nothing else holding you back then trust your feelings. Good luck!|`|OwJDjANKaa	Have fun|`|UXuSI6EZaa	stop wasting your time. go get yourself a real man.    good luck|`|GzlZmAWYaa	1. THIS IS A VERY LONG QUESTION  2. before you start thinking about it then you need to work out whetther you love him as a friend or more than that  3. if you love him as a friend u need to tell him that, same goes for more|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Could you repeat that?    Only give us the short version...|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	after reading this whole thing it seemed like he genuinly cared about you a lot    then right at the end you mentioned he smokes and your kind of allergic and it makes you gasp for air and your eyes water and all that stuff that it hit me he cares more about himself than you because if he cared about you he would quit smoking or at least not smoke around you, even if he needs to smoke    it may not seem like a big deal, but its where it starts because when he needs sex or a girlfriend and your not around hes gonna care more about his need for sex or a girlfriend and go make himself happy with no care about you
DTrqM46taa	If you really like her then you got to trust her and see where it goes, maybe she really doesn't like to text, or if not just go and have a talk with her so she knows how you feel|`|ub23m7Praa	If she isn't legitimately busy then she is playing with you.    Also, mortal kombat is tight|`|VdtZKYynaa	shes playin u like a game of checkers, big two, etc. hombre|`|2uXNtCUlaa	she is playing world of warcraft... you should start playing her games|`|0IhCFeXLaa	well she is probably like me but opposite.  i HATE talking on the phone but like to text.    she probably HATES texting but loves phone chat|`|jNQbVDHSaa	you are being dodged, give her some space...|`|AA10682405	Hmm, well if I were to do something like that, it'd be because I wanted space. I can't tell you exactly what she's thinking, though.  The best advice I can give you is to talk to her about it. If you used to always text a lot, then you could bring that back up to her and say "Well, now you're saying you're not the kind of person to message when there is nothing important, but we used to message back and forth all the time, and now it's stopped". Tell her you want an honest answer from her, because honestly if she isn't willing to give you those 2 seconds it takes to write a text, you want somebody who will. Tell her you don't know what to think about it, and if she cares enough, she will understand your point of view and work on it. If she doesn't, then you don't need somebody who isn't going to work for your relationship.|`|pIKPFpbiaa	I like mortal kombat.|`|2NzCS7ALaa	well i'm the type of girl that if I'm really into a guy I love hearing from him and respond right away and when I'm not into a guy I just kinda ignore the texts and be like ughh leave me alone!!! get a clue! So I dunno how ur gf is personality wise but if you get a gut erie feeling about it go with it...cuz it's not the way it's supposed to be if something seems weird to you!|`|V6BWAWoyaa	Well, if she use to text you a lot, she is lying and something is up.  Maybe she is having second thoughts or met someone and doesn't know if she should stay with you or go for this new guy.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, she sounds like just as big of a jerk as the guy I was supposedly in a relationship with.  He did the same thing.  He doesn't have to bother anymore.|`|U8gIdoXFaa	If she's fine when she's with you then just give her the benefit of the doubt. She obviously doesnt feel the need to text you constantly and I would say that was because she was comfortable in the relationship.  But she wont be for much longer if you get too clingy. Just relax and let her be. If she wants to spend time with you and is fine when you are together then just run with that. Enjoy your trip away and dont stress.|`|fArUNIfRaa	she just said your not important  you should f*ck her extra hard and see her reaction  but f*ck her in the *ss|`|EemUvfwgaa	hehehehe... she's not a girl like me. during the night before i sleep, i would check my message counter and always be surprised that i have send like 800 messages for that day. funny.    ask yourself, do you trust her?|`|OwJDjANKaa	She's playin you holmes.|`|ujXdjG1gaa	A.) maybe..the texting is costing too much...  B.) she really is busy..just tell her to call/text you back when she's done  C.) She's playing you buddy  D.) She's on her rag...try talking to her next week
tXlvg1ahaa	Start going commando.  Wear a skirt and blouse and nothing underneath and sit so that he has a clear view underneath.  Men usually get the message then.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I'm not sure you can do much else because smiling and talking to him should have been very effective.|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	i agree with the unhuh its me b-eches guy    and chances are hes madly in love with your right now    hoping you will talk to him and smile at him|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Go for the dorky guy who sits two seats behind you.    He will treat you better...|`|iwXs65h2aa	Don't try, and this isn't a 'you're not good enough' don't try. it's a, stop trying so hard. be yourself. if he's into who you are normally than great. otherwise brush it off your shoulder. You'll be suprised how much a guy will notice you more if you don't try or even acknowledge him in a flirty way...|`|WRC0O6tqaa	ohhh just try to talk to him about ur love and tell him drictly that i love u may be he start thinking about ur love...|`|48ZW7O3Maa	if a guy doesn't find you attractive, then whatever you do, it'll be useless|`|eeYl64bhaa	try to be a hot chick|`|GPMmlhuqaa	in my personal expirience, if a guy is not attracted to you first, than it will never work out.       its like: if a guy was attracted to me first and noticed me first out of the rest of the girls in the world, than he truely is attracted to me. but if u force a guy to like u, than he might as well cheat on u because u obviously werent first on his mind.     trust me, you cnt force a guy to like you. it means it never works. he would jus end up cheating.
hxG4zLX5aa	are you leaving out parts?  are you guys "doing" anything physical in your meetings?  if so then yeah he's using you til he finds something better.  but if not, then it sounds like he might be at a crossroads and he's at least being cordial with you.  my gut on what you've mentioned is that it's over and you need to move on.|`|Yy5SRxBJaa	yes and no|`|TzNC8zoBaa	think wisely...  i think his just using you to move on....  you have to be open to all the consequences..good luck|`|pIKPFpbiaa	I think people should use common sense.|`|91aDQQ66aa	its all about your attitude.  by being needy/clingy your telling him he is the boss and you are at his mercy and waiting for his approval.  try being aloof, act like you don't care.  its called reverse psychology and it works very well.  stop chasing him, and if he doesn't come back to you then it wasn't meant to be|`|P17HujJ4aa	He can either be telling you to move on or he is saying yes.|`|n6V2hec3aa	do not trust him anymore
AHX4wxQaaa	Send her some flowers or some candy. Write her a poem or a letter. Send her a heartfelt card asking for her apology and tell her how much you have missed not being a couple as you were. Sounds like if your still cuddleing she feels the same way and will respond to your new gestures. Speak your heart and don't lose what you have because of someone elses opinion.|`|M3BkrI1kaa	brow the ' give and take thing' - fight for her brow.,.,find that ways or let her remind why you should be back together.,. dat will help i guess..|`|ujXdjG1gaa	You gotta really ask yourself if this girl is really down for you.    If she was, would she break up with you?    All that things that you both are doing together could slowly fade away, and could really mess up the thought of getting back with her.    You gotta watch out and ask her about getting back with you. She could be playing this game just to **** you over..    Trust me..I've seen it. They get you all sprung after a break up..then when you give all your attention and love to them, BOOM!!    It's over..and they're in their corner smiling at you.    Forget this...it either goes one way or another. If you truly love her..ask her to get back with you..If she agrees, then it means she loves you..If not, then get out of it before you get even more hurt.|`|dgoZCrt0aa	She dosen't love you TRUST me. Love don't work that way. She likes you but dosen't love you like you do. But I mean if you want her back try talking to your mom and if she tries to accept your GF maybe ya can get back together.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	you haven't broekn up yet|`|nvowgvtzaa	"we still kiss, hold hands, cuddle and have sex"    Sounds like you never lost her. Take her out on a date. Just pretend you're back together, because to the rest of the world, you are.|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	your still together    she just wants you to give her more attention    which she is getting becaue your trying so hard to make it better    and she knows if she makes you think  you have a chance your gonna work hard to get her back    girls a manipulative and crazy, my girlfriends done it to me, my twin sister has done it to her boyfriends    so dont worry about it just keep doing what your doing and keep showing her you care and she will snap out of the pretending|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	I think she just wants the benefits without the whole commitment. I mean, you both still have sex, make out and hang out all the time. The only difference is now you're calling it..friendship? She most likely just likes it this way. No commitment, no strings attached. If you want to pursue a relationship with her, you need to sit her down and have a serious talk. If she's not willing to consider going back to you, then I would recommend you leave her once and for all. I hope you are using protection when you're having sex with her. Good luck!|`|igwoCxYwaa	to me it sounds like she is using you kinda of. so at the moment she doesn't love you  but do something special for her so she knows that you still care for her n everything.  n talk to your mom about her n find out why she doesn't like her. n ask your mom if she will be willing to accept her n not  be hatin on her.|`|rd5468H1aa	It sounds very possible that you can get back with her. You should just find out why her mother doesn't like you so you can try to fix it. It'll be alot easier to date out in the open without constantly watching your back.|`|GzlZmAWYaa	she ztryin to make it so ur not officially going out for ur mom but u kinda r|`|YoswmsWKaa	maybe you have been going out so long that she feels she needs to try something else, kinda like that movie my best friends girl.  Or she just wants to feel that spark like when you to first met.  Try taking her out and recreating your first date or something equally romantic.
htBHCNDtaa	You're a sicko.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	have you been raped at a concert|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	I was touched by a girl once. She stuck her finger up my *** as she walked by and looked at me smiling. I was scared.|`|AA12346188	Never mind about others.  Mind yours and enjoy.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	yea never take your girl to a concert     if you do be reaaaally close and make sure people know whats up.    depends on what kind of concert and where you are    stay away from death metal black metal thrash and anything relating to dead the devil and killing in general .
xUXW6Ufvaa	its called keyboard courage,    go up to him and give him a hug    he wants it as much as you do    hes just shy and its so hard to make the first move    and he will so estatic that you made the first move he will be floored    then after that first time it will become completly normal    and nt nearly as akward    thats how me and my girlfriend were    we jsut talked over the internet all the time then one day i just hugged her and held her hand and then it wasnt nearly as hard ever again    and 2 years later we are still together    good luck|`|j6pqXCh9aa	Ask him out just the two of you. Take him to the movies or out for ice cream and learn how to spend time with each other.  Its just that the two of you have gotten used to talking online that you don't know how to talk to each other in person, so you break the ice. Invite him out and when you two see each other you give him a hug and go from there.  Believe me it will get easier. Good Luck|`|rd5468H1aa	When you make eye contact with him at school you should smile at him.|`|R3VuWvOLaa	well i think like, maybe, like, i don't know like......    i like big butts and i cannot lie all you other brothers can't deny    it's like this and like that and like this and uh|`|P17HujJ4aa	You should make a move soon! If the internet gets in the way, you'll never get what you want! Also, you should give him a hug or smile when you guys meet in school.|`|HPCetoNkaa	I had the same problem with a boy I got with. Put yourself in a position where youre going to have to communicate face to face with no distractions. That usually breaks the ice I swear it works. Go to the library together ask him to help you with homework or go and eat  just the two of you it dont matter as long as you have no choice but to talk to him|`|ujXdjG1gaa	I personally think you should just approach him. Don't let the internet get in the way of acting a certain way around people. It's probably awkward and all at first..but yeah...    Maybe you should talk on the phone first...so you are both comfortable..    haha..and start talking in person...    MAKE A MOVE!|`|WbcHNSUbaa	Life is much easier when you don't have to do things face to face. But it's also a lot less fun. If this guy is shy then you don't want to make him to uncomfortable.next time you guys are chatting online, tell him that you going to *** up and talk to him next time you see him.that way he'll be prepared and he has a chance to object.if he doesn't, then go ahead and make the first move.    You already started building a bond so you don't have to worry bout him not liking you.if anything, your just working towards having the same relationship in real life that you do online.you'll find it much more fun,reading body language and laughing off those silent uncomfortable moments.    Good luck.
qRwmWmDBaa	Handmade gifts are for 7yr olds to give to there mothers.  What you need to get her is a 6 pack of champagne and a funnel.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	yea just google you can find some good things|`|vK2le3WYaa	you can make her a photo album filled with pics of you two.be creative about it. hobby lobby has some cool things.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	google 2 find out ur answer..we're not martha stewart|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Make a replica of the Taj Mahal out of toothpicks.    That's always a winner.|`|fArUNIfRaa	come on her chest|`|Pk02ucx2aa	Maybe a memory album.|`|ujXdjG1gaa	A huge *** poster is always good. Be creative. Use a lot of different colors and cut outs. Use pictures...|`|6UcJWkUJaa	Because most of the other people who commented are jerk offs, I would be more than happy to help you out!  I am a romantic at heart.  Last Valentine's Day I had my buddy light candles in my apartment before me and my girl came home from dinner.  I actually wrote on 20 cards asking random questions.  I call it 20 questions.  We had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries there too.  It is just a way to let your girl know how much you care and want to know about her.  Good Luck Man!
ajgC0KPhaa	I don't believe in Love At First Sight. That's for sure.    Belive in simple love? Yes. If I think I'm in love with somebody, I will think it over.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	15 years on, I believe in it, I experience it every day.|`|ub23m7Praa	I believe in love to the fullest.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I believe in love in every sense of the word and emotion. Love is real and it exists.|`|6MOn3H8Yaa	love at first sight is mostly lust. It is interesting how I see some guy I think I am in "love" and find out more about the guy (he just not really what I am looking for).     BUT YES, I DO BELIEVE IN LOVE !!!|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	A chemical is produced by the brain which creates the feeling of 'love'. But, I never look at it like that..     I believe in love - very much so. It's a wonderful feeling, and it's even more lovely when the person you love feels the same about you.   Anyone can feel love, and be in love..     I love my partner, and have such passion for him. What I feel for him, I can't imagine feeling for someone else. He's sexy, smart, lovely and I know he's going to look after me and our future. Whatever we get hit with in life, he'll stand by me, just as I will do for him.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Yes, love love love, all you need is love :)|`|qRwmWmDBaa	It's just an emotion some people get it wears off though, I personally don't believe in love it's kinda like turkey if you know what I mean.|`|Ox1Z5eESaa	I believe love has many meanings.  one can define it your way, or one can define it another, and both be correct.    love is defined by you and only you.  It can mean heartbreak or it can mean pure joy, or something else completely different.  The word love is very tangible and flexible, but strong all the same.|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Yes, love rocks.    The difficult part is getting it to coincide, that is, having the girl you love actually love you back.|`|iwXs65h2aa	The only people that don't believe in Love are the ones who just got their heart ripped out and are full of crap.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	I'm spending a fortune and a great deal of time looking for it so yes, I guess I believe in love.|`|AA10682405	It's an emotion, but it's something you feel FOR somebody.   And I do believe in soulmates. I believe that there is that person who's meant for you and can give you what you are missing on your own.. like 2 pieces of a puzzle fit together.  So I think it could feel a lot like a spiritual connection.. but it all comes from the brain, of course. It is an emotion, based on an emotional connection you have with somebody, and that's where your foundation with them is.

And if she starts going on about her ex, bail. You can't impress someone if she's still hung up on someone else.     I think in this case, it would be better to aim for friendliness rather than a great romance/boyfriend and girlfriend thing.|`|HxXduL1maa	To impress her, the first rule is: Be yourself. Do not act like someone else, that doesn't impress them at all.   The second rule is: Do not be a jerk. If she asks for something - do it, if she doesn't ask, you should ask her if she wants something. Be polite, no swearing and such. Also it is good to try to avoid friends that act like they are cool and such, since they may totally humiliate you and ruin mostly everything.   The third rule: try to be neat. You must be clean and not sleepy; girls hate stinky guys and being sleepy to her means that she is too boring to you. Also don't even try to talk about sex. Most of the girls aren't perverted and hate discussing about that.  After a few weeks or a month of dating try to get something new, dates are not supposed to be routine. You should start hugging if you didn't start that yet and keep doing things that could make her happy and amused.  Tip: If you would like to get some perfume on you, you can, but don't put on too much. A slight drop may do the trick. A strong smell of perfume can make some people sick or give headaches. Compliment her on the perfume she has.  Compliments: you must compliment her at least once per date. But DO NOT compliment too much, that way she may see that you are trying too hard and may think that you only want her in bed. Try to compliment her at different times, not just one minute after you meet each other.  You must listen to her, either you like it or not. But girls are not like in the movies, they mostly talk about interesting things, not just shopping. Don't forget important dates like her birthday, especially when there is no birthday party and you still remember to buy her a gift.  This is how you should try to impress her.   Hope I helped|`|V6BWAWoyaa	Well Raj if you think you are not attractive you are in trouble from the get go.  Depending on how this girl is you are meeting..some have personal preferences.  If she can see you for who you are you should be fine.  A person's personality makes them more or less attractive.  I met this really hot guy and every time I saw him he got less and less attractive because he was a jerk.  Women like different things.  So it all depends on who she is.  Bring some flowers with you.  Then find out what she likes.  If you are shy it will be a little harder.  Be a good listener as I am sure you are.  Start out by telling a story and see how she responds.  Ask her if she has, or ever will?  Music is always good to talk about.

IcfoAI3naa	For a young adult, pregnancy So many Young women really don't stop to think everything through because there hormones kick in and get them to follow through with what is on there mind. then they end up pregnant, Now they have a baby that they may or may not be ready for.  so many end the pregnancy at the beginning not thinking about that  unborn child being God's little soul and it's up to God to end the pregnancy of that little soul if he wants and only him. And I guess the worst thing would be that if your not marred then that would be fornication and damnation to hell, unless you repent of that sin and mean it from the heart. Just something to think about Good luck with your choice, Just keep God in your mind and heart and you can't go wrong.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	There are too many to list.

Pmt56tnzaa	Wait. It will be worth it. And wait til you find someone that you are in love with. But make sure you are really in love with them. Don't have any kind of sex. Unless you're positive that you're ready. And no don't do it in the anus. Not only nasty but it's exaclty the same thing. You're losing you're virginity if you have any kind of sex in my opinion.

There is no "right" age for sex. everyone is different. It is up to you to decide if you are ready or not. You can't let anyone else (not even your bf/gf) influence the decision or you'll regret it later. Personally, despite being roman catholic, I do not believe in waiting until marriage before having sex provided you are ready before then. Some people don't feel they're ready before marriage and that's fine too. It's a very personal and individual choice. If you don't think you're ready then you're not. If you're not sure, then you're not. Once you're absolutely sure it's what you want, and with the person you want it to be with, and you have talked to this person about it and they feel ready too (if you can't talk openly about sex with your partner then, again, you're not ready to have sex) then it shouldn't matter how old you are. whether your 17 or 50 the first time. It's whatever works for you.|`|iiKZYO6kaa	wait on having  sex dont  lisen to people when they say sex is alsome   cuz u need to think about wut the person mite have where they been  who they done it with there lot of things we need to know before having sex   IT'S YOUR CHOICE NO ONE ELSES|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi Jaz  Dam hard question to answer because to everyone age and ideas of sex are different.

I've never met anyone under 16 with the maturity to have sex, but there are also people in their 20's who don't have the maturity to handle it. If you have doubts about being ready, your probably not.    I see waiting until marriage as a respectable life choice, but didn't make it myself.    Most embarrassing story...oi. Used a condom that my friend gave me, so I didn't know the size. It turned out being so small diameter wise it took me maybe thirty seconds to get it on, and it ended up being too painful to finish.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	i wish i waited til marriage.   i AM a christian, but i slipped up and did have sex, and i was confused if i even loved him  however, a year later, i found i DO love him and we want to wait til we are married to do it again, so we dont spoil all the fun too early ;)|`|J14tPA9Eaa	i say 18 + give or take a year|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	Yes, I believe you should wait. You will regret it.|`|faf9e51ca2493862319971e2688bd52aaa	When I was younger, I wanted to wait to have sex.  Believe me when I tell you that in some ways, sex does change everything.  I waited until I was 23 to have sex, and I even regretted it then.  However, I got into a good relationship and now I don't regret it anymore.  But I'm still glad that I waited until I'm older and more mature to do so. If you're unsure about it, it probably means you're not fully ready.  Despite what some people say, it iS a big deal because it's a connection between 2 people both physically and mentally as well as emotionally.  Oh and I don't really have an embarrassing story to tell.  I suppose the most embarrassing stuff is like.. farting during sex.  Which has happened to me, but I wasn't really embarrassed because my bf is the best and I'm totally comfortable with him.  Good luck. :o)|`|H4GM9kWyaa	Age: For me, 18 years old. But this is just me    I dont think you should wait untill marriage, because what has happened to people I know who've done that, fell in love with sex and just basically gave themselves away. I think you should do it when you're ready.  And by ready, I mean once you've matured, and make sure you're prepared to have a baby (have money, be responsible etc) because anything can happen    And I dont have any embarrassing sex stories, Im fifteen years old, and I've never had sex|`|NGtc5UfXaa	Obviously it's better if you are older thank 12,I think you should have sex when your ready to, but the person you do it with... make sure it's someone you LOVE, otherwise you will regret your first time forever.

O36qjj7Oaa	If you consider another man over your own husband as your best friend then yes it is wrong.|`|rQfzifT7aa	sounds like you are comparing your husband to your best friend.      You say your bored and he has no opinion. Well maybe his opinion is that you do look good in both dresses. He married you for a reason.    You are missing something with your husband. It is called communication. And you both need to practice on it.    That is the number one reason marriages fail. When your husband takes out the trash or what ever he does. Do you say thank you. I know it is his responsibility. But a thank you goes a long way when you say it and mean it    When you wash his clothes or cook him dinner or what you do, does he say thank you?    You have to let the other spouse know you appreciate them. They don't know you love them unless you tell them and SHOW them.|`|WluRS5ivaa	sounds like you are spending more time with your other best friend, and not your husband.

You say that there is so many things you want to do. Your husband is amazing. Why can't he do them with you?  Or maybe you just want to be on your own. What ever the case may be. If you are unhappy being married, then maybe it is not for you.     Before you go and file for divorce, take a week a whole week and use that time for you and you only. You can make excuses that you can't or don't have the time. But if I told you that you could make 50,000 dollars by just spending 1 week alone you would make arrangements to do it. So you have to want it.    And then maybe decide what you want.    I think some time alone just to think would do you alot of good|`|PRUXtYh5aa	You have a very good excuse to leave:  your heart.  You husband can be the best guy in the world, but if your heart is not into the marriage and you are no longer in love with him, that is perhaps the best reason to leave.  It is not an excuse to leave.  It is the reason.  Who knows, you may leave, travel the world, sew some outs, do whatever and come to realize that you are meant to be with him.  Before I married my wife I left her.  We lived together and I left.  It didn't take me long to realize how much I really was in love with her.  She traveled and found herself as well.  We got engaged a year later.  Married almost 12 years now.|`|DlAOGBz5aa	Regret is a good reason, at least your husband has a chance of finding someone who wants the same as him out of life, and besides, maybe he feels the same & doesn't want to hurt you.

I've had friends go through something similar and my husband also decided about 10  years into our marriage (and four kids) that he wished he hadn't gotten married as well.  It happens.    The thing is is that I have come to the conclusion that you don't have to have a 'reason' such as cheating or drinking or some concrete action to end your marriage.  It is really ok to say 'this isn't for me.' People change, it happens.      I also think you have to put yourself in the other person's shoes (your husband I mean).  If it were you would you want someone to stay with you because they felt they had too?  As much as it may hurt him and upset him initially in the long run it is always better to be honest about how you feel than cover it up.    I think you should talk to him about it.  You don't have to end your marriage, you can ask for time and space to think about what it is you need and want out of your life.  Some time apart to clarify what you are feeling may be a good idea as well.  Either way it is your right to live your life the way you see fit to live it.  Talking kindly and calmly to your spouse and discussing how you are feeling is the first step and you can take it from there.    I hope this helps! Good Luck|`|tqJeFCYZaa	Check out the United State of Tara on Showtime. Maybe you'll get a few ideals. LOL! Just kidding. Here is what I live by.

9FiV99qiaa	Not sure if I could help answer at all, but please read, if you can...    I've never been married, divorced, nor had any children. However, I was raised by a single mother. From a son's perspective, I can only say that I was and still am very grateful that my mother did not abandon me when I was 12. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about my father who had indeed abandoned us for the sake of pursuing his "freedom to live his life the way he wants", disregarding all parental responsibilities including child support.     Since I'm the oldest son, in my heart, I have decided to take care of my mother so long as she lives and so long as I can. In a few years when I get out of college, it would be my time to pay her back for all her time, love, care, and efforts.        I don't feel the same way about my father though. In fact, I might not even show up at his funeral if he dies, nor visit his grave. He has chosen to stop being a father since I was 12 and so, it is only fair that I too stop being his son. Though unfortunate it may seem, we're practically strangers now because that's the path he chose.      I don't know how old your kids are, but before you take any action, please be reminded that you and your husband were both responsible for bringing lives to this world. Please have the foresight to think 10-15 years ahead. If you look back in time, would you have any regrets or guilt? Would you think running away was the best thing to do?    I believe people have the right to live life the way they choose. But would you rather pursue your own happiness even if that could ruin the childhood of your three kids? Is it more important for you to run away and abandon your kids? I urge you to think about this.      I don't know you but I think you cared enough about this so you posted your question. So, I assume you do feel and understand the responsibility of what it means to be a parent. Please think about your kids before you make your choice.                 Lastly, if you do make the choice to continue to be part of your children's lives, I could almost guarantee you that your children would always remember your love.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	don't run now|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	please take a day or two to think this out .. if not then run as fast as you can|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	take a mini-vacation for a day or 2 by yourself. you probably need a break from the monotony and need some time to yourself to relax.     when its the same thing day after day after day after day you begin to wonder "is this really it? forever?" and that's scary... really scary.... take some time to yourself every now and then.     Though I dont have any kids yet (we have been trying for 3 years) I have been fighting the urge to run myself here lately. I have no time for friends... its all about him and supporting his job (hes in the army and I help out families in his unit) ... I have no 'me' time anymore. I am taking a mini-vacation next week and spending a couple of days with my best friend from high school and her kiddos.     Sometimes you just need a break from those you live with.|`|USKa5FR7aa	to put it short you need to go  counselling thy are there to help trust me and you will see the deference xx|`|X0ubZnPjaa	why would you want to run? if your not happy with your marriage then get a divorce and leave .. but dont leave your kids  make sure you take them with you.   you could maybe see a marriage councilor or try talking to your  hubby about the situation  if you haven't already .    good luck ..|`|tN3rnAJEaa	if your married is not getting alon i would live to , if your hudand is hitting on you get the kids and live and go to a saft place go to st mary saft place for you and you and your kids to go to be saft|`|UAVrMc4kaa	Find someone to talk to about it.  Why do you want to run?  Running won't help...your problems will follow.|`|Kz56BwKyaa	Why do you want to run? If he's abusive in anyway then of course run. Take your children and get the hell out.    But if you're thinking about leaving your husband and kids and running away then go talk to a therapist or a close friend. Running won't solve anything, trust me. Whatever issues you have can be worked out. I know what its like to just want to run away and never look back. When I felt like that I would think about all the people I would hurt and how it would make things so much harder. Good luck.|`|k5zJQVRraa	Hi, i understand the need to run. but it might only help for a little while..   take about a week or so and go somewhere nice.. and see if it helps you to recoup.. of course as long as your husband is good to you and the lil ones..i would make it a point to return home.. if hes not good then i say pack up and get out of dodge.. the first and foremost though is making sure those lil ones come first.. you always wanna do whats best for them..
AofMPwijaa	I wouldn't be mad, I'd be FURIOUS. What the hell kind of crap is he pulling? Sounds to me like he's not a loyal as he wants you to believe. Talk with him about it again and tell him that you shouldn't have these "bad feelings"... and you wouldn't have them if he would start treating you like his fiance and not his fling! He's getting married and he needs to stop fooling around and cuddling with other women. If he wants to cuddle, he should go to you. That other chick needs to get out and find her own man. He's completely out of line. If he really honestly loves you, he'll understand your concerns and work them out with you, not accuse you of "being jealous". He won't keep doing what is bothering you, because that's NOT what a person does that loves you! Please talk with him and tell him that it's to the point you don't know if you should stay with him. If he keeps this behavior up, as hard as it will be, I urge you to leave him. There IS a better man out there, that will respect you and your relationship. This man doesn't sound like much of a man at all.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I'm wondering why you are still with him.|`|afkygHMgaa	Not only is it out of line but both him and your friend are not trustworthy. You are in for some serious problems if you do not move.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	Theres nothing wrong for your fiance to be making friends with your room mate and having people thinks that hes cute is not a bad thing either. But I think the room mate is attracted to him|`|diAqosiIaa	nope!!! he and her are both out of line and you need to say something or kick them both to the curb. one when you are friends with someone and they have a guy you already know not to cross that boundries....getting to friendly it is something you just dont do and if she was a true friend she would know that. two you are in pain and he is kicking it with her....thats a big nono. i think you should sit down and talk to them both and see if there will be changes|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	OMG, you're not being jealous and out of line! He's seeing her as well as you! You need to do something about this. Your room mate/best friend is no friend! There is something wrong! You need to talk to the both of them NOW and you need to tell them they oughta stop or its over! Seriously, I'm sorry but this is too much! Good luck :(|`|AA10548545	yes. i have also doubt on him. but don't do direct anything in this case.if possible go out side for some days with your Fiance,so u will have full time of him.talk continuously about your marriage, planning of  marriage ceremony,etc which things where only u both can take decision and involve her in this discussion. u will get some clues or result from this for u future relationship.|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	this is soooo out of line...you better get ur man back on his leash and ditch the roommate. i'm sorry but since you two have been having medical issues lately she needs to keep her nose out of ya'lls troubles.|`|fArUNIfRaa	just f*ck him in the *ss with a strap on  he'll get over it.|`|dsWxq0vyaa	You are not being jealous. There is something fishy going on between those two...|`|ujXdjG1gaa	You know what? Honestly, I think you need to talk to your roommate/best friend. Because if she was a good friend, she wouldn't pull this kind of **** that makes you feel uncomfortable. After you tell her and she fully understands and is aware of the situation...See if this thing keeps on continuing...If it does, you should take action immediately.    If you end up telling her...and she's a good friend, she'll understand..and if this keeps coming up, she's a friend that isn't worth keeping..    Yeah, jealousy happens..I admit..Just make sure it doesn't go TOO far.|`|9fZYkQisaa	woah woah woah they are both WAY out of line. sounds like the only thing there not doing is having sex. they might as well be in a relationship. you need to do something about this before it gets any worse you are not being jealous at all. you should have never let it go this far. them cuddling and talking all night? wtf no you don't do that with when you have a gf i don't care if the other girl is your friend or not|`|xI4L9byOaa	put it this way hunni id let her know back off or move out and to be honest if she was a mate at all she wouldnt be doing this ( a mates guy is way out of bounds ) as for him as him if he`d mind you laying in bed with his mate and cuddling up to i bet he would rather stick pins in his eyes , you need to sort this and quick hunni xx|`|BD5WT4uZaa	make sure he understands if he would like you to behave the same way with his male roommates or friends, same as your friend.    there is something called respect and what is the point of the relationship if there is no commitment, compromise and communication which is the base of a relationship.    You better act fast girl, cause if you cannot trust either of these people, why do you want them...    this is not easy, so ask God to guide you in this and to show you the way however difficult it will be and it already is... something ain't right.|`|lwXyuS2yaa	I normally don't give serious answers, but I'm going to on this one.You need to open your eyes! She is trying to take your place, and he is letting it happen. I would bet my life that they have had sex. You might not want to believe it, but I'm a man and can tell that he is. No man gets that close to a woman when he has a g/f unless they are also being intimate. Part of this is your fault. You are allowing this to happen right in front of your face. You have said nothing and I'm sure he knows you're clueless. Well, it's time to get a clue! Either kick her out ,take your man back and try to get your relationship back on track or let him know this will not be tolerated and leave him. If you do/say nothing, I guarantee you he will leave you for her one day and /or you will end up walking in the bedroom and they will be doing a lot more than cuddling.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	If they aren't having sex behind your back already, they probably will in the future.  This is absolutely not an okay situation.  I don't know who is worse, your fiance or roommate.  But if it were me, I'd kick them both out.  You're in for a very dark, and very predictable future if you stay with a guy who loves nothing more than to cuddle with other women.  After marriage, what do you think he's going to do after you have your first big fight?
JaOddaodaa	I COMPLETELY AGREE TO UR BOYFRND, U SEE WHENEVER U SPEAK TO HIM ABT YOR PAST, HE MAY FEEL SAD, PLEASE DNT DISSAPPOINT HIM, TRY TO FORGET UR EX-..........

NOT ONLY YOR EX- , U WERE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR WHT OCCURRED TO U, SO ITS GOOD U FORGET IT.|`|og3Tmn0saa	It's very likely it was just a flukey period that took longer. Stress can make those things skip sometimes. I doubt you were pregnant, since it is VERY unlikely to happen without penetration and orgasm. More likely your brain thought it might happen and somehow made your body skip a period. Brains have funny control over stuff like that.|`|D6pfv64maa	i have never heard of getting pregnant without having sex so i think that chances of u being pregnant was unlikely.  with reading what u said that u and ur ex have been on again off again there is a reason why u two haven't been able to stay together so i think that is a sign i think u would be better off stayin friends and finding some else.  as for ur friend giving him a bj u don't need friends like that she knew what she was doin she come crying to u was just a way for u to forgive her.

We6rY8ynaa	I don't blame you - it would irk a lot of people. It sounds like he may not be completely over her and may want to reconcile. Do not get me wrong, I think you can be friends with an ex but you have to respect your current bf/gf feelings. I hope that this is just a friendship thing between the two of them. If it really bothers you -tell him. That is not asking too much of him. Good luck with all of this.|`|xCLX9Aczaa	Dump his sorry ***.  He is being inconsiderate of your feelings and most likely, he is putting you in her spot until she decides she wants him back.|`|y9z65Rndaa	i say try to spend more time with him or do something together he might enjoy you know have any interaction with him and plus their just friends right don't worry if you both have stronger feelings for each other than there's really no problem|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Being used should irk you.|`|VmorQmIhaa	Tell him how you feel. If he's with you, then tell her to back off. Don't be afraid to let her know how you feel politely especially if he has made it clear that he's with you and not her. Good luck.|`|CcW9fpvEaa	umm welll this is a bit of an akward situation, i would say perhaps talk to him about it maybe suggested you go out with them both and see what they are like around each other if there the suspicion they are a lil close or flirty then maybe drop your bf n go looking for a new one!  x|`|dsWxq0vyaa	It should irk you. Its not friendship. She will most likely try and mess up your relationship|`|9eyETvWpaa	Have you tried talking to him about it?    Just state that it bothers you a little bit.  Ask if he's over her because if he's not then he shouldn't be wasting your time.  Also let him know you're okay with him talking to her and being friends, just you want to be open and to be faithful to you.    After you talk about it and you let your feelings known you'll feel better.  Other than that you can't change someone, so if he's not commited to you, you shouldn't try to change him.    Hopfully everything is good tho :D|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	You have a right to me unhappy with this, no one would like this situation, he sounds like he is using you, i think you should consider dumping him and getting yourself a real man.     Good Luck|`|Trps6yyDaa	plz leave him..... i had the same situation n finally after a very long time he told me "i still love her n not u.... i just had a crush on u..... so plz u study well n leave me", it was the most painful thing for me...... i loved him more n still suffer unable to forget him..... a girl having such a crash in life is really too difficult to digest..    ur boys ex is still single... but my guys ex got married n divorced n now she has a kid after so long she came back n asked him to take her back in his life... all of a sudden his love for me vanished n my world darkened.. i m still suffering coz my relationship with him was a brief one..    i suggest u...... plz plz plz leave him in this starting stage itself....... its ur life.. ppl just ve more attraction towards the more better thing in their life,     don't go behind him anymore, he'll ruin ur life    plz take my suggestion... its a life experience for me
jTV6rLX3aa	The problem with this is that she could be doing the same thing.    If you like her and really want to get back together with her, have a good self-reflection. Think about what went wrong with the relationship and your role in contributing to that. You may think about her actions and how you would respond in the future.    Giving her some space would be good for both of you in that it will allow you to have some time to reflect and experience new things.     You can call her occasionally. She might call you occasionally. All that matters is that you are upbeat and happy to hear from her when you do talk. If she gets the impression that you don't want to hear from her, she may stop completely.    Don't call her often, especially initially. Given time, she may be willing to talk about how the relationship went and what went wrong with it. You should then apologize for your role in the break up and tell her that you still care for her.     If it is meant to be, it will be. Who knows? In the time you are apart, you may meet someone even better. These things have a way of surprising people.|`|V1i6c9qMaa	I have been in the same boat for the last couple of months, my gf broke up with me. I went through a period of seeing her daily and hanging out and talking and it was a little awkward, we still lived together for a few weeks until the lease was up. It was good at the end but still weird. No we live apart and talk pretty much daily. I tried to not talk to her for a while but she wouldn't let that happen, she kept calling or texting me to talk. In the last couple of weeks she has been reminiscing a lot about us together.     In affect you are doing the right thing if you are not talking to her. Use this time for you to rediscover yourself and find out what you may have done to end the relationship. If you both get to talking ask her out for coffee or something easy. Just talk dont push anything and read her body language. If she leans in you lean in too. If she looks into your eyes look into hers. Then follow your instincts from there|`|WjPkqk0Jaa	I think your best bet is to get some Professional advice, There's a link below to a site I found hope that helps and good luck.|`|Or1FSQxKaa	If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be...|`|oGzcWDNeaa	you should think about a little more and see if another time around is worth getting into. anyways do what you stated but dont talk to them at all and start doing stuff for yourself. if you are doing stuff for yourself then they want to get back together with you because they are comfortable with you but now you are doing more for yourself and they are attracted by that. good luck!|`|UbTHwP0Faa	I'm in the same boat as you Theo.    I *will* get her back though. Just don't know how, lol.    Either that, or find someone else :P    Good luck, man.|`|V4PA9foJaa	Apologize to her, and say you still have feelings for her...look man, we say them a thousand times "I love you" but they never hear a simple sorry from us... just see how happy she becomes when you apologize to her...Good Luck!!!|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	It is such a cliche but time is the answer.    Although you have to think why you split up in the first place, an ex is an ex for a reason.|`|ojtc54Iwaa	find how why the break up happened..fixed everything you did on your side and be a better person, show her youve changed is key. if you broke up for a certain reason and the problems arent fixed she wont want you back that way. try and be a friend to her. playing games wont work its not worth it
Midbg5BJaa	I think we should encourage it.    We make most of our mistakes in our youth, mistakes are what you learn from- do you really want adults going out into the world without any idea how to have a relationship?|`|pQBjqMkoaa	i know im tired of seeing my favorite show maury and every episode its a teenage girl saying she doesn't know who the father is and she has 10+ candidates|`|3IXArLJMaa	well.... personally, i think there's good and bad to relationships... and it's each individual's choice to make it good or bad... we all have choices and decisions... so, it's up to each person's decisions that will decide the outcome or result of his/her relationship...    ~daN~|`|OXcApjPzaa	My parents wanted us to learn how to foster relationships with the opposite sex so they let us date from 14. My parents never discouraged it at all. In fact, my mom always beamed with pride when one of us siblings said "mom, i have a girlfriend/boyfriend". It was a sign we were growing up to her. My dad was a typical dad. He didnt want my sister dating anyone who wasnt a good student and he'd throw a temper tantrum if they dated bums. "Dr's, lawyers, business men and tycoons. Thats all you will marry or I will kill them"    I'm not a dad yet but when I am..... you can bet my kids will be allowed to date. The only parents who need to fear dating... are the ones who dont supervise the dates until they are at least 16 or 17.|`|URxUGoUMaa	erm no you should encourage it if anything  if not then teenage years arent half as good !    xx
cr8J3hPqaa	I commend your bf, he sounds cool, by the sounds of it, he is playing the game perfectly.... We guys should stick together....    But I'm going to help you, since you asked the question, and you need it, since you dont understand the game completely yet, so you must be in your teens, or very young; okay here we go:    Since your no longer bf/gf, What I would do is, date other guys, or atleast give the perception that you are.    Talk to your bf about the guy(s) you are dating[even if you cant get a date that fast, make it up, act like you are], tell him how funny 'John' is [or whatever name], and what he did, then start giggling, talk about John's motorbike, and what a bad boy he is. Talk about how big John's muscles are, and how athletic he is, John does boxing ect....you get the idea....    He will be pissed, and he will begin to want you, more and MORE.    You say that you still chat to him on the phone, this is BRILLIANT. What you do next time when your on the phone with him, is put him on hold, say 'excuse me, someones on the other line, I'll call you back', and then dont call him back, for at least 4hours+ or if you want to be very cheeky, even the next day, next few days.    He will be thinking about you all day, he will be thinking what is she doing?, why has she not called me back?. You will look so cool, that you have a life, and that he is not everything in your life, it will also show that your not available for him whenever he wants. If you do accidentally answer your phone, keep the conversation brief, and try getting off the phone as soon as possible.     We all want what we cant have, think about that. When you where a child in the playpen, you never played with that one toy, but when your mum would come to take from you, you would all of sudden want that toy, like nothing else.     This is basic psychology, now he will want you, like that forbidden toy....    If you have Facebook, or something like that, put some pics up on there, of you looking extremely sexy, with some guy. Get a makeover, get a Mac stylist to do your makeup. This wont cost you heaven and earth, to speak. Go to the Shopping Mall, there are mac makeup artist stands there who will do your makeup, free, as a demo. Get a sexy low cut dress, and a tan. Showoff some skin.    With your friends, or by yourself, walk up to the sexist guy you see in the mall or wherever, and take a picture with him, he wont mind, trust me, just tell him he is sexy, your just using him. AberCrombie models are hot, if there is a abercrombie shop in the mall, find a shop assistant there, to take a pic with you. When you do take the pic, stand side ways to the guy, with your hand on him, to show off your curves.    Now post these pics on facebook for your bf to see, send him [your bf] an email to check out your facebook pics. ;)      Soon enough, my friend, he'll be eating out of your palms in no time.|`|TlnTKyXxaa	In my opinion...At this point after a break up, getting back together all depends on who's in what place. You both miss each other, you want him back. But for now it really is on him. If he isn't ready for a relationship, then he isn't ready.    As for how you are with him - ignore him or be his friend - you need to decide if you can live with Just friends, or if you really need to cut him out of your life to get over him.    But the best advice I could give you, is don't play games by doing things to test him, or acting in a particular way to win him over.    I hope this was helpful|`|W6wqwws1aa	go round his wearing sexy linguire under your coat and when he answers the door open your coat so he can see you.  im sure he will have you back then.|`|p0ioXUM2aa	food and sex attract men and not in that order|`|3ba3d366710c221dbd1c68c4c6c1b3ddaa	If you take care of yourself, only good things can happen. Cheer up and try to accept things for the way they are. I like the idea of seeing if he misses you. Once you are "out there" he might see things in a whole new way. If not, well you are already out there, so no more feeling low!!|`|CcW9fpvEaa	hey hunie,  Well if i was in your postion maybe id go ryt back to the start and act like you where when you where trying to win him over,   maybe dont talk so much so maybe he thinks about you more and he will then relise that he needs you.............umm thats about all i can think of for now sorry!  hope you win him back!  x|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	it sounds to me that he only see you as a friend, sorry. you need to move on. in time it will get easier.
og3Tmn0saa	Well, when you do it yourself, make sure you're doing it right, you know. And you're young and hormones are raging and you're going to feel this way.

However, you do have to make a conscious decision as to whether or not you want to have sex with someone at this point or not.  It pretty much sounds like you've made a decision to wait until you're in an at least fairly serious (monogamous) relationship, and if that's your decision than you should leave it at that.  Make a decision and stick to it, after really thinking about it.  If you decide you want to wait to have sex, get a little collection of different sex toys and go for it.  Once you get past that feeling of being really aroused and feeling kind of helpless, you should feel better.   Don't worry about feeling aroused all the time.. feel empowered in knowing that you can take care of yourself until the right relationship comes along.   Good luck. :o)|`|gVsjWfpKaa	No its not u are only 17 yrs u should be concentrating on ur studies not on sex plz try harder to stop it its not right..|`|rjac15O0aa	No worries!  You are normal.  Try getting some toys or run it out.  If all else fails just please use a condom.  It might wear off and it might not.|`|V4PA9foJaa	you are young, you are a sex maniac, like any other teen, but I still think it's a bit abnormal because you seem to need more sex than other 17 year old chicks I have known...so yup, please consult a psychiatrist, he may be able to help you out, i am not being sarcastic, i am serious...
9Oxu5CIoaa	You need to move on. I know it's hard but think about it: You are only 19 years old. You are SO YOUNG. You shouldn't be getting into a serious relationship.   It's pretty messed up of him to do this on your birthday. But don't worry, you will feel the same way about other boys in your life. You have a long life to live.   You will be fine, just be happy and keep your head up.|`|D6pfv64maa	first let me start by saying happy birthday  i feel that two people love each nothing should stop them from being together.  i know that its hard when someone u love leaves how well do i know and yes it does hurt.  the thing is there isn't nothing that u can do.  i can say over time the pain does lessen try and find someone to talk to someone that u can trust and is willing to listen.  i do wish u all the luck in the world and i hope things work out for the best|`|CvP4rPliaa	soundz like a dushbag but on the other hand ur free i hate   dating sumtimes just for this reson i recently went out with this chick and i got annoyed and broke up with her she thought it would last pst!  but dont become a lez and move on or just forget about religon or countrys and be together make it like some romeo and juliet lovey dovey stuff thats what i would do yo|`|jgXTrdS6aa	wow... aren't you unique?  WE ALL FEEL THE SAME PAIN WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN!    move on!!!  and omg, 19 years old?!  I know a single guy who is 26 years old, he's cute and amazing he earns big money.  but hey, this guy is so financially stable and didnt i mention he's cute??  he just got hurt from his last relationship, now he is looking for miss deserving him kinda thing.    what i'm trying to say is... a lot of men are better than your guy. enough is enough! you dont deserve to get hurt!|`|UbTHwP0Faa	If you need a "rebound" here I am...|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	You can't force anyone to care for you, when they want to walk away. I'm sorry you're going through this. You have no choice but to let him walk away..In time you'll feel so much better, and you'll be glad things happened this way. For now, you're going to feel really bad and depressed. Trust me, I've been there. In time, you'll be okay and you'll find out why there was a reason why he wasn't meant to be your soul mate. I wish you all the best!|`|8l52BsB1aa	If HE does not want to make it work with you, there is not much you can do.  But do not worry, I recently broke up with a really great guy, and it was REALLY hard at first, the waves of grieving pain are really strong at first, but they get better. Trust me.   You are young. You will find another, perhaps even better love, someday. Even if you do not like thinking of that now, you will, someday.    I understand how usually cheery times can make a grieving person extra sad. It IS sad. But it will get better.    Happy Birthday.|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	i know how you feel he just ain't listening huh?   im sorry to say this but what you need to do is face the facts and keep your head up   plus your ex knows that you are desperate for him now and you shouldnt show him that because he will take advantage of that   but do believe this in do time he is really going to regret walking away trust me you can count on that   Smile its your birthday and it only comes only once every year
d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	First of all i doubt there is anyone who doesn't want to change anything in their past, we all have our regrets.  You have to look at her now, does she make you happy? do you want to continue the relationship? If the answer is yes then great, if the answer is no, then end it as nicely as possible.  Forget about if she had a crush on your friend or not, she is with you, not him.    Good Luck|`|VmorQmIhaa	Sounds like you want to know and you don't at the same time. Ask the guy she was seeing if it's true. Show her the evidence. If you you're really serious, ask her to take a lie detector test. Try talking to her friends. There are lots of ways to figure out the truth if you're willing to take the time. Good luck!|`|QdnH6oyMaa	she is real... but you are being unrealistic here.... irrespective of what her past was you were not not in it..... so you cant judge her on that.... the truth is right now she cares for you.... so move past  her past... only if you move past it can you get over it and have a future|`|Trps6yyDaa	Better keep some distance.... u ll be more hurt if u fall in her love sincerely n if she leaves u...... doubts never disappear once they r created.... anyway be as her support n try to keep ur heart friendly towards her..... don't imagine too much

Aj99vuqYaa	She's married with a child. Drop it! Don't go trying to ruin a marriage and a child's family just because you "like/love" a person, especially since if there ever was a relationship, it prolly wouldn't last long. Find someone else.|`|1Df04dWaaa	umm u shouldnt try to get involved with a professor. it just isnt right.  plus hello she is married and has a child. who said she wasnt happy with her husband. leave her alone. your at school to learn.    i agree, dont go ruining peoples lives, plus ur sick in the head too|`|tXlvg1ahaa	She does not "like you" in the way that you are hoping for.  Trust me.  Move on|`|zka26204aa	You can quit acting like an immature high school kid.  Your professor is not interested in you.   1 It is unethical for her to have a relationship with you.   2 She is married and has a child.  Wy could you want to ruin someone's marriage and a little child's life?  You are a selfish person, with a huge imagination.  Leave the woman alone before you cause her and yourself problems.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Ok... You want to get into a relationship with first of all a professor? second of all she is married with a child? I doubt very much you 2 will get together. If it was me and I wanted a long time relationship I find someone who was single. Good Luck!
D2g0XSLTaa	Tell her -  I need to talk to you about something important.  Make sure you are alone and not in a hurry.  I think you are a great girl and I want the best for you.  I'm sorry that I'm telling you this now before Valentine's day and all, but I just don't see us having a future.  I've been feeling this way for a while now and wanted to tell you, but I didn't want to hurt your feelings.  This relationship is not working out for me.  If we could be friends, that would be great - but I understand if you don't like me right now.   Take care of yourself and bye.|`|9P6dCTB6aa	Say that you really like her but maybe you should be friends and forget about the love buisiness. She may be upset but tell her that you don't think it would work you are together anymore. Do it calmly and nicely.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Text her and also the log on connection to this site.  After having read the bad news, she will need our help...|`|4EpynpMraa	well before valentines day, i think you should sit down and talk to her. but it doesnt mean that you two cant still be valentines right? i mean, dont make this one of those lame relationships where you break it off then you two act like you dont even know who the heck each other is anymore, like total strangers. do you just get nervous? i think you two should just go somewhere quiet and talk it over, make sure you let her knoe why youre doing this and dont leave her hanging, make sure she understands. i hope this helped you out, and good luck (:|`|DyuWvcgjaa	dump her. if ur really fed up.  honestly i have the same problem but dont have the heart to do it before valentines day.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	say it's not working out|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi, do you had someone in toe ?  did you slept with her ?  what's the reason for this breakup ?  or can't you wait till V is over ?    i don't know bout you but i would certainly not choose a V day  to break the news.|`|AA12250678	Just get on with it.|`|1gFxxJsBaa	u made 3 attempts and u could'nt that could be cuz.. may be u still like her...think 10000 time before breaking some1's heart|`|JaOddaodaa	TELL HER THAT U ARE A HIV AIDS PATIENT..........OR U HAVE LUKEMIA.................OR LIKE SOME GENITAL PROBLM..........  EITHER U LIE TO HER  OR   GO TO HER, KEEP YOR EYER ON HER AND SAY THE TRUTH.    (NOW U CANT EXPECT THAT U WILL BREAK UP WITH HER AS EASILY U PROPOSED HER, THERE WILL BE SOME CRIES AND SHOUTS, BUT EVERYTHING WILL BE OVER SOON)
mN0DnlYYaa	I think that maybe she is worried about you when you don't call her. if she loves you then she should be she may just work herself up 2 much. when she wants you to go home right away maybe its because its late and wants to go 2 bed but wants to talk 2 you first. if you work a long day every day and don't see each other very often that could be why she gets mad. you don't see each other much and you don't call her when your home i can kinda see why she would be mad.|`|LHzlvfRQaa	I'd say that she is feeling insecure, and needs reassurance that you are committed to her 100%.  Your girlfriend needs constant reassurance that you are devoted to her. If you tell her this repeatedly, then she will feel more confident about your feelings for her. Your girlfriend, won't feel so threatened by not knowing where you are, and not getting a phone call, at the exact same time everyday, if you regularly reassure her that she is the only one for you.|`|CvP4rPliaa	umm idk but maybe she would like to see you make a date at like 12am go sit in a park and talk or somthin idk bro have fun with this 1 yo?|`|y3gDqFobaa	your a guy you can`t understand
ajgC0KPhaa	Why is it unfair?    I'm not agreeing with these guys, but I'm not disagreeing either.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	unless they never had sex either they shouldnt judge|`|mE1HSVTsaa	I honestly dont see why it matters if a girl is a Virgin or not. Unless the guys religious or something!!!    Thanks for the   |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|AA10949589	not true AT ALL.  the one relationship of mine that actually lasted is the one that i married  we are still married and no she wasn't a virgin when we met.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I'm a virgin. My boyfriend says that even if I wasn't he'd still love me, because it helped shape me into the wonderful woman I am now. If the guy really loves you, he will look past your mistakes and see the beauty within. Everyone makes mistakes.... and for those guys who've had sex and then expect their girl to not have are completely low. I'd want my boyfriend to be a virgin like me too, but I wouldn't judge him if he wasn't... again, people make mistakes. My boyfriend isn't virgin and I still love him with all my heart. He's not with that person anymore, he's with me. And while he did give his virginity away to her, she doesn't have him anymore. And he's been sex free since she left him. To me, that's "virgin" enough.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	Seriously if its a short term relationship idc as long as i get to sleep with ya but if i was serious and wanting long term, virginity would be one of the many really long list of factors to consider|`|eT9cRbgFaa	yes it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they ganna run outta virgins one day!!!!!!!!!    i respect guys that are willing to wait for their GF till they ready, but you cant expect all your future GF to be virgins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5QF6n2g7aa	no the virginity is not important otherwise everyone would be very single, yes loosing your virginity is and should be special but after you loose it, is does not mean that you are damaged goods.    i don't agree with them.  x x|`|QdnH6oyMaa	it matters for some guys.. personally i dont care.... cause a woman being a virgin or not doesnt define her character|`|Trps6yyDaa	yes... it is important,   guys r unfare in this...   they want their gf's to lose their virginity towards them but they want a virgin as their partner... this is really mean    i suggest girls must maintain thier limits wit guys n be truthful to their partner who'll be a loving n lasting relationship|`|DyuWvcgjaa	no, i dont agree with them  just cuz u lose ur virginity doesnt mean that ur no good.  godd how can ppl be so backward sometimes.|`|vSAQqGa8aa	yeah total bull s*it! so what they can have there wieners in ten girls get std's and then when they decide that were "pure" enough for them they'll give us the STD. maybe a little to exaggerated but it really is stupid. if they can go out and have "fun" so can I! just be safe.|`|OPSfAK5paa	It's unfair that girls are pressured by society to loose their virginity while boys just want to have a "relationship" with girls who are virgin but in reality what the boys really want is to have sex with a virgin and move on. It's the thrill of being the first at conquest for most boys. Don't play their game. If a boy only wants a virgin, forget about him. She's just a trophy to him anyway.    It's only semi-important when they both are virgins and have spiritual/religious requirements that both partners are. But really, the idea of saving yourself for your true love is its own gift, it also says you are not one of the mindless sheep mating with anything that comes your way. (goes for both male and female)|`|09DE4NG3aa	No one likes to be compared as a lover.  So these guys are loving the fact that when they're with a virgin for the first time, they can't be rated on size, technique, stamina, body type, anything.  No matter what they do, it's fine, because they're going to be the best the girl has ever had by default.  Yes, it's terribly unfair.|`|lFcwzrDFaa	no not really depending on their age groups  the want her first time to be with them and if it isn't she's considered a whore|`|3IXArLJMaa	well.... virginity as a whole (both sides) is important in a relationship.... why? simply because once they have sex, a lot of unnecessary problems and issues would arise... trust me... they do...    take care,  ~daN~|`|RX3U4bw8aa	I was raised in a strict Catholic family and I used to think this was important.    But...    The girl I love now more than anything in the world is divorced with 2 kids.    I grew up and realized that stupid sh-t don't matter. Ya know.|`|WwXaSZZwaa	Virginity matters ONLY when one or more the people are virgins.  Once a person has dispensed with their virginity they can then become comfortable with this aspect of their sexuality.     Being a test pilot that flies a new and untested aircraft for the very first time ever may be very adrenal; but most of us would prefer to be in a time proven aircraft with an highly experienced flight crew.  What I want to convey is that as people mature they come to prefer partners that have already learned what they like and that are already comfortable with their sexuality.      Their are some subcultures particularly within Islamic and Christian communities which prize purity including sexual purity.  But outside of those communities the loss of virginity is merely one of the rights of passage in to maturity which many recall and most realize in hindsight was something that needed to be cast aside eventually. Only hindsight will allow a person to realize if they chose a good time or not to lose their virginity.     At this point in my life if I were to meet someone my age that claimed to still be a virgin I would considder that a red-flag statement and would at first think twice about starting a relationship with them. I would ask them how and why they were still a virgin and weight that information carefully.     I think your guy-freinds comment indicates his immaturity and ignorance and does not reflect the perspective of an enlightened person.
hFlnKsBZaa	Well I can understand his side. Paying off the loan before the interest gets to him. But why can't he get a bus ticket or something if he really wants to see you?|`|KBtDdsNAaa	why are you trippin? he's gotta pay off that loan before it gains interest and then he'd have to pay more. than he'd really never have a car. And if your so worried about him getting one, why dont you get one?
203084e5ea553346cdd3577aa2818652aa	No need to talk it out. Just don't answer if she calls you. Ignore her and above all, do not beg her to keep you. Nothing sadder than a dude begging a girl not to leave. Keep your dignity and treat it like you really were not going together.  Girls like closure. do not let her have it. do not let her tell you reasons or anything like that. she can tell her story walking. next. you date an older girl. girls hat it when you date someone older, more experienced, more mature than them.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	ever heard of     "you're fired"    "you can't fire me. i quit"    dump her before she dumps you|`|pQBjqMkoaa	you let her go    she lost interest|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	I know relationships are hard.

If she's doing this without telling you first she doesn't have much respect for your feelings or others for that matter.

If you still love her, then you should try to impress her/court her again. Perhaps she feels like you don't care? If you actually don't care, then let it happen and walk away.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	You should surprise her and dump her.

Altering one's own behaviour is an alternative route to take.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	He might have some things going on in his life that he is scared to share with you. It takes time to trust someone in a relationship. If it was me I wouldn't talk about what is bothering him. Just be there for him and in time he may open up to you. Now if this has been going one for a long long time there is something wrong. Its not healthy to be in a long term relationship it is good to talk about your problems. Makes a relationship healthy. Not good to keep things from another person.

Good Luck  Lovers Gurus|`|eplmv4nNaa	nothing, just give him some time. dont be overbearing with asking him whats wrong. if its something he wants to share he will. maybe its a family thing and doesnt want anyone to know or maybe he is just needs some time to think and reflect on things|`|AA11565057	It sounds like he's hiding something, perhaps a secret that is painful to him. Is there a pattern in the tpes of things he won't talk about? It may be that some comments you make hit a little close to home for him. That's not at all uncommon, and if he's not comfortable with the issues that have been raised, he may  be unwilling to talk about them. He also may just not want to bother you with his problems :)

We were barefoot on the sand, and about 30 friends and family were there with us.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	In our church, where we grew up and where we met.     And that's where we WILL be married, 8/1/09.    Good luck!|`|WCxzJMnvaa	In England, in a castle. :)|`|7EPLQzueaa	Patagonia|`|8HewQkkoaa	Id rent a whole castle or one of those amazing old manor houses with gardens in Italy in spring. My favorite is called Miramare in the north.  Id fly all my friends and family out there, and have them stay in rooms in the castle.  Id hire full service staff and catering for a week.  Id have the ceremony in the gardens at dusk and then a reception in the ballroom of the castle in the evening.  Then Id arrange for day tours all over italy for the guests, and fabulous meals and parties in the evening for the rest of the week to celebrate.  Then they could all go home, and me and my new husband would travel to Venice to stay in a water front palazzo for a honeymoon for a few more weeks.      It would cost a FORTUNE. but It would make me sooo happy lol|`|7jM9Ghchaa	I do not care as long as you choose the choice will be great my Prince x|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	http://www.visithelsinki.fi/In_English/V...    see that white building in the picture on the top of the page?  there. without any shadow of doubt in my mind      i went to finland right after high school graduation and fell in love with helsinki, esp that building.  i was told they sometimes do weddings there, but the waiting list is years long.  a lot of the music my fiance and i listen to comes from finland, so idealy we would go to helsinki, have our wedding there, then travel around from city to city on our honeymoon going to all the music festivals, like ankkarock, and ruisrock.  it would be so awsome
WzKrZoHQaa	ABSOLUTLEY...........and it is just the best thing.  You know when it happens for sure.   You don't want to be apart for a minute and it takes over yr whole being.  You don't sleep but have masses of new energy, you seem more relaxed and chilled, you make efforts and nothing is too much trouble for either of you.  The sex is just fantastic 11/10 and you just want the world to stop and time be suspended for ever.       Then you marry them .................. oh boy after 6 months things are not the same - you are working harder to get more money to pay the bills (no one spoke of bills and debts before)  he/ she has a nasty annoying little habit that is just aggrevating but do yousay anything for fear of starting a row?   Why can't the clothes on the bedroom floor just find themselves in the wash basket ?    Yes whilst you are happy to go out in a crumpled shirt somehow society still views this as the little woman is not keeping a good house and is therefopre a bad reflection onher skills and abilities.  SO she asks you to take the shirt off so she can iron it - BUT why is she doing this .....and so resentment creeps in.       He'll prang the car and promise to pay for the damage but 8 months later he has still done nothing about it cos it's YOUR car after all ...........................................    I wrote a poem once:    Did you ever love somebody but they didn't love you ?  Did you ever feel like crying and think what good it could do ?  Did you ever look into their eyes and say a little prayer ?  Did you ever look into their heart and wish that you were there ?      Did you ever look into their mind and wonder if they're true?  One moment you are happy the next you are blue    And then it starts you don't know why you worry night & day  You'll find my friend you're losing them I said it would not pay    Love is fine it hurts so much the price is very high   If I could choose between love and death - I think I'd rather die  So when I say don't fall in love, you'll be hurt before it's through  Believe me my friend I ought to know - I fell in love with you.    Basically it is a roller coaster of emotions you just cannot explain - like a moth to a flame - why ?  The moth gets burnt but STILL goes back time after time after time...................|`|AA11366224	Well I've been married for nearly 39 years (engaged for over 40) - I don't think just lust would have kept us together this long.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its great mate been married 30 years now ..so u see what i mean .. its just great mate|`|9inngmg7aa	nope! i am yet to fall in love and quite frankly i anticipate it.|`|YE0baNYRaa	once. im still in love. but im heart broken. u cant force the person to like u .|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	dont think i was inlove maybe i was alittle but i was heart broken he broke my heart and i still think bout him all the time i never wanna be in a relationship ever again or inlove cause love hurts thats the worst feeling is a broken heart =(|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I'm madly in love with the person I've been with off and on for 8 years now.     I thought I'd been in love before, but it wasn't the same at all. And it's pretty difficult to describe.    I like being with him, just being in the same room sitting around is nice. I like doing things with him, if he's sick I'm happy to take care of him.I like doing things for him. He likes doing things for me.  We take care of each other. I can see us getting old together.|`|V4PA9foJaa	Are you in such a state??!!|`|d1a26bdbe60e7f3b4dfb03becde36b2eaa	Cannot be put into words!!|`|ea0e58f47e20d7f5d63cd509e9fda61eaa	no. never. I am 22 and I don't expect it to happen. Then again, Ive always been....how do you say...a little cold.|`|5agXk9ldaa	once and i will never do it again|`|AA11602064	Yes without a doubt, still in love with the person i wanted to be with forever 2, you know when ur in love when u cant imagine your life without them, nothing makes sense and when u lose them its like living in hell everyday!|`|UPmehQwraa	its the happiest I've ever been :) I can't live without him and I want to be with him forever - I can't stand being away from him, I miss him all the time and I always want him to hold me.  If I lost him I don't know what i would do :(
pOCabUMvaa	Marriage is all about communication, I suggest you communicate with her and find out where the hairs are coming from.    They might be yours.|`|EvzEjuOGaa	Strange?? What do you mean?|`|ma6Re8B1aa	are the hairs curley and short?? If so >>theres a good chance she is.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	have faith before concluding things.|`|AA10610878	open ur eyes mate.........  just open as wide as u can, there nothing to be worried abt tho, just use ur head and open ur eyez to find out if theres something really going wrong.    all the best.|`|qIDBrSmnaa	look into to it pal... seriously... its easy, just make sure you don't let her catch on... tell her your leavinf for the weekend... give her the oportunity...|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	I think you could be a little paranoid,but do you have a reason to be?|`|yQ76KKkaaa	it is better u sit and talk to her...suspicion will lead to many other negative things..it is better u rule out that problem..as u find strange hair it might be her friends too..but it is better u tlak to her..or watch and rule out the problem..soon..|`|ZQiwgdRaaa	Hairs on your deodorant? hum, when the heck did that become a sign of cheating?? Do you really think some strange man is coming over doing your wife then using your Hygiene items?? I think NOT.|`|1Bs0sNViaa	I would say just sit down and talk to her and ask her where they are coming from communication is the key here.|`|2AyOIhQXaa	if you keep the deodorant out of places you shouldn't be having it there won't be any strange hairs on it...........only joking|`|IPS3hWweaa	Hmm...    You might be on to something. Next time, make sure they aren't your hairs and then just keep an eye on it. if you are careful not to leave your own hairs and then you see strange hairs, yeah, you know what could be going on.    Make sure your wife doesn't have armpit hair too. I know, she's probably clean but I wanted to cover that, no offense!|`|iblT1HJpaa	Like........dog hair?  Yak hair?  Yeti hair?  Mailman hair?   Hobbit foot hair?|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Maybe it's your domestic worker or your wife???

Also Kylie Minogue and Selma Hayek are famous and beautiful even though they are short. Height doesn't matter, how you use your mind matters!|`|YKXkcfzSaa	Just ignore them & they will just give up coz you're not responding. They will feel silly for themselves. It's like talking to wind & they will just stop one day.|`|mLsP2M0taa	dont let them see that you feel bad about it :)) just ignore the things they say to you. Dont say anything back, LAUGH about it too
m2fH8Fw8aa	Did you ask your dad if he's tried to get her off it? Maybe he did try.    Well, maybe there's a way for you to stage an intervention. Is there any way that you can put her into rehab?    Remind your mom of the person you thought she used to be. Try to figure out why she's on them. Maybe there's a way to stop the pharmicists from filling her order if she's abusing it.     If I were you, I'd go to the doctor's and ask them what you can do. You don't have to use names but let them know you're concerned for someone who is abusing RX drugs. Ask them what you can do and if they know any legal actions you can take.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	It sounds like he is not interested in fighting this problem.  maybe he has tried and has no energy left.

h3s02b3Jaa	I'm so sorry to hear you have lost your dog, especially after having had him/her so long. But i'm sure he/she had a wonderful life with you. Just think of all the good times you had together and nobody can take those wonderful memories from you. Take time to get over your loss.  At 20 you have so much time to find another partner. Again your first split with someone must have been very hard, but i'm sure there is someone very special just waiting to meet you very soon, when you are ready to move on.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Sophie, so very sorry all that had to happen to you. Life can certainly deal us all some crappy hands, we just have to find ways to cope. As for your fiance, well, he's a loser or he never would have treated you like that. It's obvious he didn't love you and even though you feel empty right now, it's better you found out now and not down the road.            I am sorry about your pet. I love my cats and it always hurts when i lose one. Sometimes its very hard to accept, but life is like that and we all have to deal with it. You need to give yourself time to get over that breakup. In the meantime, keep yourself busy, do some volunteer work or join a club or group.     Time heals all wounds and you will be alright. Just don't spend to much time alone ok. And I suggest you get a new pet as soon as you feel up to it. This will help to keep your mind off things. Feel free to email me.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Sorry to hear about that.    The good news for you is youre still very young and you have time to find a new guy. He wasn't the right one and see it as a blessing that he cheated on you now rather than when you were married - because he's obviously a cheater and would you have wanted to marry one?|`|pd5LkFWoaa	I would suggest talking with a counselor to assist you with this difficult transition. You would be suprised at how simple things throughtout the day can get you through. Also you might be going through seasonal depression. Just get some help or find someone to talk to to release the toxic emotions|`|i8EMuPJiaa	My dog died on Tuesday :(   I know it's hard for you!   But you have to think about the good things, it gets your through it!   Think your dog is in a better life now  and all the good things that has happened through the dogs life   and all the amazing times you have spent together!   Etc etc etc  I hope it all gets better x|`|gqQGG9Wiaa	I have had some tough stuff going on my life too, but I cant imagine how you must be feeling! I will pray for you! Do you have a great friend who you can cry on the shoulder of?? I am really sorry that I can't give you any real advise. When i'm down I turn to the Bible, but I don't know whether that would suit you. Sorry. xox|`|DlHfmzaiaa	Maybe you should get another pet, I know that no pet will replace your dog but they might bring a smile to your face and it would give you something to think about x|`|56LJzg3baa	see a therapist|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	im sorry for your losses i can talk to u if u like  over the net if u want to|`|58b39836778b4f8ccc1d94c29b22f1b0aa	Some things have ended. You feel empty because they are gone but it is necessary for you to have a bit of time. You need to grieve for the things that are gone. That is your job now, to get on with getting over this. The fact your fiance cheated on you shows his feelings for you were weak, that is why he's moved on so easily. The positive side to that is that you escaped being married to the a55 hole. Your poor dog had to go sometime and 11 years is a good long time to have a fabulous life with a girl who loved him. He had it really good there. Look for the positive and then move yourself on to the next thing. It might not be a relationship, it could be a job, some studies or anything.   Good luck
rT4Lq54Baa	It's probably because texts show actual proof that the conversation existed. I hate to tell you this but if he's asking you that sort of stuff and you answer it, he's probably running to his friends and showing off the new chick he's gonna get with.  Be careful about him...|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Yes to both questions. He's just uncomfortable doing it on the phone because he's not sure how the conversation will go. And he also may be a big perv, but all guys (and a lot of girls!) have a little bit of perv in them, yeah?
9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	total turn OFF that sh*t creeps me out|`|qwVruoJ8aa	it depends what kind of sport she plays i don't mind if she plays softball or tennis other sport that don't think so i would be glad to come the games and watch her play of course if she is good looking|`|P58Vjq71aa	It depends on the girl and sport. Like tennis is good however lacrosse is bad.|`|vNzc4RnAaa	how is that a turnoff|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	Depends on the sport. Football, basketball, etc, would be kind of weird. Just because those sports are really rough and you need a lot of muscle and what not to do well at them. I play professional badminton though and women who play that can still be sexy while being competitive. So it's definitely not a turn off. In fact I wish more played cause then they'd be easier to meet and have something in common.
qLvhoRpsaa	Hey LadyE,  You are one of my faves on YA! I am sorry to hear you find yourself in this situation. If I may give some input on your situation, I would be more than happy to. First of, you are newly married, but now also newly pregnant. I am 43 and my two daughters are now 17 years and almost 16 years. My husband and I separated years ago but we did manage to remain friends and co-parent the girls together. I only tell you that so you know that I have some experience and age to go with this. I understand you are unhappy with some things such as the division of money and feel you are pulling more than your share of the bills. Your hubby goes out and gets drunk, weekly or whatever and does not find that a problem. Now you find yourself 7 weeks pregnant. Congratulations, by the way. I would just take really good self and your unborn child and if you are not living together, let it stay that way until after the baby is born. You don't need the stress of this things while you are carrying a precious baby that needs you to be in good health, low stress and eating well and taking vitamins and office visits. Please do not make a decision in regards to your marriage until after you baby is born. Right now, just stay apart. If he wants to come and visit, take you to dinners, doctor visits, whatever, fine, but you come first. If after you have had your baby, and you and he finally have a real deep conversation about anything (after the baby, he will change too even if he thinks he won't) and only after looking into every avenue of trying to make it work and get across your needs to him and he will not meet that then I would suggest looking into getting a divorce. Please do not make that decision right now. You will be thinking more clear than ever once that baby is here. Good Luck honey and if you want to chat, message me. Good luck and have a healthy pregnancy. Peace:) Joanne aka Canadian Diva|`|fi3HRxABaa	lean on your friends for emotional support but yeah um id cut my losses and run. you kid shouldnt be brought up in a home where his or her father isnt repectable enough to be around.    i mean your basically living alone now right? i mean its okay to go out now and then with the boys, he's stressed he needs space just like you need time alone but he's married, i can see going out maybe once a month or every like 2 weeks. but with a baby on the way, he's days or partying are over!!! i cant imagine living in a different place then my hubby.id just put my foot down, say i wont take this...ytell him he's to immature to be a husband. then go after him for support for that little one on the way. you need to look out for you and not deal with his stupidity adding stess to you while you are preggers.|`|OFxayUOIaa	Well, unless he can manage to change his ways, theirs no point carrying him on your back along with a child, i would say divorce, unless he changes|`|u84hPxW1aa	He sounds like the kind of guy that jumped into marriage and really was not ready. Also, he sounds extremely immature. You do not need this. You should definitely get a divorce. He's not being responsible and he sounds so immature. He does not care, and it doesn't seem like he will. I'm sorry darling. Congratulations on the pregnancy. At least you'll have a baby that you can share unconditional love with. He can help pay your bills when you go for child support...or maybe he'll snap out of this when you file divorce. It'll show him you're serious.    Take care!|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	Just think of the responsibility you are going to be faced with when your baby is born.  If you can't handle this situation now, don't think it's going to get better for you unless he starts doing his part in everything.  Are you going to be able to pay all these things and support a baby?      I would sit him down and give him an altimatum.  He has to grow up and take responsibility or get out.  Soon you both are going to be responsible for a new life - really to start out like this - it's only going down hill from here.|`|9VaWal2Daa	welll where to begin.  First off, I suppose I should say not all guys are like that........being a guy and all.  You are either ready for the responsibility of fatherhood or you are NOT.     and a guy that goes out and gets drunk, lives apart from his wife of less than a YEAR (????)......and doesn't seem too interested in even spilitting the bills fairly..........Geeeeeesshhhh,   see this is what gives guys a bad name.    If you are pregnant, (and congrats by the way, kids are great!)   then this clown is either ready to buckle down and get serious, or he is more interested in drinking with his buddies.     It doesn't sound like, from your BRIEF description, that he really gives a rats azz about anything other than himself.  Not exactly stellar material here.     Having said that.......raising kids alone is no joke either......do you have any other nearby support?  Mother, sister? whatever? .......    Bottom line is......now that you are about to become the parent......is HE finished being the kid?     If not.....then you will have TWO kids to take care......your baby and him.     Think long and hard on that, and ask yourself......is he HELPING or HURTING. ?   You sound like you already know the answer to that.     Sit him down, lay it out, and give him one more chance.     If he blows ya off......there's your answer.  It won't change.  Dump him.   If he promises to change, but then comes home drunk next week, dump him.   Words are a dime a dozen.   ACTIONS.   Judge by actions, not WORDS.   Drunks can spin the prettiest words, and they mean nothing.  Settle for nothing less than clear cut ACTIONS.     Best of luck to ya.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Yes, divorce him now.  He has already abandoned you.  It is not going to get any better.  A baby is only going to add more stress to this bad relationship.  Change the locks, get a roommate to pay 1/2 the bills and concentrate on making a beautiful life for you and the baby.    Why did you marry this guy?|`|4twWhKgmaa	sit him down and talk to him about the issues. if he still doesnt respond in a way you want him to, then i suggest divorce. although it is more complicated as you are pregnant|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	i have to agree with Steph,he is too immmature and doesn't deserve you in my  opinion,honey if my hueband left and we were living apart and only married for nine months I would tell him to go to hell and just leave me alone period. and just lean on family and friends for your support,and let him go once you begin not to like him ..then it's time to move on...
wNKleK4Uaa	Its normal to feel like that. There's nothing wrong with having a set of standards you'd like your potential girlfriend to meet. What you described as your perfect girlfriend doesn't sound at all picky - I don't think there's anything wrong with knowing what you want in a girl and what you want out of a relationship. I think its good. You sound committed and ready to treat a girlfriend with respect and love, what's wrong with that? I'm sure you'll meet your ideal girl sooner or later, the key is to be patient and open minded. I'm sure it will happen for you someday.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Yes its normal to thinks these things, but as to will you meet her and when, who knows.  Good luck|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Ideal...you'll probably think you've found your ideal girl many times. Then after the excitement is over and she isn't who u thought she was she will change from ideal to hit the wheel.|`|hFsl7WpPaa	Sounds like the perfect woman.    You will only meet them in the right place, you aren't going to find her in a nightclub or pub. Join some sort of club, take up a sport.    You will meet her, but she wont come to find you? Get out there and stop worrying.|`|rfGgMitkaa	well..you're 17...one day you will think of things in a totally different way...and u would find yourself even atracted to people that you actually hate being inlove with..but when that day comes..just..remember..that one day far away..you had a dream..and you shouldn't let go of it..  mmm..it's not hard to find a girl like that..but usually she is got to be young..because..believe me..by time...with work stress and other crisis..a lamb would become a tiger...  and as for the drinking and partying part..i dunno where u live exactly..but reserved people..religious people usually don't do drinking and stuff...  good luck...oh oh and one more thing... you would love those people who let you be yourself..and nothing but yourself...|`|VVk0hHgpaa	It'll all come in good time!  Things happen when they're meant to. Be patient.|`|YE0baNYRaa	u will meet her soon. have patience.|`|hN08l7tLaa	you'll be able to meet her soon! dont worry|`|6Ei4mn6naa	Wait another 5 years and ask yourself the same question.  Gd luck|`|ubf26k2Oaa	There is your perfect girl out there somewhere...but let life take its course and you will meet her, there's no rush.  Make sure you go places and do things that are likely to put you in touch with the sort of girl you like...eg. college, not nightclubs lol|`|CL6aPgljaa	I'm sure there are plenty of girls like that! there's always someone for everyone. i haven't had a boyfriend for ages, I'm sure there will be  someone like that out there... and yes it is normal (it's called love) good luck x
INpHxTyZaa	Talk to him about it maybe he doesn't realise what he is even doing. Maybe he was just exciting about getting his new flat and wanted to christen it and was still doing stuff the the flat.     Maybe he just wants you as a **** buddy but if your going out offically then it doesnt seem that was otherwise he wouldnt have asked you out so just talk to him and tell him that you want that affection that your missing etc|`|z5hrgF45aa	he only wants  a f  buddy. dump him
6HNdZqnGaa	wow hes a dick..sounds like hes useing u|`|TMi1GhSHaa	ya talk to him definitly about it and how you feel. I dont get why you left though, why didnt u stay.. did you even say bye to him? i dont get it.. i would of stayed and cuddled with him lol.. just cause he is drinking beer doesnt mean he cant cuddle with you. Maybe your just paranoid he doesnt like you from the beggining.. hmm .. well thats just my take on things anyways, definitly try talking to him and see whats really up.|`|QaT680QHaa	(((Hugs))) Im so sorry. Sounds like he wants to be an ex-boyfriend  Have you talked with him about it?|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	hes just using you for sex girrrrl. you should discuss with him what he wants from your realtionship, sex or companionship/romance etc.. sounds like hes a jerk and you could find someone out there so much better, not every guys like that trust me (: just need to find one that  appreciates you|`|3wFt9fyZaa	Well.....you did spend time together, just not how you hoped.  If you have not guessed, you are just a piece of booty.  Its up to you to either change that, or accept it.|`|TV3aH15kaa	he did it cuz that's what he was after. he just wanted the sex and thought you were easy|`|RXiDcg8Waa	u im   did spend time    not quality time  though just his  christning hisflat imafraid|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Well I don't understand why you left? Did he make you? Otherwise you should of sat down with him and watched a movie or tv.|`|dalNxu8zaa	hmm i dont think that is right|`|8MbbY0Tbaa	First off i just wanna say sorry to hear your dealing with a guy like that. I would say talk to him about it and see what he has to say cuz i could never picture doing that to my gf or wife or what not.Good luck with everything tho.|`|sZePlWTQaa	A lot of times guys don't want to show that connection/affection after sex. It scares them that you might start suffocating them in the relationship. Don't feel bad. A lot of guys do that-no cuddling, etc. After time I think he will as you two get closer.|`|PQ2SOk49aa	Hey, its nothing you did wrong that could have prevented him from treating you this way. I've had experiences with guys like this before, especially one in particular, and it makes me feel bad too. But you have to remember one thing, guys never know what they want. they see things differently. you should try not to over analyze anything if that helps. but If it keeps happening then you should try to talk to him about it. if he cares at all for you, he will listen and change how he treats you. i hope I helped you a little :) feel better!|`|UtrgRjTeaa	It sounds like he's not particularly attentive to your feelings or your needs. You need some affection and attention after sex, and he's never really given it to you.    If, in general, this guy seems eager to please you, then he probably doesn't realize he's hurting you this way. Talk to him and let him know that you need to feel respected and loved like this.    If he's not interested in giving you the affection you need, dump him! Find a guy who cares about your feelings and will show you how much you mean to him. Guys who cuddle after sex are definitely out there -- I'm one of them.    Good luck!|`|bE6ulnRUaa	yeah, why did you leave? it sounds like hes using you for sex, but idn you both got it on right away so your control of your sexual side wanted it too...maybe you should hold out on him, and drag out if any feelings he my have for you- this way your not so hurt once the deed is done. REMEMBER YOU GOT THE CONTROL-  or you can have very quick sex and treat him as he did you-but to have quickie sex keep clothes on, once done be like "ok then ima go have a drink with my other friends" (keeping attention to hes mode change)|`|hl6Xmd8eaa	You should tell him how you feel. Maybe hes just one of those layed back guys who dont really notice whats wrong unless you tell them. And if that does not work then he is an asshole and not worth your time just dump him.|`|y65a48yuaa	kick him to the kerb. hes got one thing his mind .sorry its not you in less your in his bed?|`|6ef6abf769b9dbdf78d8eaea822e3733aa	I know this can be tough (seriously, I'm not being sarcastic), but you should tell him how you feel. Trying to rely on non-verbal communication can have very frustrating results. He might accuse you of being too needy or something, but he needs to know how you feel ... and you should know how he feels too. If things don't get any better after that, it's a sign that your relationship isn't working out and you should move on.
AA11395970	Expect life to go on as it is.    You need to think this through hard and long.  What happens when you go into labor and he is called to work?  Your child's first school play and he has the lead and daddy can't be there?  Missed wedding anniversaries, family holidays, birthdays, and all the other important events in your life.  Being at home alone night after night.  Taking responsibility for the maintenance of the house, the bills, the kids' medical care, etc., etc., etc.    He is not going to change.  He loves his job.  He loves you, too, but he expects you to understand.    And when he is home, he'll probably want the guys to come over and watch the game with him or play cards or go out and shoot some hoops.    You need to decide what you want...as much of him as he is willing to give or a man who will be there for you all the time.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Granddaughter is marrying a cop too and I have told her the same thing. You just have to grow up and deal with it. While he wasn't an officer my husband was an over the road truck driver, gone sometimes a week or more at the time.  I raised 3 kids, have repaired my own car and handled a ton of other things during the 43 years we were married. It is a mindset on your part. If you are a simpering have to have someone to lean on type person I would advise against marrying anything other than the local hardware store clerk or accountant (except at tax time of course, they work long hours then).  If you are strong, can stand on your own feet, address problems and solve them without leaning on a man, then go for it, they are great when they are around and the memories are wonderful.  I have rushed the laundry, gone to things alone, driven myself to hospital to deliver, and baby sat refrigerated trailers, all in the name of "hot loads" The choice is yours, strong and self sufficient or a leaner? You  hopefully know yourself better than we do. Good luck with your choice.|`|AA11603468	You did ask this yesterday, and maybe you didn't get answers you liked, but there is just no reason to think it would be any different because you're married. Unless he changes jobs, he's subject to being on call like that, and those calls must take precedence over having dinner with you, I'm afraid.    While he might be the greatest guy who ever lived, if you cannot be happy with his work demands, he probably isn't the right man for you to marry. I'm not saying he isn't, because I don't know you, but if you honestly can't live with this situation, then you can't live with it.  In his line of work, I'm sure he feels pretty stressed at times, and he surely wouldn't be able to live with you putting him on a guilt trip for having to dash out of the restaurant or whatever.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	don't expect more and find any thing to do when he is not with you
zdpp7cubaa	If he continues with that line of work then yes, it will probably always be like that. I think it is kind of hard on the spouse of anyone who has a dangerous occupation whether it be in law enforcement or another field simply because most days your partner is in potentially life threatening situations. Personally, I do not know if I could handle something like that, I think you have to be a very strong person mentally, I am a bit of a worrier myself. I think you just have to hope for the best, but also prepare yourself for the worst. Do the two of you plan on having children? I think that would be the hardest aspect of that for me because if he were to be killed after the two of you have children, your children would be left without a father. I'm not sure if I would let my spouse keep a job like that after we were to have children.|`|FzFSzilmaa	SWAT is a very dangerous profession... he could get shot (injured) or killed in that job...    so prepare for the worst.. :D|`|IKXZZDH9aa	He loves his career, and usually it's difficult for some one to stop doing what they love. I was in the military for 8 years. I LOVED everything about it, and miss it terribly. Then I realized how much of my family I was missing, and made a hard choice and got out.    I have my regrets because it was my passion to serve my country, to travel seeking out those that wanted to harm our country and dispose of them...but there is NOTHING in the world more precious and perfect than walking through the door and your little girls running and screaming towards you, as if you've been gone forever.    He eventually will have to make a choice when you start a family if he starts missing a lot of time as I did. Maybe his schedule will improve over time, and he'll move up in rank where he won't be bothered as much. Just know and completely understand what you're getting into...as this could be the way things are for the next 20-30 years.
Oae9mimmaa	shes just being sympathetic.  you should go.its polite,and i think u need to talk about her to her sister.sounds like she needs to hear it too.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't understand. sounds like she is just being nice and nothing more.|`|BZ8Rlp9uaa	Um, this is a weird question?   It sounds like she is just trying to comfort you and be nice.|`|KLFVEUtGaa	I don't know.... Yeah,  I just think she is being nice and trying to help you out that's all.  She understands what you are feeling obviously, and understands what it must be doing to you, and just wants to help out, that's all.  Hope I helped out, and sorry for what you are having to go through.|`|YE0baNYRaa	she is being an angel to you . accept her invitation . dont try n think so hard.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	There is no dilemma she is just keeping in contact with you don't think she wants anything from you|`|5Z0m3x4haa	hmm, do u wish to go? :)   personally i don't think there's any morale issue here.   Correct me if i'm wrong, since u r asking this question means ur heart is already telling u to go.     Follow your heart~|`|E4LzHrJEaa	gi and shag the heck out of her.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	She might be concerned for your welfare after your loss (I'm sorry too), & she also might like you.  Just take things slowly & see where things lead. Take care.
qWF36Ujaaa	well just ask him if he wants to go out and have fun but not like a date or anything like watch a movie and maybe the scene will help and maybe things will just happen and you guys start making out..i mean it worked for me me and my guy friend went to his house sat on his couch and started watching a movie next thing i no hes asking me if i want to make out and we did......and the next day we were still friends and we werent going out...|`|HinnghHTaa	don't turn your head when he goes to kiss you....  maybe. lol.            sorry i'm a dick, but it was necessary. lol.|`|iSAs1RWFaa	I agree with that EnisainWonderland girl. And to the other girl that answered this, they did. and Dominique is a pansy.
wLv4NCV7aa	Well, it depends on the woman.  Some women it takes a long time for them to do that.  But, it is more of a moment in my personal opinion for you two together if you do it at the same time, especially if you are doing it while looking into each others eyes.|`|iPQoY4M0aa	When it comes to sex, it's generally hard not to come before she does. If you do, then go again or do something else so that she does.     If it's any other sexual activity, she usually comes first. There are times where she comes a number of times before the attention shifts to me.|`|7a57027e46cab12b9f8953e22c90edb7aa	A real man makes it last.|`|Y9e4vK9Taa	My husband always waits until I climax.... but sometimes he waits so long he can't climax at all.... so if he dint finish, im not satisfied... so it was all for nothing.   Its so much better when we both "orgasm"|`|dwuJt06qaa	Considering a lot of women actually can't orgasm from penetration alone (or at least have a very difficult time with it), I think it's best as a general rule to get her off orally first, and then for the second go round, go with penetration.  That way you're both going to get off at least once either way.|`|UYRgG59Naa	Honestly when it comes to sex, I'm all about the other's pleasure. I prefer to make them orgasm multiple times beforehand through foreplay and the like. Though It would be really nice to come at the same time. It seems really romantic to me.
GLlZMUBUaa	Yes.    It would help, but its not the only thing.    It would help but her hygiene would be important too.
Bwosoy7jaa	Just go with your heart man. If you really like this girl then ask her out. The worst that could happen is that she could tell you no and she just wants to be friends cause she doesn't want to ruin what you have. Then if you can live with that then just be friends but if you can't then tell her you don't wanna be friends, you want to take her out on a date. You gotta have confidence, girls like that, trust me.    PS.  If you manage to land that date go to these website.  www.cupidsreviews.com/article/The-Perf...  www.bspcn.com/2008/09/30/50-rules-to-b...       Good Luck|`|oKEkKhd4aa	Tell her yourself how you feel.  Tell her that it could maybe work out and tell her you could still go back to being friends if the relationship does not work out.  Also, tell her that you could be a really good boyfriend|`|8BVEoMBraa	NOPE I GOT NOTHIN. HAHA SUCKERRR!|`|AA12221397	Ahhhh. I guess I would tell her that I want to be more than friends, and that you would understand that she is scared but. Dude it's a chance you have to take plus your really young. Go with the Guts
r8ozJABSaa	i feel the same about a guy     but i stoped chatting with him and it works cuz i learned to 4get him more and more each day|`|p6Pv6ioOaa	Maybe she thinks you're joking.  Especially if you've tricked her in the past.  There's nothing worse than replying to something like that in the affirmative, only to have the other person say they were just kidding.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	you need to tell her exactly what you said here. tell her you feel like she is acting like nothing happened and that it rips your heart out not to know how she feels. she may not know how she feels about it and until she can figure it out she still wants to be close to you. I wouldn't over react, play it cool and things will probably work out.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think you have decide if you want to keep her as a friend.|`|5r48jn7iaa	the fact that she hasn't said anything back yet means she doesn't feel the same. if she did then she would have said it right after you did.
vn2Lq7hIaa	Sounds like everyone you've sacked has been in a place with a  bathroom.That's a big difference from a tent, a truck, the beach, or on the boat. I'm a nature lover, can you tell. No bathrooms, but the girls might excuse themselves temporarily to dab on some Ky, and who knows, maybe they have a pee too.Whatever, it doesn't bother me, and I don't ask.        I hope you solve the restroom mystery !    Good Luck    God Bless|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It's just one of those things... I pee before I leave the house and I pee before I have sex - just in case... don't want to be half way when you suddenly get the urge to pee.... I don't do it all the time, but I have done it. When I don't know the guy very well yet I also tend to freshen up at the same time....|`|Scupj6XVaa	maybe she's "freshening up"?  i dunno. i dont always use the bathroom before my man and i sleep together|`|NqMmvvgVaa	To pee probably. if she already needs to go then sex won't be very comfortable as there will be a lot of pressure on her bladder. It also can make it harder for a girl to have an orgasm if she needs to pee. Other than that, it is also healthier for a girl to pee before and after sex to reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection.|`|OE8r1VtRaa	ITS TO FIX THEIR HAIR AND MAKE UP AND MAKE SURE THEY DONT SMELL OR LOOK UNAPPEALING LOL.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	I did it once but just to pee. Maybe she is taking Birth Control Pills.|`|YE0baNYRaa	i know many who do that. they want to make that intimate moment special and pleasurable for the partner as well .so they fix their hair,add a little bit of lipgloss, re do their make up, apply some perfumes, get their dress proper etc. i hope u got it
dDSuBQURaa	Boys are stupid! Just move away from him so he won't bother you again. If he keeps on doing this, just talk to him about your concern. If he still does this, talk to the instructor. You are there to learn--not to be bothered by other students! End the problems as soon as possible, so you can focus on your study more.
Bl9u2e73aa	he could like you but if you're good friends he probably enjoys talking to you. maybe has a little crush     or maybeee he's just a player?|`|0pX1oQAJaa	has he had relations with you? like kissing, etc?   remember though... he has a gf... so, don't get too attached, until the gf is out of the picture.. have him come to you. there's so much to be said, message me if you wanna talk about it. i'm pretty good with relationship stuff.      mz_individuality@yahoo.com|`|3325a2162fb81b6dcd62281b3f7a6677aa	Why do you call the other women whores? Or are you saying that because you really like him?. Either way it sounds like he likes you or the thought of you wanting to talk to him. If he is confident in other women and doesn't seem that confident in you, then it seems like he considers you a challenge (which men love) so play hard to get but not to hard and flirt with him every now and then to help build his self esteem eventually he'll ask you out. Why do you say he's weird though?|`|AA12240948	Be careful. Sounds like trouble. Good luck. God bless.
c534219f52edbcbf0ed54e53501afdebaa	Yes I would ask him out if I were you. You never know what a good thing you have until it's gone. Then all you willbe left with is a broken heart and damn regrets. If you like him as much as you say you do just GO FOR IT you just never know! :) Happy early birthday by the way! :))))))|`|6HNdZqnGaa	dont lose somthing good|`|H7fUC8ILaa	Well first happy almost birthday!  ummm...yes i think you should ask him out  before someone else does|`|StILqPsxaa	Ya i defintley ask him out i asked out my bf and he and me have been going out for two months and are perfect for each other.|`|Xprsabo9aa	Thats kinda a messed up thing to do
erZLmlluaa	Congratulations, Mom!!!      You guys rock--I will keep thinking about ideas for you two.    Love you.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	I agree on the candlelit dinner thing, but if you don't feel up to preparing this yourself, you could see if you can get an outside caterer (some will do meals for 2) to prepare a sumptuous and gluten free dinner for you both. That way, you get the benefit of the cosy dinner a deux, but you don't have to wear yourself out cooking it first.    Is there a friend you can trust to set everything up for the dinner for you? Get them to come round on the quiet and sneak them in the back door or something. Tell your husband he needs to dress up as you are going out, and dress up yourself. Then go out to the car, have him drive round the block (or to a high point where you can both look at the moon for a while) and arrive back at home - where the table has been set for you, and the candles are ready for you to light (keep a box of matches handy).    The rest of the evening is up to you to work out, but I would suggest a bottle of wine, an open fire if that's possible, and a movie. Popcorn is optional.|`|lohDhzRzaa	just make some food in yur house and watch a couple of movies|`|rLk2w03gaa	Here are a few ideas off the top of my head:    Why don't you fix him a special/fancy dinner compatible with his diet, serve it at a candle-lit table, and present him with his present, then watch a good romantic movie together.      Have a party.  Invite your family over to share this special occasion.  Watch old home movies, serve food hubby can eat.    Send hubby a singing telegram in a public place.  Does he still work?  Does he hang out at the local cafe?      Attend a theater performance, go to a comedy club and drink juice or soda (you don't have to drink alcohol), look in the paper or on the internet for unique things to do, like attend a murder mystery fundraiser dinner for some worthy organization.    Good luck, and congratulations on making it that long!|`|c8618f07576acf7f0719396bada43c4baa	well since you know what he can and cant have can you make him a special dinner something he loves to have saand make it a nice night at home get a movie vhe likes|`|TPhIWWniaa	I hope one day I can say I've been married 32 years, you don't hear about that anymore so CONGRATULATIONS!!!    My suggestions would be to make a beautiful and romantic candlelit dinner at home (since you know better than anyone what he can or can't eat), scatter rose petals all over the table, after that go dancing in your living room to music that was played at your wedding perhaps or just plain old romantic music (Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Diana Krall for starters).  You can also take him to a play or musical after your dinner, check your local papers to see what is going on that weekend.    Have a wonderful time & Enjoy!!!
0Id85yiYaa	i don't know how it got complicated? good question. you just grew apart and didn't get back together. keep in mind that men are different creatures when they want something. do you really think he'll be this loving when you 2 get married? just something to think about...|`|UNZuciedaa	i didn't bother to read the question...if you're asking the question i already know the answer.  you're stupid|`|OCdJ38EQaa	aww hunny, go get him. you both seem to love each other so much. i wouldnt even think twice about it. im in a relationship with my boyfriend of two years and hes my first love. im in teenager but i would be the happiest person alive if i could marry him later on in the future. talk to your ex's mom. please :) and good luck! i hope you two get together again|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Home wrecker!!  Your being stupid, he will not leave his wife.  He is only saying this stuff because he knows that your hurt by him getting married.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	I would tell him to get his life straightened out, then give you a call. Of course he tells you his wife is mean & bitchy, what else would you expect him to say about her? The bottom line is, he's got to have some kind of feelings for her or he wouldn't have married her in the first place. If he is truly getting a divorce, then great, go for it. But if his story changes or the "divorce" starts dragging out, I would be very leery.|`|tPMNAFbsaa	WOW. You gonna brake this marriage. Hopefully you can live with the guilt that comes after that.|`|W9zJwOAaaa	I think you need to be careful sweetie..I would wait until the divorce is final to see how serious he is and see where things go from there...Talk is cheap..lets see if he can walk the walk...    Good Luck girl|`|Yleae8hiaa	First of all, I don't think you have a right to call his wife names. Do you even know her? And if she is the way you describe, why did he even marry her in the first place?   My thought is this: If you moved back to town before they even got married and you two love each other as much as you say you do, then he would have never married her. Yes, there would have been some broken hearts, but the pain is going to be deeper with a divorce. How much pain do you think there's going be if anyone finds out you two slept together the night before their wedding? Neither one of you was thinking at all. If you to really want to be together, then he should get a divorce. But be prepared for some major heat. Worse heat then if he would have stopped the wedding. And you also need to be prepared, because you are going to be seen as a home wrecker. And you will probably be called names that will hurt. And you best bet is just to keep your mouth shut. Because if the roles were reversed you would more and likely feel the same way his wife is going to feel. Plus the fact, how would you feel knowing someone married you and you didn't have their whole heart, that he loved someone else?|`|kHEeipm8aa	get over him move on it will be hard but you have to get on with  your life just remember this is a big world and there are millions  of men so stop beating your self up over one    good luck.
h2OOcyNOaa	Lol it depends on the two people kissing, im sure allot of people would say that there kissing style changes with each person they date, i know my kissing isn't always the same due to the people iv kissed.|`|2hAuIg5baa	what???|`|shvhgzXeaa	You can kiss a partner many ways but its knowing how the partner wants to be kissed that makes you a good kisser. If you like being kissed outside the lips then that's your deal.|`|rOtfBBEYaa	Woah! Outside the lips!?  Kinda weird...o_o|`|dKCoyvMSaa	would make them a bad kisser, but its down to the person there kissing|`|B1lPJWTdaa	Dude kissing isnt like colouring in
7sivs9y2aa	just ask her to hang out sometime. even if she doesnt like you, you should go for it anyways.|`|wE2etBzbaa	yes make a move.  don't move your hips though.    just talk to her more and be with her, later you may ask her out|`|xHPBzfuSaa	try to get to know her. anyway you told us that you both are shy. so being the guy that you are be the to make the first move. make way to get to know her better. goodluck
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	oftentimes when people marry they have expectations and desires, and think that their life will be a good  one, and they will be happy in life, but they didn't get to know the man that well, and he begins to show disrespect, he begins to treat her badly. so it changes how things might have been. just get to know her, look closely at her past, and how she treated others, find out about her upbringing, and desires in life. find out if she has a strong belief in god, it doesn't happen to everyone, some people have wonderful marriages.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	The only women that grow into this type of shrew are the ones married to complete incompetent jerks.  Since your dad ended up like this, you may want to invest in your future by finding a better way.  You can read books on relationships for free at the local library.  You can change your destiny by creating a better man in yourself.  A little look in the mirror doesn't hurt anyone, man or woman!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	OH NO??? We would never think your taking a stab at woman???? Because you guys are so much better then we ever will be???And of course your not saying that it's always the womans fault??? NO NO?? Why would we ever think that???  Sounds to me as you have your sh*t together????????????????????????????????...|`|CKQtOusTaa	i just think women get angry because they get left with the kids all day to take care of them pooing screaming etc.|`|ZQiwgdRaaa	No that is not how all women are and for every action there is a reaction. If you treat a woman poorly then she is going to react in a way less then positive towards you...same as a man would. Act like a child after she has children and she will treat you as such and lose respect for you as a man....because lets fact it no woman wants a immature punk in her bed she wants a man and a responsible one at that.  I hate to say it but there are a lot of women out there who do not understand men and therefore end up nagging and bitching at them to death until there is little left of his manhood...I suggest staying away from those types of women.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Wow... yeah right. You need to grow up a little before you get married if you really think that's what it's like. Maybe that's how it was in your family, but not mine.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	There are always hope.  Not everyone's marriage turns out like that.  You can't start out with an attitude of expecting the worse and expect your marriage to work.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Not all women get that way . men treat women that way to it is not just women who do that.   If you treat her good and with respect and stand by her you will be fine.   I got that way with my ex cause he became an abusive drunk. he would call me nasty names and he would grab my by my throat and shove me against the wall and he had punched me in the back of my neck.i worked longer hours then him and i did all the house work and yard work and i had to shove the snow from driveway after working 12 to 13 hours a day. I am married to a wonderful man now . I do not treat him that way.  I lost my job. so i do all the house work , In the summer i do all the lawn mowing. I help shovel snow in the winter.  i give my husband a guy time he goes to a friends house once a week and sometimes one night on the weekend.  i treat my wonderful husband i am married to now the same way he treats me. with lots of respect and i take care of him when he is sick just like he does me..   my parents are still married and they do not treat each Other bad. my mom never cheated on my dad but he cheated on her. get your facts right.!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Because once married set with children and afer X years of marriage they are entiteld. It means your happiness is not important. You stay she gets all the money, you go, she gets all the money, she throws you out, she gets all the muuhneey.|`|dnFpyyMSaa	Yes, yes they do.|`|H1uTMdY7aa	its just stress about getting married, having kids. starting a different life style. It will all get better if you give it time. and not ALL ppl go through that.|`|LWEAUWxkaa	You can never take her for granted. You have to treat her 5, 10, 20+ years from now just like you do now. Buy her cards, pick flowers, do special things for her randomly.    If you wait until Valentines Day, Birthday, Christmas etc.. to get her a card, she will realize that it's the only time you think of her romantically. Take her face in your hands EVERY DAY, (even when kids come along) look deeply into her beautiful eyes and tell her how beautiful she is to you and how much you love her.    Turn the ballgame off when she calls you. You can get the score anytime. NOTHING I mean absolutely NOTHING is as important and compliments and attention to your wife.    Bottom line is if you get boring in your relationship. Somebody else will fill in the gaps that you leave open. IE: If you don't tell your wife that you're proud of her or she's beautiful etc. When somebody else does, she's REALLY gonna like it ;)    Believe me, I know :(|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Well to answer your question it doesnt happen to all women.I am happily married for many years now and if i do become cold or angry it is not because of my husband.He brings out the best in me.There are other circumstances i am sure that happen in those womens lives to make them that way its not just because they got married.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Everything you've said here is horse$hit.   That's like asking do all men cheat after they get married?  Girls look at their mommies too and think I'll never be married to   someone like him either!|`|KOYZfaDkaa	I think happy wives have more proactive husbands. Women need support to get through life, and I don't think a lot of husbands are prepared to give it. If you're lucky enough to find a woman to marry someday, remember to help her around the house, with the kids, listen to her. We just want to know that we're loved and supported emotionally.|`|znvx2NMQaa	yeah they do.|`|dDasUgW8aa	I don't think so- no.  Some women take a man for granted a bit after marriage- as do men with women- you just have to keep up the spark and the romance.  Realize that the other person has feelings and is still human, especially after marriage, and still has needs as well.    So don't generalize.  Maybe talk to your significant other about it BEFORE marriage.|`|TOSeJQJnaa	Unfortunately, due to the lack of understanding that men and women have for each other, these relationship difficulties will continue.  Men and women in relationships are not acting according to the laws of nature, but instead seek out solely the fulfillment of their own desires.      We go into our relationships with fantasies of how our lives will be made better through our partners.  What happens instead is that we start to see the flaws in our partners and how these flaws are taking away not only our fantasies, but our ability to have our desires fulfilled.  Men and women need to have an understanding of what a relationship really means and how to operate within it from a spiritual standpoint in order to make it work.    I have included a couple of links which explain this.    Best wishes to you
2hAuIg5baa	go shopping with her and go for a coffee, then get some lunch, then go to an amusment park, or a picnic, or an art museum, or something, try spend the whole day with her to break the ice and get to know her|`|hN08l7tLaa	take her to the amusement park.|`|DyuWvcgjaa	picnic on the beach. amazingly romantic :) |`|iYSYLUa1aa	Why don't u cook at your place   and get her some rosess she'll think your  really romantic   coz I think that's a great idea   she'll love it!|`|dDSuBQURaa	Don't be so cheap! If you can't take her to dinner, then she will assume that you are cheap or dirt poor. You don't have to take her to somewhere expensive--just to a place where you two can eat and then catch a movie!    Why don't you ask her where she likes to go? She might like to see something at a museum or go to an outdoor market place. Hey, you may never know if she suggests a car show that you can check out. I like going to classic car show just to check out the Pontiac GTOs and Corvettes.    Find out what her interests are and you will know a bit more about her.|`|hFsl7WpPaa	Ice skating, falling over and picking each other up. Collapsing on the ice in a fit of giggles will.... break the ice?|`|AA11636892	Beach would be a wonderful place... wat do u think?|`|sARTaNLNaa	Hmmm.... some nice exibition, or go bowling. or go shopping with her.|`|TCcfYPSlaa	I think an amusment park would be amazing.  you guys can have fun and laugh without anything getting awkward.  And later you guys should go for ice-cream.  After a friendship is built you guys can get to know each other.  have a quiet moment and kiss!|`|M7SyJZr5aa	dude.. get reaaly drunk and reaaly naked. only good will come from this.     buy alcohol, it wont be awkward trust me.|`|kIblsxJQaa	It would only be a really awkward silent dinner if you make it that way.  Dinner everytime.

Too many people misrepresent themselves online.

It happens to every online relationship or friendship. The excitement of a new friend or potential boyfriend will fade and vice versa for him. I've seen it happen a million times.|`|3TsO2UWRaa	what if he's 50 o.0 ??    just don't get to relationship close, thatsall i guess|`|za9b8cHKaa	Yeah, I talk to guys on the internet all the time. It doesn't necessarily mean that I want to marry them or anything like that, they are just people I enjoy talking to.|`|0pX1oQAJaa	aaaah! i don't like the concept of chat rooms at all. i mean it'd be different if he knew some of your friends, etc. now the only sure thing to do is create an aim acoun (i'm sure you know what that is, aim instant messenger) now, if he doesnt have a webcam, get him to get one, since you guys are such great friends and all, and you get one too, they're fairly cheap. now, on aim they have a thing called video on the bottom (no it doesnt record you) but it is a webcam so you can see if he is legitly his age or really a 59 year old.. anyway, now that that's out of the way, if he refuses to get one, or makes up excuses, that'd be fishy, because they're cheap and EASSSY to use. then if he does, just drop it, and try to not talk to him as much. it's so much easier to say stuff on the computer than it is in person... remember that, and trust me on this, i know it's true... it's happened to me, i got a sweet talker, and in person, yaaa they aren't that great. oh and that brings me on my other topic. if you guys ever decide to meet up.. BRING A FRIEND and make it in a PUBLIC place, where you choose, not him. because if he does, and you dont know the area, then you're screwed because you could be on a wild goose chase and he could lead you somewhere and take advantage of you. i know he may sound too nice to do that, but people have bipolar, or multi personalities, you just odn't know what they might do.. they seem nice when they're talkng to you, but how are they when you're not there/not talking to them? there's a lot to risk with this, but that also goes with people you know in person. that's why they always say hang out in public until you're comfortable to be alone.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	There's a guy I started talking to online about 7 years ago. Years later, we're still friends and we keep in touch. However, he's the only person from 7 years ago that I'm still in touch with. You can build lasting friendships on the internet, it does happen. But, if anything starts to seem fishy or if he does anything to make you feel uncomfortable, cut him off. Along with my good friend, I've had a few bad ones too.|`|mXQfvvHBaa	This is tricky .If u do meet him be careful cause you never know wat his true intentions are|`|jZlLzRziaa	well   if you really like him just   be yourself and forget what  other thinks>>>>(:|`|ubf26k2Oaa	Yes, I've met really great guys online...I even ended up living with one guy.

This will do..|`|AA12240948	You are fine. Have fun with it. Just be careful.
j7l9gavRaa	i think everyone should test it out before tying the knot    i also think everyone should have sex before marriage for the same reason|`|ld1vh7nHaa	i think that is a personal choice to be made between 2 people.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I don't think it's a bad idea. I would probably do it.    I think it depends on the people. Some people just won't for whatever reason, and that's ok too.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	Yes I agree that it would be a good Idea if a couple lives together first to see if that is the lifestyle that they want and to settle down With that ONE person.  definitely would bring down the divorce rate.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	An old saying...........No rings=No strings. I think it's a good idea, that way if it don't work you don't help the lawyers get rich|`|LxvA4vGpaa	For me personally, I am glad that I lived with my husband before marriage. It gave me an opportunity to really see if I could live with him.  There is a big difference between dating and living together.  I have also lived with an ex...and if it wasn't for the fact that we did live together, we probably would have gotten married and since I don't believe in divorce, I would be one miserable cookie right now.       But to be honest, this is something that is not right for everyone.  Not everyone believes in it and not everyone approves of it.  If it isn't, then don't, but if it is, then go for it.  I am not going to judge someone for not doing it and I hope that they wouldn't judge me for doing it.  It is a personal opinion and something that needs to be addressed as that.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	If the reason your moving into together is to test whether or not your compatible...then you are doing it for the wrong reasons.      People get married because they love each other beyond surface issues; not because they make good roommates.     Look at this way...     Once upon a time I had a fiance I swear I loved to death. Well she moved in on 28 Nov and got asked to leave by Dec 31st of the same year. Obviously, that situation didn't work out too well.     My wife now initially moved in and within months we were heading down the drain. Luckily, we were married (which is a lot harder to get out of than dating) and because of it realized it's worth and that everything worth holding onto is a work in progress... We have now been married for 3yrs and I can't even imagine breathing without her. I love her so much, and I honestly do not believe I would of found that out if we would of lived together before marriage, but hey, that's my story.|`|FzFSzilmaa	living together helps you work out if you could live together when married...|`|CzNe9yooaa	I think you should.  You can never really know what someone is like until you live with them and know whether you can really mesh together.  Otherwise, you may end up with many surprises that could really impact your relationship.|`|AA12014379	I think you should definatly have a taste of a period of time living together see how eachothe work, maybe youll see how you both do things in the home, and its possible if you dont you will argue when you do marry cause tehres alot about each otehr you dont know, you dont have to litteraly move in maybe a couple of days a week in each others house will do it, as soon as its regular you will see how it works, good luck :)|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	yes i think they should live together b4 hand u can see who each other really are and not the person they show  so yes live together b4 hand is my answer|`|3ywVS2JEaa	i don't know about living together,,that depends on religious views of each individual persons,,but certainly date a loooooong time,,,before marriage.....?!|`|T6nvpX6zaa	The facts actually provide the answer on this one.  People who live together before marriage have a HIGHER divorce rate than those who do not.  That means you are more likely to divorce if you live together before marriage.    Why?  The evidence isn't totally conclusive as to the cause.  However, to quote the link I've provided, "Numerous empirical studies indicate that living together does not produce healthier, happier marriages, but the contrary. Mature love is built on the security of knowing that your love is exclusive and permanent."    Not just exclusive, but permanent - there is a different level of security that comes from that!|`|dtHjJah5aa	No I don't.  I lived with my ex-husband over a year before I married him and we still ended up divorced.  The thing is, it's like dating, one or the other will put their best forward to convince the other that they are genuine in their love and will always be the person that the other fell in love with.  The problem is, that once we got married, he totally turned into a possessive, cheating, lying, abusive idiot.  He never acted like that when we were just living together...but he felt marriage meant I had to put up with that crap.  And the other reason I don't believe you should live with someone is because the Bible tells us that it is a sin against God to 'know' someone until they are married.  I know that I have committed a sin against God...but thankfully, He is a forgiving God.  Good luck....I hope this answers your question.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I do.  There is no proof that says it lowers the divorce rate.  That really depends on so many other factors.  However I think it is a huge adjustment.  You learn things you never knew when you live together.  And if one of those is just a huge deal breaker, it's better to know beforehand than afterwards.    I definitely think it gives you a better idea of what you are getting into.  Especially if you have never attended college.  Living with any roommate is a huge adjustment and if you've never done it, compromise over space is just not something you've done before.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	By that rationale, marriage could just go by the way side. Live with someone and if it doesn't work out, leave? Why would anyone ever need to get married then?|`|0gOWh0z2aa	The divorce rate is higher for those who have lived together prior to marriage.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	I am sure you will reeive mixed andswers on this. 50/50    Dont you test drive a car bfore you buy it? Even if you are seeing someone for a while...sleep over here and there...you dont live together...its different.    I don't know though. I was put in this predicament once. I invited her to move in...we had 3 kids...12 years later are now going through a divorce. (She cheated and left me and the kids)     Marraige shows you are truly commited to that person...but it can be the biggest headache too once it fails. 50% fail today. Its a sad statistic. And she lived with me before we got married.     I dont know what to think about this but from my personal expirience...I may try not living together the next time.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	TESTING IT OUT DOES NOT MEAN LIVING TOGETHER..although it works  for some people i think it is a pacifier for marriage and the commitment it takes to  stay together...|`|RYCMFLMuaa	Yes u need to see if u can get alone ok.. u need to have a lot of sex also ...|`|bXyTCsDyaa	No.
be792f37a8b46e5492b6149c6f330751aa	Its always been a religious thing, stay true to your one partner in life and have that 'special bond'. But people like to wait for 'the one'. It pretty much never works that way though!    Do what you feel is best... If you like a person, and want to have sex with them, do it! But be careful.|`|0n6CZA32aa	Virginity is not dignity but its lack of opportunity...Thats for a start!! (by the way i disagree!!)But it depends on how u value urself..n also culture and traditions also play a role...N its true..Its special in its own way!|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	Well virginity all has to do with that little thing a woman has inside herself which is called the hymen or cherry.. or whatever.  Someone saves it so they're married lover can break it. Seems a bit odd as a ritual, but many religions do it and so do other people.  I did it for myself and for some reason people were really surprised and almost looking at me as if I were a magical creature that walked out of some crazy book. But dang! Everyone was having sex WAY before me when I was in middle school towards highschool, until I was 17.  But whatever. People do it for someone special and not just for anyone that asks. I wanted it to be with someone I cared for.|`|eqiVdFrraa	its special because its a gift. Being a female is a gift and so is finding someone whose perfect for you. People in high school don't know what love really is, and get their hearts broken all the time. Having sex is not as casual and simple as society and the media make it out ot be. its beautiful and intimate and to throw it away on someone who may or may not be the one is a waste of the most precious gift you have to offer a guy.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Virginity today means very little to girls or boys for that matter and it seems to be something to be got rid of as quickly as possible. Thats very sad.  Being a virgin means you have not had sex with just anyone and that you value who you give your feelings too. If you dont think that much of yourself then go ahead and give it to the next boy you date, but if you dont want to come across as s l a g g y and easy, and ready to drop your knickers for anyone then hold on to what is important to you.  When you mature and grow a little with your feelings then you will realise that saving yourself for the love of your life will mean something to not only you but to your man as well.  He will respect that you never slept around and that you have pride in yourself, he will trust you more and you will make him feel more special then you could ever imagine. Making love for the first time with someone you truly love and who loves you back is the most amazing feeling imaginable, sex today has no meaning for most kids but ultimately its the one precious thing you can give the man you love, its like a gift to him and you give it because you know he deserves it.  Most girls end up a statistic and either pregnant or disillusioned with love and men because for girls love is emotional and for most men and certainly all boys its physical. It wont mean a thing to them if you sleep around, it makes it a lot easier for them to get into your knickers, but if you hold yourself higher than other girls and wait for the right man they will be more interested in you as you are a challenge to them.  Dont give it away until you are old enough to know what love is, sex is not a quick fumble with the boy you are dating, its a mindblowing experience when you are with someone you love.|`|jLmtqrMmaa	Because once you start having sex, you don't usually stop.     Sex brings a lot of complications to life ... good and bad.  It makes relationships more intense and brings a whole new set of worries to the table.     Plus, your first sexual experience can give you an impression of what sexual intimacy is like. For girls especially, it can be very painful and frightening.  If you start with the wrong partner, it can take a while for the negative impression to leave.|`|RPpXarDDaa	it something that you can only give away once, some women don't get that pleasure. some have it taken away.    it is special because you are sharing your body with someone and not just anyone should be able to enter into you|`|zokJMPBAaa	you already answered your own question|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Virginity is a choice that I made consciously to protect myself from not just disease or unwanted pregnancy...it also protects me from losing a part of myself to just any person.  I value myself too much to just have sex with random ppl or ppl I am talking to.  I want to save myself until marriage honestly.  I am 23 going on 24 and been a virgin.  I am happy with that.  Why have sex with someone you dont love or care about or be with someone intimately that does not love or care about you? People need to value themselves more than just that.  I dont want to just have sex because I'm bored or horny.  I want to have a very memorable and pleasing experience making love with someone I cherish and honor.  On my wedding night. Thats just me, I dont knock anyone who doesnt wait or anything thats just my choice.     Many of my friends who are NOT virgins (including my bf) often saythey wish they would have waited to have sex at least until they fell in love.  I waited to almost 24, I would have been had sex if thats all that interest me and its very accessible to me if I wanted it but all the drama involved turns me off.  I simply deserve more! I want love and I dont feel I need sex to find love.  Many ppl have it twisted these days thinking its the other way around.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I can't see the reason myself.|`|rQrwAS2aaa	I am a virgin not by choice. I can't help it that girls don't like me more than a friend. They just want to be friends with me.|`|FzFSzilmaa	some people think sex is something special and "saving it for marriage" is a spiritual thing...    personally, i couldn't care less... and wouldn't have anything to do with the "save it for marriage" freaks...|`|AA12014379	Depends really, having sex for the first time should be with somone you like and care for, its somthing you share, and like somone already said you can only give it away once ;)|`|87d4tt6Raa	Ive heard it put like this:  A you grow up you have this 'gift' (virginity) thats very special, its something that once used, or lost gets 'spots', and 'dirty'. When you get married, and you go to give your husband your 'gift' its all nasty, and used, but he goes to give you his (which was never 'used') and his is pure, and beautiful. Some pep dont really care, but if you truly love your husband, you will want to give him the best possible gift you have.    Anyways, thats just how some pep explain it.
pLGMqqBFaa	he likes you  he just doesnt know what to do  tell him you really like him and would like to be more than just friends and take it from there|`|vNzc4RnAaa	heeee prolly likes you|`|3GZPbkbQaa	I'd say you have a love hate relationship going on. If you want something more with him, make it happen.     I've been in a similar situation. Go about it something like..      You: "So what are your plans for this weekend?"   (And if he says nothing, proceed with)   You: "Good, then meet me at the movie theater at 6:30 on friday. If you're late, I'm picking the movie."     something like that.
m2fH8Fw8aa	It is abuse. While it isn't physical you are being deprived of essential needs. You need to speak to your school counselor.

Levi jeans with a nice bum and straightish hair.     I'd love to be asked out at the beach or something romantic like that.   I don't understand the last bit, but if you mean you lied about your age, I think that I would forgive you if your cute. :)  x|`|n49caa5Vaa	eh, shut ur face        PERV!|`|PliIXKdIaa	my type of guy is someone who is funny and can make me laugh (you can't beat that, really!), someone who can protect you but doesn't have to but likes to if you know what i mean, height doesn't really bother me as long as he is taller than me as i'm a wee short *** at 5 foot 2.    perfect place to be asked out, well i'm not really sure to be honest as long as some random person didn't run after me in the street and say hey fancy a date i think i would be pretty creep ed out! and a good place to take a girl is out for something to eat, doesn't have to be fancy just a good place to take someone to get to know them better and see what you have in com men.    for the age thing i would have to say DON'T LIE about it, you don't have to tell her how old you are Straight away, that can come into conversation later on, but if she asks you tell her the truth. I'm only 17 coming up 18 and i've been out with guys much much older than me cause i'm pretty mature as well but they knew my age and they accepted it. so if you like a girl don't start a friendship or a relationship based on lies it will end bad and if you can lie about age what else can you lie about?    plus i'm guessing your pretty young so just have fun go wild, you have plenty of time (and partying) until you need to settle down, that's they way i'm viewing my life right now!    good luck anyway :)

This will surely make him appreciate you if he is not really looking for sex and really loves you. He will surely be ready to wait if he truly loves you. If he stops meeting you then he never loved you and was just looking for sex
NqMmvvgVaa	I can understand where you are coming from, you were just trying to point out the positives in his life to try to get him to stop moping.   He needs to realise, it is ok to have problems and feel sad sometimes, but you cant continually put that pressure on the people around you. If you be a sad sack all the time and don't bother ever doing anything about it, then you cant expect people to want to be around you much. Its sad, but it is part of how it is in this self reliant world.   I remember once early in my relationship with my boyfriend I was being very mopey and kept telling him how horrible my life is. I was living in my own self pitty. Eventually he got fed up with it and told me he didn't like seeing me drowning in my own sorrow all of the time and that he was with me because he wanted to have a good time with me, not to sit around moping. And honestly, that helped me snap out of it, I realised how selfish I was being by constantly using him to vent about all the things I was sad about. And it also helped me to start seeing the positive things.|`|rLFmDQezaa	Some people don't want to hear about the good things in their life when they're feeling down. It's simply a case of self-pitty and he wants you to feel sorry for him... for whatever reason. Just try to tell him that everything will be ok and whatever, but don't offer your advise unless he asks for it.     Now if you can't be like "it's ok" all of the time and it gets overwhelming for you... try talking to his parents. There may be more going on than anyone knows about and he may need to talk to a professional.|`|n7hezV5aaa	But you did comfort him. Perhaps he is really self centered and the fact that you brought yourself as an example bothered him, but I don't see why he would get mad. He sounds like a really pessimistic person. If things are going well right now, there's no need for him to be thinking about when things are going to get bad again. That's not a good way to look at life. The good moments in life are so few that we should cherish them, not ignore them and think: "Hm...I wonder when things are gonna get shi*ty again..."|`|op4gBJRJaa	No, your not ridiculous helping someone out is always the best thing.  If he thinks he has a bad life then tell him to shut up and think about the people in Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe they're the ones living on less than $3 US a day, he gets a car and a apartment those people would have to save up all there money for over 20 years plus they have to feed them selves.    I used to think i had a bad life until i realized that what was actually happening in those countries was a disgrace.    Tell your boyfriend to think twice    Hope this helps|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It`s soo cruel to ruin a perfectly good pity party!    But, yes, you were correct.   Because giving advice is also a form of comforting.    If he does not like that, then he does not want the problems solved, but wants to keep them as excuses.|`|WHN5cuGZaa	Sounds like he only wanted you to listen to him.. but it is still strange of him to react that way towards you... Whatever he is going threw he is not handeling it well... You are not ridiculous for trying to help him the only way you can... he needs to realize you are the one who will be there when he needs you instead of pushing you away.|`|AA12333135	This is an awkward one because if that is what he wanted then he should have said in the first place and he didn't. You gave him the best advice but he has almost rejected it but I would give him time men do not like to be told. He will come around even if he does not admit you were right. Sorry is only said by a great person who does not mind admitting it.|`|xVyj3qNQaa	No it wasn't wrong, and believe me, if a friend said exactly what u said, to me, i would feel very comforted. It was very nice of you and maybe some day he will reflect on your words and be grateful for what he has. If you think that he will get angry if you give him advice, then just comfort him by saying that everything will be ok and nothing stays bad forever.   Good Luck.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	I think what you said was very right in trying to help him cheer up, but for some reason, thats not what he wanted to hear.  He sounds a needy person who, perhaps likes attention and wallowing in his own self-pity?  Maybe, though, its more serious and he is depressed and needs some kind of medical help...? Its hard to tell without knowing him...hope this helps :)|`|hFsl7WpPaa	Some people don't want advice, maybe he has depression or anxiety problems.    I myself am a taurus, strong and single minded, when my gf starts complaining (about work usually) i offer advice, this is seen as lecturing, there is the potential for argument, but given time she stops being pig headed and realises I spoke the truth.    It wont stop, but you will both learn how to deal with it better.    If it seriously affects his day to day life, he should see a doctor.    Just because his parents give him the money, does not mean they give him the love and support to believe in himself. Plus living such a sheltered life has obviously not prepared him for the harsh realities of the REAL world.
8xVGuEDkaa	so this guy has a girlfriend that cares about him, and puts up with his constant self pity parties, has parents that are basically paying for everything for him, and STILL complains and GETS MAD at said great girlfriend?    dump the boy, get a man.|`|gWoZYpX6aa	I do understand that you were trying to comfort him, and it sounds like you genuinely meant to help him, but sometimes when we format things the way you did it can come out sounding like the complete opposite.    When I share my problems with somebody, often times I am not looking for advice or a motivational speech, but for justification. Someone telling me that my problems are real and that I have valid feelings about them can make me feel one hundred percent better. Often I get frustrated when people try to solve my problems instead of just acknowledging them. This could be part of the motivation behind his resistance.    Also, it really doesn't help when someone is upset to tell them how bad things are in your life. All that does is make it sound like you are turning the conversation over to be about you and your life instead of their problem at hand. Throwing out all of the things he has that you don't can sound like you are trying to one-up him in a way when it comes to things going wrong in your life. In the future, try to focus on his problem first before elaborating onto your own or telling him what he has that you don't. This does the opposite of justifying his feelings. Instead it makes him feel like he is stupid for being upset.     Sometimes relationships can be extremely frustrating when communication becomes misconstrued. If I were you I would chalk this up to a misunderstanding and comfort your man by telling him that its okay for him to feel the way he does. It sounds like that's what he is looking for.     I wish you the best of luck in this and future squalls.

Just tell him you want to break up, that it's not working out for you - you don't even have to explain your decision to him (although, if you're feeling generous, you could).

It should be easy to tell him this and yes i would separate immediately ... give yourself some time to heal and see what happens also dont insist on keeping the ring .. if you stay apart... just get rid of everything you got from him... of course if he has your virginity that you may have given him unless you gave it to someone else than you will just have to forget about that... but just tell him like it is... living with someone is not a good idea... you gave him yourself before he gave himself to you... no committment ... if a person marries someone like him then an annulment could be granted... depending upon the circumstances... its a relationship starting on a shaky foundation|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	You left out the part about him moving from a different state, only having 1/2 the rent money and no job.

Yes, you should tell him your feelings have changed. Let him know his lack of honesty from the beginning has left a bad taste in your mouth.    Call it off immediately! Give him the ring back and tell him it's over.  I would have sensed something was wrong if he proposed so soon...and even gave you a ring!  (Many abusive men do this, you know. It's one of the classic signs...)    We should never get married if we are not 100% convinced that this is the person we cannot live without.

Y7sio6Yhaa	o hunny i know how you feel. there have been 2 guys in my life that i just did not have the best judgement on and even though logically i knew i was stupid i just could not do wat i know i needed to, which was cut off all communication with them. if u really do want him back your ONLY shot at that is to tell him wat's best for you is to not talk to him and let yourself move on, because ur always gonna want more. but deep down know that that doesnt mean it'll never happen again, in fact u talking to him all the time is giving him reason to not get back together, he needs to miss you and see wat his life is like without you before he'll ever see a reason to be with you again. he prolly still loves you and i really think it could happen again because that's wat happened with my first long term bf, he broke up with me after 3 years and i kept talking to him n talking to him and it wasn't till i forced myself to take him outta my life that less tahn a couple months later he was begging ME back. i'm not saying that will necessarily happen, but it's your only shot. and if it doesnt work at least you wont have him around keeping your feelings for him strong, i promise eventually you'll move on. but remember it's a long life, and who knows wat the future holds. that's wat always got me through those hard times with boys, knowing that just because we're not together today right now, whos to say that 5 years from now we wont be in different places, nothing is set in stone. maybe u could just take advantage of this time to do the things that you couldn't do while u were in a relationship, take a class in something do things you think would be fun.. enrich your life and then when he or some other guys comes along they'll see how much more you have to offer and they'll want to be apart of your interesting life. seriously after just 2 months of not talking to him cold turkey you'll feel tremendously better, it's like quitting a drug you just gotta take it one day at a time. and although it seems like it's been since september it really hasnt cuz u still talk to the guy. so make the time count i say. i hope this helped but i dont know that it will cuz once again there's nothing anybody could've said to me that could've made the ache in my heart go away, it's just something i had to learn through trying and trying and hurting myself soo much to the point where i just had to do wat was best for me and taht was moving on.|`|V4PA9foJaa	You will make a good novelist, you have immense talent!!!

dKi2R2oHaa	Probably     But I'm sure that there is adult material on sale involving twins, etc.  I know the BBFC won't pass anything encouranging abusive relationships, but I'm less sure about consentual.     Incest is covered in England by the Sexual offence act 2003, but European law may take precedence and allow greater freedom. I'm not sure what the current situation is.  Scottish law is a mess, but tends to be more draconian than English Law on Sexual Offences.     It seems to me that prosecution and stiff sentencing are unlikely, as it is difficult to see what the public interest arguement would be.    Incest is illegal for three reasons. Firstly because of the hazard to any offspring. Second to prevent abuse through any power relationship with the familly. Thirdly because politicians will always trying and be moral guardians whether it is appropriate or not.    Napoleon abolished the incest laws in France and I believe that siblings are even allowed to marry in Sweeden.    Freud's ascertion that we would all be sleeping with our relatives given half the chance is not accepted by modern researchers.  The reality is that familarity breeds contempt between siblings. Experiments have shown time and again that they tend to show no sexual interest in each other when unsupervised.  A problem does arise when children have been seperated at birth and form relationships in later life.    James Roffee has been award a 50th anniversary scholarship to study "Consensual adult Incest and the Eurapean court of Human Rights" at the University of Liecester Law School, but you will need to wait a couple of years for his findings.

If you wear something different you will stand out against the crowd and it creates a better chance of him noticing you.     I would go to the club, have a good time and make sure you don't spend the whole night staring at him! Wait until he notices you and comes over to say hi, that way it's like a casual bump into each other and you can see where it goes. You could drop in hints during the conversations of things you will be doing over the next few weeks and see if he accidentally turns up to any of them :)     Good luck x

Just let him know that that was not ok. Do you two kiss often? If so he probably didn't think nothing about it and just did it. It's a natural genetic chemistry in men to act before thinking (not really a fact), so just talk to him, tell him that you know he's young, but it's not ok (if it's not) and that if he did it again you would talk to your mom about it. Don't go directly to his mom, he'll lose trust in you. Let your mom do that.|`|34ruM1eDaa	If everything is normal, I think you should let it go. I think your cousin was somewhere else, mentally. If something happens again, then be sure to take an action. Doesnt sound like anything serious from what you say. I wouldnt worry if I were you (:    good luck!|`|77FNePxFaa	Well you are grown, I don't necessarily think you have to tell your parents, but I do think if the two of you were close you should talk to him about what happened and then go from there.|`|u9QCrynDaa	Well...you're 33 years old. I know you're asking for advice, but if you're not from a religion that accepts french kissing between relatives as normal, than what your cousin did is not normal.  I would say he's feeling some attraction for you, and you as well at some level, because if not you'd have had a reaction: I mean if you're here asking for advice there's a part of you that enjoyed that kiss.  So just be honest about it...and remember that he's your cousin and some things could not be fair in family, so be really careful; I suggest both to find another person for those things...there are so many people in this world, why just making things complicate?|`|PEny7qbTaa	c if u r really felt discomfort abt it then u wll not ask 4 a advice jst u will give him a tight slap but u dint do this that means u have gone some disturbances, anyhow this thing happend long ago sooo its not the right time 4 u to warn himself r reweal this to his family ewen after a long period.ok  leave that thing nd if he made this again then as a matured women give him a tight slap complaint abt him .moreover this time i hope u dont post this again nd wait 4 a right answer.ok.|`|OKvqRBGMaa	...you keep asking the same old question...EVERYDAY!!!!!!!  omg|`|lsFcvd32aa	this question has been asked some 50 times.... ugh........|`|oXOcZIeNaa	Well, I would be shocked I guess... Maybe he's gay?  It's a little bit disgusting anyway, it's your family!!|`|UyYoxd3waa	LMAO! Hey, me and my female cousins went at it like rabbits, but it was more like 13, 14 years of age. What can I say, we were young, really Curious and keepin it in the family!  Yeah I know, we was sick puppies...but were all still real close and laugh about it when it comes up amongst us.|`|4AbXxowTaa	Sounds like a good Jerry Springer dilemma.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	You've asked this question so many times! Either forget about it or pursue a relationship, whatever.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	ewwwwwwwwwww.|`|wE2etBzbaa	I know this story, you have posted it many many times.    Do you post that everytime he kisses you?  if so,  tell your mom quickly.|`|59HXAtRHaa	Woah!!!   Did u like it???    Ahhh just kinda forget about it..  sweep it under the rug b/c it'll most probably explode into this family war...    If ur that concerend about it..  ask him y he did that..  maybe hes n2 older ladiies and finds u attractive??
scUqnbNJaa	You know why the hate you? Because you are so much better than them (C'mon its true! You probably don't judge them and attack them because of what stuff they have!).     I think you mum probably spoils you just a little because of your dad dying and she feels sad.    If they are really your friends they should feel sorry because your dad died. Geez. They are so slack!    I wrote this list of what true friends are. See if they are your true friends!    True Friends..    - Care for you.  - Listen to everything when you are sad and down in the dumps.  - Help you out with all your problems.  - Can always cheer you up, no matter what.  - Are never judgmental of anything you do.  - Never make you feel left out.  - Don't brag about anything they've done which you haven't or things they have and you don't.  - Never snob you.        Hey, see the bright side of all this. If they aren't your friends anymore, they won't be able to use your stuff!! Hahah! :)      Hope I helped you honey!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	I lost my mom last January.  I took care of her and was there when she passed.  She left me some $.  I invested most of it and then I decided to spend some of it.  My mom would have wanted that.  I quit my job and went traveling.  I bought myself new clothes, jewelry, laptop, camera, etc.  I have nice car.    The economy is so bad and so many of my friends can't even pay their bills.  I helped so many of them with car payments, rent, phone bills.  When I wanted to go out, I always paid.  They started resenting me BIG TIME.  One "friend" tried to rob me.  She had no remorse and said she wouldn't have missed it, she has everything.      The one thing that no one realizes is that I don't have everything.  I don't have my Mom anymore.  She was amazing.  She was the one person I could always count on in this world.  So many times when I went shopping or traveling, it was running away from the grief and pain of losing her.  I had to do something, anything...and if you got $, you can do some fun things, eat some great food, buy nice things.  I'd give it all away for just one more day with my Mom.    These people that talk about me, putting me down - when all I did was try to help them or go out and have a good time.  They are mean.  They don't know me.  They might think that they do.  People will be jealous of your material possessions because they think that is what is important.  Things.  They don't know the most precious things in your life are people that love you.        I'm sorry you are going through this too.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	simple answer - laugh at them and say "maybe you peasants are right"    True answer - there are vain people everywhere and someone somewhere will always be jealous or envious of someone else.    Im not in the same position as you but i know people that are and im happy for them.    they have it so let them live with it.    Dont hate.|`|PJSCDoaraa	they are sooo jealous of you. dont worry, they just obviously think you are WAY cooler than them. just as long as you dont boast, i dont see why they are jealous.  screw them, make some new friends!|`|X2bVdsfUaa	im not gonna lie. That made no sense.     BUT i will try to cheer you up with the best knowledge ever    Why should you care what other people think of you?  seriously if their really your friends do you think they'd leave you just because ur busy and going through rough times?    no...their not...your better off without them and you can get better friends...besides your 14 you got the rest of your life ahead of ya
AA11821715	They need to share, i guess it makes them feel better when they talk about it...|`|iblT1HJpaa	I find it amazing that after all this time you still don't understand the heart of a woman!   Women crave intimacy! Women desire relationship! And for 99% of women, this comes from COMMUNICATION! (for men - it comes from sex) (('nother story))  It's not that women NEED to say 10,000 words a day. It's how they find out the condition of the world around them.   You know - Women and from Venus, Men are from Mars (John Grey) is not a lot of phooey. It's the absolute truth. As a man, you need to find the strength to come into the presence of a woman and give her the time that she needs to TALK!!!!!!!!!      (I'll tell you secret. ((no one else read this)) When you come to give your woman all the talk she needs - you will get all the sex you can take!)|`|F4d89iRMaa	okay, you're in a marriage and what do you do in a marriage besides have sex? SHARE A LIFE!! DUH! Sharing your life with someone means doing daily things together and that also means VENTING to one another! You have feelings and your wife has feelings; angry, mad, sad, happy, wouldn't you want to tell her your day too?!?!! I would hate to be married to you, lol! No offense =p|`|a984cQjKaa	i know us women are supposed to be there for our husbands,  but do you men really think we care about having sex with you as often as you want it?    why do you feel the need to poke us?  most women have no intention to sexually harrass their husbands all the time!    it's not like we really care about your sexual gratification.      see how stupid that sounds when it's turned around?    if you listen to us, we feel closer to you and it makes us want to have sex with you.  isn't that incentive enough?   next time you're not getting any, you'll know why.|`|AA10176537	hellooooooooooooooo    this is what part of marriage is. About sharing your problems and the things that bother you with someone you love and loves you back. Sometimes lending an ear is more important than actually changing or fixing something that can't be changed or fixed.|`|05ST0VH4aa	sometimes women stress relief requires more stress..      ok. i got too tired to finish my answer but here we go.. after reading everyones of course. i'm going to pretend that the rest of you who answer this in a upset manner.. have absolutely no problems with the relationship. if you say no, i don't get along 100% do to him/her whatever floats ya boat.. then you just an idiot for telling this dude off for being a jerk.. and if you say yes.. you get along 100% then. you are a liar too.. you know that feeling when the spouse does something you get annoyed about. but you really don't say anything about it? that's a problem. rather you like it or not. thats life. and love is just a fantasy overrated. i'm better off alone. and trust me. i'm having alot of fun. no stress. no unhappiness. no depression. i'm always happy. i'm like a cat.. i'm gone with the wind. and go my own way. and lead..|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	Because they can and if you want your life to go miserably wrong, don't sit there and act like your not listening.  Because you asked this question, shows that you know what you better/have to do, gotta love "husbands" they are so attentive and concerned (better sit there).  :-)    God Bless.|`|lvelp0CGaa	WOW and I thought I had issues , you must be the only guy out there who comes home from work and does NOT unload his issues at work to his wife or your just a jerk who is bored and has nothing better to ask I pity your wife either way .|`|Rl2VamIRaa	Tell me why it is in the beginning men hang onto every word we have to say but or at least act like they do but when they have us they do a 180?  Women like to talk it is what we do,its how we get out point across other then with holding sex(which I do not know why women do that?) But I will tell you that the women who with holds it gets their way a lot quicker! But thats a different subject all together.Anyways stop being selfish and listen to her if you would unload and open up you might find you get extra special things,,,,who knows even an ever lasting marriage go figure!!!!|`|eCs32xBTaa	A Husband is just like a best friend, telling them everything doesn't meant to change or fix everything..but at least we have someone to talk and make us feel better.     I know that some of men don't tell their wife about whats going on in their life, they don't like to share it bcoz they think nothing will be change even if they tell their wife about it.     So, whether u want to tell or no,its up to u..who care anyway..but for women,they tell their husband bcoz they appreciate their husband not just as a husband but as a best friends in  their life.|`|rsb6rEouaa	Because when you are in a relationship that is what happens. You share each others feeling, thoughts, good or bad. Get used to it.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	Because we're obviously under the false impression that you actually care about us.  That as human beings you can muster up the compassion to hear us out.  Not because we want you to f'ix it' but because we want you to care.  Which is obviously our shortcoming to think that men are capable of thinking about anyone but themselves.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Whether they will admit it or not, many women don't really want to work outside of their home.  But for some ridiculous reason they believe it makes them a better person/parent if they go out everyday and work.    So, for that group of women, perhaps they are complaining because they are just unhappy and would prefer to quit their jobs and stay at home.|`|9tf9VF9naa	it depends. i am the type who loves to share everything with my husband (good or bad). Luckily he loves to hear all of it. he himself is a chatterbox. so its not a problem for us.     we have every intention of unloading because women dont  forget things easily.     No, its not that we want / expect you to change or fix our bad days. its just opening up or sharing (good or bad ) with the one you love. hope you got your answer.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Wow, I'm so glad you're not my husband !|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hate to tell you mate it goes both ways, my OH does shiftwork & no matter what time he finishes work.  He arrives home with a dose of 'verbal diahorrea'  & I sit there or lie in bed & listen.   That is what marriage is about.     Although men are very good with the SD gene (selective deafness), if they don't want to listen they just switch off.   Marriage is about sharing & caring & that goes both ways.
hFlnKsBZaa	Yes they can. Its crazy I know.|`|zka26204aa	Absolutely!!  I do!!|`|Fs4fAwfwaa	Some can, some cant.    But yeah, many women "seem" to feel bad about themself. Sometimes that actually is the case and sometimes they just want you to tell that they are beautiful. So as the technical term says: its insecurity!    So they simply want you or everyone else to reassure them that they are beautiful and whatnot so they can cope with their fear of being rejected.    Sounds like psychological mumbojumbo but learned that to be quite close to reality.    Be good!    Caleb|`|iYSYLUa1aa	obviersly I do every second of the day!|`|1vHlqJ8qaa	i can help (bow chicka wow wow!!!!)|`|9inngmg7aa	why not?
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Sounds like you have a point.  What actually is a pet peeve of mine, is the use of the word "like" when they mean crush, love, infatuation or attraction.     Does my friend like me? Yes of course, otherwise he would not even be a friend, right?    Having gotten rid of my pet peeve - i think that a girl can make attraction known, by asking the guy if he is up for a drink or something with her. Which basically is saying "You like to hunt, i want you to hunt me".     Sounds weird when you say it like this - almost like a rabbit in hunting season holding up a sign saying "shoot me"..|`|NrKD11vaaa	Well I for one agree with the bee in your bonnet :-)    I tend to to read them for all of 4 seconds, then move on. One thing that always disturbs me is this - do they live in the middle of no where, with no family members, friends, etc. that they can ask? I appreciate parts of America of pretty remote, but no one should resort to asking random people that have no idea of the background situation, personality's, etc.    Anyway, well said.|`|e5YaHUUVaa	this isnt a question.    but i agree with you.  coming straight out and saying it DOES NOT WORK.  if you really want to suggest something, talk about the most banal stuff, this can be deeply seductive.  talking about love, boyfriend gfs, when you barely know them does not promote bonding, it actually repels.  people are looking for a distraction, a fun game for their mutual amusement. people arent looking for others to profess their feelings immediately, then wheres the game? wheres the chase?  where's the ride there?  think of it like a metaphor, you're driving but you'll eventually get there. the longer you take, the more its usually worth it in the end.|`|xYgFcEfwaa	people who give stupid advice are those people who are losers and they cant help and they dont deserve help.|`|dwiuV0Hvaa	i accept wat u say 100%. coz were i come 4rm we allow the guyz 2 do the chasing & its unlady like 2 chase a guy.    and its more fun if as a girl u re being woed & chased by a guy.    so ladies u hv ur pride & dignity if u let the guy do the chasing.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	because they have no idea what they're talking about    it's obviously not as easy as it sounds.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	i think when people say 'just tell her you like them' i don't think they mean it literally. It could be a polite way of saying 'grow some balls, stop asking people about this and go try to get her yourself you wimp'.|`|bZTpK9uVaa	I concur. -_- people watch too much movies.|`|XoiKGZstaa	I can't tell if you just answered your own question. But I know your making a statement and it is so true.     Thumbs up.|`|u7bxSrtKaa	you sound like a good kid.    but understand this.....as we get older there are more and more "what if" moments, and they keep stacking up.  "what if i had said this, or that" and they bother us through the years.    JUST TELL HIM YOU LIKE HIM so you dont drive yourself nutz later in life wondering if you could have changed things!
rJ7OgRzgaa	This would have really helped if i had known earlier ='(|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I know what you mean. it's not that easy to just say it. I also hate questions that only say "how can I him to like me" without any details. with questions like this that are so vague, no tactic can be generated for a chance to occur....thus the ask him question|`|AA10855935	YES.thank you|`|wjS3GtOYaa	I agree with you 100000000%    Girls should never say "I like you" first. And guys should tell her when they are sure she feels the same - or else it will feel awkward after she rejects him.  How do you know? Look at her behaviour. Ask her friends. Things like that. =D    btw -- thanx for throwing this out in the Y!A world loool|`|BgClmJb8aa	You seem to know what you're talking about when it comes to relationships, I've posted a few questions on my account based around this girl I like, your answer to on was really helpful. Can you please answer the others or read a few and give me an overview in one answer. Sorry, I just really don't have any idea what to do|`|houWY7qvaa	It's not always terrible advice.  It depends on the maturity of the individuals.  If a friendship would ensue first, then nature would take its course if there were a mutual attraction, and if not, one or the other would comment that they were not into the other.  With the younger kids though, I think you hit it right on, but how do you give them your message?
C0yagFFoaa	hi  have apregnancy test, do it twice. i am sorry but you may never see him agian, did he not gicve you his address in the country he lives in, or is he trasvelling as well. maybe otyu could catch up with him on his travels,  but if he is gone, thats life, i know it snot nice, but , thats how it goes, ships that pass in the night.|`|N24wkFROaa	sigh -.-|`|CpUJI8adaa	honey, you had a unprotected fling, not a good thing at all. not to be hard on you , but that was so not cool at all , he could have had aids and now you think your pregnant. do you really know his real name ? how do you sleep with aTOTAL STRANGER? what were you thinking ?and now your heartbroken.dude, thats totally irresponsible.and dangerous .think about it .go get tested for hiv/aids, you have a whole lot more to worry about then some guy you DID NOT KNOW AT ALL.you need to tighten and not be so loose with your body. i dont care how good a guy looks , if i dont know him, im not sleeping with him.and anyways he just might  have a girlfriend were he lives and just got a quick lay from you and moved on. no matter how good you think your connection with him WAS. just let go he gone . do you have a real phone number or address for this guy . if you do your good ,just letgo , he got what he wanted .and your writing on yahoo answers about how to let go. how smart are you.GGGGEEEEZZZZZ|`|qxgkhN8aaa	you bang the wrong guy or you let the wrong guy banged you.  there's no other options left but abortion and even this i personally couldn't take it but i simply don't have the rights.  so when the next time you are out there alone don't simply  let any1 to bang you.
zka26204aa	When you run away from your problems, they always seem to find you.  The same problems will occur again.  You need to deal with your problems and then if you still want to relocate, you can start fresh.     Sounds to me that you may be getting too involved in relationships or friendships much to quickly.  Always take your time before you trust anyone enough to give your heart or your secrets.    Getting hurt is not always a bad thing.  It teaches us what kind of people to trust and how to prevent those things from happening over and over again.  Use your bad experiences to learn what to do and not to do.  EVERYONE has bad experiences in their lives.  That is what helps us to appreciate the good ones so much.|`|PJKB5QIqaa	If you're serious about it, then do it...  But by posting on here, i sincerely doubt your integrity.

Relationships are way to complicated to figure out on a message board.  It does sound like you've both been behaving in a manner that feeds off each other in a negative way.    People don't lie unless they think they're going to be in trouble and it sounds like your hubby is in trouble a LOT.  It's not the fault of either one or the other, it's a combination of things.  Get marriage counselling.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Can we all say marriage counseling.  You two have started in a downward spiral that has no end in sight unless the two of you stop it.  His behavior is a response to your behavior, and your behavior is a response to his.  It's a vicious cycle that will never be broken unless you get some outside input on how the two of you need to change things.  And this is a two way street.  Neither one of you can make this right alone.  Get some help.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	then take control again .. or you will be left out in the street ..|`|iblT1HJpaa	Know that whenever you find yourself "bit ching" about whatever or you find yourself talking/grumbling to yourself about an issue - it's always about boundaries.   Whether you have spoken then or not - we each have established boundaries to protect our self. Your skin is your first boundary. Then you set up boundaries to protect your body, mind, home, kids, work, etc.... They are only YOUR boundaries and if you don't set them down, anybody can walk right over them. THis is what your husband is doing. He's crossing your boundaries. And you feel disgusted, irate, peeved, angry, lost, etc.........  Learn about boundaries and how to establish them with others. Once you've done that, if someone crosses that boundary you will not feel the way you do for the "problem" is not yours. It is the other person's problem because you have "set the fence posts".   Also, do yourself a favor and learn the difference between men and women and what they both desire in a relationship. If you don't learn it now, you will go through this again.|`|m81dfyOYaa	You mentioned several times the lies and then your example that he went out to run and errand and more lies. Isn't he coming back for hours and lying about where he's been, what? Your sister-in-law is right, you should change your victim status, go get counseling by yourself if you have to. And obviously calling him on it and fighting isn't helping, see a counselor and have a plan as to what you want to do and how to do it. Good Luck.|`|09DE4NG3aa	You should be able to trust your husband.  This is a man who vowed to be your partner in all things, and lying to a spouse is unacceptable.  It isn't your fault that he lies, but obviously you need to wise up and not accept what he says at face value.  You  say that he is abusive to you.  If this is the case, then you need to leave, no further discussion.  You cannot allow your son to be in this situation, and you cannot allow yourself to stay their either.  If your sister-in-law can see how bad the situation is, then you need to change it.  If it was your own sister where you are now, what would you tell her to do?    I think you do understand what you are being told - that your relationship isn't working.  I think you should discuss with your husband how unhappy you are, tell him you are prepared to give marriage counselling a shot and try that, but be prepared to cut your losses and leave with your son if things don't improve.
XwPs0Pmnaa	im sure your parents wouldnt like it, but follow your heart. there have been much bigger age gaps.. so yours doesnt seem THAT bad    just make sure he loves you for all the right reasons and doesnt pressure you into anything !    i wish you the best of luck !|`|HfTbzv32aa	yes and no. i mean it is a lil different but as long as you not doing anything like sex.|`|shvhgzXeaa	There is quite an age gap there. You probably don't wanna hear this but because your young your view on this guy may change as you get older. When your older your outlook on life and the things that you want out of life change. You may think its nice that this guy has a mature nature unlike some of the guys your age but that doesn't go for all young guys your age some can be pretty mature in personality. What about your family? Would it be worth causing a rift in your family for a guy who you may not be with for long.|`|bZTpK9uVaa	yes, that is really wrong.  Infact, that is pretty disgusting.  And you are too young, hes too mature.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	you need to find some one your own age.|`|hN08l7tLaa	there's no right or wrong, but pls pls do take care of urself. older guys are much sensitive and mature, but sometimes, their thinking is different from guys around ur age. i've an ex who was 7 years older. well.. we did get along ok, but i think at the end of the day, all these older guys like, is abt the "young" in the girls. and end up, they will still find someone around their age to be with when they are bored of this "young".|`|9ko5WUFkaa	It's not right.  You are still a kid and usually in this kind of relationship the older male is taking advantage of your inexperience and youth.    Also, it most places the age of consent if 17/18, so if anything physical has taken place it's not only wong and creepy, it's against the law.    This is not a healthy relationship for you to be in.  When you're 27 and he's 38 there's not a problem - you are both adults and able to make informed decisions, but at your age this is wrong.  You do not yet have the life experience to see the problems and that in itself is part of the problem - he is taking advantage of you and if he is having sex with you he is breaking the law.|`|74gPuaXMaa	I rag on my female friends that do things like that. Even now in college, I do the same thing. There is still major maturity differences, and being under the legal age and dating a guy who is about 10 years older is kinda messed up.|`|6boH5X5Baa	far out i hope you haven't had sex before you were 16 thats illegal and dating someone thats that much older means his taking advantage   usually i always say there are no boundaries for love but wow0.0|`|ZA11WBR2aa	never say never|`|aLyJe1b3aa	yup|`|hJLcqWKXaa	SORRY!  but that's WRONG!  i mean ur 16 you don't know what ur doing but  he is 27 he really has no life being dating you  i don't mean it in a bad way it's just that he should date someone  his age and you should date someone ur age  sorry  but if you love him or like him really much there's nothing  anyone can do
cN11LuTFaa	i think it means that he really likes you. and that he thought he needed a break when he really did not.|`|JThhM2wGaa	It could mean a couple different things.    A: He cheated and feels bad  B: He just really likes you|`|EyENdFfgaa	Jet rid of him.  Ego runs wild.... reality kicks in.  He is looking for something different but wants a safety net.   He will do it again and again and again.|`|Ys8t1CFkaa	it means he is losing some interests in you    go figure out why|`|GrwWH5XJaa	He's lacking confidence in you. Prove to him that you're worth it|`|AzZZuxdRaa	i don think its anything really serious...maybe he waz just testing out to see how it feels without you in his life...if my bf said that to me i wud feel special...cuz it means that he cant even survive 3 days without you. Just hope he doesn't try it again, if so he may b using it as an excuse to see other girls, and he'd say...well we weren't seeing each other @ the time!!!|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	it means he missed you and realised that it was a bad idea to go on a break, and that he definetley wants to be with you :) so thats a good sign|`|uCF9YYYCaa	he wants you back.|`|37U0P66naa	he might have been testing you to see if you'd do anything but then he missed talking to you and it didn't work out.|`|xmWxafHSaa	He regrets asking you for the "break".  He realized what he had and he missed it.  He probably won't admit to his mistake because of his pride, so that could be his way of saving face.|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	he missed you.|`|AchGld8Jaa	You do speak English, right?|`|baVloeL3aa	Could be nothing.  Could mean he wanted to break free for a few days without the consequences.  Either way, don't let it get to you.  Your relationship will either work or it won't, it doesn't really make a huge difference in the real world.  If it doesn't work out, you'll find someone else.|`|Jph6y9viaa	he did that to see if he could live without you and he probably cant|`|B3qTbSOSaa	My guess would be he either regrets it and really missed you or he needed an excuse to do something he couldn't.|`|sZePlWTQaa	Sometimes we get confused on what we want (girls and guys). He was probably having thoughts and wanted a break, but realized how much of a great girl you are!|`|JukGKm2paa	he misses you and needs you|`|Ccy7RslDaa	Relationship sometimes need space,  time and realization how valuable your partner could be to you.

Your lucky that your partner on knows how important you are and with that live life to the fullest!|`|RUuQ3syDaa	you made me confused too|`|5Zux7hk6aa	It sounds to me like hes kissing up to you because he did something wrong, maybe he wanted this lil so called "break" so he can have some time with a different girl, it seems like it didn't work out so he came back running to you :/|`|Q4KfpRdDaa	Maybe when you were on break, he hooked up with someone, and even though you two weren't exactly dating, he feels guilty about it.|`|pnqBH2Z2aa	He could be on a guilt trip or he could just miss you.|`|qmK8VPeYaa	Sex

0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	I'm 22 and I've never been interested in a guy in a fraternity. I don't see why women are attracted to them. Like you said, those guys are only interested in one thing.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	I guess because those girls are also after one thing which is sex.|`|ool2QdgBaa	Simple as 1 2 4  Money.

The right guy will find you sooner or later.|`|AA11821715	Sometimes they are just as scared of you, as you are of them. Get your group of girlfriends and go to some bars of clubs or whatever kinds of social gatherings you kids go to. GO AND MEET PEOPLE. and be open to guys, relax and just talk, unless they are @$$holes, then you can tell them to piss off.|`|9inngmg7aa	Maybe you want a boyfriend for the wrong reasons. no guy wants you to pour your woes on him at least not early in the relationship. relax and live a little it will all come together but don't sound so needy - it drives guys crazy!|`|DfpWFrfuaa	good things come to those who wait, dont be searching for him.  itll happen on its own.  youre barely in your mid 20s so dont worry, enjoy yourself and the right one will come on without much effort from u to find him.|`|V4PA9foJaa	Patience, my girl.. or boy(ewww!!!)|`|TCcfYPSlaa	would it be better to get a boyfriend now.  Or wait a bit longer for the perfect guy?|`|VLLNWb68aa	Its not always easy to find someone special. Just keep looking, maybe look on singles websites, go to different shops regularly and see if theres someone there you like. Theres a shop next to where I work and theres a girl there who Im sure she likes me, she looks nice as well. Just waiting now to sunday until I can ask her out.    In summary, broaden your horizons.    Hope this helps and good luck.

Xn7l9YXNaa	You may feel the same way he is. Don't mind the teasing and the looks from others. They're just jealous they don't have someone feel that way about them. If I were you, I'd be flattered and confront him about it.    Hope I helped!
T0pkW783aa	Commitment phobia, fear of losing their freedom, not enough money to provide for two, wants more time to make the decision, having doubts about a lifelong commitment to anyone, wants to wait until he can afford a ring, wants the proposal to be a surprise and would like to choose the time and place himself without feeling pressured.  (Just a few ideas.)|`|QPwrLdUxaa	Because marriage effectively alters your relationship. It makes it more cemented, definite for life and, although he may love you dearly, forever is a long time and it encroaches on his freedom slightly. Or maybe he's just nervous the girl would say no.     Or maybe, to quote the film title, he's just not that into you :P     xx|`|D48KtNRKaa	they r most likely scared or nervous|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	not all guys|`|NBW0jjEsaa	I would want to be sure that the relationship can pass the test of time, before i committed to a lifetime. and besides if your going to together for the rest of your lives why does it matter when you get married, if you have a lifetime to get married.|`|qXp0gNzKaa	Hey, I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years and he and I are 100 % sure that we will be together forever, at least in this life.  But we don't plan to marry anytime soon.  I think it has to do a lot with the background of your fiance.  Did his parents cohabit before they got married?  My boyfriend's parents lived together from age 19 to 27, then got married at age 27 when she got pregnant.  My boyfriend is also likely to follow the same path.  I think you copy your parent's path when it comes to marriage.  Some men are relaxed about marriage, not that he is unsure she is the one or something.    I am not crazy or a big fun of marriage because my parents didn't have a wedding and they also got divorced.  I am just fine cohabiting with my boyfriend...    Please don't be insecure about the proposal, if it still bothers you, then ask him what his plan is.  No problem in asking or discussing this.      Good luck!!!|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	They see marriage as losing freedom. Suddenly they can't do everything they want to, and they have to check with someone before they spend money or go out.    Women already have all those restrictions on them. We can't do everything we want, and we can't be totally free. In fact, we might be freer after marriage than before.|`|6r6Laeozaa	I'm in a relationship with my gf for 1 1/2 yrs.  My gf told me a month back that if I propose to her, she will say yes.  I told her that at the current moment I'm not going to propose.  Maybe in a yr or 2 later i will do it.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	they are afriad of making a mistake, along with the thought of marrying the wrong person|`|QXQWDw1qaa	Marriage is a church-made concept for women and children.. but it's not really something that men want to be stuck with.

Xn7l9YXNaa	No offense, but a hug doesn't mean much. I hug all my friends at every chance I get. My first girlfriend/kiss I was extremely nervous. Not about the kiss in general,but the looks I would receive around me from everyone else. But, I got over it. He seems nervous or not so much embarrassed of you, just scared a bit. Just sit him down and tell him he's got nothing to worry about. Ask him if he still loves you, if he says yes, take the initiative and kiss him. He'll warm up to the idea.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	encourage  him and don't be in hurry|`|DGzdxtelaa	he is shy be gentle with him|`|hNHp9woaaa	you're just 13 !|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	He is shy...your only 13, slow it down.|`|GzlZmAWYaa	it is a fact that ppl r more confident, texting, on msn etc than in person|`|sGfLmEdSaa	just dont presure him|`|M63kq3AYaa	Look back at this question when you're an adult, then you'll realise what a stupid question it was.|`|0pX1oQAJaa	there's a lot of different kinds of love. and when i was that age and dated, i thought you had to say it because of how other relationships around me were. so just because he said it, don't take it to heart. and hugs don't mean much.. it's all about holding hands, stuff like that. 13 is young.... so don't try to hurry too much, i mean, he's honestly just shy and immature, girls mature way faster than guys, not to sound like a broken record.
9it5nGJjaa	He wouldn't need to cheat on me, I'm more than enough for any drago... I mean guys. :)|`|BHlQ1KTXaa	it is hard to believe...my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me with my best friend even though he always said he'd never cheat.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i dont find it hard to trust bill. hes a wonderful father and great husband. he gets all he can handle and i make sure hes too tired to do more than look at other women. (unless i invite them over, for more details, read my blog!! ;).)|`|IN1X1CVGaa	no its not  but yes it is  we never fully trust you for a while  until after you prove, that even in the toughest situations  you really wont cheat|`|FPT6pstraa	I like to quote comedian Chris Rock on this subject  "A man is as faithful as his options."|`|wC88aBxXaa	Some do some don't but this I can tell you I've never cheated on my women and I sure as h ll am older than most on y-a's  so the chance's were always there.

I TRUST my instinct 200%|`|LZzsDARUaa	yes............well, depends on the guy I guess, I know a few men that r really loyal|`|7ciw1aCXaa	Yes. It is hard, as no-one knows the future. And you fail to understand that "cheat" is a movable goal post.|`|qWF36Ujaaa	well it depends on his past and reputation was  if you cheated on a girl before then a girl would have a hard time believeing but if you havent then you shouldnt have any problems|`|rZIBwchQaa	Well if i really really trust that guy i would believe them. But it is a scientific fact that guys are attracted to girls. Like for example you have a girlfriend. But there is a blonde at 4:00. I meen girls are natural flirts but guys they flirt to. So i dont trust guys if i havent known them for at least a month. Or if i no there like personality.|`|sZePlWTQaa	My thought it...why does he need to express or tell a girl that he won't? Through his actions a girl should know. To me if a guy brings it up..I question why they are telling me.|`|pnqBH2Z2aa	I just think other guys have ruined that for the good ones. Never is really long time, but no, I would believe it, if your relationship background is clear(no cheating)your good.|`|Zo6TQY6haa	It is, because so many men do it. It's not your fault. It's just a stereotype you have to contend with due to your gender. You may very well never cheat on a woman at any point in your life (though this does remain to be seen), but it's simply a stereotype you have to prove yourself against to your girl.    Women have a lot of stereotypes as well. They we're emotionally needy, never want to have sex, can't drive, etc.    It's best to just ignore these things and be yourself. Being faithful in a relationship is difficult, period. There's so many temptations out there. It's like a strict diet and you really want that piece of chocolate! If you are fully capable of outwitting these temptations then whoever you may be with one day sure is lucky!|`|IFGzOomWaa	Yes.  My boyfriend who was my WORLD, and from my understanding loved me sooooooooooooooo much. He cheated.  Theres always that chance that boys will, even girls.
HCgNSgKBaa	I think you need to tell your fiance that what if it were you? If you and his brother didn't get along and he didn't go how would he feel? I would stress to him that this is one memory that he will never get back, and he needs to be there to support his brother not necessarily the marriage itself! So yes, I would intervene not to be controlling but to let him know that he may regret this later on!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	if he really really doesn't approve, I understand his principles and that he doesn't want to be a part of the wedding.  he must have a pretty good reason for hating this girl.  it's a shame but if he doesn't go to the wedding it will probably mean the end of his relationship with his brother.  don't get involved, let them work it out.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	No dont interfere, its nothing to do with you. You may have your own feelings on this but keep them to yourself.  If you start problems with this then you and he will end up arguing and do you really want to have this hanging over your relationship ? Be supportive in this but keep out of it.|`|URO3gDXcaa	he is an adult and can do as he pleases.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Have a sit down with your fiance and tell him all the reasons you think he should go.  In the end the decision is his though and you need to respect it no matter how stubborn and stupid it seems.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's not your place to say anything. By standing up as a groomsman, that says he supports the marriage, which he does not if he doesn't like her. He has every right to refuse to go if he feels that strongly against it.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	If he has a good relationship with his brother, then he should go to support his brother.  If their relationship is bad then it's fine for him to stay away - it's not like it's causing any damage in that case.  It's his decision whether or not he wants to support his sibling - as long as he's willing to accept the consequences there's nothing you can do about it.    If you have a good relationship with the bride and groom you could send them a wedding card from you to let them know that you wish them well in their marriage - don't add your fiance's name, though.  Your not his mother and he's old enough to make decisions for himself.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Tell him to be a man and go.Thats his brother.He can just ignore bros fiance.|`|5DJcir9saa	Since he is your fiance and you two can share everything, its important that you communicate with him and give your reasoning as to why he should go.  However, if he doesn't want to go, that is all you can do.  I wouldn't be the go between for him and his brother.  If you have a fairly close relationship with either his mom or dad, you could also ask for their input.|`|f9ca0489c84566012f6ae440195cf6b4aa	State your concern briefly, then let it go.  You cannot force him to go and repeatedly trying to change his mind will only cause friction between the two of you.|`|e5FoLh2Paa	He's an adult and apparently capable of making his own decisions.  What are you his gf or his mother?  You can't make him go if he doesn't want to.  Stop trying to be controlling and go to the wedding by yourself if you want to go.|`|8QOlaQWgaa	Have a friend that married a girl none of us liked.  We all went to the wedding in support of him and will be here for him if it ever falls apart.  In the beginning his sister and family refused to go but decided to go to let them know they are there for him no matter what.

However, it really depends on the person. I wouldnt say no to a skinny or big girl because shes skinny or big.

EmpDdyHraa	I used to have that problem until I made it clear to him that if he doesn't start taking me out, then I would find somebody who will. He called my bluff and one night  I did go out on a date. He was mad but I could care less. If I'm just his "lady friend" then that leaves room for me to date. A guy will take you seriously if you show him that you are not playing with him.|`|OHfZFR31aa	That doesn't sound healthy. I wouldn't want to be with a guy who didn't take me out or won't tell his friends about you. Sorry but it sounds like he just thinks of you as a booty call, not a girlfriend. My bf introduced me to his friends when we had only been going out a few weeks, and he's met all of my friends as well. When you really like someone, you want your friends to meet them so you can integrate them into your life.    Tell him exactly how you feel. If he won't take you out or introduce you to his friends, there is no long-term future for you.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	find a new boyfriend..................he sucks|`|V4PA9foJaa	Some thing is very fishy..may be hez cheating on you.... and take some grammar lessons please...|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Well if he is hiding you it's for a reason. He may still want his ex back, so he doesn't want her to know about you. Or he just wants his cake and eat it too. Wisen up.|`|XGQ3o4i7aa	Everything you mentioned suggests he is either cheating you or is not taking you too seriously. Dont stick around with someone who doesnt acknowledge you. And what on earth is a lady friend??
shvhgzXeaa	Yeah of course people believe in romance. How would people get together if there was no romantic element involved. Maybe your boyfriend feels that he doesn't have to do that any more. Just give him a wake up call.|`|PSWFAVthaa	eeeh well why isnt he taking you to that wedding?? Have you spoken to him how you feel. Thats an important part of the relationship and if one person really wants it, it shouldnt take a lot for the other person to show a bit of romance|`|xpv3BUyBaa	Alot of people beleive there isnt some :/  Because either they think they cant find it and they been looking forever   Or Because some people beleive its for S.e.x :s   But some peope Like me Think romance is amazing and It still exists in my life No matter what people say :D|`|EsVjwKPAaa	some people do still believe in romance... but i guess your bf belongs to those people who doesn't believe in romance. there are really people who are like that.|`|meG2ZZ5paa	Dump.....................him...............      saying stuff like i hate holidays like valentine  and you've been talking for it for along time, he is trying to upset you......      he doesn't even seem to be trying with this relationship........      I don't think it is the word romance thats been lost in society rather the word love from him in your relationship    It is obvious he doesn't have his priorities set, he dopesn't deserver you..........      :) I'm not tryiong to upset you just want to make it clear for you|`|GSzQWlccaa	No its not a thing of the past, Romance is the thing, it is forever like diamonds, you just got a really negative dude, Im sorry, is he on Weed coz I used to do weed and it took out all my romantic thoughts, but since giving it up , I have regained my thing and realised how important it is.  I am sorry u have to deal with that.|`|1xHbgqB5aa	Well this is a very sound question indeed, and I've given this a lo of thought.  i think that romance isn't still dead, but it's dying alright. It seems people just don't care about doing romantic things anymore. And I must say that it is our own fault, because why should people bother, when they could get their dose of booty in any case.  Some 50 years ago, the only way for a guy to get with a girl would be months and months of giving flowers, being as kind as possible, saying all the right things, to only go out on a date. Even kissing was found inappropriate.  But today, it seems that couples first make out a number of times and only get in a relationship after that. I mean what romance can we expect, when sticking your tongue in someones throat is more natural than knowing his favorite color? Or his name for that matter...  A lot of studies on this topic show that it's the lack of romance causing so unhealthy and short lived relationships. A couple can't just live on lust forever. That also where cheating and lack of trust come out also.  In conclusion, the best thing that can possibly happen to a relationship is the presence of romance, and don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about romance all the time, but it's really nice to have from time to time. And having a desire for it that's not returned, sure can hurt.  So you should plan something for when he comes back, and I'm sure he'll appreciate it, and find it really moving. Everyone has romance in them, but sometimes it's simply buried a bit too deep. Nothing a bit of digging can't solve ;)|`|e24xEC5faa	I totally believe in romance! maybe he doesnt realise how much this day means to you? while you might think you've been pretty obvious about it all along, he prob hasnt been picking up the clues.. i know my bf takes a while so generally i just tell him straight out. Saves a lot of worrying/stress. Either that or he not worth it, if he thinks being romantic towards you is a waste of time. Hope this helps|`|cn9FRj9taa	people still believe in romance, but not everyone finds valentine's day overly special...i don't. it's just another day to me and a highly overrated one at that.    love should be shown and shared to one another every day not just on valentine day. the fact that he doesn't share your sentiments doesn't make him unromantic.    wow! i now get the whole picture. he doesn't deserve you at all. after all you do for him, he can give you some of his precious time.    if he truly loves you, everything that is important to you, no matter how silly, will be important to him.    go to the coast alone if he won't come with you and have as much fun as you can. when you get back....dump him! you're too good for him.|`|cWcGz4Z7aa	yes i do.|`|psw08EJuaa	I still believe but all the girlfriends I have had I have found out they cheated on me and only liked me for my money (gold diggers).So Im not sure still.|`|rOtfBBEYaa	Of course there are people who still believe in romance! Why do you think there are a BUNCH of dating sites?|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Awww sweetie that totally stinks! I would talk to him again and tell him how important it is for you to share this day with him. Since he is going to a wedding during the day ask him if he would do something special at night. Tell him you'd like this very much. Good luck.|`|fg2xU6Z2aa	well maybe he is scared of commitment like that, and what guy don't like valentines day? usually he cant wait to see the surprise you have for him! and do you know for sure he is going to a wedding?  honey i would check into it|`|4zVi6gvgaa	I still believe in romance! I might just be naive but I think its really important.  I know Valentines day is pretty stupid and commercial, but I like it cos its romantic! Don't lose hope.|`|MXzzUDbRaa	You deserve someone better =))|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Psh, he sounds just like my ex boyfriend. That is why I ended things with him. He was totally not into the whole romance anything! he even told me Valentines is for *******! I couldn't take it anymore so I ended it with him. If I were you, I would sit down and talk to him about how you feel. Tell him that Valentines is a very important holiday to you. If he doesn't make you a PRIORITY in his life, don't make him yours. You're a very importan individual and you deserve a man who is willing to give you the world-his heart. So, I would give him another chance, if he backs out, dump him. You deserve everything. I believe in romance. Its out there somewhere.|`|2hAuIg5baa	nope my boyfriend ditched me on our 1st anniversery to be with his friends iv never gotten over it and i swear ill never forgive him for that!  ALL guys a d1ckheads, there idea of romance is getting a bj and a porno movie, there COMPLETLY selfish and self obsorbed and would NEVER consider doing anything romantic for there girlfriend EVER because there a$$holes and im seriously considering becoming a dyke because i hate men!  you treat them great, and do everything they ask and the most theyv ever done was buy u a f*ucking mcdonnells that he guilted you into paying him back for! uuuggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	romance....... what is that?    evolution is telling me i should only care for sex and reproduction with as many females as possible|`|mOxVL0luaa	it depend on what type of ppl. i for 1 believe in romance. u can try talking to ur bf about it so that he would understand u more about it.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	Wow.. that sucks. Having a romantic partner is a plus, but in your case.. it seems different.    Romance is still around - it's the people that don't want to show their emotions, love and effort for someone, who make it seem like it's dead.     I hope he does something close to romantic and loving on Valentines for you.|`|sLtmg9xzaa	No. I do not. Absolutely NOT.    More you expect... more you just lose..........
ZjM0ghSnaa	Well, from the signs she gives off, I think she definetly likes you.    She's trying to make you jealous, by flirting with another guy, and just wants your attention. She's waiting for you to come up to her, talk to her, and ask her out.    If you like her, go for it.
AHY3UUIiaa	He may like you or just being friendly, But theres also the chance that he thinks he's in with a chance and may lead you on. Just wait for him to make the first move then you will know hes really intrested.    AJ.X|`|09zVUMBRaa	It strokes his ego knowing you have feelings for him & maybe he likes you too, on some level & the capturing your gaze thing is the only way he can express it.|`|cr8J3hPqaa	I thought only guys misinterpret a smile as,   'She wants me'.    If he is genuinely a cool friendly guy, with everyone, then no, if its just with you, then Yes, he likes you. See how he acts around others, both guys and girls, is he cool, talkative, friendly, smiley...    I personally, give guys and girls, I know, a nod, and a smile, it does not mean I want them, especially the former. I usually give a smile to girls I know, but that I dont want, in order to have them want me, and lust for me, since I know they are attracted to me.  I also talk to these women, rarely, and when I do it is brief, since i am so much cooler then them, and I dont want to be seen talking to a loser for too long, this comes across in my behaviour, body language, and attitude, and trust me, she is loving it, shes want me more, and MORE. I have even had some women become stalkers, by doing this, so I've calmed it down a bit, on the low self-esteem types, and I really dont want to hurt them, believe it or not.    Why do I do this you ask?, the same reason women do this to men, I rack up spare women on the side, for a rainy day, I keep them as friends, and they come in handy, for all sorts of things, like homework. And if I wanted to be a real ********, even sex, when thing get boring with the gf, this is what hot women do...    If a girl, I know, and who is hot, was playing me in this way, by trying to rack me on the side as a loser friend who wants her, I would wave at her all enthusiastically when she smiles at me, and then quickly turn that wave into the finger, yes you heard that right, the up-yours middle finger, and smile as I'm doing it....She will laugh, and have a greater respect for you, do the same to him....he will most probably approach you, and start a conversation, if he doesn't, it will work after a few times of doing this...It will certainly make you more Cool in his eyes...    I would never be all lovestruck and smiley/lots of eye contact with a hot girl, why? for the exact reason you have just demonstrated, she will think that I want her;  it also telegraphs too much interest, and it is a turn-off for the girl, she's thinking, 'Loser.......he so wants me so bad....Next', you have just boosted her ego, and made her think shes all that, making it harder for other guys to approach her.|`|5R7N5dcYaa	Yeah!! I think he likes you.. cause when someone is not flattered they try to avoid that person!|`|nkxE1DGMaa	he might like u or hes just a friendly guy|`|Fe1Z7fpbaa	im pretty sure he likes you :)  smile back!!!!  dont be embarassed    however, he could just be being friendly......     probably 1st one though im sure!!!!    hope i helped!!!  clo  xx|`|gBAstki5aa	wow you're really overanalyzing this. just continue to be friendly and see where it goes.|`|foq9TPjzaa	hes just smiling. dont make a big deal out of it. i smile at my friends if i walk past them, guy or girl.|`|QvRnCtr7aa	maybe hes just a happy guy?  maybe he smiles at everyone? i do.  i smile most at people i dont like...  the bigger the smile, the less i like them.|`|9F76AUgfaa	he smiles at you because he likes you|`|w8xJGEJCaa	Hmm, I'd say the only way you'll know for sure is if you just go and talk to him. If he doesn't act interested--there's your answer, but if he starts acting sort of nervous, then that means he likes you. Also, if he wants to keep talking--and doesn't say like I'd better get to my next class, or something like that..then he's into you. Good luck, be courageous! You only have one life, so live it up! Have an awesome day!|`|7u33Zruhaa	Your probably just thinking too much about it.|`|4bMMC47Baa	Its Possible that he could like you because hes making eye contact with you n smiling so it might mean that he likes you otherwise he wouldn't be smiling n he knows that you like him. if he didn't like you back then he would not be smiling back at you.ask him maybe he likes you just ask n check what's going on.good luck!!|`|a3kjC49Baa	NO really it means he has something in his mouth that is causing him serious pain ,that he has to clench his teeth...      Sweety there are five kinds of smiles which you have to learn to differentiate between.    SMILE 1. Sympathetic..."oh how cute she likes me, i'll be nice and smile back :)"    SMILE 2. "Attraction... "I feel an attraction to this girl, and can't help smile cause she's cute and my ding dong just wants to say hello"    SMILE 3. Stalker/killer... "I am obsessed with this girl, and am smiling at what i have planned tonight, ohh yesss"      SMILE 4. Wrong girl. "I was smiling at this other girl , but accidentally caught the attention of another, so i'll just keep smiling... until this awkward phase is over'      SMILE 5. Something on ya face. "OMG what is on her face, well i gota stop staring , so i'll just smile to cover up my smirk"|`|ipaCYvB7aa	He likes you :) If not he wouldn't bother :)|`|ljyuS5Ubaa	ask him.
el8XHxBpaa	Don't dress to look sexy. Dress in something that meets the weather conditions and is nice. if its cold wear a cute sweater and some nice jeans.     To meet him. Just walk up and tell him you are interested in getting to know him more. And that you would like to catch a movie or go grab some food.     aslo he already likes you so that is a plus. just know that your not trying to impress him, he is already impressed. so be yourself.    Add me as contact and let me know how it goes for you if you want. i would like to see what you did and how it worked.|`|6k8GJBRPaa	Have you already asked him out (or has he asked you out)? If yes, then you should know, he's already showing interesse for you. Think of the fact already billions of girls and guys have a partner, so why wouldn't you get someone. Just think of everything you're good at.  Your outfit: I would take the outfit where you think you look the best in.
L4gtJfNmaa	1-A girl who dosnt mind getting her hand dirty is sexy  2-Tugging on those cow teats can translate to other tugging skills if you know what I mean.  3-Braids are hot  4-You've gotta love those dresses|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Milk maid?|`|2c2W4zQJaa	We love corn flakes|`|8LzZvPwjaa	first time I hear it...but it must be the uniform (whatever uniform that is)|`|qwVruoJ8aa	never heard of it i heard of french maids|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	whats a milkmaid?|`|MgiK02Zbaa	why are women so paranoid about this?  ha! i just did a typical stereotype to women just like what you did to men.|`|XZ47QWOlaa	because some mens' mind is dirty :)

gfCgQ0Jsaa	With someone to whom you are not married to, keep that kind of information to yourself.|`|3WwFJG8Caa	some guys are not all|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	its disgusting. we don't want to know, so don't tell us|`|JhIIPQFaaa	Im a dude and if I saw it I would be f*ckin' grossed out, but if she tells me she has it right then, I would understand  Nah not really curious when blood is spewing out of you... lol|`|xWq93Ckyaa	I always told all of my boyfriends whenever I got my period. None of them were really grossed out about it. They were curious at times about like tampons and stuff lol. But, i think it's more the fact that they have never experienced that.|`|Rd59CO9Aaa	never tell a guy about your period or if your having it. we don't want to hear about it and learn enough about it through health|`|8vUFcFqbaa	Well, if your old enough, you kind of have to tell them.  Because if they want to have sex, you kind of have to tell them your on it then. But just don't bring it up with a guy besides that, it's gross and kind of awkward for them.|`|b5d79fc67a9b8e3af70ac7d8aa6672b6aa	I don't get grossed out i mean its normal human nature     and yeah i would like to know when it happens to a girl because like that i could be more careful around them     now with older woman yeah its nasty idk why hahaha they have to be in my age range to be normal     yes im super weird|`|DYmhJ8xhaa	ew|`|jPp607eTaa	gross|`|JdnBpzXCaa	most are|`|Qe95LNxYaa	you mean when a girl have the few delightfully months|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	yes and i just don't trust something that can bleed for days without dying|`|gC8cNMQ8aa	nope, its part of nature i don't see why guys find it gross to be honest|`|tZ4Kyc0Waa	I don't care personally. Not particularly curious, but i have a pretty good relationship with most of my friends who are female and they trust me with all kinds of info. This stuff is part of that info. And as long as the guy is sentimental than he'll be fine.|`|707gOCvbaa	A real man will not frown his face or think it's disgusting. Only your boyfriend or husband should have insight to when you are on your period. Any other guy would not care and does not need to know since most people still consider it a no no subject.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	We already know what they are and no we dont want you tell us about it    Just say its your time of the month most men wont touch you|`|hF2NVMNJaa	yup|`|bKK2eq3vaa	I've never been bothered about a gf having a period. But the THOUGHT of my mum having a period geez to we really have to go there??    Although you asking if guys are 'curious' about it, I guess I personally embrace any differences between the sexes so there is some degree of curiosity but it's not a turn on like for some people...|`|BFCIXFnPaa	No, i always notice when girls in my class have their periods cause they always go to the female teacher and ask them to bend their heads down and say they have to go and it's private.
XGZBEdAWaa	FIrst off if your not comfortable dating your bf then you don't have to explain anything! If you must just tell him that you don't think that you can trust him.  At least he's being honest with you when you asked him about the text to your friend. But the fact that his ex came up to you and let you know that he was hitting on her says to me that he doesn't take your relationship seriously.  If I were you i'd let him go and start looking for someone who would put me first. good luck.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	If he really cared for you he would of replied to that text thanks, but I'm in relationship.   Sounds like if given half a chance he will be trying to date both of you.  You must be worried about him cheating if you sent as msg from his Ex's phone.       Tell him straight pick one or the other of you.  Ask him what his intentions are.   Leopards don't change their spots. Be careful, if you play with fire you could get burned.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	If I were you, I wouldn't want to be with someone who has feelings for somebody else. If he still have feelings for her, then why the heck is he with you? both of you are just wasting each other's time|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sounds like either he is already cheating or thinking about it. If he really cared about you, he would have told your friend that he was flattered, but he had a new girlfriend and didn't want to get involved with anyone else. the fact that he said he still likes her means he is open to cheating|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Break up with him immediately.  he is a lying cheating player.  You should thank his ex for being honest with you and telling you the truth.  She probably got hurt by him and didn't want you to suffer and go through the same thing and look like a fool.|`|3325a2162fb81b6dcd62281b3f7a6677aa	Common question, If you like the guy try to talk it out. Of course he's gonna have feelings for his ex, but for you to let him know that it's ok, makes you look like the better person. Trust seems like a major issue, so since he already told you that he still has feelings for her, is pretty much NOT A LIE, so is he a cheater? Only time will tell that. For you to call him weird in that context kinda seems like you already want to break up and you just don't know how.
46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I would maybe get her something small from Boots so then you have at least something to give to her for her birthday and can say you have something else for her but waiting for it to be delivered it's just taking longer than expected because of the snow. Then maybe order her a bigger present online.|`|ObJTgBafaa	Buy her a nice picture frame and put a photo of you both in it.  It'll be more sentimental than all the rest of her presents.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Go to Boots and buy her some perfume.|`|AA10548545	make some poem on her if u can and text her at night 12 .ok  and then give her gift later on.|`|4iIr0ANnaa	Get her something from boots and make her something special, like a cake or a bracelet.|`|16107200db1f078e8b87a9cbafa363daaa	dont woory about it girl just explain it to her :P|`|0bs8X7Nvaa	get her cake, balloons all that make it very festive for her tomorrow and then as soon as you can get her something nicer!!!!! she'll understand the reason why you couldnt get it to her on time, just make sure she has a nice time tomorrow ;))))))))) your presence would mean more then a present anyways|`|X3RRybHWaa	get her a card for tomorrow and tell her you've already ordered her a present but it hasnt arrived. then when trains are back on go buy her something and tell her it arrived

op55FtqYaa	So you were in a sexual relationship with this guy but his ex has weighed in on this and has now taken over?    Basically you were a rebound and it sounds like he used you to make her jealous. His plan has obviously worked but here you are, hurt and upset.     You need to take more time - I know you said it's been going on a year but really know the person through and through before you have sex with them. It's hard to find someone without a history of partners but you need to do some digging. Always know what kind of man you're getting involved with. Always ask yourself "Is this someone I can take home to my family?"    College is one of the places everyone makes mistakes and its ok. From now until you graduate try to keep your head in your books and don't wear your heart on your sleeve.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA, that is part of growing up.you leaned by your mistakes.sorry that  you are hurting over him.he must have been seeing her,whiles going out with you.he is not worth crying over.all the time you are having sex with him,he is getting the best of 2 worlds.how can you have sex with him,after what is has done to you.he is only using you.you are worth more than that,him going with you,whiles still with her, means he feel he can knock your door for sex.hold your head High,and move on.let him see you for who you are.A STRONG PERSON.good luck.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	He is your ex, you have to forget him and move on.  Start looking for someone worthy of you.  You deserve better.  He is using you for sex.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	right now your a friend with benefits so I would stay away from all  you are getting is hurt and why would you sleep with him knowing he is probably sleeping with her too.  Now he has both of you you deserve better lose this loser|`|et39TGIsaa	Honey, don't let him treat you this way.  Cut all ties, and I mean REALLY cut them.  Don't talk to him, don't see him, don't do anything that reminds you of him.  He's probably in hog heaven right now, seeing two exes at the same time.  DON'T give him the satisfaction any longer!    He's an ex.  Exes don't make good friends.    Please don't allow yourself to go on like this.  You have to let him go.  It's the only way you are going to move forward, get over him.|`|QPmTzcGmaa	you need too get over him and move on when he seen that you moved on he will start to chase you! take my advice|`|j7p9NFY8aa	don't worry, be happy ooohhooohoooooohhhohohohhooh|`|BJwhdvjoaa	GEt OVER THIS GUY. the guy less than two days after the break up already had feeling for his ex. Look the best way to get over an old man is to get under a new one. Loose all emotional attachment for him he wants you to hang out with them so you can be jealous and miserable|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Why are you still having sex with him I thought you guys were broken up?  Seems like he is playing both of you girls...he is probably sleeping with her too!! He doesn't sound like a very responsible person and sounds very immature.  You are asking for heartache if you are continuing to have sex with him and keep that contact with him.  I think you should move on and forget about him.|`|6NPgEosOaa	omg you silly silly girl. I feel so sorry for you but cant help it, its programmed innto our genes. women are just dumb. we are always being used by assholes.     call him and tell him firmly that since you guys broke up, you need to have your own time and space away from him. which means NO contact NO calls, NO emails, NO texts the likes. YOu have to say this and mean it if not you'll be in the middle and you'll never move on or be treated the way you deserve to be. A loving relationship is not like this and you deserve one. after all there are plenty of other guys out there who would want to have you all to themselves. Trust yourself and your own worth...    abd for goodness sake NO MORE SEX! make it clear. Be firm. His just using you. I dont know who initated the breakup but if it was him, then good riddance. You dont want somebody who doesnt treasure you. wake up. see through him. I know its hard, but you have to stop seeing this guy until you're both sure with what you want. If he calls you DONT pick up. dont listen to his best friend bullshit.   tell him, maybe in the future when you've know for sure that there isnt anymore romantic feelings left can you be friends. FOr now you have to treat the breakup as that. a BREAK UP    You're either in a relationship and have sex, or you're not, and not have sex. You cant give him both.     PLease. women should stop letting men assholes get what they want.
9ZvQCpHPaa	Just avoid her  If she talks to you act like you dont care   She will know    Or just talk to her and tell her how you feel\  I would do it straight out though  "its over miss"|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Grow some balls, man up and just do it. 'Slowly' doing it just sounds so immature and just shows that you are worried that it will make you look like the bad guy. Either way she will probably be hurt, why drag it out any longer than necessary. Rip it off like a bandaid nice and fast so she can start healing and move on.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	Try and have a week apart and socialise with other people and see how you both feel after...usually though, a relationship that splits for a while is doomed to fail in the end. If you were really right for each other then you wouldnt feel that way in the first place.  You're still very young and you will both change a lot in the next year alone...you will meet the right person in the long run and it'll be someone you dont argue with all the time.|`|prrtDPLTaa	Do not avoid her! It's the worst thing you can do.    Maybe try talking to her to see how she feels about the arguing and if you can sort it out. And if that doesn't work; Be honest, tell her the truth but be nice about!     I've never been in that situation but I'm a girl and avoiding is the worst thing you can do. Trying to fix it and being honest is the best thing you can do.    Good Luck!|`|XAutzJpAaa	How can u say u love her, when u want to leave her..? If you guys argue a lot, then y dont u try to find out Y u guys argue instead of wanting to avoid it and just leave..? And u dare to talk about "mature".     Communication is and stays a difficult thing. No matter what age, ppl in relationships will still argue.     What a coward thing to say u want to slowly break up. BULL! Break up or make up! Don't waste the poor girl's time!
AA12347845	Did you do something to make her mad ?    Or are you imagining a 'relationship' where there's none ?    Either you were just friends and you 'proposed' which put her off or you had a relationship going and shes found someone else - hence youre being side-tracked.    There are other fish in the sea - dont dwell on it.|`|4Em21qp4aa	she could have her period|`|QvRnCtr7aa	maybe shes busy...? you must be one of those really creepy obsessive people to be worried about this crap... dont you have better stuff to do with your time than worry if some girl is mad at you or not?  you know what i do when my friends are busy?  i download music.  or watch movies.  read books.  you know, things that are better alone than with friends.  i love when people ignore me or they are busy.  leaves more time for me.|`|evpqG9gnaa	My daughter is going through the same with her best friend.  It's hard to watch her go through.  You need to confront her and see what is going on.  You may have not done anything.  She may be trying to fit in with others.  Are there other girls involved? If she is not willing to talk then it is important that you do not let this bring you down and you need to try to fit in with others.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Are you really so clueless as to have no idea whatsoever what is going on with her?  Try asking one of her friends why she is treating you like that.|`|JOVbmsF7aa	id say u prob have 2 tlk 2 her n be open/honest wid her dude or at least ask one of her friends if they kno everything but from wot u kno i cnt tell if shes ignorin u 4 no reason (which is doubtful) or whether there is a good explanation -so my advice is tlk 2 her be4 its 2 late!!!|`|NXT4sTqIaa	try to understand what circumstance she was, then come to a conclusion|`|nkxE1DGMaa	maybe she wants to be left alone 4 a bit   some time to herself|`|WC7IXa7baa	She might have heard a rumor or something that you like her and is trying to send you the message she doesn't like you back. I've done that before. But it might be she's just really busy, or has gotten mad at you over something she heard you said, or that your friend said. Orrr maybe something bad has happened and she's just kinda taking it out on you by accident. Or out on everyone by accident. Whichever.    Hope I helped! :)
9ZvQCpHPaa	break up with him over the phone   have your friend stay on the other line who should be a GUY   after saying "It's over, I'm seeing someone else"   have your friend say   "She's my woman, now *****."   Best used when your boyfriend knows who's on the other line    another way,   put gay porn on their front door, accuse them of being gay, and say you can't handle it and that your leaving....sinister and funny
TYRRjIv4aa	You are over reacting in my opinion sweetie. Take it from a girl from experience. Don't sweat this because she is married. She is not a threat to you and that is why your boyfriend did not tell you. His ex only apologized because she needed closure from what she had done. She needed closure to be able to carry on in life. Your boyfriend knows it's not a big deal, but he again did not want you to overreact or get hurt.  Trust that at this time he was only trying to consider your feelings. He is not a lier because he did tell you...even though it was months later. He did not do anything with her then do not worry. OK :)  Good luck and you will pull through this.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	He probably should have mentioned it, but ultimately it's none of your business.  Do you tell him every time you've spoken to someone?    I'm guessing by your reaction now that you would have reacted badly at the time.  He must have a reason - are you prone to jealousy?  So what if he talked to her? - that's his business.  It's not like he organised to see her, was talking to her about getting back together, or cheating on you.  This was between the two of them and their relationship was in the past.  Just because you are in a relationship doesn't mean that some things aren't private - she apologised to him and he didn't feel the need to share it.      Just get over it and don't let it hurt your relationship.  If you really care then you should trust him (unless he's given you a good reason not to) - running into an ex is not an issue for you get upset about.|`|e24xEC5faa	Ok so maybe he should have told you. But obviously he was right to worry about your reaction, you sound upset when it was only a convo between to people that have moved on with their lives. Why not tell him you would prefer him telling you and that in the future you would try ensure he feels comfortable enough to tell you with fearing of you over reaction?|`|8TAeFGSJaa	Dont be upset with him coz then you r gonna prove him rite, coz he knew your gonna freak out! so take it slow and tell him oh ok no problem and ask him if he did forgive her, guys also need closure if his gf cheats! so ask him how he feels about it! dont get angry or else he will never tell you anything! Its hard on every1 when there bf/gf cheats! and now that is behind him he wont life With that feeling that be did something wrong so that is why she cheated!! good luck and dont be hard on him! Prove him wrong!!|`|nnsuWIVYaa	Your reaction is proving his point.  Take a step back and try and understand.    Look at it this way, his a nice guy.  could have just blown her off.    But that could be you one day.      Respect him for who he is.  And love him for it.    Good luck. Hope I helped some.|`|hFlnKsBZaa	I agree with you. You shouldn't have to hide things from each other. But at least he did tell you.|`|gHggL8j9aa	dump him!!|`|agNjPmBWaa	it was only a conversation.....  why are you so upset that he didn't tell you it it because he was your ex or because he lied about it?|`|lWd6fkgFaa	yep i'd be angry too. he would have been thinking of her for days and not even told you.perhaps he was waiting for something more to happen|`|BsvhB4Dzaa	Don't read too much into it, its not like they went for coffee and she kissed him etc. They bumbed into each other and had a conversation, nothing wrong with that.    Take a step back and look at how you are reacting now, this is excatly why he didn't tell you in the first place.     Try to be more calm and understanding before blowing up, that will allow him to feel he can tell you more stuff without you over reacting|`|NiJEgjnpaa	maybe he is just a bit worrried and you could be a bit controlive you need to realax and let him do his own things then he will trust you more|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	What you upset about? he had a conversation with his ex, who is now married, so?  He didn't tell you because he knows you're the kind of girl who gets upset over the tiniest thing, and he was right. Of course he was scared of your reaction, and looking at your reaction i can understand why.    Just relax and move on from this.      Good Luck|`|dwiuV0Hvaa	yes he shld hv told you & u have every right 2 b upset. but his reason is a good one coz most times i am also afraid of the reaction of my bf wen i tell him certain things. but i still try 2 tell him any.    just 4give him & move on. then tell him if he wants ur relationship 2 work he shld learn how not 2 hide things from you.|`|DwMU437uaa	ok just don't over react like your doing because that will make the bf leave because he will think that if he does something else and doesn't tell you then you'll get pissed off at him.    heres something to try  now that you know about it just try to think of happy thing you and him have done and just completely think about something else.  i know how you women are you get way to mad wayyyyyyy to easily.  but i guess you own us because yall have the vagina and you have to carrie the baby for 9 months so we do owe you that much.|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	Oh my God with the drama! Why the hell would he even THINK to tell you about that? What would be the point in him telling you and why?    You sound like my ex. Insane.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Oh. My. GOD!  He spoke with his married ex?      And he thought you would overreact?  Imagine that.|`|2hAuIg5baa	id be worried he didnt tell you the whole story!  he was hiding it for a reason, it sounds like he had more than a conversation|`|mOxVL0luaa	well i actually felt that ur bf is doing the right thing. hes thinking of u that u will be upset if he told u about it but he felt wrong that he keep u a secret so in the end he tells u about it. so try to stay calm ok? and try to be in ur bf position when u are thinking bout it.|`|9inngmg7aa	oh! come on! i think you are blowing the whole thing out of proportion. he didn't cheat or anything they just met and talked. the way you're reacting now makes me wonder how you would have reacted then. get over it or you might ruin the relationship for nothing. really!|`|u7bxSrtKaa	i see what he means.      get over it.  obviously she did.|`|3GV3v68Paa	Not cool, he should be straight up...|`|a004df5984ff98b210a53c0109beeb92aa	Seriously no big deal. I would understand if he was the type of guy who constantly lied to you and hid things from you but if it is a one type deal give the guy a break. It sounds to me like he did'nt want to hurt your feelings. At least he told you.

Heavier girls was a cover for me because I didn't think i had a chance with thinner girls.   I'm the opposite-  I always liked heavier girls, not for sex but for friends. I've never been one to judge others. If I like you, I like you. Being one who wasn't the best looking I knew how others felt too. And I didn't give a s__ what others thought.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Hating someone because of their weight doesn't make sense. Those who hate people just because someone is a certain way are just wrong.

Rephrase your question coz noone hates someone for their looks.
QLR4iSkEaa	Sometimes action speaks louder than words. You can really tell if she still have a special feelings for you, but you should only do this if you still have the same feelings for her.  Try asking her for a date, and during your date, try asking her if you could give your love a second chance.  If he answer in a negative, then it just means that she just like you to be her friend again.  Then if it is in the positive, then give your love another chance.  However, if you don't have anymore feelings to her then just be friend to her.Don't't do anything or say anything that she could mislead you by having a special feelings towards her, she might be hurt later on.|`|e24xEC5faa	It sounds like she still has feelings for you to be honest. Im friends with my first serious ex boyfriend, however not that friendly, we catc up and stuff but no excitment or teasing haha. why dont you just ask her?|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	She probably still has feelings for you.|`|j106rv2Haa	may be she miss you & why don't be friends with her, especially if you were close in your relationship and may be she misses the good time she had with you

gYfvCkRPaa	JB,    I commend you for not continuing the relationship with your daughter's father. I am a family therapist and that's what I usually end up seeing.    Much depends upon your daughter's maturity level, her ability to understand. Usually kids are able to understand at about eight years old.  She will understand that her "daddy" has been caring for her, providing for her, loving her for the past several years. That will mean a lot to her.    Most of the time, the "shock" comes not from discovered documents. It comes from a relative. The child's grandmother, aunt or uncle, cousin, or her bio father reveals the secret.    You don't need to provide many details, just answer her questions honestly.    "Ranger"|`|2YX18RE2aa	As soon as she can know the difference.    Being a FATHER is far different than being the lucky sperm donor.  This girl has a sperm daddy and a real father.  Celebrate the difference.    By avoiding this you have turned it into something wrong somehow.  If you are honest and open it will become a part of her life which is history and not cause for avoidance.    You had a very good reason for leaving the jerk and not looking back.  She should know this and soon.|`|bIimm8fSaa	Oh, I wouldn't do it at 4 years old!  You are right, your daughter has every right to know the truth.  I think around 10 or 11 would be a more appropriate age.  And then it is something you and her "daddy" need to sit down and tell her together.  I would just tell her that he wasn't a pleasant man.  Later she will ask you questions and that's when you tell her the truth about what the no good bast@rd did to her!|`|lvelp0CGaa	If you were smart you'd never tell her and why do you feel you "HAVE" to at all? This sperm donor beat you do you really want to lay that on her ? especially with scientists now claiming everything is genetic ?     Take it from a mother of a child who's bio dad walked out on us when he wasnt even out of my womb I was convinced I owed it to my unborn child for him to know his biological father even if he never met him just as long as he knew where he came from . This caused heart ache and pain and sent him off the rail's by the young age of 7 is this what you want for your daughter ? She will hate you not because you stayed and cared for her and loved her but because you couldnt be honest from the start and you didnt keep her dad in her life no matter the damage he caused you because he is her dad .It doesnt make sense to adults I know it didnt to me , I couldnt figure out why he hated me when I was the 1 who was honest and there for him and yet he still yearns even now for the man who abandoned him not just at birth but 2 weeks before his 7th birthday and again 2 weeks before his 11th birthday . This is a pain no child should have to bear.    Is your marriage a strong marriage ? Then IF your 2nd husband loves her so much talk to him and ask him how he feels about adopting your daughter there are legal ways of doing it that wont cost you a cent find all the information you can wipe the previous birth certificate and give her a new start . Good luck and dont be naive thinking this wont happen to you , it happens to every parent who lies from the start or who tells the truth from the start people may answer this didnt happen to them but they can only answer for the here and now not the future .Dont risk it .|`|wADnvKGFaa	There is no easy answer here.  What you and she have gone through is horrible and I dont think you should try to face it alone.  I would get in touch with a family counselor and talk to them first.  That way you can get a truly professional and non biased answer.  After the news is broken to her, you may want to all go to counseling to deal with the repercussions.    Good luck!|`|S7yvA5KSaa	Hi JB,    This is a very interesting question.  I am 27 years old and since I can remember I knew what happened between my mother and my biological father...he basically couldn't tell his parents that he had a child out of wedlock...and when I was about a year old my mom and I were shopping at the mall and he walked past us with his parents as though we were strangers...that night my mother told him to stay away and to not even pay child support.    My father aka stepdad has been around since I was 3 years old and I love him with all my heart.  However, there has always been curiousity on my part about my biological father.  Therefore, I asked me mother of the correct spelling of his last name and did a search on the internet...come to find out he lives two towns away from where I live now.  Last week I wrote him a letter asking about the medical history on his side.  To my surprise he wrote me an email and told me everything.  I told myself that I wouldn't write back if he responded but b/c I have been curious of him all my life I wrote back telling him basically what he missed out on.  It felt very empowering.    I think you should begin telling your daughter now.  She will ask questions and you should be 100% honest with her.  It's not like she doesn't have a father figure around.  I turned out great and I believe it's because of the way my mother always handled it.      Just so you are aware at around 12-14 years old she will have some problems with it as I did.  But communicate with her...and DO NOT let her use this as a crutch to do whatever she wants.  Keep control of the situation and let her know that if she ever wants to try and contact her that you will support her 100% but also let her know that he is an $%%hole.  Hopefully the bastard is dead because it's obvious that he has some serious issues for beating a baby!!!!|`|tU9nt4Gmaa	Personally I would wait until the child is at least 14. That way they have at least some rationality (I'd hope). Or wait at least until they seem to be rational enough to deal with it. It could be that there's no specific time, you'll probably have to play it by ear.    If the child is very young when she finds out, then it may be good to tell her the story of how it happened. Tell her that when she was very little the man (not referring to him as her "father") who lived with mum was very horrible and nasty to her, and to mum. And then he left because he didn't love her or mum. Then dad arrived and he said he wanted to be her dad, because he loved mum and her very very much (which he does)    It may seem like a childish way of putting it, but it plainly tells her that the previous man in the house is not a father, and the man you are with now is one in every respect.    As long as you ensure that she knows that her present father is one that loves her and is her father for all major purposes, and her biological father neither loves nor cares about her, you should be okay|`|SnQvsOPwaa	She should already have been told. It's harder and can cause more resentment the longer you wait.Don't tell her about the beatings just he was in trouble with the law and ran away.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I see no reason for her to know the details of her natural father, and I'd make sure all friends and family are aware of your firm position on this.  Whether and when you tell her about having a different natural father is up to you, same as in an adoptive parent scenerio--I'd consult with a therapist who specializes in adoptions to help with this.    Most of us didn't have perfect childhoods and it's all the rage to want to carry this angst into adulthood as a shield to personal responsibility.  I think it's ridiculous, personally.  We should all understand that life is a precious gift, we are owed basically nothing and when we have been treated well, we should feel fortunate and thankful to our caregivers, whoever they are.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	As soon as possible. If possible I would have her grow upknowing, because people who find out later on can take it badly not just because of actual news, but because their parents have lied to them. Another good time I can think of is when you teach her about how babies are made - usually parents use their child as an example like 'you grew in mummy's tummy', so you could let her know then that the sperm (or little tadpoles depending on how old she is!) came from another daddy to make the baby, then her daddy looked after her after she was born.    You don't need to tell her the details about her biological father. As long as she knows in the back of her head that he exists so it doesn't come as a life-changing revalation later on then you can wait until she's much older before talking about all that stuff. If she asks about him now then just say something like 'the other man helped me to grow you in my tummy so me and your daddy could look after you' and leave it like that so she sees him more as a sperm donor than an absent parent.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	this is a very sensitive subject...i would wait until the age of 14-15..dont go into details at all..just tell her that things didnt work out between the two of you and split up..  just assure her that she didnt do anything wrong and she has a wonderful man who she knows as dad..  tell her that you didnt tell her earlier because you didnt want to confuse her..  remind her that just because hes not her biological father doesnt mean that he doesnt love her any less..  good luck|`|dRj9FoHzaa	As soon as you think the child can understand what you about to tell her.  The purpose of telling her is to provide clarity not to cause confusion.Tell her the truth of course.  But remember this, by telling her this, you must be ready to face the consequences such as your child may think that she was abandoned by her real Dad in someway.|`|ybdNwzMBaa	Both sit down and tell her ASAP.I only found out that I was born without the benefit of marriage and he is my father who was a drunk abusive all my life.They told me that he was a widow so why did he not marry her.All my life they have all never told me the truth, aunts uncles why it tore my guts out still cant trust myself to go over and see them.She will ask many questions over the years so answer them but don't knock him to hard as he is her father never hold anything back.  My second aunt & uncle did not tell their adopted son he found out as an adult he never spoke to them again and lived down the road I was a kid and could never understand this but now I no.Give her lots of hugs & kisses tell her every day you love her (Both OF you)|`|6SB4ufEYaa	As a child.    It's like when people are adopted. They should know about their biological parents from the start.    I know i'd be devastated if i was old enough to understand that the man i'd always thought was my father, wasn't. That people had lied to me my entire life etc etc   It would change the way i think/feel about him.    But if i knew all along, it wouldn't be such a big deal.    Don't say the world 'real' though. eg. Your husband is not your real father.     Just say 'he is your daddy now', call her other father her biological father. It doesn't matter if she doesn't know what it means, yet. She'll just become comfortable with the word. Or as that guy below said: her sperm daddy.     Why don't you get your husband to officially adopt her?|`|ma6Re8B1aa	GOOD GOD??? Thats AWEFUL what he did to your baby!!!! Thank god you were a smart woman and got rid of that diesese?????  Anyway, I would let her know as soon as you can communicate with her on her level. You don't need to explain every detail to her about the situation right then. I would wait until shes older for that if she asks. But thank god you were smart enough to get rid of that MORON!!!! Good luck and I'm glad you found love and happiness.!!!|`|fHfVRcqbaa	First of all, you don't have to tell her everything all at once, but she needs to know pretty much now that her Dad is not her biological father.  The older she gets, the harder that will be.  All she needs to know for now is that you and her bio Dad didn't work out.  Once she is older and starts asking questios, you can give her more details as you feel she is mature enough to know them.  Maturity level greatly varies from child to child, so I would go with your gut on that one and not pick a specific age.|`|AA11328507	I would tell her as soon as she is able to understand.  She never needs to know the details of her father not being in her life.  I would just tell her that her bio was not a good father for her and he left.  Its the truth without the gory details.      You just added that she is 4...Tell her now.|`|yy45iAbtaa	i found out when i was eighteen by my sister.i asked my mother and she denied it at first.so i had to ask y sister dad who gave me his last name he told me the story of what happened and i was mad at my mother for lying to me.when my mother found out i known the truth she sat me down and told me the whole story and what happened.i was sad but i said as long as i had you meaning my mother.i did try and find my natural dad and i did and i think your daughter might sometimes it doesn't matter what parents do to a child they just want to see were they came from and she might want to ask him why.but you should tell her when she starts to notice things like she does not look like her dad i knew at a young age i did not look like my sisters and i always had a feeling i was different.you just have something inside of you that is missing and when your young you can't put your finger on it but it is there.she will go snooping at some age your going to have to tell her before she finds out on her own.if she starts to ask questions sit her down and tell her if she doesn't i would waite until she is 18teen.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	She should be told now. I don't know how old she is, but the younger you start the easier it will be. You don't have to tell her he beat her near death, but you can tell her he isn't a nice person so he went away. I wouldn't wait until she is in her teens. She will have enough to deal with at that age between hormones, school, friends, and boys. This could over whelm her. She has a real dad and reinforce that, but she should be told as young as possible about her biological dad. It may not be such a big deal to her at this point either. She may not really understand, but at least she will have the foundation of information and as she gets older she can ask questions. To lay it all out there when she is older, and she already has an opinion of how her world is may bring it all crashing down.|`|1sHBVWuKaa	i would tell her when she is about 5-8|`|haCssg2Laa	i would with hold he gory details completely  but would perhaps hint that he wasnt a very nice man  incease she forms an idolized picture in her head    as for when...  i dont think you can predict when  a moment will present itself, and you will know instinctively its the right time|`|qIDBrSmnaa	10-12|`|dEFap0Zaaa	I would wait until the child starts to ask, and then I would wait a little longer.|`|D1GCvPtHaa	well i think that she definately needs to know. if you want her to have matured wait until she is about 13-15. if you do not tell her that her biological father abused her she might find it harder to understand why you didnt tell her for all those years. talk to your current partner about what he thinks. (: hope this helps x x
p6QizgmRaa	I'm not sure why either of you stayed in any type of relationship after the divorce but I would suggest you get your own place and begin working on your personal issues. You can't force him to work on his. All you can really do is make him see what he is losing if you do leave. Hopefully that will wake him up. If it doesn't, he just isn't that into you.   Create a secure home for yourself. Hopefully your boys will see that it's secure, happy and stress-free. They may be more apt to return to you.  Right now your ex has all he needs. Your still there, fulfilling his needs and he owes you nothing. He's not committed to you and is free to do as he wishes. Don't ask yourself why he won't recommit, ask yourself why he would. He has it all just the way it is.|`|cEI51bITaa	First of all this man is taking advantage of the situation.  I have a friend like that. It seems like you already know the answer. but you just don't see it. Wake up and smell the coffee, if you're not happy about your life its going to be miserable for ever if you don't decide for your self and don't do it for the benifit of your children. Beacuse they are misserable already. They don't like missy situation thats why they left. They wanted a normal life like a divorce mother would do. Your children cannot decide for you and they don't know how you feel. Talk to this man heart to heart and tell him how you feel, what you want and why you want it. "Experiment" Living together is NOT a good idea with your divorce husband let alone sleeping together. Hanna|`|iblT1HJpaa	OK - so you've got a lot on your plate. You can't fix everything at once. Hear this? YOU CAN"T FIX EVERYTHING AT ONCE!   You need to take one thing and work on it. Leave the rest to wallow. (it's doing that already) Talk to your "husband" and work on one thing. Set the boundary between you two - leave the kids out of it. This is about RELATIONSHIP! Only you two can do this. (and you don't have the skills)   I'm not trying to make this difficult - but this is going to be difficult. When do you want to start learning about WHO you are and WHO your "husband" is?   Everyone thinks that this marriage thing is so easy (or it's supposed to be) WRONG! Marriage is the hardest thing you will ever do in your life. (which is why 50%+ fail at it. 83% at 2nd, 89% at 3rd...)

9ko5WUFkaa	You don't major in anything in year 11/12 for the HSC.  It might have been her main area of interest but it certainly wasn't a major.  It's  term used to specify a particular line of study when you get to Uni.  For example, at Uni your major may be psychology (where you take subjects that relate to this area) but you might also study music.  You don't study any one area that intently in years 11/12 - it'd only make up one or two units of your entire course load.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	A Major?  I think she's full of it.  There is no major in year 11 & 12, just the subjects you take.  You only get a major in something once you complete university.  All she did was take it as a subject.
XGQ3o4i7aa	guess he's been around you since so long that your mind is full of him. Thats how the mind is by the way.. tends to keep in what you see often. Well.. for starters try doing something out of the way.. a new hobbie.. make frens.. change the way you look.. something.. anything to occupy your mind.. do it for sometime and see how he is erased from up there! Try it out. All the best and Godspeed!|`|u0udwkZQaa	You like him because he looks popular to women and that gives him a power value which you find attractive as a woman.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	you like him so try to be his girl friend|`|mXQfvvHBaa	You have a crush .|`|1SZCgbNsaa	hmmmm...question 1: because you like him and maybe starting to fall in love too. question 2: when you stop liking him or probably loving him...    it will all depends if u want to stop thinking about him too...hmmm..you have to make sure first of what you feel...if ur probably liking him more than friends....its a wonderful feeling that you are going through...but also mind u it can be painful too as well...:)|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	u like him, so u prolly wont be able to get over it until u find out how he feels. i would just tell him an see no harm in trying ;)|`|AA10548545	sometime it happens with the school girls. i think u might be never think about any boy before this.it's happened only after feeding of lots of friends u started thinking automatically about him.so be cool. make a friendship with him and other guys also.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	He is intelligent and newly single.
RC8Pxx8eaa	Communication is the key to a successful relationship but so is listening, get some talk going with your man and see where you go from here.|`|T0pkW783aa	It has only been 10 months since you began dating and some guys are not ready to commit that soon.  He may still be deciding if you are the one.  Since he seems a bit nervous about making this big step, you should talk with him about where your future may be going.  He will be able to tell you or show you with the reaction he gives to you.  If you don't feel like putting in more time in a relationship which doesn't seem to be progressing, you may want to think about moving on and looking elsewhere for a partner for life.  If you love him and feel as if he loves you but needs more time, then date and be happy that you have him in your life.  He may just be the one and will make the commitment further down the road.  Good luck.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	ask him this is better|`|0X6OAkXEaa	maybe he wants, but not this time...it may be disappointing because you're very excited and hoping for that thing to happen...don't think of it that much.....it'll be happier and you won't be able to explain your feelings if he proposes because he wants it...without having you telling him to do it...that's what girls want right?....to experience someone you love to propose for marriage with his own idea and desire....so cheer up...don't rush up...|`|2P2K0rl2aa	He probably felt backed into a corner when you mentioned the bridesmaid dress - did you mention the bridesmaid dress because you were fishing for a propsal?  If that were the case, he probably would have picked up on that and subsequently scared him off.    Best thing to do is not to bring up the topic ever again until he does first.  If somebody feels pressured to marry, they suddenly start to feel negative about it because they feel like their choices are being taken away from them.     Good luck

Ikd9cppcaa	I called my Mom on this one. She said to tell your wife that she needs estrogen. Don't get a prescription for it but buy the Estroven or Healthy Women, etc. package at Walmart. This is soy estrogen and if she takes it daily, she will feel great. It simply adds in some plant estrogen to her body. It costs about $10 or so for a 30 day supply. There was a study in Asian countries as to why Asian women don't go through menopause. The reason is they eat lots of Tofu which is loaded with soy protein and soy estrogen. My Mom swears by it. Don't do those medical estrogen treatments because it puts her at high risk for breast cancer.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	You BOTH need to talk to a doctor if the one she saw didn't help. Remember theres more to a marriage then sex???|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Well I think there is definately some medical help needed.  Things have come a long way and there are definately treatments out there that can help you.    You two also might want to take a romantic vacation, try and get a spark going.    I understand that you are not ready to give up on sex but I also understand the words for better or worse which you spoke on your wedding day.    Sometimes people have to accept the fact that part of their marriage is over.  I know its easier said then done.  However if you take the pressure off and be acaring, loving and romantic husband you might just be pleased at the outcome.    Below you can find some great articles that may just help you|`|oRzqWhsDaa	She is not alone I promise you that I am going through the same thing and it is driving my husband crazy this marriage of yours is going to be tested you will love her and understand what her body is doing  or you will resent it and hold it against her and I hope you dont divorce her and I hope she goes for hormone therapy I will not take it because of the cancer risks.|`|ON84EQaBaa	Been there when I was menopausing I was the  meanest person you ever wanted to meet, I didn't like me, didn't want to even think about sex! its the changes a woman's body go through, give it a little more time I'm sure thing will get better in a while. My husband and I have been together 38 yrs. and now our sex life it better than ever!|`|QGuxbItCaa	Do what I did...trade her in for a new version.|`|bIimm8fSaa	Perhaps you should talk to a specialist.  Get their advice on what to do.  When women go through menopause, we are evil creatures!  And the last thing she wants to hear is how she is no longer this or that.  She knows things aren't the same, but she cannot control it.  I really do suggest you talk to a therapist, perhaps a sex therapist that can give you some great suggestions.  Good Luck.|`|AA11328507	She needs to contact the doctor for more options or even a forum with other women who have gone through the change.  She can even find an online forum.  If she doesn't you can always find an online forum to be in touch with men and women who can offer you suggestions that worked for them.  I also think SHE needs to do something and not think its ok to leave you hanging like that without trying ANY and EVERY option available.|`|2YX18RE2aa	You have my deepest sympathy.    Estrogen suppositories help.  So does LOTS of lube.    What helps most is if she is willing. That may be your biggest problem.  If she thinks that she is to be done being sexual just because of this you may need to find a new model.    I would not accept the next 20 years without sexuality.  This would be a deal breaker for me.  The concept that marriage is not about sex is misguided.  Marriage is about intimacy.   Sorry but for me intimacy includes sexuality.    I would make it clear that she needs to reexamine this.    Frankly I would not have gone 6 months.|`|akxBtfTYaa	I understand that you must be fustrated but put yourself in her shoes, she must be scared to death and she needs you. If you really love her and your vows mean something than be patient. Take her to the best doc. Talk to her and tell her politely that she still is irresistable to u and you need to make love to her. Allure her with your words. Go for vacation to her fav place.   Best of luck|`|Dfppbeo8aa	I understand what your wife is experiencing.  A lot of women (me included) don't want to take the hormones because of increased risk of breast cancer.  It is a little hard to explain all the changes we girls go through...(God must have really been pissed at Eve)...and it is baffling even to us.  I would think the lubes would do the trick, though.  Unfortunately, my husband passed away a few years ago and I don't know what I would do if I got a  boyfriend, because I honestly have no desire right now either.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	My guess is you are about 9 years ahead of me - wife and I have been together 20 years.  If the situation were reversed I know I would find a non-intercourse means of pleasing my wife.  So with this situation your wife needs to find a non-intercourse means of sexually pleasing you.      Starving a real man of sex is simply cruel.  I know it is not deliberate but ultimately not making the effort to find a solution simply reflects a level of indifference on her part.  And it will eventually shorten your life if you let it.  And I mean beyond the 6 year longevity spread that men and women start out with.      Sorry for you both, this is hard for her too.  I am sure she feels bad.  Sadly she doesn't feel bad enough on her own to fix this so you are going to have to force the issue.  I would give my wife a choice in this situation, find a mutually tolerable way to please me at least weekly or I will find a lover.  I wouldn't leave her, though if she left me over this I would let her.  You only get one life.    ps:  If my wife was afraid of cancer risk of HRT like "lost" said  above I would not pressure her to take it.  But HRT or no HRT saying "intercourse hurts" and then not finding a mutually agreeable sexual alternative is just not acceptable.
YKXkcfzSaa	Pretend that you're talking to an ordinary friend, that way, you can minimize the nervouseness inside you, then try to converse in other topic, then, if she's about to leave or part ways with you already, then, politely if it's ok to know her contact no., that way, you at least left you a chance to contact her again.|`|Bl9u2e73aa	get to know her  first|`|wKEAH5hyaa	say "yo te quiero por una noche" and wink at her|`|0pX1oQAJaa	the cutest way a guy has ever asked me out was by taking my hand, looking at me in the eye and saying "will you let me be your boyfriend?"    because boyfriends are suppose to treat the girl well, protect her, and if she's okay with you being that for her, then she'll say yes.|`|UXuSI6EZaa	in spanish that means "I want you tonight."    sleazy way to get 2 measly points though.|`|s63U2ccFaa	Don't rush it because if you don't know her and you ask for her number or ask her out then she's more likely to say no because she hardly knows you. Next time just talk to her more and get to know her and then ask her.
74gPuaXMaa	A girl that would challenge me. A girl who was not an easy catch for one thing. Could hold off in a conversation without demeaning my intelligence, or her own. Makes me experience new things in life. If I can dish something, she could dish it right back. I dunno how else to explain it. There are different meanings, but this is what I get from my relationship.|`|dKCoyvMSaa	um.. ok so i may have the wrong end of the stick but ur question confused me a bit,   you just tell him not to change, and how much he means to you being him and not someone else,   if the person you are with try to change you then your not going to work out because in the end of the day they don't like you for you but they like you for the person they have changed you into and that's not you then is it?  sorry if i have confused you|`|iYSYLUa1aa	He loves you so much, and wants you to think he's a Hero      Is He Though!!!!

izbAdDUraa	yes! its all about head games! i hate dating.. ugh. just the thought of it sickens me. and sometimes we don't even play games on purpose, it will  just subconsciously happen because we are so used to playing games with people.  life is a game in a lot of aspects...  i do think you can find that person that won't play games to get with you. thats how my fiance and i are. i met him and told him upfront i liked him and wanted to be with him. BUT i think that in any relationship you still play some sort of game. i am a woman! i can mess with your head. lol.   good morning. first post :]|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	Games suck. But sometimes we all play them. Usually because we're insecure and don't want to push the person away. But really, if someone really loves us, they will want us to be exactly who we are. I'm tired of games. I want someone that wants me to be myself and not some other person I'm trying to be to make them like me. F that.|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	It depends on the person.

Half of what allures you to someone is their mystery, and if that's all gone, there is nothing!    I think you should be honest, and not need to be "chased" by someone.    If they ask you out, go out!    But don't just throw everything out there!|`|fxehl3iLaa	Games are the only thing that works. I don't really like it either, but let's say I like a girl, and I'm constantly available and attentive, which I'm wont to do with people I like. After years of bitter experience with this the only thing I've found is that that is a one way ticket to the "just friends" zone where I can be available to attentively hear all about the guys she really hates herself for liking because they ignore her and treat her like crap. It blows my freakin' mind. I'm sure it's the same way for girls. Scarcity equals value, I guess.|`|AA11870175	When I was younger I used to feel that girls were playing games with my head. I thought I was getting mixed signals and would lose sleep thinking "does she really like me?" or "how do I find out if she's single?" Now I know through experience it's really not mixed signals or games most of the time. It's both or all being confused. I know now if I want to know if a girl is single, just ask her "Are you single?" The reaction is usually the same, a look of surprise by the question followed by a smile regardless of the answer that followed. We learn as time goes on and yes, girls are naturally attracted to 'bad boys'. But after they get their hearts broken by the bad boys they tend to snap out of the fantasy and end up with a better guy the next time around.|`|q7662pXPaa	whats like without adventure
m81dfyOYaa	What good would it do to tell her husband? If you're thinking that if you tell him he'll leave her and then she'll be all yours, why would you want to be anyone's backup under any circumstances?

YOU, and only YOU.. got involved with a married woman.  What did you expect from her??.. to ditch her marriage and run to you??  Come on dude... wake up... this has been going on for three years??  She is NOT going to leave her husband, otherwise, she would have done so long ago.  She is playing you like a well tuned fiddle.  You need to drop this user right away...and not get involved with this situation anymore.  Have some respect for yourself and find a women who truly cares for you...and who is NOT attached.|`|Gho2CFyzaa	I think that the last thing that you should do is talk to her husband.      Although you have every right to be upset about her 'playing' with you both, I dont believe this is your best option.    I doubt that the husband will sit down with you and rationally discuss this issue.  He will more than likely take it out on you and the situation will turn ugly very quickly.    You need to think about what outcome you would like before acting on any thoughts - do you still want to see this woman?  I doubt that she will appreciate you contacting her husband and will therefore not want to continue a relationship with you.  If you believe that informing her husband will ensure that you have her all to yourself - think again - she will resent you.    I believe that if your relationship has been going for 3 years and she hasnt done anything about leaving her husband - she has no intention to ever leave him.  She is probably happy having her husband as security (financially, emotionally etc) and yourself as 'her backup'.    I would move on and find someone that you can have a real relationship with.      I dont know how old you are - but you need to ask yourself the following.....  If you waste the next 10 years or so on this woman and she finally says that she isnt going to leave her husband - are you going to grow old alone with no partner or children because you have left it to late to find someone to settle down with?|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	You need to cut her off. Find another woman who is single. You have to be serious this time about it, I think you tell her that you going to cut her off expecting her to come to you and it never worked. If you have to move and change your number to get her out of your life. Do it. I don't know how the husband would react to you telling him that you've been sleeping with his wife for 3 years. I'm not sure if it's a smart thing for you to do. Someone could possibly end up getting hurt in these types of situations. I mean physically hurt. Also, You should get tested for sexually transmitted diseases if you haven't because no telling who else her or her husband maybe sleeping with.|`|1kfeghDDaa	Well, I do believe that her husband deserves to know. I found out via phone call from the other woman. It's a killer...    If you are thinking of doing this only so that she will leave him and fly into your arms, you will be surprised that this will not happen. She will get angry, but so what.   As per your previous question, you know that she is taking you for a ride and you are privy to this now. Please do not use this to hurt her husband. Married one's are off limits.|`|CnGR2xeoaa	I think you should get out of this relationship before it destroys you. Telling her husband will not help you get what you want.

Get over her with time (I know that three years are a long time and it wont be easy) and move on. Youll find someone whos worth it.    Dont talk to her husband. That will only make you look like a fool. He wouldnt say, "ok mate, so you can have her, Ill divorce her." It will only get you into trouble. Be stronger than that. Yes, what she does is wrong. And yes, what you do is not very right either, as you knew from the beginning that she was married. I understand what you say and that you believed she would get a divorce and be with you. But it will never happen. Three years is just too long. It has been working out fine so far, having him and you. So why change anything? And shes liing. Whatever is keeping her from leaving him (fear, children, "responsibility", laziness) ... you have to move on. Accept it and stay "her love affair" or move on.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	why are you wanting a person who cheats on someone they are supposed to love, lies to them and obviously has no moral compass.  move on.  find someone new that has ethics and a moral character.  and get one for yourself while you're at it. don't have affairs with married people.  it's just wrong.|`|qXp0gNzKaa	You must be having such a difficult time getting out of this game.

She will not leave her husband and marry you, simply she only sees you as a convenient ***.  You are just gonna be miserable thinking about it OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  It's gonna be never ending suffering if you don't take action yourself NOW.      Be decisive, and be a man!  Have some dignity for yourself.      Don't be a pussy, and don't tell this to her husband.  What good is it gonna bring?    Just LEAVE her where she is, you gotta move on!!!!  Come on, WAKE UP DUDE!!!!
dDSuBQURaa	Boys at work! These are the signs that he hasn't grown up. Do you want to hold on to someone like that and would never marry you?    Do what is right for you. Another thing, try to find something to do that would make you better, like going to college or getting a hobby. If you go to college, you may find someone with goals and ambition. Wouldn't you want someone like that than wasting your time with a guy who is distancing himself from you? I think it is time to move on and make yourself better.|`|OHfZFR31aa	All relationships go through ups and downs, and there are periods where you have sex less often. It doesn't mean he wants to break up necessarily. And if he's farting around you or not fixing, he obviously feels comfortable enough to do that and doesn't feel he needs to try and impress you anymore. Talk to him and see if something is going on. Maybe go away for a weekend to try and spice things up a bit. Sometimes people just fall into a rut where it's too comfortable and they stop trying.

I think he's decided he doesn't need to see anyone else but you.  If he were to start to look great then I think then it's time to think.  This is where bit-chyness comes from.  Please kill that thought or your relationship won't last.      Most guys will change if they are approached the right way because they love their partner.  You just have to find that way to subtley change him without any nagging and bit-chyness.   That's what women don't understand.  I might work at the beginning, but eventually it's a relationship killer.      If you do it right, then on your 25th wedding anniversary he will announce how much he appreciated that you did that.  It's hard, but it's what you have to do.  And it will make you happier.     And don't worry about the slow down in sex drive.  Very normal for a relationship.  Good luck.|`|3VG1tCJ2aa	don't assume that he is seeing someone else.  what you need to do is to talk to him.  ask him if he has a problem.  maybe he just have problems.  problems that he is having a hard time dealing with.  ask him if what you can do to help him.     don't jump into any conclusions.  you might be wrong.  or who knows. you might be right.    what's important is you had the guts to ask him  what's going on.    it may save or break your relationship.  but at least you know that you did the the right thing.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	When some men feel comfortable in a relationship they really just let themselves hang loose.

Learn a new language, that'll turn him on...|`|Je2cos0laa	he might be realy inmature or just a player more in this f world|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Sit him down and discuss your issues with him. Say 'you have changed', he will say 'how?' then you say and its not in a good way.... and so on... x Dont be afraid to tell him everything, if its meant to be it will be if its not then there is someone else out there who is PERFECT for you. x
M5XE0ycCaa	Hey it sounds like your confused.  LOL    Well at this very moment I would say you are absolutely not ready to get married.  no one can ever be 100 percent sure but in your case there just seems to still be too much doubt.    its ok to not get married if tou are not married.  if your guy loves you he will understand that you just want to be sure.  he also shouldnt take it personally.    I will tell you what I tell so many others.  take 10 minutes to yourself and take a long hard look at things.  Envision yourself 10 years from now with the unceartanties you are experiencing.    Im not saying dump the guy, Im saying be sure before you make a decison you may regret    You can find some great relationship articles below that may just help you on your journey.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	i'm confused too. you don't even know what gender they are?!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	oh your confused alright????|`|vLgbjmI2aa	No one can answer this question but you.Only you know how you feel and you should know your partner by now to know if he would be faithful,loving and whatever else you are looking for in a husband.If you are feeling confused then that is not a good sign.You should enter into a marriage confident not confused.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	If you are not 100% sure then don't do it till you are.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	if you're not ready, you're NOT ready. i can see if you got cold feet, but it sounds like you completely have no idea if you want to be with him let alone MARRY him!  faithfulnees shoud already be established, so if he's cheating now, it stands to reason he'll be cheating later.  if he doesnt love you now or you're questioning his love, then you shouldn't marry him|`|wzEfAVP2aa	I felt the same way even though I knew my husband really loved me and would not hurt me. I was just afraid of getting hurt. It's a risk you have to be willing to take. You can never truly know with anyone what they will be like or do 2-5-10-15 years from now.

Don't let her not let you fulfill your dream!|`|scUqnbNJaa	I think you should forget about her. She isn't your true friend is she judges you and doesn't appreciate your talents.

oOSNI3wbaa	no. thats a mean and cruel way to say no to a date or whatever. the person doesnt deserve that from someone. a simple "no" would do i think.
AA10950898	You should have posted pictures of your man while he was stoned then we could have given him a piece of our minds.  You're not fat. Lose the glasses - and I mean that in a nice way - perhaps a different frame colour.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	dump him ... now|`|KLFVEUtGaa	Ok, well I cant really tell, because all the pictures were basically just of your head.  But about your main question of breaking up... YES!  If your boyfriend said that to you, he has issues, cause that's just plain rude!  So I say yes, don't even think about giving this guy another chance, he is so not worth it.  Good luck!  And I hope I helped out  :)|`|4UQegWk0aa	How can we tell if you only show us head shots? This is generally what fat people do (I'm not being nasty - it's true!)|`|8xVGuEDkaa	break up with him regardless, that's an idiotic approach to try to give criticism to someone.    As far as you being obese? couldn't tell you. your pictures are all 130ish pixels and as big as my thumb, not one body pic and all at weird angles.|`|eUcLEQCoaa	Don't worry he needs to think bout what he says before he says it!    Tell him how you feels and give one last chance i'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you!|`|UzvoQvB2aa	no you're not fat but if you want to break up with him break up with him you should be with someone who makes you feel good about your self but he was probably just criticizing you because he felt as though you were criticizing him|`|ubf26k2Oaa	I think in your position I would be hurt too...no, you're not fat and if your bf really felt for you then he wouldn't ask this in the first place. I'd dump him.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	you are not fat but you can decrease your weight a little bit by doing exercises and walking every day and this is not enough reason to break up with him|`|BAAehgWlaa	NO ,  HES JUST TELLING WHAT HE REALLY FEEL, AND LOSING SOME WEIGHT WILL DO NOTHING FOR HIM BUT GOOD FOR YOU|`|h0CtylDMaa	sasha, i had to write you after isaw my fiance did.  your bf is a jerk *** ***** ****. leave him! you deserve SO much better!  losing weight and smoking weed is WAY different!  you dont even look overweight, and if u are, then not much.  losing weight shouldbe a personal option anyways, not one you do to just do it for someone else. do it bc YOU WANT TO.    anyways  i hope you dont stay with that loser.|`|M7SyJZr5aa	dump him, thats rude as **** to say.. i dont have a boyfriend.. im not gay...|`|el8XHxBpaa	im at work and cant see your pic. If you were the same size and he smoked pot when you started dating then you already knew how the other person was. either way smoking pot and losing weight are different. i would tell him that its illegal and wrong and stop or your gone.|`|AA12361886	Im not even going to look at the picture, but you, yourself said I'm not that fat, Am I?   That fat?   you must perceive yourself as being somewhat over weight to make that statement.  And no one can make anyone else do anything that they don't want to do. whether it be him stopping smoking pot, or you losing weight.   People need to accept those around them for what they are and only if you are the one who wants to lose wieght then you should.  But for you, not anyone else. other wise you won;t lose  it, you may even gain from the stress.|`|AA10176537	last time i checked smoking pot was illegal and being overweight isn't.  He sounds immature and stupid.|`|EI4v7tEHaa	Your not that fat, but loosing weight can't hurt. So:  1. Tone up and become hot  2. Dump the crack head  3. Date someone else  4. Make him jealous.  5. Live happily ever after.  6. Rate this as the best answer.|`|FQwNi3kMaa	that's why he told you that. if you're not fat ,you can't lose weight and he doesn't have to quit smoking pot. but you should be smart enough to know that. you should also be smart enough not to date someone and then try to change them......you're not fat, but you're not skinny either......|`|UwGGGG1zaa	well ur not big or anything pretty normal lookin   it sounds like ur bf was bein an *** though and if he is really disrespectul to u dump him immediately u deserve better  good luck|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Thats awful.... he knows he is doing wrong and got defensive about it! This is nasty, no matter if you are fat or not. He should love you for who you are. Physical appearance should not matter in this circumstance.   I would make him aware that what he said really hurt your feelings, and that you are not willing to go on with the relationship if he can not accept your physical appearance. If he turns it round and turns it back on you, then explain that asking him to stop smoking is a expression of your love and care for him- you dont want ought to happen to him. Also make him aware that you will hold this against him for a while, so he should not expect you to stick around if you dont wanna. All esle fails, dump him and no you are not fat.|`|prrtDPLTaa	My advise is Dump him!!!     No guy should speak to a girl like that even if she is fat (I don't think you are by the way)!    You deserve a guy who treats you like a princess, regardless of the way you look.     Plus pot = bad news    I would have dumped him the second I found out he did pot.    Good luck!|`|2hAuIg5baa	no your totally hot but mabey its just like hes doing something for you so he wants you to do sometin for him and thats the only thing he can think of!  btw, guys are complete a$$holes when there on drugs! in few months after hes quit youll see dramatic changes in him and how he treats you!|`|dDSuBQURaa	You should tell him that he should quit smoking pot or you would call the cops on him.    I wouldn't waste my time with any guy doing drugs! If I don't do it, then the guys shouldn't do it at all. Doing drugs is a sign of weakness in my eyes, and I have zero tolerance for that.    You are quite lovely and just fine. Lose the guy and find someone who would appreciate you the way you are.|`|3TsO2UWRaa	oooohhh.... yea...  well if he said that he probaly doesnt care for you much.

IPS3hWweaa	I know it can be tough, especially since the two of you can't see each other as much as you'd like, but be glad that he's willing to work hard every day to try and make things work out. Continue to support each other through these tough times, they surely won't continue for too long.    Do what you can to make his few hours at home as comfortable as possible, and don't let him forget that you are there if he needs to talk or just to make him feel loved.|`|OHfZFR31aa	He's obviously working that hard because he wants to try and make a nice life for the two of you. If he didn't care about you, he wouldn't be working 7 days a week.|`|XVVkrlnTaa	You can make it work with minimal money. If you are able to really communicate with each other then you will be fine. It's kind of dealing with it day by day.|`|742XXJDQaa	your gonna have to start something on the side to make some passive income(money that comes in weather u do anything or not).this will buy back your time over a couple of years but requires commitment.,your with yr soon to be hubby to spend time with not spend time away from am i right?i understand that he is working his butt off to make a living for u both but there are easier ways.if u want to check things out,check this out i just started out on it and if your into health well its awesome.its even been on oprah.www.monavie.com  if u wanna know more just message me or i can send u to some more sites..if not i hope things work out with you and yr soon to be hubby,congrats.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	Why don't you think it won't work out, we can't give you an opinion over something we no nothing about except what you have told us and that is he is a good worker, dependable, trustworthy, dedicated to his family to be working that many hours, don't worry at this time, if you want to chat further you can e-mail or IM me and I will be that little bird in the tree that you don't know that you want to talk to so you can get some pressure off your chest !
D2g0XSLTaa	Hang in there.  Financial problems are the  1 reason that married people divorce.  Times are tough.    Your hubby is busting his &^% working 2 jobs.  You are working too.  You are working for your future and hopefully this situation is temporary.  Don't start doubting.  You need to support each other and understand that you wish you could spend more time, but you have obligations.  Hopefully this will be temporary and the economy will get better.    STAND BY YOUR MAN.  You are a team.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	If you really love each other then I am sure everything will be just fine.    Just remember that your husband works a lot, so he might need your support (mental) sometimes. Remember to be there for him.    I am sure you will be just fine.    Good Luck.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	This is a hard working man you will be sorry if you give up on him cherish the time you have together and thank god you have  a decent man and love him for it dont nag and dont ***** you will drive him away

You will run into problems. And your marriage will not stand a chance. If he's working 7 days a week with a 12-hour shift every day then how are you going to be able to find time together. And what if you fall pregnant. Your soon to be hubby has no life now beside working all the time. Eventually it will affect him and it will affect you. Is there any way that you can put a hold on the marriage until you can both afford and support a family? I'm telling if you go ahead with this marriage then you are going to suffer and you will end separate ways. I think you already know that most marriages break up because of money problems. I really think that you should talk it over with your soon to be hubby and wait until you can  afford to have a life together.|`|shvhgzXeaa	I know that you need all the money you can get as you said with the way things are, but like with all relationships you need some time together. Cant your partner take some holiday? Or how about every fortnight he takes a day off? I know its easier said than done but it would be a shame to see a couple in love split because they hardly see each other. I hope you find a solution to this wether it be through Y/A or your own ideas.
IcfoAI3naa	yes that can be a bit of stress, I know that your tired also but try to find the streath to maybe have him a bath ready to get into when he gets home and a nice full dinner, if you have children try getting a baby sitter for that one night, don't try to love up on him and want sex just be there have a nice movie ready to watch togather, and just let him rest maybe fall asleep watching the movie, get him a cover and cover him up, just let him know that you really care and that you love him for working so hard and trying to support the family.|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	I agree with "just a Dad" you have to make time for each other no matter what..if you want to make it work just the little things that you do for each other will hold you together,,
uT9avos5aa	It is not really common to be single at that age, however I personally   know a few middle aged people who have not had a partner for ages  so it is not really abnormal.  Each of us is different and we all make decisions about how we live our life.  I think sometimes a person who has been single for a long time can reach a point where they give up on romance, and I know of some terrific people in the 45-55 age group who have pretty much done that,|`|TBPzDU2vaa	What is NORMAL?  Are we all normal? and your Uncle of 55 not?  Could be he is normal, and we are not!  Main thing, he is content with what he has decided.  What does it matter whether he hasn't had sex or girlfriend/boyfriend/hookers .. should he want to be unique, he has my blessing!|`|dDSuBQURaa	It is his preference. Only he would have to make the change if he wants to.|`|scUqnbNJaa	Ok......|`|9inngmg7aa	it's sad! very sad.|`|UzvoQvB2aa	I hear some people aren't straight or gay they are simply sexually disinterested not that I've ever met anyone like that but maybe this is your uncles problem or perhaps he is gay and still afraid to admit it does he ever discus a desire to have a girl friend?|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It's not normal, but it does happen. These people tend to have issues....|`|YbSsCVRRaa	the saiths are also virgins and are pious and he must be a  service minded. he is what he is.|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	i have to agree with Mrs.G some people just aren't interested in a relationship or that companionship of another person they enjoy life just the way it is they may  not want to be tied to anyone whether it be because they are scared or just because..

Maybe if you don't call him for a while, he'll miss hearing your voice and would probably call you sooner or later.|`|e5YaHUUVaa	just ignore him, he'll eventually come to wonder why you arent callin him 24 7|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	take off our clothes in front of him|`|OHfZFR31aa	Well, if you have been calling him and he's not making an effort to call you, he might not like you that much.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I think his initial behavior was dangerous.  Using your authority to get 'sexual favors' could have cost him his job, and his career.    But, since you are now 'elsewhere' - asking to be connected is not such a strange thing - especially if you do have friendly (or more) feelings for this person.
d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	You can friend request anyone you like, it's up to them if they accept you or not.  I wouldn't worry about it to much though, just forget about it and move on.

It was a bday gift after all, so that might account for the initial anger.    But staying angry? No, that is pathetic.|`|pHbVh9kIaa	i think she doesn't have the right to be upset, coz she told u to look around and u just touchjed her ipod, so wtas the big deal?  i think she is mad at somthing else, so she is just being angry at you....maybe shedidn't even want an ipod for present so she was  abit angry or maybe.......she is just changed by knowing that she is much richer than u and can efford bettre things,   guess u should tell her how u feel and she might be sorry|`|xpv3BUyBaa	Shes pathetic !

Lots of people in her situation use others to look down on and you might end up being her little servant or hanger-on.  That is not good for your self-esteem.  If you really like this girl, fine.  But her attitude is not nice and I don't see things turning out well.  I think she was verbally abusive to you for no reason.  Beware of people like that.  She could have said it nicer and not made you feel so bad.  Why do you want a friend who doesn't care about your feelings, and makes you feel bad for no good reason?  Ugh.|`|wNKleK4Uaa	Wow. Your friend sounds very spoiled and very immature and NO I do not think she has a right to be upset over this. You didn't do anything wrong and she is overeacting to an unfair extreme.

I wouldn't want him near my daughters either.  You've voiced yr concerns to your husband & he still wants to be friends with this guy?  Maybe he is re-living his teen years or something?    I suggest next time he comes around that you either take your daughters out for a few hours or your husband meets him somewhere & doesn't bring him home.   Eventually your husband should gradually realise that his old friend really isn't the sort of guy he or you want to hang around.  Take care & protect your girls.|`|AA10248966	Has friends been inappropriate around the daughters? Get into counseling with husband to discuss with therapist.

If he is talking about sexual escapades that are embarrasing or shameful to you all you have to do is tell him to change the subject. Because his sexual behavior has differed from yours, does not make you one that has to join in. His deeds are not your deeds. I am not buying the "we have daughters" thing since I am sure you are not allowing him to talk about such things around them. Are you insinuating he is a pedophile and may harm them? I have a feeling you are more in fear that your husband may be dragged into a similar disdain for your marriage and may be roped into being with other women. Am I correct? If this is the case, the problem is not with the friend, but with your husband.|`|BXhl64n2aa	I understand you, I would also feel uncomfortable with this type of guy. I would keep him at a distance.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My brother's wedding was a disaster but they presevered:  - Two days before the wedding the brakes on my bro's truck failed. He wasn't hurt but he did hit a parked car.  - The dry cleaner pressing my SiL's gown "couldn't find it" when my bro went to pick it up for her. They later "found" the gown and delivered it in the back of their SUV, where their dog was running around. The lace at the hem of the dress was completely ruined because they had pressed it improperly and my mom spent the evening reattaching new lace. It was also crumpled like tin foil so we had to hang it in the bathroom to steam for hours!  - The florist's fridge broke so they moved the flowers to a friend's house. But her fridge was too cold and the flowers all died. We had bouquets of shriveled orange and yellow roses. It was horrible. But they used them because they looked almost "dried" and we had no time to get new ones!  - The bride's mom cleaned off the dining room table and threw out the jeweler's envelope with the bride's engagement ring in it. She and her mom spent awhile rummaging through the garbage disposal before they found the ring.     I was also once at a wedding where they had 3 flower girls carrying kissing balls on ribbons. That was cute, until they started brawling with thier "weapons" in the front pew during the service! Two adults pulled them apart and everything proceeded as planned. It was funny though!    Good luck!|`|7cdfc5d9a205827b098980cae58531dbaa	A close friend of mine had an appointment with beauty shop but they got more costumers than expected and therefore my friend was late at the end. After that, the bride and groom had an appointment in a photo studio  to take especial pictures but they missed the appointment and were late to the ceremony as well. The bride was just a sad angel.|`|AA11587893	i once attended a wedding and the bride had forgot her wedding dress 500km away from where  the wedding was.|`|aGcB3nUBaa	My wedding is this saturday, just 2 days away, and I found out last night that my friend who was flying in from out of state today, can't come.  Her two older daughters were supposed to be my flower girls.  Turns out, day before yesterday she rolled her Ford F150 after hitting black ice.  Great thing is, everyone is absolutely okay with only some bruises!  I'm super happy they're safe but super disappointed I can't see my friend now.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	At my FMIL's wedding, they decided they could build there own "tent" out of posts and a huge tarp type thing. Well, the dancing started and the pole got bumped or snapped or something, and the whole thing collapsed on top of us! The pole smashed my fiance in the head and we all got soaked because it was pouring! Complete Chaos ensued!! :) Good story though!|`|cGbTJobeaa	At my sister's swanky wedding, her nephew and an "and guest" were drinking alcohol.  Problem was that they were 20 and the rent-a-cop at the museum carded them and told them to stop.  The "and guest" stopped drinking. The nephew continued to drink.  Both were arrested at the reception.    My sister still can't stand to think about her wedding because of this.  Now if it happened at my wedding....I'd laugh because I'd have a "good" story out of it.|`|T0pkW783aa	I worked at a place where weddings were catered.  We had one wedding where the wedding party was toasting the bride.  The lovely wedding cake was in the center of the table and when the group stood up for the toast, the table collapsed and the cake fell to the floor, crumbling to the ground.  All the drinks spilled, the flowers went flying and it was a huge disaster.    Another wedding was spoiled when the father of the bride collapsed after dancing with his daughter.  That was very upsetting and was a sad kind of disaster.    The third wedding, and most memorable was when the manager of the wedding scheduling took off with the books and a whole lot of money.  The day before the wedding, the bride's mother called to ask if she could possibly change the vegetable that was being served to another.  We didn't have a clue that there was going to be any wedding because the scheduling calendar was gone with the embezzler!!  We scrambled and got the room ready, the tables set and had barely enough prime rib to cut for the guests.  (Cut them extremely thin so we had just enough!!!)  As we were serving, one of the waitresses slipped and a prime rib went flying onto the floor!  She grabbed it, ran back into the kitchen, rinsed it off, heated it up and immediately served it to one of the guests.  (No choice, since there were no extra pieces!) It was an embarrassment to serve anything like that but we were stuck and the show had to go on.  People were asking for end cuts of the prime rib but there were no cuts to be distributed so they had to settle for measly little cuts and were probably pretty disappointed but, they had the wedding reception and we got away without a lawsuit!!  The wedding party never knew what had happened or that we didn't have a clue that they were coming for the reception the following day!!  Can you imagine!!  I didn't stay working  there for very long; too many problems!!  (The embezzler got caught and went to jail somewhere down the line!!)|`|egqveuPjaa	My friend was at a wedding once where the flower girl stepped on the long train- you can guess what happened!  The train and veil was attached to a tiara so the train pulled on the tiara which pulled down the hair. Disaster.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	Oh lets see.....   1: my husband promised not to shove cake in my face. But his friend paid him $5.00 to shove the cupcake in my face, and it got on my dress  2: My horrible room mates were drunk at my reception. They were rude to my family, hubby's family, my land lady, and my other guests.     3: I HAD to spend my honeymoon with my in-laws, because they had never been out of state before. It wouldn't have been so bad if my sister in law the C*** had allowed us just two days for ourselves. But she whined about us ruining "her" vacation! If it weren't for us, she wouldn't have been there to begin with!    4: My wedding ceremony was interrupted several times by my room mates laughing, and snickering. Yeah real polite.     I hope this helps.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I babysit for a lady and she told me that she was an hour and a half late for her own wedding, she found out her mom had gotten into a car accident once she had gotten to the church and to top it all off her mother in law had hired someone at work to run the alcohol bar. Little did she know that he had mutliple personalities and was supposed to keep it down with meds....end of story he was an 8 year old little girl named Sarah that day.|`|afkygHMgaa	I married him.....that was a disaster in itself|`|1nMYqT1qaa	My mother's crazy boyfriend (who was NOT invited) showed up at our reception..absolutely crocked, screaming obscenities and threatening to tear the place apart.

All the icing slid off the cupcakes and melted everywhere,  us waiters went out and bought more instant icing, and did a super quick repair job, re-icing them and decorating them with store bought decorations. They werent as pretty as when they started, and the bride was upset but the guests didnt notice, and once they were all stacked up on the tower together with the ribbon decoration they still looked pretty spectacular.    I guess thats a disaster saved though...|`|HOAQtDDzaa	How about the groom getting caught kissing his gay lover in the men's room?

The couple is still married.  They all just pretend that he's straight.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	We ended up having a huge snow storm on the day of our wedding. It was one of those we'll only get 1-2 inches storms, and we got over 6. All of our guests were traveling from farther south where they had over 12. My husband spent time shoveling at the church and my dad at the reception site. Neither place had anyone on call since it wasn't supposed to snow that much. Made for a crazy day, but we still had the ceremony and just about everyone made it.|`|VTee51r9aa	At my cousins wedding in October we all got seated and got our programs and in the program it had the wrong names.When the ceremony started they said we are gathered here today to join "Pam & John" that was not their names!

Qks0PQhAaa	if you knew deep in your heart that she would never be unfaithful to you then u would not be worried who she is talking to,i think if your both chatting to others on the Internet then you are both bound to wonder inside your heads,things like this always start off as being a bit worried then you wonder what they chat about then it will be in your head every day and that's when the paranoia starts the best thing to do is to remember that if you can easily have a conversation with a woman and you know that's all it is then you have to trust your gf on that too,and another thing don't let chatting to people end up ruining your life cause people start getting addicted to these things and forget about their partners so as long as you both know its only chat theres nothing to worry about :)|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Same. I'm very protective over my girlfriend as well. She talks to me friends on MSN and I wonder what they are talking about. I trust her and I know she loves me but I still feel awkward. She doesn't put other boy's names in her personal message. You're right about feeling jealous though and I guess that's a sign of your true love for her.    My girlfriend hates it when I talk to other girls. I'm still good friends with one of my ex-girlfriend's and she gets really jealous whenever I talk to her. I think it's something to do with the fact that they both loved me at one point and they were best friends at the time. They are okay now but they're never going to be close mates again. If she doesn't like it then I'm not going to change the way I am to people. She tells me that she doesn't have a problem with it. She also says that she trusts me completely but doesn't trust her. She says that my ex-girlfriend still has feelings for me even though I categorically know that's not true.    Just explain to her how you feel and if she loves you then she will change to make you happy. If not then she's really now worth it mate. You sound like a really nice guy and very similar to myself. There's plenty more fish in the sea if it doesn't work out. Best of luck!|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	It's natural to be protective of your gf. There's nothing really to do but trust her.

jYMlAN4Paa	Dilute about a 1/4 cup of salt into a glass with water that is as hot as you can stand it. Make it salty. Gargle with this every few hours. It helps with cleaning the bacteria away.    Talk to your doctor and tell them what's going on. You're having a side effect that could be potentially dangerous. You absolutely have to tell your doctor whenever you are on medication and you develop another ailment (cough, rash, nausea, fever, etc).    It means you are having problems with the antibiotic you're on so the doc will probably change it or do something else.

In fact, you talk about whatever you want, and they reply with words of enlightenment and support.    They know you, you know them. Just look into their eyes, and you should be able to see how sincere they can just be.

When you are a "true friend", then you know how you would want a "true friend" to treat you, it is really very simple.  But when you see your so called "true friend" doing and/or saying things that you know you would never do or say, then, you have an individual dressed up as a "true friend".  Since this is a "friend" question, know, that, being part of a clique, doesn't constitute "friendship", the things that an impostor "true friend" would do or say to someone else, know, that this same person would do or say the same thing about you depending on how the wind is blowing on any certain day, so with all this said, if you are a "true friend", then you will have a "true friend or friends".

For whoever gets to be your first girlfriend it will be really special and they'll be happy you've never done anything before because it's amazing to know you're the only one.

You will find someone special and i am sure you will treat her well and look after her just be patient.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	You are like my partner, he too was a late starter because he didn't have confidence and read alot of books and was happy in his own company basically.  By the time he was 35 he had dated just 3 women from 3 months to 18 months.  See already on here you seem to be getting a slating for just being YOU - why ?  You will meet someone but you need to get out and mingle more.      My motto - it's not who you are out with but who you meet when you are out     Now consider the person you would like to be with - if you are say not into nighclubs and drinking then why would you go to that environment ?  The ppl you would meet there are just not your "type"    Join clubs and organisations - you may not be the next Tim Henman (thank god for small mercies) but it is the socail side you are more interested in.    Dogs are a great way to meet ppl in parks on balmy early afternoons too.  You HAVE to go out then don't you to give Bruno his walk so you have instant excuse to get out more.   Dog obedience training classes - see more access to females.     Night school - why not take a course and agan this opens up new social gatherings.    Badminton, Tai Kwon Do, these are all places youcan go to meet someone for you but you need to pop down on A4 yr best qualities and no so good too !!  Then compile a list of likely attributes you want in a female and this will clarify where you are most likely to find them,    Now what about friends ??   Is there someone who may have a dinner party and "invite" a couple of single females along ?  Friends introductions are good as it somehow doesn't seem like you are stalking !  It is a safe environment and there is no pressure to ask for their tel number.      A good way to start conversation is to say "so Gabby what do you do when you are not attending parties?"  this opens up a Q which you can then make some follow up remarks on  "oh how interesting, tell me more......"   "and when you are not ????  how do you relax?...."    "Yes I'd like to see that film too would you allow me to invite you along one night next wk we could perhaps have a pizza or something pre-film ?"    Ask about aany planned holidays as this willgive an indication as to whether she is a sporty type and wants ot go off to the natives areas and sightsee rather than lay on beach with a trashy novel - not that there is anythng wrong with this either.     Pop into one of the major bookshops or maybe chk out ebay for a copy of books by Nancy Friday.  My Secret Garden;  Men In Love;  These will possibly open yr eyes somewhat but will give you some background research ..... these books are not for everyone so apologies if the contents offend in anyway, they shouldn't,  these are real life accounts.  I bought one of these for my partner to read at his leisure and he has never looked back.    Confidence is a trick - that's all, you just need to learn how to make it work for you, stay true to yourself of course but start by getting out there and mingling.     Good Luck|`|Pi3Zv3E9aa	it is true that being single ever since and have not kissed somebody or gone farther from kissing is attractive..=-)    i think it's because you are so valuable. high value in other words. like still brand new.=-)    i am sort of like you too but still 21 and i'm still thinking of going single for a while and saving more of myself... am i selfish??!! hahaha!!! NO, I GUESS!!heheh... i am not also saying that if love comes and i am feeling it, i will repel it...no.    i guess i am just i'm enjoying my time anyway and that is what is important... and also i guess learning more and preparing myself so that by that time i am ready too... i guess too it's because i don't want to play around.  and besides, i don't want to force myself just because everyone is already into IT.    i find myself valuable too while i'm in a status like this at 21 anyway. and i think that is why many can say it's attractive to be in such a condition.  =-)    of course i am taking into consideration that during my 20's that is a task that has to be accomplished. i also don't want my development to lag...hahahah... but it's just that i am not pressuring myself too much about it....    and it's normal too anyway.... i am still within the age range where my developmental task is too seek for a partner... it's not like, its my last year or even last 3 years of the period..hahah!!!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Would they think it was weird? Yes.  They would assume you have some issues.  They would probably be right.    Women don't need "someone to look after them". They want a partner they have chemistry with, can talk to, can share things with, who has similar interests so they can do things together.    You need to start asking out women you think you might like.  Start getting some practice, for just in case the right woman comes along.    Women aren't really into the "bad boys". The thing is, with the bad boys, they aren't shy. If they fancy someone, they walk up and ask them out. They tend to be confident, which women like. They can hold a conversation, which women like.      A nice guy who is confident, not shy, and who can hold a conversation is considered quite a catch.    Too many guys consider themselves nice guys, when in actuality, they are doormats. They let everyone push them around and run over them, rarely stand up for themselves, and when they do they tend to explode in a temper, rather than handling it in a mature way.  That's not a "nice guy".    You say you had a tough time in school, and hint that it may have caused you some issues. Have you done any counselling or therapy?  It doesn't mean you are a loser, it means you are someone who wants to improve themselves and get past former issues.|`|NEfezEUQaa	it's so not weird.  personally, I would like to be able to say in the future that the only man I ever kissed (not including family) was my husband.

You ask 'wouldn't you look at me and think 'why has he not dated anyone'?'.  Well no, personally I would think that perhaps the right situation has never arisen or maybe the right girl hasn't come along yet.  Having limited experience with girls certainly doesn't make you unfanciable.      If you meet a girl and she finds it weird just ask her if she would prefer you to have been sleeping around?  I'm pretty sure that she wouldn't.    Not all girls want bad guys and the ones that do, well, more fool them.

It's a-ok. Wouldn't you rather your first girlfriend, kiss and 'first time' to be with someone special? Most likely - yes.     Just because people say "oh I had my first kiss at 13!" doesn't mean it's the right age. Who did they kiss? Someone that doesn't mean crap to them now..    Just wait, and be paitient... you'll find your girl.

Some people can deal with the age difference quite easily, if it is only 10 years or less.  Some can not, and it causes problems.  Over ten years can be a struggle, but can still work if they work hard at the relationship.    This relationship is way too new to know if it can become a serious one.  Tell her to take her time, and get to know him well before making any commitments.  His ideas and expectations could be very different from hers, due to the age difference.  Tell her to be sure that he respects her and her opinions, and treats her as an equal, or things will not work out.|`|UXv24pDQaa	37 is the one which has perfection and 27 is the one has deflection.

We have been a couple for 9 years, and married for 8 years.  We are still very much in love, have a great marriage and three gorgeous children.  I would say let your friend make her own choice.

He's already told you that he has an excuse to be unfaithful, so he's already preparing you that he will be unfaithful to you.    He sounds toxic - I would never consider getting into a relationship with a guy like that. If he couldn't make 2 marriages work, the problem is with him, not the wives.  Plus, you have to worry about a guy who tells you that he wasn't in love with his second wife. Why would he marry her in the first place if he didn't love her?

This is not a good fit for you.  Some guys will tell you they love you just to get sex from you.  Anyone that says they do not want to be with you only, is not in love with you!!  We are not apes and we are much more advanced than apes!!  Ask him if he thinks it is normal to go around scratching his body and his behind in public too!!  that is natural for an ape, but not for a human being!!

He is obviously content with living his lifestyle, so you are not going to change that.  You need to either accept him for what he is or find a man who wants to be a faithful partner.    There are plenty of people like myself who prefer to be faithful to our partners. Most people like security, so I am sure that we will always be in the majority.    One thing which hasn't helped is the divorce laws.  Divorce is now assumed to be "no fault" with an equal split between partners.  This has given a green light to gold diggers and affairs.|`|ImVRIDtIaa	I think he only wants sex. Leave him and find a man who is more mature. He is 50 and set in his ways.

I believe that if someone really loves and would go to extremes to make your relationship work, then he should be willing to love you against all odds. If he could cheat on his previous partners then why are you still with him, because that sort of person doesn't deserve to be with someone as wonderful as you. You are not to blame when things are not going well, but he is and if he's not too careful, he will be infected by H.I.V/ AIDS and this will entirely be his fault seeing as he acts like an animal. BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, u need to put your foot down and tell this man this he should decide what he wants from this relationship and tell him if he wants to stay, then so be it and if not tell him to leave.

I've been in the same position.  You get into a relationship with a guy, and they aren't perfect but you say, 'hey, who is'.  Then they see you accept those and they begin to treat you more and more badly.  You make more and more excuses and you cry more and more -basically you're doing all the work for both sides in the relationship.  You need to think about how much your willing to put up with.  Is he treating you as you deserve to be treated.  If not you need to tell him, give him 1 chance to change and if he doesn't, leave.  I know it can feel like you NEED him, but after a while of it being very tough you'll wonder why you let him walk all over you and then you'll be comfortable and strong being on your own.  Then if you meet someone new, you'll make sure they appreciate you!  Just my advice.|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	We all like to look. The main thing is that we don't touch.

I hope things work out for you x|`|8TAeFGSJaa	All i can say is trust your gut feeling! its most of the time rite and u dont need him! there is no need to be hurt by a guy!!!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	You don't "need" him. You may love him and want him, but you can do without him if you need to.    Many men are like this. They think the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.  They think with their second brain, the one "down there" if you know what I mean.    If you want to keep him, you need to realize he IS going to cheat when opportunity presents itself.  If this is something you can't handle, your best bet is to get out now.    Some women have pretty good marriages to men who play on the side.  These men are otherwise good husbands and fathers, and they are discreet. The wives know, but since he comes home to them and things are otherwise good, they put up with it.  I know of many marriages where this is the case.    In a way, at least he was being honest with you. He knows he's going to stray if the right opportunity comes up. While you would have liked to hear the right answer(Honey I love you, I wouldn't do that), he would have been lying, and you both know it.    So, if you can't handle him playing around, leave now.  If you think he's otherwise a good enough man, then keep him, but be prepared to find out he is occasionally straying.
u84hPxW1aa	I'm sure you've heard the whole "this is the time where you change the most" and that is for sure the truth. I'm 20 and I've been there. I am still constantly changing friends. Whether I get annoyed with them, bored, or whatever..it's just something that sadly happens. It's not all bad. One thing I regret is I was always so negative..then I realized you only live once, and you have control on how your life is going to be. As far as you being depressed I have no advice for that besides what I've already told you. Don't waste time on a guy that already has a gf..no matter how much you like him. That may lead to more drama and make life seem a trillion times worse.|`|LMeOJ0V0aa	OMG! The worst thing to do is to freak out so don't.

If you arent sure you agree with it, get a second or third opinion. You can also talk to a pastor or Christian counselor to get help for depression.   Step2If you have been prescribed medicine for depression, take it and keep taking it. Do not stop taking the medication just because you feel better or feel nothing.   Step3Take the medication at the same time every day and dont forget a dose, if possible. Make it a routine. Dont tell yourself negative things about taking the medicine. If you needed eye glasses or a cast on your arm, you wouldnt be embarrassed to use those treatments. So, why should a chemical imbalance be any different?   Step4Be accountable to a friend or spouse. Make sure they know you are committed to taking the medication. Tell them to feel free to ask you if you are taking it, especially if they notice unusual behavior or attitudes. Remember that when youre depressed, others can take the brunt of it, and they often notice it more than you do. This is why its so important to take your medication regularly. Often, if left untreated, you may end up suicidal or abusive to those around you. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to keep taking your medication unless told otherwise by a physician.   Step5Keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings. Write down what you are sad about and what you are feeling. Write down what types of negative thoughts try to come into your mind. Then, praise yourself for doing whats best for you and the family. Be proud that you didnt hide behind your illness. You did something about it and you will reap a positive reward in the end. Your family will be happier and so will you.|`|jZlLzRziaa	well i think you should tell that  guy your inlove with how you  feel >>>>>(:

Fs4fAwfwaa	Hey there,    I pretty much can see myself in the situations you describe although I must say that I never had an escalated argument like that.    As you yourself have said you dont say anything if you are not absolutely certain that youre right. That most certainly is the problem ;-)    The lesson I have learned so far is that many people cant really argue on a non-competitive level. So they seek confrontation when they feel that they are being wronged and turn irrational. Then it is not about the argument anymore but about who is rightn no matter what.    In my eyes it makes absolutely no sense in insisting on your opinion and continue to try to convince the other person. Just accept that there is no way (and no need) to continue to argue and get back to neutral topics.     With some people you simply could talk forever and ever and it wouldnt make the slightest difference. So why bother?    Ah and... dont take offense at work if your not absolutely sure that the other person will reconsider. But those people usually dont say anything offensive..so... just smile and think "you dont know sh** you jack-***"    Be good!  Caleb|`|NrrB3eyDaa	Maybe she has a crush on you?

And all I want is for him to love me and respect me,to make me feel wanted-desired-needed-listen to me an occasional flower,  I can tell you what not to do  dont cheat on her  holler and cuss at her  hang up on her in the middle of an arguement  holler and cuss at her in front of your friends  respect her or you will lose her...|`|5ZKdo0Tqaa	it would be nice to feel like your his everything    im not saying shoved up each others butts all the time    im saying that when he says and does things the wife should be on his mind also,      i dont know everyone is diff and every women wants diff things, you just have to know her and her heart  not just go along with whatever comes|`|AA12257785	hi most woman want a husband to be kind understanding flowers are nice every now and again not all the time because then you expect it all the time and that's not what its all about trust is a big thing in my life and for many others. we just want someone that's cares for us but not to clingy  that wil put most woman off we like men to be men but to have a sensitive side too. good luck to you hope all goes well|`|09DE4NG3aa	I want a hug at least once a day from my husband    I don't expect flowers, but it would be nice to get them once a month - my husband bought them for me every Friday when we were dating, but after 8 years of marriage this has tapered off.....pity...    As for the listener, leader, decisive or submissive, different circumstances call for different things.  I want him to listen when I've had a bad day at work and I want to let off steam without him doing anything about it.  I wanted him to be a leader when our painter drove his van through our fence and crashed into the neighbours house (he was), I want him to be decisive when I ask an important question like "Do you think we should move to a bigger house or just renovate?", and submissive when I ask him to please leave the toilet seat down.    When we got married, my husband joked that a husband takes care of all the big decisions, and the wife takes care of all the small ones, but it was up to the wife to decide which decisions were big or small.  When in doubt, go with that theory!|`|nJwOG1Dzaa	I want my husband to hug me at least every time he leave my side.  It would be nice to have some bathwater ran.  Cooking for your wife is a +  Listening and Communication comes hand-in-hand that's the only way for the relationship to work.  I also expect for him to be there at any given time   He also needs to give unconditional love|`|AdLvtgl6aa	hugs are important,occassional flowers and listening is vital|`|AA11984795	What is to be expected will matter directly on whom you marry.  Everyone is different, every marriage has differences and it's not a hard and fast contract--it will change over time.
ImVRIDtIaa	I've been asked that too and I give them a straight up no. (No pun intended. haha!) I am completely straight, but I think given my small build and caring about my appearance, people sometime translate that as gay. Apparently not everyone knows what a metro is. Anyway, don't let it bother you. You can't change what others are thinking and dwelling on it can only drive you crazy.|`|K71ZlPWgaa	I asked out a couple girls who rejected me, after that or every time it happens, some people will always ask you do know there is a gay option? I will always shake my head and go dude I just asked out the girl over there how the hell do you think that I am gay? It always works they have nothing else to say! It is annoying question to be asked of your straight. Especially when you just asked out a girl!|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	Never been asked, guess i dont look gay, cause i am not. What would i do? prob cuss them out and knock the hell out of them for even thinking of that assumption. And as for your percentage, your either gay or not, its not a percentage.|`|t2sTqzu9aa	Yeah, I've been asked, but I just say, No I'm straight.    It's only happened once, so it doesn't worry me =]|`|EsVjwKPAaa	nop! not yet!|`|DIEih5asaa	Yes, I nearly scratched his eyes out.|`|9inngmg7aa	Yeah! i've been asked many times. apparently the reason why i get asked is because i take good care of myself and am outgoing. I got tired of the question a long time ago and now just simply ask them back what they think. i don't care anymore and so i just don't answer it.|`|eY4RubMSaa	Yeah... quite a bit actually. My mom's asked me twice. :S|`|MXzzUDbRaa	For my case ,only gay ppl asked whether im gay .Lol .|`|Sw61kY7Saa	i get it sometimes, it happens often to people that are well groomed/spoken, i say take it as a compliment and try and meet people with broader vocabularies and perceptions|`|2GvstdnNaa	yes. I said yes once even though I'm not..just wanted to watch their reaction..Guy never talked to me again :)) that friggin homophobe.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Could be any one of the mentioned reasons.    OR, he wants you to drive him now, instead of him driving you ;)|`|8TAeFGSJaa	FREAKIN LUCKY  Hes trying to buy her love  or just loves spoiling her and why not hes got the cash|`|XoiKGZstaa	If his filthy rich, then his just being lazy and wheres the effort in that. It probably didn't even make a dent in his bank account. Yeah sure a car is fantastic! But something could have been done more, for love.    He could of done much much more, that is more memorable something that will make you more happy in the long term. I'd rather have a broke boyfriend who is considerable and puts effort for love than a filthy rich guy buying all the things I want in the world because love is something no money can buy.|`|onbwN4csaa	And they say you can't buy love.    Who said that...|`|BbRewQjQaa	It means your boyfriend is subsidizing for something he is lacking. You don't buy girlfriends cars until they become your wife.|`|rOtfBBEYaa	I think he just wants to spoil you :3|`|AA10713007	He will expect payment in return.  And I don't mean money.|`|iYSYLUa1aa	Tell him that you ''Love don't cost a thing''|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	he's buying your love|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sounds like he's trying to show off.
dKCoyvMSaa	call me crazy but why don't you start with hi?    look at her and try to get her friends to notice you looking at her,then her friends should mention how threes someone looking at her, if she turns round and looks at you she will know your real (think to her right now ur just a person on the tram) if that makes sence to you, which i hope it does, then one day when shes alone go and say hi, and start the convstion and make sure you tell a joke,   :) i hope this helps you|`|GNpR4a9vaa	be nice.|`|QLR4iSkEaa	You make the first move, you approach her anything under the sun, like for example, "r u marie?", "u look so familiar, do u live in _______?", "r u working in _______?", just say anything which you know you could have a better conversation with her.  Then if there's an opportunity of getting her number, then do it.  I find nothing wrong with it.  Its just a matter of how u will approach her.|`|Kw9h0z6Oaa	Hi my name is ... I've seen you around and thought you look like a person I'll like to get to know    Girls like attention|`|OHfZFR31aa	Maybe start with Hello.|`|wjS3GtOYaa	humor  make a joke - a funny smart joke - be witty   humor is the way to a girl's heart lol|`|UXuSI6EZaa	nonchalantly.    x )|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Approach her when she's alone. Be easy going, start a conversation with her. Be confident and act very friendly. Compliment her outfit or her smile. Women love compliments. Tell her you think she is very pretty and tell her you've had your eye on her for a while. I love a man that is bold! Give it a shot and see what she says. Most likely, if she's single, she'll give you the yes, I'll date you! If not, at least you tried! You can't go wrong with that!|`|AA10217731	Just approach her and say hello? Or maybe if you're shy  you can bump into her purposely or just get her to notice you somehow. (In a nice way though)|`|GSzQWlccaa	First confess to her that you think she is really pretty( with  no one hearing of course), that will relax you, you could ask her, if it doesnt hurt to be that pretty. she doesnt have to answer this question , and then go on and invite her on a date or something, you need to drop all the ego when approaching a girl, you need to stop caring if she will like you back but you need to get this off your chest otherwise you will be miserable|`|L7DmH8Dyaa	http://groups.yahoo.com/group/loversguru|`|rOtfBBEYaa	Try to wait until she's alone, so her friends won't make fun of you for trying to pick up a girl on the tram.|`|Uu9EYF5Saa	just go n talk with her friends,  dont look at her while talking with her friends then u can catch her attention ..  she'll only come n proceed with u...|`|fg2xU6Z2aa	be confident, don't be scared of what her Friends or anyone will think, just go up to her and tell her she is a very beautiful lady and you would like to get to know her!!!
PSWFAVthaa	Thats awful. This is easier said then done and I know the moment has passed now, but I'd have had a quiet word with the mother and say you witnessed what happened. Somethign like that happend with my mother and a neighbour years and years ago.. the son next door smacked his little sister with a football, she was roaring crying, and the mother came out and gave out to the little girl (for crying?). My mum went it for a casual chat, and in passing conversation asked if her daughter was ok, because she saw 'Mark kick Sarah in the head by accident with his football'. The mother didnt remark much back but the little girl was back on the street playing within an hour.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes as she the mum|`|orfmhb2waa	its hard to tell and it is none of our business|`|xCLX9Aczaa	You should've picked up a rock, sigal to the kid, and chuck the rock at his face.  Then you should've said "You like how that feels ******?"|`|b81651b3e653a6354f1a8d2bcbdec23aaa	Put on a monster mask and scare the crap out of the little boy.|`|ebD1plKNaa	Sounds to me like the little girl may have been punished for being a drama queen.    If somebody was going to be spanked, it probably should have been the little boy or both.  Parenting is hard and it could be that the mother was aware of something that led up to the incident that caused a seemingly more severe punishment on the little girl.    On the surface, it sounds like the mother missed on this one.  But who knows?|`|R1zUIh7taa	Who knows but the mom!  That and it isn't our business or yours.  Yet if you see the mom being Abusive to the children then that is a different story!  Yet for all you the little girl was supposed to stay inside!  Again who knows but the mom!|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	Get out of the window, and that Mother was minding her business - so what were you doing, she didn't need you all up in it - I am sure she had a handle on it.  God Bless.|`|YK8zJNluaa	The ***** needs to be flogged.  So does the barstard that fired the arrow.  The little girl didnt deserve that.

Tell her that you need to get something off of your chest. Let her know exactly how you feel. Tell her that you are sorry for the way that you feel about her, but also tell her that you do not want to stop being her best friend. She might come around. If not, then I am sorry.

zka26204aa	Just ask her why she texts you so much if she is not interested in going out with you.  Then ask her why she stopped contacting you for so long.  Tell her that you enjoy hearing from her, but you really do not enjoy being on the phone all of the time.  Tell her that you don't mean to be rude, but that you never seem to get anything else accomplished, and sometimes you have other things to do that are important.    If that does not work, wait long periods of time before answering her texts, and eventually she will realize that you are busy and can not answer all day.|`|FFlGzrROaa	all waht everyone here hs said. i used to tex a boy a lot and he told me off so i stopped then he found a way to tex me all the time and i really enjoyed it but then he wouldnt talk to me or see me for real so now i stop texing with him cos i dont like being just a tex-girl! i want to be 'his' girl. she likes you and you like her then you should do something about it or you'll lose eachother! that wouldnt be nice would it?|`|bZTpK9uVaa	just tell her that your phone bill came out, and you had to pay over $30 bucks for text messages.

Worth a shot.|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	if she texts you so much sounds like she likes you.    you should probably just have a conversation about you guys, see were your standing, she probably regrets she rejected you and is trying to show you she likes you.    just tell her that you have no credit and cant reply, or that your mum keeps reading your texts or something.. goodluck!

oOSNI3wbaa	because its you giving your heart and mind to someone else. i can relate to that. i recently went through it. even if you arent having sex with someone, if you give them these other things it's still hurtful. and i dont believe that statement above. i think men get just as upset over emotional affairs as they do sexual ones. i know i do.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Oh my husband is the same....he could forgive me of I slep with someone else but if  Iove....no!|`|FzFSzilmaa	because he realises that sex is just sex... the physical action of sex isn't cheating... but being emotionally involved is bad...|`|vkwbaZAAaa	well you must have a pretty deep boyfriend. any way it just means he knows if you hav sex with someone else it doesnt mean anything but if you are inlove with someone else obviosly he going to feel broken hearted|`|AG3dYL84aa	Flick.  Good answer.    Perplex.  An affair is an affair.  It's still cheating weather it's sexual or not.  It is a loss of trust in a relationship.  If my girlfriend had one, I'd sit down with her, and tell her stop or it's over.  That's it.    No matter what type of affair, you are still taking love away and giving it to someone else.  I'd be upset too.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I have to admit I get jealous just at the thought of her seeing someone else and jealousy isn't something i'm use to.|`|W60e5AA5aa	Because he truely loves you, and it would hurt him more if you fell in love and emotionaly cheated on him...Rather than if you just slept with someone..    He sounds special!    XxX|`|TlnTKyXxaa	In my opinion...Depending on the man, some feel sex isn't such a big deal, others find it's the best way to show someone what they mean to you.    But for your guy, I'd say connecting on an emotional and intellectual level is far more important. In fact in most cases, connecting emotionally is the difference between being in a relationship and having a sex buddy.

3NoQuoWuaa	You don't have to flirt keep talking to him. find out what he is interested in and talk about that. Ask him out or over to your home to just hang out. Be your self. He is probably as nervous about you as you are with him.

0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	First of all, if your boyfriend would involve you in something you aren't totally comfortable with, you should reevaluate your relationship. It doesn't sound to me like he thought a lot about how you felt. But, it would be good to mention wanting to experiment with his friend. If he expects you to be okay with his ideas, then he should be okay with your ideas.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, you should, maybe he enjoyed it too.

Proof is in the Pudding.|`|W60e5AA5aa	YES YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.    It is always MUCH better to admit and talk about what you want in your relationship and your sex life.    It is better to be open and honest- after all he may want the same thing....You could het some great sex by being open.    Go for it!    XxX|`|K7sDPIcZaa	Yeah, tell your boyfriend. He may have enjoyed it too. You never know until you've taken a shot at it !  x|`|qF5fZquuaa	UH........... crying before or after sex should be the first sign that something is wrong, him forcing you into a threesome is basically rape|`|fvoJf9Psaa	Threesomes almost always destroy relationships, so if you don't want that to happen then stop, don't do it again.  You have to decide what's most important.|`|G5Xf3vm5aa	if you think he sexier. have sex with him alone. then wen ur bf finds out, IF he finds out, tell him you werent thinking staright that day and had 105 fever. or just break up with him. i go wiht ppl who are more sexier becuase having sex with them is more sexy|`|mwEBrwlOaa	Having had a few threesomes I will give you my opinion. A part of the reason you are going through this, I believe, is because your boyfriend did not speak to you about having a threesome and instead decided to bring home a friend. Given the circumstances your reaction is quite normal and acceptable. The one flag I see is the fact that you want to have another threesome with the same person and this leaves me to wonder, given the circumstances of the first threesome, if there could be relationship issues with your current boyfriend.     My advice to you is this wait a few weeks to see how you feel then. I suspect you are going through the emotional roller-coaster that follows having a threesome. If in about four to eight weeks you feel the same then I would think it would be appropriate to tell him. The last thing you want to do now is to tell him and then find out next week you have changed your mind.|`|kfMPDO2waa	Yes, tell him what you want
7e4jxj3Daa	It could be either reason.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	he just want to act out his Fantasy. all men go throught this. don't do it. it will wreck your relatsionship.|`|Je2cos0laa	mmm that depends mayb he wants just to change what u do when u have sex or maybe he just want sex from u :S|`|05NIkjy6aa	In a twisted way, maybe he wanted to do something nice for you...something he thought you would like.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	Society teaches us that relationships are one man and one woman. Media romanticizes relationships and chastises those who violates the relationship norms of what is an acceptable relationship. Since there are so many images of what is considered an acceptable relationship anyone who asks for a threesome is treated as though they do not care about their partner. The reality is however in most cases they do and the time I would agree that they do not is when when it involves some form of coercion to get their partner to have a threesome. Without knowing more about the situation surrounding this I would have to say, for the time being,  he did nothing wrong and should not be made to feel bad. I do believe he loves you and cares about you. However at the same time you need to respect him and let him speak to you without fearing he will be criticized. If you criticize him every time he says something he will learn he cannot speak to you and find someone that will. Communication is a two way street and you cannot try to control him.  So to answer your question I do believe he loves you but you also need to ease up on him.
K7sDPIcZaa	not really. Just don't do anything with her !  x|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its ok .. as long as u dont do anthing wrong ..ok|`|HfTbzv32aa	no. just dont doanything stupid like having sex|`|hN08l7tLaa	there's nothing wrong. but it's wrong when things get physical.|`|4HTMZ97Saa	NO!  if your mature and love each other there's nothing wrong with it!

gJE0ujbzaa	Are you worrying too much? Yes.  Are you being selfish? Yes.    However it's really normal, and few people don't have those feelings.    As we get older, we meet new people, and make new friends. We will keep some friends, some friendships will peter out and you may never see them again, and new friends will be made.  Sometimes old friends will pop up years later and become friends again.    You aren't stupid.  They are just super smart. That's the way it goes. My guess is there are things you are good at that they aren't.  Not everyone goes to college. I never did, but it hasn't stopped me from learning and being successful.  I am self educated, I read a lot, and I've learned a lot from life. I have many college educated friends who are working at McDonalds.  Going to college isn't everything. if for some reason you don't go, you can still buy books and read them, and learn quite a lot.  You can get jobs that will teach you a lot as well.    Don't worry about it. Just go out, have a good time with your friend, and be open to new friendships as well.  If an old one fades, it's normal to feel sad. But don't dwell on it. Move on.  There are many friends out there you haven't met yet!|`|j1FCM0pqaa	theres no law that she has to be friends with ya so obviously she likes being ur friend so i doubt she'll dump ya u can have more than one friend ya know dont be childish get to know her friend u may even like er the three amigos lol :P|`|PCpMqpP3aa	like yea but no but yea but no but dunno|`|X2bVdsfUaa	i dont think so. i think its normal that you feel that close to someone and feel concerned that you might get replaced. if anything that shows how amazing of a friend you are.  at the same time dont get jealous because jealousy can lead to anger and that would just cause alot of unneeded drama.|`|Nco7uM0gaa	You don't replace friends,you just add new ones.What you are feeling is insecurity.No you are not being selfish.Mel will not forget you.You are not stupid either.
AP0ZyBbLaa	Hi Iris,    If it gives you good memories and he was a true gent, keep it - other wise get rid.    If you decide to keep it and wear it, never ever tell your new boyfriend about where it came from. Dont talk about it.    Kind regards  Justin.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	grrrrrr. i'd be infuriated if she did still wear it!!!!!!      grrrrrrr    that damn whore    edit: it's not valuable though. it's the sentimental value. i was dating this one girl and i got her all these worthless garbage that had sentimental value. but while i was dating her, she was dating someone else at the same time. and she ended up choosing him over me because he was the "bad boy" type. at one time i demanded it returned, but she said F U. it's mine now. i could care less what she does with it just so long that she doesn't contine to wear it.|`|NEfezEUQaa	depends on the situation.  If he broke up with you, left you for someone else, or you dumped him for cheating on you, you can wear it if you want, although I don't know that you would really want to.  If you broke up with him, left him for someone else, or he dumped you for cheating on him, you probably shouldn't wear the jewelery.  If it's the latter situation and he asks for the jewelery back, you should give the jewelery back.  The former, you don't have to, unless you want to.|`|Mt4t34KOaa	For me it wouldn't matter so long as I knw that she is really still for me.I mean shes not keeping anohter guy in her heart though shes wearing it.But for GIRL case, most of the time, they wear it/keep it cause they can't forget it.As for what to do with it, that really depends on the girl.For me, as a guy, what she wants to do with it, its her choice.I can't force her or anything.

Maybe because he never got hurt. And my fiance laughs at me when i get hurt, and she says its because "guys don't get hurt". The pain don't bother me much when i get kicked or smacked there. I am more worried about the long term damage that can happen. But to answer your question, its just funny to see someone who don't get hurt actually get hurt. And its probably more the face they make and reaction more then the location of the pain.|`|PEny7qbTaa	well i realise that as a kind of a timepass pleasure as they amuse others and nothing more than that so i advice u dont think abt it in a broader way as it is useless if not u carry on with them nd have fun.|`|piHVQmXdaa	because you're hanging around with the wrong women?

kIblsxJQaa	If you love her as much as you say you do, why did you make fun of her?  If she was upset by what you said, you should have apologised to her immediately and not got into an argument with her.  She's obviously very upset to have harmed herself.  You should go and see her and apologise and make it up to her.  She also needs to get some help as she can't go doing silly things like that when she has a falling out with someone|`|rd70xQvwaa	she slit her wrists.. tht means shes depressed so she must love u. u just gotta say sorry to her, explain to her tht u were just jokin, buy her gifts, stuff like tht. don worry she will get back with u just don make fun of her!|`|9inngmg7aa	she needs serious help so my advice is if you really love her then don't get back with her because it will only mess her up more. i mean she slit her wrists for pete's sake!|`|e24xEC5faa	Wow you feel pretty strongly about not finding someone else. Since you said "dont tell me..",  i wont, but am thinking it :)  Anyway, obviously your argument was very intense and upset her greatly. If you have apologised to her profusely and she's still not forgiven you then i recommend giving her a bit of space. Let her know that you regret "it" and will still be there when she feels less hurt etc. Everyone makes mistakes in relationships and all you can do is try make it up.

Every girl ( I think) wants her guy to be slightly possessive and a bit jealous too at times - it reassures her that you care for her.    But dont overdo it ! She should not feel suffocated in the relationship.  Its OK for her to talk to her colleagues, her girlfriends BFs, her cousins, her brothers friends, neighbours etc.     A relationship full of mistrust and nagging is obviously not a happy situation - and who wants to be unhappy and tense ?    There's something known as TRUST - don't be suspicious - but dont be totally blind either. I'm sure that you would'nt like it if your girlfriend was overly possessive, suspicious, distrustful about you. You would also want to run in the opposite direction.    There's a saying (one of my favourites) - IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE, IF IT COMES BACK IT'S YOURS - IF IT DOES'NT , IT NEVER WAS.    Move on and learn from your mistakes.    All the best !

yQ76KKkaaa	as i understand ur problem i feel that u r expecting a lot frm your man. when u expect something..not only in this case and when that does not happen things seems to get unhappy...so is this happening in your case..all the mistakes are in your side..pls correct those and live happily..first of all dont except frm your man..accept him the way he is..not all of them should be of the same character..may be ur man is more good..expressing would be different..if u accept him the way he is..half of your problem is solved. and the next one is dont compare him to anyone as he is not cloned. he has his own identity. he has his privacy..and life too. he need not be like others..he is your man not everyones..so when u stop comaring and expecting the whole lot of problem is solved. be happy the way he is..accept the way he is..get adjusted to the way he is and ull be successfull in your life.. he should have his privacy..too..in later stages also..dont be possessive also..dont feel jealous..be happy for everyone..if ur friends guys are so be happy for them dont be jealous..have a happy llife:)|`|jp5lfmzTaa	You need a gigolo?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	if you want to talk to him more then just tell him.. what you want .. ok ..|`|YWUjeTnUaa	From your post I can tell you have a problem with communication.

Spending quality time is quite essential for the development of any relationship. But when you know that he loves you a lot, there is no need to worry at all. Try to meet or talk with him, grab every opportunity to talk with him.But dont show your frustration on him, it will not help you. All the best!|`|el8XHxBpaa	wow. that hurt my eyes reading this...  calm down and think before you act
fPDCgKjbaa	Have you tried speaking to the parents? Perhaps you could attend a local restaurant with both sets of parents, and have them see that you're a decent person and have a good background.    If you're getting really desperate, you could remind them of Romeo and Juliet's plot line.    Otherwise..  "If you love somebody, then let them go"  Not permanently, but until he can support himself. That of course is the last resort, but in the end that's all you can do.    Best of luck to you, Juliet, and also to your Romeo.  (Just remember none of this is his fault...I know it sounds stupid, but seriously, girls can get frustrated in these circumstances and take it out on him...not saying that you are/will, just giving a warning =])    If anyone's interested, I've asked this question with very little response. Easy question, BA rewarded!  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i am sorry .. for his people .. as thay are so wrong.. love is great at your age ..why let them ruin it for you.. ask you mum and dad for help and you will get by i am sure ..|`|V4PA9foJaa	Participate in essay writing competitions..you have immense talent!!!|`|Mt4t34KOaa	Very sorry.Racial strifes are everywhere affecting people of all age,creed,religion and etc.There really isn't anything to do.For I am not a person to risk everything at one shot.Perhaps he is.I suppose I am akin to you being sceptical.Not afraid of losing it.Is afraid of the future, y not wait till he is stable N when he is able to guarantee his future first? There really are nothing much anyone can do in these situations.We're in reality , not in a drama where we can u knw, prove true affection to ppl or anything. But there are ppl willing to do such.Nobody knows the consequences after that though. I hope u pull through.There is nothing I can say either, so sorry.I will pray hard for your strife, the best I can do.  Good luck, God Bless.
szVvf7Nkaa	I also have Fibromyalgia and CFIDS so I know what you are going through. But your life does not end because you have that. The days that you are in pain you need to keep doing things because if you don' then it's only gets worst. The worst thing to do with FMS of CFIDS is to stay in bed. I know your body is tired all the time but you can fight this. And you can have a wonderful healthy relationship with your boyfriend. There will be days that are harder then other days but I'm sure your boyfriend understands that. Don't let the FMS of CFIDS come between you and your boyfriend. The day will come that you are going to be able to handle the pain. I've had FMS and CFIDS for more than 10 years now and living with that without any medication because medication does not agree with me. But if you have the proper medication then you will be okay if you don't give in to this disease.     There are support groups out there for FMS and CFIDS and maybe you and your boyfriend should go to a few meetings. By going to those meetings it will help your boyfriend to understand more about what is going on with you. And if you don't want to get involved with a group then there are many good books out there that explain what your disease is about. But I wouldn't give up on your relationship with your boyfriend. Don't take your disease as a death sentence because if you do then you end losing everything. The only way you are going to survive this is if you fight it and accept what is going on with you.|`|g5ShGjszaa	I'd just continue as you are, since you can't help it.  He seems cool, so just be happy about that and continue to do your best even as you're going through this crap, and he'll probably continue to support you.  That's crazy, cause I've been dealing with something similar to this for the past few years, and some days I've thought of suicide.  My girlfriend didn't care at all, especially since she's spoiled and selfish, so we ended up breaking up, but sounds like you've got a good guy, so good luck.  I think he'll keep "putting up" with this as long as you treat him well.
6k8GJBRPaa	When I'm in a relationship, I would like to be with only one partner, yes. It's way to busy to keep 2 (serious) relationships together at the same time.   What I think it's important is that we're both able to be ourselves in the relationship. And a good communication is also important.|`|AP0ZyBbLaa	Hi Thando,    Never ever nag, give each other space to breath and smile too much.    Kind regards  Justin.
w4W0dwz3aa	When he tries to touch you he loves you physically and when he smiles at you and acts differently in front of you compared to when hes with other people he loves you emotionally|`|rd70xQvwaa	if the guy goes out with you, wants to kiss nd **** u|`|GrhiWC4uaa	well..i think you will know by small gestures...like surprising you by doing things you wouldn't expect him to do.(cooking you dinner,lighting candles,giving you flowers)or just maybe holding your hand,watching you sleep,going out of his way to show you he cares.(when your sick he tries to comfort you and help you to get better,snuggles with you,opens doors,takes you to a game or picnic,talks with you on the phone for a long time*not alot of guys like talking on phones*)also he doesnt mind trying to be patient and work things out if there is something wrong or on your mind...might sound mushy and non existent but those are some examples. also if the guy always tries to look and smell nice for you..good grooming is a sign that he cares for you|`|4khY5boEaa	maybe in a way that..he always kooks at you and talks to you...and  you'll see it in his eyes...u'll see it's different the way he look at you..|`|K7sDPIcZaa	Emotionally - they are like a little puppy dog with u  Physically - they love u for who you are and if they emotionally love u then they will physically love u  x|`|tS0N6zQVaa	he will accept u just d way u are wherther u are fat or slim tall or short or even normal .u will notice that he always tell his friends about u and always tell u he loves u when he is out.even wen his friends try to discourage him he tells u .|`|Je2cos0laa	his eyes or actions will tell you

nyylb6qUaa	If she is a close friend of yours, love her no matter what she does. Sit down with her, and let her know how much she means to you. Forgive her for whatever she has done. Show her that no matter what she does, she will always have a friend like you. She just might feel that there is no one on this earth that truly loves her. Just let her know that you do no matter what. If you need any more help, e-mail me at themark08@yahoo.com. I had a friend like that once, and I never let him feel like I loved him, and after ten years, I lost him. Don't let that happen to you. May God Bless.|`|JieuhM9eaa	i no you feel hurt but if her boyfriend was controlling her she was in a v. bad situation. mayb if you cant forgive her straight away take it in steps. hope it goes well. x|`|j7hRHcIzaa	Yeah... I would talk to her.    Try talking to her... more! Give her another chance. And as a best friend, try telling her to pick a better boyfriend next time. Make more effort. Don't waste the memories of your friendship. It maybe hard to talk to her again... but at least you tried to be a real bestfriend than a temporary friend, right?

fxehl3iLaa	I think the context and content of the call are much more important than the call itself. If he actually did enjoy the date as much as you did he'll probably call you (they're expected to). Keep in mind guys don't tend to feel the need to "take it slow" if they're really interested... just sayin.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	Call him .. its perfectly fine|`|AzwqJ6Hdaa	No,I don't think your impatient.If I were you,I would be wondering why he hasn't call too? If he had as much fun as he claim he did,he would have call you by now.But,maybe he's old fashion.Some guys like to wait.I say give him a couple more days,then if he doesn't call,you can call him.I just hope things work out for you.|`|y5qZRyLraa	Nah, just make sure he's in a good mood when you call him lol!
AA11200536	The only way to forget someone you love is to love a new one..see, he doesn't deserve you!Point out the bad qualities he has and open your eyes.Maybe there are others who will make you feel loved, you just need to open your eyes.|`|AA12361886	Set your sights on someone else.

Every time you walk past; look in the other direction, every time he  pops into your head, think about something else.     Good luck!   I know it's hard! But trust me, you will get over him!|`|DMLT0uXWaa	you could offer him the prospect of sex or letting him touch you.
0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Yep.
fPDCgKjbaa	I wish he would....    But any of my other friends...yes. That would wierd me out, unless they were a serial kisser or for other reasons (context plays a big role in answering this q)    But most of all, I'd feel bad that I didn't feel the same way as them.

szVvf7Nkaa	I hate to have to tell you this but if this guy really cared for you he wouldn't be acting this way. I think this guy is lying to you but I don't think he means to do that. I think he just doesn't know how to tell you that he's not interested. Maybe you should stop texting him and just let it go.    I think his message was clear when he said he was just looking for fun. But now maybe you have deep feelings for him and he's not interested in that. I'm not saying that he's not interested in you but he's not interested in a serious relationship. If you think you are starting to have deep feelings for this guy then maybe its best for you to walk away. If you dont walk away then he will only hurt you in the long run.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	well i think the key thing in this is the part where u said he told you he was just looking for fun, unfortunately that was his out clause so that you would never be able to get mad at him for things like that, i mean in his mind. doesnt make him any less of a jerk, but guys say exactly wat they mean if u listen closely enough. i'd forget him if i were u, he's 25 an at that age they either want to settle down or they just want to party and i think he's made that clear. so if i were u i'd be straight up and be like i want more than friends with benefits and if u cant give me that that's cool but i dont wanna waste emotions where they're not wanted. u seem like an awesome person, and i've totally been there, u know hoping that if u hang out with someone enough feelings will "happen" but it just doesnt work that way and ur just growing more and more attatched to someone that's prolly seeing other people.|`|V4PA9foJaa	Every guy hates cougars, if you know what i mean, older women looking for younger guys...|`|Je2cos0laa	well look the guy has a job, his cell phone is a **** and he is not able to talk to you u have to understand him plus u guys never went out so babe first go out with him and then feel offended because right now what i see is just that you like this guy a lot like an obsession
b1u9jlRhaa	the reason why you`re still thinking about her is because you still make yourself hope that you can get together with her. you probably havent got much of girlfriends, have you `?|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	she was playing with you and this enough to stop thinking in her try to find another girl|`|UzvoQvB2aa	you need to move on remember she belongs to someone els now not you would you want your girl friends ex thinking about her all the time|`|V4PA9foJaa	forget about her dude, just get over it...what?! is this your first breakup?!|`|AA12361886	your obsessed with her.|`|cn9FRj9taa	she's with someone else....let her go!|`|bqnteDwTaa	i kinda was in the same situation a while back. try finding another female, and if you still can't stop thinking about this girl then you know its for real. And if you see it fit, GO FOR IT !
UOmhBNxKaa	They just have indiscriminate sex with whoever they want and don't think about the future.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Because we believe in sex before marriage so there's no need to rush! Personally, me and my boyfriend are at a stage where we could get married but we thought we might as well wait until we've got more money so we can have a nice wedding because marriage doesn't really give your relationship anything extra, so what's the point of doing it as soon as possible when it's more practical to wait.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Easy- just have sex with as many different people as possible!|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	cause 75% of marriages fail this day in age and you really should live life and date before getting married to anyone.cause marriage is alot different than dating,,,

Xn7l9YXNaa	To share mutual feelings with them but cannot be together. Definitely!    I'm going through that right now, and millions of emotions fly through my head at once. I feel a bit led on by them,knowing they feel the same way, and there's something stopping us. And the sense of jealousy knowing you can't be with this person. Feeling upset, fearing someone might step in the picture and ruin it.    Hope I helped|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	both have been in both situations|`|ymXa9xe4aa	they actually can both be painful dude!

I would think to share feelings but cannot be with them is harder.  To have feelings not returned is tough, but you can rationalize & say it's their loss.  But, if you know this person wants to be with you & they are just beyond your grasp.  This keeps you in a constant state of what if.  Yeah, the second is worse.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	second one ...|`|Wytd3dajaa	The second one.|`|dKq0Ak4taa	second one|`|M63kq3AYaa	The first, because there is no "cannot"  Where there's a will, there's a way.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	2nd one|`|OE8r1VtRaa	i think to know your feelings are shared is harder, if they dont feel the same its easy to get over but to know what you could have is very hard.  I've been there|`|9inngmg7aa	the latter! i know exactly how tough it is to be in that situation. It almost kills you but then you make peace - however difficult it is.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	The second. I'm in that situation right now. :(|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	the second case|`|BRnYseFKaa	second one. i dont mind that first feeling.....the first feeling gives me hope and someone to fantasize about :) the second is just utter pain!|`|5AwLW1buaa	The latter.    Because, being apart when that person could be the one, is a killer. If a person doesn't like you back, unless you are a stalker, will naturally (in time) make you move on.    It is impossible to move on though if you both feel the same but are being seperated through no fault of your own.|`|812xWV0naa	second one for sure|`|scUqnbNJaa	How do I choose!? both have happened to me and they both hurt so much!!|`|D74Lj3H7aa	the second one|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	both are tough|`|ANqFzXxWaa	2|`|UzvoQvB2aa	the first one|`|szVvf7Nkaa	I say the second one.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	Definitely to have feelings for someone when they are not reciprocated.     If you share mutual feelings, but cannot be with them, chances are you can have contact via email, phone, etc...so you are still able to have a relationship on some level.|`|u0udwkZQaa	I think from the male perspective, I'd say it's worse where there's mutual attraction because it's painful when love is unrequited, but you get over it -it's not the first crush and won't be the last. However, when it's mutual the pain is more because the fact you are loved makes your love for them that much stronger. I have actually become attracted to someone simply because they showed strong attraction for me.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	Definitely the 2nd one :(|`|JnnBiFK4aa	the first one|`|x5GH9A9Gaa	Second option .

At least in the first one you know that there is no chance of something happening and you can gain closure and move on. The second one is a fresh wound every time you think about it.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	sharing each other|`|YKXkcfzSaa	I think, the latter one coz' you cannot be with them eventhough you both love each other like in the case of OFW (overseas foreign worker), leaving their family behind to earn a living!!!

I mean, man grow up ,and try and find someone in this country eyy! xoxo|`|Mt4t34KOaa	Your life, your pick.Think with the logical side.Not the feeling side.Then you'll see the right answer.|`|OHfZFR31aa	don't get your hopes up too much because you have no idea until you meet if the chemistry is there or not. A friend was online with a girl from California and went to visit her, expecting to stay with her for 2 weeks, and he ended up leaving after 2 days because they didn't click at all in person, and she was much different when speaking than she was online. I know another friend who flew from NY to Miami to meet a guy she met online and the same thing happened. Before she went, she was so excited and thought he might be "the one" but in person it just wasn't the same    The problem with online is that you build up a persona in your mind that doesn't always match the reality of that person.|`|9inngmg7aa	it's too risky and not to mention crazy. don't do it!|`|q4tTabfjaa	Have you spoke to her and seen her face?  If not it could be like the character Mo from Eastenders or worse a bloke!|`|wRwyUNGmaa	I would take some more time to get to know her first and then save up some money. It sounds like a good start, but TRUST me, you really need time to get to know each other before you make any big plans and spend money on it because sometimes even when you still have feelings for them, people can change and show a really ugly side of themselves you never dreamt was there.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	if she loves you she will come to you because you cannot leave your work

Challenge her but be very calm and collected and explain why it is annoying you|`|InGWARz9aa	stick a mouse trap in there lol x|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	WTF is this bird your Supervisor?  Or just another nosy employee.  If it is yr permanent desk then speak to yr Supervisor & get her to bring it up @ a team meeting, she has no right to go through your personal drawer.      If she continues sticking her beak where it shouldn't be after yr team meeting advise yr Supervisor that she is still invading yr privacy & you want to put a mouse trap in the drawer.   Yes it's the company's desk that you sit @ but unless she shares that desk what reason does she have to go through your drawer?   Have you asked her what she is doing?  If you can't do the mouse trap thing (don't unless your Supervisor okay's it), then start going through her drawer when she asks why just tell her you are returning the favor.  If she doesn't like it tell you'll stop when she does.   Good luck.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	It is a question of boundaries, does she have a drawer? do to her what she does to you. If you don't like it tell her, obviously it is your company space and therefore should be respected. Why is she writing notes on things I don't quite get that. Is she your supervisor or something? Good luck.|`|B24W8w43aa	It's not your drawer - it is office equipment (If you brought in your own that would be another story). Unfortunately they have every right to go in there.

Some issues that u did not know, since u two hardly talk.It might be a crime when u called him, cause the issue was ONGOING in front of him at that point of time? U see, possibilities everywhere.And don't find the thing out by asking directly.For now, just play like its normal, but u need to find it out, u know, after u went all over the bush and stuff, then ask him about it.
Nco7uM0gaa	There is an age old rule that it is up to the guy to make the first move unless he is too shy,and by what you say about this guy,he is not shy.!This sounds like a guy that you should stay away from unless you want to be another one of his trophies,not to mention ruining your reputation.Trust me on this one!!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	you have known him for 3 years.

It really depends if you have dealt with the issues that drove you apart the first time around.   For example if it was problems with interfering family members and you have moved away or financial problems and circumstances have changed for the better then there is so hope.   However if you broke up the first time because of infidelity or abuse then more then likely things will be no different the second time around.   People grow, mature and change so there is always hope.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	It depends why they broke up in the first place and what kind of damage has been done to the relationship, also the time that has elapsed.

p6QizgmRaa	No, no, no! If you both have finances involved in this home, it should be completely yours should something happen to him. His daughter is an adult. Yes, leave her funds or something but not your home! Stand firm on this as it is very unfair. Standing your ground may cause friction between the two of you but simply explain to him that it would be heart-wrenching enough to lose your husband, let alone your home at the same time.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Unfortunately - if it's his, it's his. But if he isnt interested in looking after you past his death, sell up and take what's yours now. You don't need to be treated like that. You have alot of life left, don't get left out in the cold cause he's having second thoughts about your welfare. Get half you money out of the joint acct and inform the bank you are in dispute- no more money is to be withdrawn (he he he) sell the house and get half. Let him see what he'll be leaving you with.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Time for you to have a consultation with a lawyer and find out where you stand legally.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	You will need to talk to a lawyer and find out what your rights are.  In some States he might not have the right to "will" away joint property.  In others he might be able to give "half" of the house to his daughter / half to you BUT you (the wife) can remain living their for as long as you want (your daughter can't unless you want her to).  It is only if you should sell the house / property would you have to split the value.  At any rate, get a lawyer.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	His obligation is to his wife, not a daughter, and certainly not a grandchild.  In this day and age of blended families, lawyers are very familiar with all of these issues.  They will council him through this.  Some very creative solutions do exist, but get started now with a lawyer in your pocket.  You may need to meet before without your husband in attendance.  Can you agree to leave your assets to daughter/grandkids in your will should he predecease you?  You should have the right to live in your own house, but once you die, who cares where the $ goes.  It sounds like the grandkids will benefit, and the daughter will just have to accept this.  The x, too.  Remain calm and unemotional when you talk about this issue.  Hire the lawyer.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	WOW??? You really did marry a RAT BAS*ARD????  Stick to your guns honey ansd don't allow this idiot to take whats rightfully YOURS!!!!!!!!!|`|LiqV0tGhaa	This is a complicated one and no easy answer as there is some right on both sides.    Some of the value of the house dates back to his first marriage and the children from that and they should get some benefit from that.    As you are younger, you will probably outlive your husband, but that should not mean everything should go to yo and your family.    I suggust you discuss this with your husband snd suggest this:    1)  On a first death (might be you!), the assets are split 50/50, half to the survivor and half to where the deceased wills it.    2)  Agree that the deceased wills half of their share to the surviving spouse.    This will mean the survivor will get 75% (whoever that is) and the deceased will be able to will 25% off to whom they wish, in you husbands case, his daughter and grandchildren.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	alk to him when still aloive he might change his mind|`|dnFpyyMSaa	Simple, divorce the ungrateful bastard NOW.

Of course I'm sure your father says that because it's not "normal" and it'll be difficult to raise a family with two different religions, and one not being dominant, but it isn't. If your children want to be Muslim or Hindu, that's their problem. Love like this isn't based on religion. If you both truly love each other, then it can truly work out. There is always a way of working around religions. Stick to your religion and allow him to stick to his. I grew up in a home with two religions, but I still managed to fully follow the Hindu religion for some reason. Must've been fate! ;-) Wishing you both a successful path in life.
77FNePxFaa	I think it depends on the repercussions you will face from your family and friends. If you are strong enough to deal with the end result and you love the guy that much than it's nothing wrong with going with your heart. You just need to make sure you are strong enough to handle it.  Make sure his love for you is as strong as your love for him as well...    Good Luck|`|AA12346188	No conversion - no marriage.|`|PbM8D3j2aa	First of all love is not a wrong thing. I don't know under which age group you comes.If you are in adolescent group take it as a part of your growth and development.In this age it is so natural that most of the children are attracted to their opposite sex.Believe that it is only an attraction.If you really want to lead the remaining life with him there is no place for such confusions.religion,community,cast etc.have nothing to do with true love.Remember that there is no rule that all loves must be end in marriage.
cd87288852b5c01e64c902f0433720abaa	I feel for you, emotional affairs sometimes are harder than just plain sexual affairs because you can have sex with someone and that's it, but when you know that the person you love let someone else in their hearts is painful. I know how you feel, my husband was doing the same thing with a co-worker, they would talk on the phone all the time and at all hours of the night (he used to work nights so I didn't know he was doing it). I am really distraught by it, I am in a lot of pain. Just like you I love my husband with all of my heart, and we just got a new home together and I just had our first son (only 4months old). The worst part about this situation is that he started talking to this person when I was pregnant.   Trust is a very hard thing to get back, you will never see your wife the same way but that doesn't mean the relationship is over, is up to them to fix it. I am in the same dilemma as you, I don't know if I should leave him or stay with him, if she agrees you should go to counseling and seek the truth, if she doesn't want to go to counseling, then she needs to prove to you that she is really really really sorry. She needs to make up for all of those times she was "away".   I trully hope you guys can make it, but if you see that she's being the same, leave, you can't be in an unhealthy relationship, is not good for you or your son. Not only that, but then you and her are going to be misserable.   Sorry to hear about your situation, I feel your pain, is not a good place to be, but you can fix this.|`|jjt2enntaa	I say dump her, & take the child.  She betrayed you, and lied to you, and deceived you.      She was in this "affair" for a relatively long time and she chose to pursue it rather than to end it.   She had to have seen the signs that this "friendship" was getting out of hand, and yet she continued on with it.      She only promised to end it after you accidentally found out about it.  Had you not found out, she would most likely still be pursuing this other relationship.    She is a cheat and a liar. I would not be able to trust or believe this type of person ever again.|`|FzFSzilmaa	relationships are always hard...    and there are things that happen to test them...    personally, i would have let her go to decide what she wanted/needed to do... you can't just decide to stop all emotions... she needs closure with her ex... and letting her seek that closure would be the best way forward...    but you are right that your 2 year old is the innocent party in this, but your wife is also the victim in this... she can't help the way she feels... just like you can't...|`|Gho2CFyzaa	If you decide to give your wife a second chance, you have to do it whole heartedly.  You cant bring it up every time you have a fight or a disagreement.    If you forgive her - forgive her totally.    I would continue to 'keep an eye on her though'.|`|pOCabUMvaa	You are not a fool, you are human, if you love her enough and she loves you enough to save the marriage for you and your child and for the both of you, then I would recommend counseling.    There is a reason she broke up with her ex, and there was a reason why she married you.    I think you both have to connect, and talk, and get counseling.    If she goes back to him, who is going to say the grass is greener on the other side??    She has to realize that it will not be greener on the other side, and she has to realize why she married you, because you are the best thing than can happen for her now in her life.    I would say counseling, you both need help, and she needs to come up with the tools to deal with the past in order to deal with the future.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Although your support for her talking and reconnecting with her ex was big of you I guess. NOTHING good can ever come out of a situation like that?? I'm sorry>>>But yes your right that you can never forget your past, BUT you CAN leave it behind you without any problems. I believe your wife and the ex never really left it behind them. I think that's why they reconnected. Ya it looked friendly at first>>> But any ex's that get together to reconnect after a lengthy time>>>theres something up with that?? The other thing about you checking her phone for messages??? If she wasn't doing anything wrong, she wouldn't have gotten that crazy about it!!!! SHE GOT CAUGHT!!!! That's why she was SO ANGRY!!! I'm sorry to say this but I DON'T believe her when she says she'd like to work this out with you. Your son will be fine. Theres been millions of bad marriages out there that kids have survived over as long as you guys do it in a respectful way and keep him OUT of the situation. Don't involve him in this. Getting together with an EX is NEVER a good thing. You may thought it was innocent. My question is WHY would there ever be a need to get together with an ex from your past???? Ya be friendly and cordial to each other while passing on the street. But to get together with them to hang out????? SORRY>>>that IS NEVER A GOOD THING!!! You MOST CERTAINLY can ABANDON your past!!!! Thats HOG WASH????  You may have memories from your past, and that is normal. BUT if that past means nothing to you>>>then of course you can abandon it???? If you have TRUELY moved on from your past then you can. But if you haven't moved on>>>there are going to be issues. Of course when you marry someone else and have their baby I would think they HAVE moved on??? But your wife DID NOT!!!! The next time your partner says that it's just closure is the reason why they want to get friendly with an ex again???? It's NOT closure. They want to rekindle what they had before because they are missing it. A big red flag needs to go off in your head when you hear that??? Good luck. I hope things get better for you in your future.But live and learn from THIS ONE what to ecept and what NOT TO EXCEPT??? On emore thing. You have NO IDEA that this was just an emotional affair??? How do you know that it wasn't physical???  I believe that at one point it was physical. If this has been going on for a year??? It was physical at one point. This is not an emtional affair?? You can keep telling yourself that to make yourself feel better. But you need to face reality.|`|rsb6rEouaa	I do not believe you to be a fool. If you love her that much then yes, it is worth saving. As you say, it was emotional which is easier to get over then physical. I would say talk everyday. Keep treating her well, she will know what she has. I have been through this not long ago. My wife and I are totally happy. So there is hope and I wish you the best.|`|AA11972752	Not that I'm typically skeptical about questions, but there's something about this question that feels off to me. "My wife has just recently revealed to me..." If she was having an emotional affair for a year, where you say it was enough to hurt the child by "abandoning" you both for a year emotionally, wouldn't you have noticed this happening? Why would it need to be "revealed" to you?    Also, you keep placing the emphasis on what she's done to the poor 2-year old child, but it seems like most of this is really about what she is doing to you. I'm sure the 2-year old child isn't reading these text messages. It will only hurt the child if you both let this completely destroy your marriage, and I don't believe that has happened yet. I can't figure out what your motivation is in using the child as your reason so much. Do you think you are not a worthy enough reason for her to not let her heart stray?    With all of that said, of course this marriage can be repaired if both of you are willing to work on it. There's no guarantees in life that it will work out, but if this relationship is important to you to save, you'll give it a good, honest try. I would just continue to be watchful and forget about the privacy issues at this point. Privacy is for people that don't do things like this. Eventually you will have to start trusting her if you want a real marriage, but I would give it some time to make sure it really is over before you start doing that!|`|YbSsCVRRaa	please try to live for your son as his future is more important to you both as his life depended on you both as you will have to live with better understanding for the welfare of the boy to bring him in a better atmosphere|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	my God my heart goes out to you...I really think that things will never be the same my x and I had some issues like that it your situation that is almost as having an affair,I really think you and your son should walk away...I am so sorry|`|p6QizgmRaa	Walking away is easier said than done when you're still in love with your partner and there is a child involved. I don't like giving this advice as it is so obvious and I know people are looking for more but I really do think counseling would benefit you and your family.  I would have to disagree with your comment that she wasn't looking for more. Treating her as a queen or not, even though you feel she has nothing that could possibly need fulfilling, she obviously feels something is missing. An emotionally, physically and spiritually fulfilled woman will not look for outside attention. She did. Don't take it to heart and certainly don't allow yourself to take blame but she was looking for something, even if she doesn't admit it. She needs to search within herself and find what she feels she is lacking. A counselor can help her figure this out.  Good luck and I hope things work out for you.|`|nlQiRHRJaa	YES it's terrible nobody should go through that ,i feel for you ,i wish i could do something,BUT the best i can tell you is do what's right for you and your son ,nobody can tell you what to do in this situation,so take care                          god bless you   ps :if you want to talk more let me know|`|yQ76KKkaaa	u seem to be a very nice person:)  u r not a fool. u r trying to save ur marriaige and u dont want your son to be affected by this and u are playing a good role of a husband and a father..but i feel u should also understand some practical things..ur wife has manipulated with u..many times and u know that is having a relation. mothers normally don abandon children but unfortunately she is more concerned about herself.  if u want to have a sincere suggestion i would suggest that u let go as she likes as one can never force and staying with her without love and responsibily is not marraige. if at all u are living with her it shoudl be a proper relationship. otherwise it would be more problematic for your son. let her go her way..talk to her..and keep your self happy..with a life as you like ..u have a life to live too..everyone has just one life. u have given her chances..but she wants her choice respect htat and respect yourself too..how long can you keep working out..children are very smart now a days ..they get adjusted to all situations..dont worry about your son...nature will take care..sit think properly and take good decision..i suggest u to write down the problems and work out..in an order..good luck..and have a happy life..:)|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Once a cheat...always a cheat.

She may have been the best thing to have ever happened to you.  She clearly is not the best thing happening to you right now.
YVEeGlFbaa	You have every right to be mad in my opinion. they have ex- past history together and now they are good friends. some woman can handle it, but I couldn't. I guess it depends on every individual. everyone has different morals, beliefs, values and ways of thinking. i think that there has to be a boundary between that kind of friendship. I feel that she should be somewhat distance and respect you.  if he loves you, he should respect your feelings. if you love each other, he does not need a best girlfriend, when he has you. it is ok to share laughs and conversations with the other sex, but there are limits with ex-'s in my book... he seems immature too. he twisted things around and all of a sudden you are over dramatic. you did nothing wrong. what you see and hear is clear. don't question yourself and be hard on yourself. your gut feelings and intuition come to you for a reason. it is not that you are overly paranoid, jealous or over reacting....it is common sense and what you feel is normal. speak your mind and if he makes you feel bad--then i feel your going to have to deal with an idiot for a while. you'll have to be patient and wait for him to grow up. f you are in the early stages, move on. you are too good for him. there are a million men in this world and some will treat you like a queen. that is what every woman needs. we need to be treated with respect, love and honesty  --from experience.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	no you do have the right to talk to him if you feel uncomfortable about it. i'd keep an eye on this one.|`|acYPFNeFaa	say something!|`|0pX1oQAJaa	you have the right. exs can be friends, but they shouldnt be that close... especially when they know what makes the other tick...|`|5fwIsT9Baa	You were right to give out he shouldnt be flirting with any girl especially an ex and not in front of you|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If he is 'just friends' why the flirting?

If he flipped out (literally, not verbally) then he might still have feelings for her. Have a sit down with him and tell him how you really feel about him (as i'm sure you have) and remind him what you have to offer compared to her. Ask him to tell you how he feels and don't hold any grudges, (i.e. if he says he still has feelings, that's to be expected). Can you trust him though? Has he given you a reason not to ?|`|48RXUHh8aa	When someone is having an affair, the other person can sense it 90% of the time.  This happened to me, and these two were flirty with one another... throwing water on each other right in front of me... and I was jealous... and they denied it meant anything.  Later I caught her texting the details of the sex they had on the beach.  I would be careful.|`|QltaXcKUaa	He's cheating!|`|XAutzJpAaa	OMG, isnt it obvious girl?? Of course you have the right!! What kind of bf is that, 2 dare to flirt in front of you and it's even his ex?!     Clearly ur bf doesnt respect you and wants 2 act like you r the one who's at fault.     Y dont you flirt with ur ex in front of him. Let's c how he feels.    Sry, but what a b*stard of a bf you have.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Hey i agree with you. You cant be friends with your exes. Especially if they are flirting whats with that? Tell him to cut ties from her or you start talking to your exes and flirt and see how he likes it!  I bet ya he will back off very quickly if he doesn't then there is your answer. best of luck|`|pCRVh7NEaa	no u r not crazy look firends can be lovers but lovers cant be ever firends   so i think its better if he stop this relation with her ex|`|qXp0gNzKaa	It is not considerate of your boyfriend to have flirted with his ex in front of you.  You need to let him know that this is bothering you because he truly loves you then he will stop whatever he is doing.  I was in a similar situation where my boyfriend kept replaying to his ex who was stalking him with "I miss you" e-mails.  It was over my limit, I told him that it had been seriously bothering me and that he needs to CUT all his ties with the ex.  And he did, because he loves me and wants me to be happy.  The ex is just another human being like everyone else, but you are his GIRLFRIEND.  It's okay you feel this way, and voice it to your boyfriend in honest way.  Do not be hysterical or overly emotional, just know that if he truly loves you, he will do whatever to make you happy...      Good luck!!!|`|zLsA6IAPaa	you had every right to say that because you should be able to talk to each other if something is bothering you in a relationship. but i still think that he should have realised he was flirting and stopped it, especially if hes confident that its totally over between them.    yea of course its fine for them to be friends, they just have to know where the line sits between friends and more than friends, and they also have to know where your tolorence lies. btw, ur boyfriend should know that if u guys are really close        i hope this helped :D|`|d4dae419ea818d444681b07b745c0670aa	you certainly had a right hun dont feel badf about ir he deserrvers being shouted at if he flirting with her infront of you     =]|`|xHPBzfuSaa	i know how it feels.. and i guess the feel is normal. the best that i could advise is for you to talk to your boyfriend about this. tell him how you feel. I know if you tell your boyfriend honestly how you feel he would definitely understand. you could also spend your time thinking of things that could help you bond with your boyfriend. like plan a movie night together, cook food for him and eat it together. if would also help the both of you get to know each other and at the same time help you get your mind off your bf's ex.|`|UJYICsk1aa	You have a right to be angry my dear :)

Don't worry too much about it. It has nothing to do with you.|`|3325a2162fb81b6dcd62281b3f7a6677aa	First. Never beg a hooker. Some of the largest cocks in porn come from ugly dudes. (Not that that's my thing{cocks}). Don't chase her, instead find someone that she knows, tell the girl the problem, pay her good (big tips help), and bang the crap out of her. The word will get back to her friend and she'll be the one missed out.   Second. Why a hooker anyway? The club life is the best place to find girls if you just want to experiment. Get a girl, offer to buy her a drink, if she turns you down, don't give up.   Third. Have you considered a different diet? I know many people that had severe acne (6/10, My brother), he changed his diet and worked out regularily and stayed away from extremely greasy foods (burgers, fries, mcdonalds, burger king, chocolates) every now and then is ok to have these foods, but if you are a constant junk fooder and don't really have a diet plan, i would look into it. (foods can affect the body in many ways). There are many medicines also that you can try and don't wash your face with soap use a lotion or baby oil to wash your face, it will smoothen and soften your face, also when you wash it make sure you do it with warm (at least 200 degree) water. Heat opens the pores in your face to release dirt. Try those and if they work let me know.|`|xHPBzfuSaa	well based on your story it's quite obvious that the girl you like doesn't like you. so stop thinking or planning to spend time with her. instead  of spending time thinking why she doesn't like you try to improve yourself first. you said that you have a poor skin. try to improve it first for you to have a better personality and improve your confidence as well in meeting girls. please stop meeting girls just for an experience. instead of rushing things why don't you meet people who would help you build your confidence and personality. im pretty sure in time you will be able to have a girlfriend that would love you for who you are. but first love yourself.|`|jIB2kIzKaa	If your really horrible to look at, why not try a Gimp suit.

What I would suggest is find a time before you both go to sleep, like on the weekend when you are not working, or before you go to work, do it early enough.    By adjusting the timing, you will both be happy.|`|F4d89iRMaa	sex without romance all the time in a marriage is bad but once in awhile or not too much is fine.

She may at times feel the same way, just wanting you to perform oral o her for her own pleasure. If she does and even though you may be tired or not in the mood then you do it for her.     It's a two way street. I'm sure it happens in all marriages.

Being a teenage guy in high school, I'm afraid to say at most guys are animals that this stage in their lives. I've learnt to steer clear of most of them, but there are the few nice guys that aren't too disgusting. And yes, disgusting would be a word used to describe a whole bunch of us. Us "nice" guys chat about whatever. Girls is a big one, teachers, whats happening on the weekend. Just general hanging out. There is the occasional "sus" comment about stuff that should be kept private, but I know for a fact that things get a lot worse in different crowds. I hope this helps.
zdu3gh8jaa	Are you sure that he has been appointed power of attorney or is he just her appointee? My husband is appointee for our learning disabled adult son. This allows my husband to discuss finances, health care etc on our son's behalf to achieve the best for him.It does not mean that my husband can disregard our son's decisions regarding his care, which appears to be the case with your brother. My understanding of Power of Attorney is it is usually only given where a person is not sound enough of mind to make their own decisions/understand their needs. Your mum sounds like she still has all her faculties, so she should still be able to make decisions on her care requirements knowing that these choices will be upheld with the backing of her son. Your brother should have legal paperwork that states that he has power of attorney, try to see this proof if possible. Also you could see someone  at citizens advice, they could advise you further regarding this issue and where you stand legally. Then if necessary see a solicitor.   Finally, have you thought to make an appointment to go to speak to your mum's doctor. If they know that she needs help, they can ask for the ot, social services, etc to get involved to assess your mums needs and there will be nothing your brother could legally do about it if it is the doctor making the recommendation.  I am not of the legal profession in any way, so legally I cannot suggest what to do, however common sense tells me thast something doesn't sounds right with this situation. I hope you get the right advice and that the situation gets resolved soon.    Sorry I could not be of any further help, but I do hope everything works out for your mum and that she gets all the support she needs.    (((Hugs))) to you and your mum|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Alright - he has power of attorney. So, consult him. Tell him what your concerns are and what you'd like done. He can't stop you from getting her help by the way. People will wonder whats wrong with him.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Power of attorney only starts when a person is unable to make decisions for themselves so if your mother is OK mentally then he has no power over her healthcare. There are also strict rules about what a person with PofA can do - they have to act in the best interests of the patient and act within her wishes, so if he does try to stop you doing anything that is best for her, a judge would probably overrule it.    At the moment, even if the PofA is valid, your brother can't force you to tell the ot to talk to him instead because the PofA has nothing to do with you so you can do whatever you want, it's not like he could sue you or anything. All he could do is to refuse treatment (but you could get away with not telling him about it) and even then anything that comes under the category of lifesaving treatment (which you could claim anything is if it would be dangerous for her not to see the ot) he has no power to refuse in any circumstances.    So in summary, in the Uk PofA isn't nearly as powerful as your brother thinks it is so don't let him bully you into not getting help for your mother.|`|8765ea9ad82eb11dbeae3ab65abec135aa	Do not, under any circumstances, accept untutored advice from anyone on this site. Nobody with a layperson's knowledge of the law can help you.  I can't, and neither can anyone else who might wish to post answers here during their lunchbreak. I would go so far as to say the well meaning social misfits who run Citizens' Advice can't help you either, even if you could get to see them without joining the queue outside their offices at 7.00 a.m.    Really, there is only one thing to say and that is bite the bullet, go halves on the cost with your sister and see a lawyer. A good lawyer. Your brother has access to legal advice, and you must have the same if you are going to go toe to toe with him.    Just remember the old adage - there is no value in bringing a knife to a gunfight.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	get a lawyer and talk to him|`|rp46MQKeaa	as someone who has for the last 6 years dealt with local government and community issues may i suggest you contact your local age concern for individual advice about your brothers attitude. As he has power of attorney or more commonly enduring power of attorney then his attitude is wrong, he will know that he has obligations to your mothers welfare.your best bet is to explain to your brother that unless he cooperates with you and your sisters you will have no choice but to contact social services and report this as elder abuse. This is taken very seriously in the UK and i have been on many a social service panel regarding allegations of abuse and they should act swiftly, you should if you look, at your local authority literature: find the contact number's. If you pop into a resource centre for the elderly (we don't call them old folks day centres any more) you will find literature and contact numbers on the main notice board.  Try and keep calm and do not start a family feud.  I have seen just how upset parents can get when their own children fall out with one another.   No solicitor can over rule a loving family, your brother just might find that his solicitor would have to remind him of his legal obligations and that does not include alienating himself from the rest of the family.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	He needs to prove that he has power of attorney over your mother to you.

yLNsOJiQaa	As much as it sucks....you have to have faith.  It is easy to say but hard to have when everything looks like it is going to hell in a hand basket.  Faith is something that you can't see, touch, taste, or smell it.  You just have it and know that everything will be ok even though on the exterior it looks horrible.  I am sure that yall have thought of every way possible to stay.  All you can do is to get up each morning, take a breath, and think positive.      As much as it hurts to let your house go know that a home is where you make it.  In the end, I am sure that all will be ok.  It will take some time to adjust and to get over the hurt of being far from your family.  You have your husband by your side to lean on and him to you.

yLM1kld4aa	Son and daughters are to share equally the property and other assets left on their death.    You can take protection from your drunken brother legally from civil court or  from police station nearby your area or from women cell.    Legally you can also claim rent from your brother and sister from the date of death of your mother.    I have never faced such situation but my answer is based on experiences from others.|`|PUARRHzSaa	If the property is not ancestral, all 3 of you get equal share. If the property has been bought by your father , he has a right to decide who gets the property (either fully or otherwise). Either ways the first right on the property belongs to his wife (I am assuming he died first and was survived by his wife). His wife cannot change the will if  she was not registered as a co - owner of the property.   In India, Word of your father's friends will not suffice. The Law does not recognise that.   Assuming your brother destroyed the will, you have nothing to worry about. By law, you will have to get equal share even if its your dads self earned property as there is no will (As claimed by your brother).    Please go to the nearest police station and lodge a complaint. Get a lawyer (Not a crook, A real Lawyer) for your self and take it forward.|`|1hciyvKdaa	talk to other family members or friends of your fathers and see if any know of the will and or his wishes before death.

Where in the world this case belongs to? Was the 'Will' in question kept,with whom or was it registered with the Registrar of Documents? See when you people ask such legal questions you must tell the details properly & correctly for right assessment of your problem & necessary solution for it. If is case for Hindu family then even if the 'Will' written by the deceased father was destroyed & no record exist about it anywhere ether in the form of it being registered document with the Registrar of Documents or in any other form its copy kept anywhere else,then according to the Hindu Succession Act,1956 all the surviving children ,both sons as well daughters have equal share in the property of the deceased Hindu man/woman with the presumption that deceased died intestate i.e. without leaving any testamentary document such as 'Will'. Similar facts may not be same in case of Indian Muslims, as daughters get share in the property of the deceased man if there is no surviving son of the Muslim. Likewise this very legal aspect may be different for other religions & in different countries. I cannot give any more legal opinion on this issue unless the entire facts are clearly mentioned as pointed out by me.

Best thing to do honestly is move on, dont focus on the past, look to the future.|`|j1FCM0pqaa	first off all stop all the drama she tried to get the point across to you that shes not feeling the relationship so respect that im pretty sure u getn drunk isnt the cause off your break up shes just not that into you !!    your still very young i had my heart broken for the first time two years ago and i thought i would never get over him that id never love anyone again and our love was different all the things you think but honestly time will heal your heart i know ur thinkin no i love her this pain wont go away times not gonna heal you dont understand thats what i said but im over him now yet i still think of him from time 2 time , im in a new relationship and its better than ever its a nice feeling being with someone that loves you for you and you dont feel the need to change xxx    take a break from girls for a while enjoy being young free n single you'v got plenty of time to settle down and love will come knocking when u least suspect it go out with friends have fun dont stress so much|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Ughh and this all started because you got drunk. She sounds kinda naive, just move on.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	Sorry to hear that. If she loves you and let her mum go to hell, She has to show off that she is capacble of her own choices not her mum or ppl.|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	I know it's hard but just walk away, she has a interfering mother which is one of the hardest things to deal with in a relationship, but the sad fact is she will not pick you over her mother.  You're only 24 and i know it's a cliche but time does heal most things, and if you are pulling very good looking women i wouldn't worry, just take your time to get over her, get yourself out with friends and just enjoy yourself.  If you only get drunk now and again that fine, as long as if when you're drunk you don't hurt anyone else, if you get drunk more or less every day then i'd start to worry about that.    Good Luck|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	In my opinion this is mainly your fault, but not for the reason she gave. To me it seems as if she's looking for some reason, any reason, to get rid of you, but she's going about it in a very bad way. Your problem is that you've got so hung up on superficial appearance that you don't seem to think anything else is important.    Looks are very important, yes, but they are only one part of the total package you should be looking for.  When you put looks first, last, and only (which you seem to, since you say that the girl of your dreams is only defined by her appearance), this is what you end up with: someone who has nothing going for her but looks. Good-looking women with character aren't interested in guys who are hung up only on appearance - to them, it seems superficial, as if you regard them not as a human being but as a thing or object which only exists for your pleasure (and yes, attractive women are often turned off by this, I was when I was young and cute back in the Neolithic Era). Because of this, guys with this attitude are more likely to attract the shallow, the vain, and the self-centered. They then have this same problem over and over again, and become bitter and angry and think all women are (insert your favourite insult).    Have a bit of respect for yourself: learn to be a little pickier with respect to character and actions in the future and stop putting all your eggs in the single basket of superficial appearance. Other things are equally as important if you're going to be happy in the long run.|`|KWobnBEQaa	heyy u lost her!! get over it .. its your fault ... umm... make her jellous n that may work...
y0ZSj6ozaa	Wow, well the first thing is, you cant make yourself stop likeing somebody. But, who do you really like? You have to ask yourself that. You said his feelings are growing for you and you even like him. So I'd say go for it. It sounds like you really liked him before you told him who you liked otherwise. So why don't you decide who you want, but if you decide him, then you should go up to him and apologize and just say how you feel. And if he doesn't want to be your b/f or anything more than a friend tell him that's fine, but you don't want that to compromise your friendship. So follow your heart. And think about it you don't have to make a decision over night give it some time. But don't want til he's not around for you anymore, he might like somebody else. But maybe he was being quiet because he didn't want to feel hurt or get his hopes up if he would ask you out or something. Goodluck|`|qxgkhN8aaa	i say cool down for some time and see what could develop.    and also see clearly whether you yourself really loves him that deep,  or else look for someone else.|`|ebD1plKNaa	Your question doesn't give a time frame.  It could be that the guy needs a little time to adjust and figure out how to deal with his emotions.  And typically, guys aren't very good at that.    After a reasonable period of time (which may have already passed), you need to look at things and see if they are getting better, worse or holding steady.  You also need to be honest with the guy and let him know in a non-threatening way how he is making you feel.  See how he responds and then you should know the answer to your question.|`|FDyzj6ICaa	you can try giving something he likes eg. his favorite food, movie....|`|EONXaXYEaa	I personally think he might want to make a move but can't bring himself to do it.|`|R5geWF23aa	If you are this confused ask him how long he thinks it will take him to know if he has the same feelings you have.    Plus spend more time together that's the only way he'll have those feelings come around for you.    If he doesn't know when he'll get those feellings for you give him a time frame. Most people fall for each other in a matter of 3 months. So, subtract the time you have been dating/together whatever and give him that ultimatum and tell him you can't wait forever. Either you like me or you don't. It's that simple.     Don't let him drag on something you really aren't happy in. It's not fair to you in the least bit.|`|C0yagFFoaa	you have to make the move, he is shy, as he knows you very well, the next time you are alone, say you have to tell him something NOW!, whne he comes close just kiss him, and dont stop kisisng him, even if he trieds to pull away, go for it|`|Vy7AbWg7aa	hi he seems tryin to test u. donot think about what he think, if u love him, love him love has to be unconditional even he doesnot love u it no matter. if u have true love will understand n come to u. love is for givin n forgiving not taking.if u love him (if he want to ) let him go if he comes back he will be yours u forever.(with his regrets) if u true love him n he doesnot understand then he is not your worth.(woman is like a plant if love her n care her u will get happy flowers n grnery in your life) n one doesnot know this is not worth havin.

Then you should know the answer of this Q : Why are men so similar to dogs- do men have dogs' DNA ?|`|y5qZRyLraa	lol, no!  I think you've been watching Cat Women too often!|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	lol, girls and cats don't have similair DNA, but we are all animals.|`|49nLhin5aa	just coincidence i think
34ruM1eDaa	Find solace in the fact that you've just lost someone who din't love you..but he has lost someone who loved him so dearly. He dint deserve you and he will probably NEVER get a gf as lovely as you. So cheerup and dont fret. You've made a wise decisiion and I wish you the best (:|`|xHPBzfuSaa	you are exactly right. there is no use in crying for some stupid guy who doesn't love and treat you that way you should be. stop thinking about him it's time to move on and be happy.|`|AA11004345	You are free to brighten you life.  Good luck with your new found freedom
AA11588385	Just ignore him and smile, it makes him wonder what you are about ;)|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	he probably does like you, just immature.|`|A8ySMvOHaa	Dont take him on, the more u worry about him the more it seems hes everywhere u go so dont study it...|`|1uRUaSblaa	If  your conscience is clear, ignore his remarks.  Move on with your life.  He's not worth the time and brain power.  You can't stop him from blabberring about you but   you can choose how you want to react .|`|4iIr0ANnaa	I think he has a crush on you.  Look out.  =D
d02gJC1aaa	slap ur mum for being a slag|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Try putting an advert in the local paper for anybody who still lives there. That's probably your best chance. If you've got a full name then you could check social networking sites, genes reunited and things like that. Good luck!|`|sqmIO2u5aa	Why don't you try to ask your mother, for you to know the real name of your father.. Then, using that name, you can search him via online search. With the reliable website I suggest, http://www.web-detective.com/index1.aspx , you can acquire true and accurate details of information you desired to have in just a quick time...|`|X3RRybHWaa	try contacting via facebook or a private investigator!    good luck!|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	The best chance you will ever have of success is to contact the jerremy kyle show  Have you ever watched it in the mornings on itv 9:25  I really wish you good luck i can't imagine how it feels not to know one of your parents it must be like a very big part of you is missing  All the best  Dave (gorleston)|`|k4WWFv6gaa	It is unfortunate for you in such a circumstance. But what is the use in searching and knowing a dad who may not be a good person? Forget about that and move on. You have your life to live on and it does matter little or worthwhile to search  such a daddy.
e5FoLh2Paa	Who cares what locale you're wanting to get married in?!  That's the same gene pool we're talking about here.      What would Allah say about that?!|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I'm fairly sure Germany allows cousins to marry.  Personally I think the idea is irresponsible and wrong, at least if you intend to have children (the odds of your children having genetic defects is very high, especially if the parents themselves were the product of interbreeding). But I guess why let logic or having blind, deaf (and much worse) children stop you.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Why should u marry your cousin ,,Damm this is crazzy|`|v5jxTsLpaa	Have you called the place where you get your marriage license? They should probably know, either that or the court house. I know German's and Turks can get married but i don't know about first cousins. My mom is german and at the time was catholic and my biological father is Turkish muslim
CjPGPwNSaa	just contunue ignoring him, in a way    the best thing to do, is dont show that you are hurt by his comments, because bully's thrive on pain of others. just go about life like it never happened. also, try and just be normal to him, so like, ask a homework question to him or anything else, and eaven try talking to him like a friend. this hopefully will get him to respect and lay off you    if it comes down to having to confront him, confront him in private, because his friends, and other classmates, make him feel more powerful, and make you feel/ look week. find him when hes alone, maby when hes walking someware, and just be like ___________ we need to talk. i really dont like the way your talking about me in class, and i would really appreciate it if you stopped.     dont say any accusative sounding things to him, this will make him mad, just talk to him very normaly|`|YVEeGlFbaa	Either he has feelings for you, he is a racist *** or he is just an immature idiot. You should say exactly what I said... Next time he does something to you ask him----    what is your problem? you have issues. You need to leave me alone. You do this because you hate me or you like me? So what is it? If you hate me than you are ignorant and need to open your mind. You need to educate your brain and stop acting like an immature dumb ***. And if you like me, you sure do not know how to get a woman. You are a turn off and you act like an ***. you are a little boy and you need to act your age. And one day you should try to trip him...|`|UnE1cycJaa	he probably likes you, just be like  screw you, i know you like me mate, but i'm not interested, maybe if you weren't such an asswhole.    suck my (country) cock lol it always works for me, even if i'm a girl    or just stick your pinky nd wiggle it (it means hes got a small dick)  iif he goes how do you know, just say i got your mum to put videos in your bathroom|`|H42WbQATaa	Well, he either likes you....or hes an idiot. Either way , hes an idiot? lol    If he likes you, then that is by fay the most rediculous  way of treating the girl you like.... So just avoid that kid, slap him in class in front of everyone and make him feel like a total dumbass.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would tell the VP, he crossed the line when mentioning your country of origin, if hes said anything regarding you being a female that too should be mentioned. Harrassment is not being taken lightly, just go ask to speak to the VP or principle or counselor and tell them how it makes you feel they will help you.|`|zgDQrI2uaa	It sounds like he is entertaining his friends at your expense.  You are being harassed and bullied.  Have you ever just asked one of his posse, why he tries to trip you, makes fun of you, and throw it in that you feel he does these things because you are from another country?      Honestly, this guy is on a power trip and won't let go because he's got his friends' approval.  Once you get a group backing up the bully you have to work on the individuals of the group.  You have to basically get the individuals to stop supporting the bully.      The only way you are going to get any peace in this situation is to kick up a fuss.  If you are uncomfortable approaching the group, go to your school counselor and parents and tell them you are being harassed because of your nationality and the school administration should fall all over themselves to end the situation.  Harassment in a school because of your nationality violates your civil rights and the admin. can get into serious trouble if they let it continue.|`|AA11627844	this guy is obviously really stupid. I suggest you turn him into the principal because what hes doing is harassment and no one should have to tolerate that crap. bring like a tape recorder with u and record him and try n get witnesses the more stuff u got the better becuz if he doesn't stop you can take him to court and sue him.|`|hjxIm8RWaa	Haha, this is what young guys do when they like someone, I remember when I wanted girls to like me in the first year of high school and I would tease them, who knows why I thought that would work. Next time he does something like this say to him 'your only being a jerk to me because you have the hots for me.' If it is true, he will try to deny it and then you should take your chance to give some back to him. Why not try to kiss him or something like that, it will totally humiliate him, a pin dick joke cant go astray either....|`|yy45iAbtaa	because he likes you.when a guy picks on you he usually likes you.just say to him i know you like me so why don't you be nice to me and maybe i will like you back that will shut his mouth.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Next time he does this - stand up for yourself in front of everyone.    Tell him -   I have put up with your mean comments and rude behavior long enough.  I have done nothing to deserve this disrespect.  The only reason that you continue to treat me this way, is because I refuse to sink to your level and tell you how I feel.  I have enough class and intelligence to know that there are poeple in this world, that have to put other people down, in order to make themselves look superior.  I have had enough.  Find another person to put down in a sorrow effort to boost your own ego.      I have been recording all your insults and harrassments.  If you continue, I will give everything to the school officials and do what I have to stop you.  Just cut it out.|`|uFil7GzOaa	he likes you its soo obvious i mean come on cant you tell guys always pick on you if they like you! ignore the comments like you have been and he should eventually stop and admit to liking you, or you could just go up to him and say "you like and you know it thats why you always pick on me," and he'll probably stop then.|`|tiopdRMWaa	I was in a similar situation. Being "bullied" by this guy a while back, when I first got into high school. Though we both came from the same country, it did not stop him from teasing me about literally everything. My friends told me to ignore him, but it was so annoying.    The thing about these kinda people is that they are really just insecure about themselves, and crave public attention. Because people laugh at the jokes they crack, or the pranks they do, they like doing it, they hunger for it.    What I did was, I told the guy off. One time, it got so bad, that he was reading the contents of my diary out loud. I actually screamed at him in front of the whole class.    He promptly placed my things back in its place, apologized (though I suspect he does not mean it), and from then on, stopped bugging me, period.    Another option, if you do not wish to stand up to him personally, is to go to a person of authority, a teacher, officer in the school etc.
zYD30zyyaa	Okay...so Brad Pitt and Angelina wants to adopt me, i'm going to USA baby!  Gawd...get real! How old are you?  Okay, so that was the frist thing my guts told me to do.  If he reli flies over, u could meet up but be extra careful not to live with him just incase. In a month hopefully he'll show his true color n see if it'll work out. But don't marry him so soon...i mean u might hav made d wrong choice!|`|ocIsJXHGaa	he just wants to get out of his country, I wouldn't marry him if I were you.|`|20LnuCejaa	All answers tell you to be careful.  It is true that often a foreign suitors will do anything to come to your country and gain citizenship through marriage.  That is their only goal.  If you are intent on this person, here is what you do.  Have him apply for citizenship.  Come over to NZ and get a job.  Wait a year before you marry.    If he truly loves you he will do it.  Anything short of this will be a huge risk for you.|`|Q7Ed9UHIaa	Sorry but he sounds like he just wants a pass into New Zealand....|`|g5ShGjszaa	Hard to say, I've heard some people will marry just to go to another country.

From that point, explain to her how much you like her, the reason why you like her and what you want to happen between yourself and her.    or    2) You can write her a note that explains how much you really like her but you didn't know how to tell her because she is a shy person and that you hope that something can happen between the two of you.
AA11870175	Sounds like it would not be easy for you to just let go of him because you are attracted to him. Since he is scared of commitment he is technically not committed to you, but that means you are technically not committed to him. I hate ultimatums because they cause a mess and become basis for arguments later. Remind him that commitment goes both ways and tell him that you are considering dating other guys. This way you can move forward while still leaving the door open for him. If he's fine with that then he's really not committed and you should date other guys, you may find someone better. On the other hand he may just want to seal the deal right there because he does not want to lose you.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	it is normal for you to me questioning this, but if you really think about it what is the title boyfriend/girlfriend? I am sure anyone who knows you two knows that's what you guys are. but, if you really want him to acknowledge you as his GF then tell him that, ask him to call you that, ask him if he minds if you introduce him as your BF, its not like your asking for a marriage proposal. sneak and get his phone and program your number under girlfriend, LOL|`|TsRvFLiXaa	I don't wait for anything! sorry if this advice don't make Sense, I'm NOT reading all that!!|`|AA11289793	Yeah defiantly give him an ultimatum, because otherwise he will keep messing you about...|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	you are not in phase with that chap jst drop your feelings to someone serious.|`|xNMPvgFhaa	Don't bring it up. Act you don't care, and do look around for other guys who does not have a problem against commitment.     If he really care for you, he would do something. Afterall, we often do not appreciate what we have until its gone.    Last, being a gf and boyfriend doesn't mean you have a greater security. Anything can happend, so guard yourself.

58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	tips from a girl who knows:  1.)use plenty of lube, like a non-scented lotion. Scented lotion have oils in them that can irritate. Plain ol lotion, in case he's sensitive, you dont want to do it dry!   2.) Use one hand on his penis and the other to fondle his scrotum. Be gentle on them but not so much that it tickles. If it does tickle, you can use the other hand to rub his inner thigh or to get more lotion if you need it  3.) Move your hand in a slight twisting motion while sliding up and down. Again, be gentle!  4.)If its big enough put one hand around the base and squeeze just slightly while going up and down the top portion quickly. Use this move towards the end when he's ready to finish. You will know when he's ready because it will get harder than it has been and his toes will probably curl. Oh, and not to be funny, but do keep your face away...unless you're in to that kind of thing, then by all means! If you dont mind it, you can finish him off by sucking at the end, He'll love that! Good luck, honey! Oh, and I suggest looking up Talk Sex with Dr Sue Johansen. She's an old lady but she's a Sex therapist and she gives GREAT tips!! I know this sounds stupid but if you're nervous, you can practice with a banana or cucumber or something, just so you get the motions right.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Lubricate your hand for a much better handjob.|`|Molu004zaa	I don't know why girls bother with hand jobs - lets face it, he can give himself a much better one than you ever could. What he CAN'T give himself is a bl*wjob so, if you're comfortable, I suggest doing that instead.|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Use some lotion or lube on your hands.  Lots of gentle squeezing, rubbing, and pulling.  Start at the base of the shaft and gently twist up and let you hand rub over the head.  With your other hands play with his balls and touch all around that area.|`|67ThRN4Taa	To give a really good handjob you should first ***wait*** until you and your boyfriend have exchanged marriage vows sometime after your 18th birthday.  (Then use baby-oil).|`|2c365569f6bbbb5389778fb20f772536aa	Use Astro-Glide.  Warm it up first by putting the bottle next to your body for a while.  Start slow with up and down strokes and speed up as you go along.  Hold your hand over the end when he climaxes and rub the result over his organ.  The extra warmth at that moment feels great.|`|fiG221SEaa	haha yea i had a girlfriend of like 4 months and she never really did it right until right before we broke upp. it may be gross for you but you gotta like spit on it and start out slow and end fastt. you cant not finish either that is just like torcher

You need to take the first step by actually making contact with them.  A depressed person is exhausting and as exhausted as you are, it is as bad for those around you.  Look how you are is not how you want to be. It will improve and things will brighten up once you decide, really decide to move forward.    Your BF can't solve this problem, no one but you can.
0pdC8H9Uaa	if u "chilled" with him for one day and suddenly like him, you shouldn't. wait to see if the feeling is real, and talk to your friend. she's liked him for longer, so be fair to her. u could hang out with him without dating him.  friendship is more valuable than a boyfriend/girlfriend, and u can learn this the easy way or the hard way|`|1Kk8PuN2aa	no|`|ThXq4vjgaa	see what happens and give him time to make the move:)
H5xmpunRaa	That Cant be answered factually.   I am seventeen, but have had sex for a few years now.  My first time was pointless, and we were just a couple   of kids experimenting.

Most intercourse results in an orgasm for both participants.  As for me i personally i wouldn't entirely know but books, and friends and facts show this.  Hope i've helped.  xx|`|eca8db1f1df327afa330a170759caae2aa	Make sure your boy goes very smooth on you and he must have a lot of patience. After a few, tries, you'll start enjoying it and you may get an orgasm depending on how much foreplay both of you provide to each other. If, you want to orgasm, make sure you understand that you're seeking pleasure during love making, so stop thinking that just because you're a virgin the first experience will be painful. Of course at first it will but after a couple of soft and passionate tries you'll enjoy and I'm sure you can get an orgasm. Have fun :))|`|VJDAm29Yaa	Orgasms come when your really turned on and into the guy you're banging. You should bleed if its your first time.

So, I would say you won't have an orgasm the first time.  If you want him more than it, it may hurt a lot less.|`|rdjHHZbraa	my first time hurt a lot.  the first time you usually don't have an orgasm either.  usually the guy does because it will be more enjoyable for him then it is for you.  however, my boyfriend was a virgin and so was i, and neither of us did. they was because we didnt get into it because it hurt me so mucha dn he felt bad.  the first time won't be as enjoyable as the second.  if your boyfriend is not a virgin you most likely still wont get one but he might.|`|ZeYcSS8Naa	well it doesnt depend on if the guy is a virgin or not. It different for everybody whether it hurts or not, but it usually does. Once again everybody is different when it comes to having an orgasm or not.|`|u8mmKDiLaa	Having an orgasm is dependent upon what you do, what you like, etc...  Also having a caring partner that is willing to help you have that Orgasm.  It is not unheard of to have an orgasm your first time, a lot depends on how caring your partner is in helping you have one.  Sex doesn't automatically = orgasm, even when it is not your first time.

gYyW39wTaa	i just knew it|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	I knew I wanted to marry him because I couldn't imagine sharing my life with anyone else-I looked at him and I wanted to live with him, to have a family with him...to share in the ups and downs and in-betweens with the man I love. He was (and is) my best friend, and with him I saw a life of laughter and memories.|`|UgcPxd4maa	I know I am the only woman for him, we make each other happy in every aspect. we respect and love each other and each others decisions...and mistakes. We're perfect together.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	He made me feel so special(still does), different from anyone else I'd ever been with by far. I knew I couldn't live without him.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Very shortly after I met him. We had a lot of similar goals I thought. We certainly had the same life styles of eating healthy, liking pets and gardening. But there were also a lot of things I did not know about him, so it has not been a picnic. Raising kids was our first big trial. He was a great Dad in the beginning -- changed lots of diapers and helped put them to bed, and was patient with them. But when they hit puberty we started to disagree about a lot of things and there are still scars from this. He was liberal & I was conservative. He was OK with lots of make-up and short skirts and tight shorts, and I was not.   So get to know this guy better before U do this marriage thing. That was my mistake. The old saying "Love is blind" was never a truer saying. So be forewarned. Check out his family and friends and TALK to them and LISTEN to them. They may tell U things U don't want to hear, but better now than later.  I fell in love with my husband because he seemed like the right guy to protect me from the world and keep me safe, but those things would later come back to haunt me. Just remember that some habits that seem cute when U R dating do not stay cute after the ink is dry on the marriage certificate.|`|xQJjTuEWaa	I knew within the first week that I wanted to marry my husband and he felt the same way about me.  It just felt so right and then one day for my birthday he sang karaoke to me Bryan Adams Everything I do I do It For You and melted my heart!!  And that moment totally did it for me I was done from that point forward!!
29hcn9JRaa	Their could have been a number of reasons that he made this call, he may have just had a argument with his live in? he may have been intoxicated? or buzzed? He may actually really miss you? however the fact that he didn't call the next day or two after his words of affection, makes me question his true intentions and accountability? However you are the one who knows his character and personality, did he sound sincere? Did he strike you as really being in a clear state of mind? Also the most important thing that really makes a persons intentions merited are not so much their words, it is their actions, it is not what a person says or does, it is what they do or have done that really paint a picture of intent, had this guy packed up his bags and got on the first plane out of state to be with you, I would say that action merits true love, but to simply throw a bunch of words out their for you to hold hope on, is simply not in my book credible.|`|zdpp7cubaa	I think he was only calling because he wanted to sleep with you and use you. Don't allow him to.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think he is looking for familiar comfort...I wouldn't entertain it...|`|QIQNzE11aa	Often times men, and women, get confused. He started to romanticize you in his mind and that's never a good thing. It's great you two were able to be friends to a degree, but really, it might be time to cut ties for his own peace of mind. Even if you are the one who has to cut it for his own good.     Don't over think any of it. He had a moment and now he's probably really embarrassed. He probably doesn't know what he wants. Seems the grass always seems greener on the other side.     Feel slightly happy that he finally realizes what a great thing he lost, and then move on quickly. You don't want to take him back, he's still the same guy and you are still the same gal who weren't able to make it work the first time.     Go on with your life and make it so great that you'd never consider going backwards. Best of luck!|`|u1uECuFNaa	HE WANTS SEX....with no strings.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	don't fall for it.  he's looking to get some sex and then tell the GF what a psycho you are and how you're throwing yourself at him and trying to get him back.|`|RAGAcJV7aa	depending on how you feel about the whole thing. its your call basically. he has a girlfriend so remind him of that.  and if you do deceide to meet treat it as a friendship very slowly and see how it turns out for you both.|`|sfCnE2O4aa	He, like all men, wants sex.  That doesn't mean it couldn't turn into something else, but he does want sex.  His new GF just isn't doing it for him and obviously, no one else has either.  And as a feather in your cap, if he's anything like me, then by him reconsidering you as a potential lover, that must mean that you haven't done anything gross or sick since you two split up.  And that is unusual.  Most women jump in bed with anyone just after a break up.  Kudos to ya!|`|N4BHooTBaa	Leave it alone, its great to still be friends, but do you really want to go there and bring back all the past hurts ?|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Don't worry too much.     Sounds to me like he had an argument with his girlfriend, and he needed some ego-boosting. So naturally he called you so you could tell him what a nice guy he is. He needed to hear that you are there for him in case he needs you.|`|iTtxlvZcaa	dont entertain it|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	He probably got into an argument with his current lover and started fantasizing what life would be like with a different woman.    Just remember why he's your ex.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	well perhaps......... he may have finally realized he had it better with you than the illicit relationship hes in now... i wouldnt take him back though unless he is going to live right... you dont need to be his mama or caretaker... some men have a hard time living alone as do some women but that is not your responsibility to be his security blanket.. i wouldnt think youd want to be his sex object either... you did get divorced from him or he from you once upon a time... dont submit to sex with him if you do meet him... perhaps a meeting at a restaurant would be best so you can leave separately without surrendering yourself to him...

I think that divorce would be a positive correlation to the question about marital infidelity.  If you are supposed to be married and in your mind it is supposed to be okay to go through marital infidelity, that is a case of having your cake and eating it too.  Who says that women (or men for that matter) are supposed to accept a cheating spouse?  I know of a case that is rather unusual, and have never heard of another case like it.  A man I knew (now deceased) told me that his idea of cheating was with a cow and his wife came home unannounced one day and caught him.  She moved his bed out into the barn with the cow but never divorced him.  How does that hit you?|`|uilFJrruaa	Dependent variable with those involed
QIQNzE11aa	It all depends really. Do you two own a home together. If so, do not leave the home. Leaving it will make it harder to get half of it in the divorce. do you have children together?     Your first step is to go see an attorney without him knowing about it. Find out exactly what you need to do to get half of what you two have together. Then do exactly as the attorney states. By leaving as many suggested, you could lose everything. Not worth it in my book. I left and i lost it all, though i didn't care at the time. Just happy to get away. But, later on, i wish i had stuck it out and gotten my half back.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	If there are no kids & no property to split up, then U should split -- fast, before U get a disease.|`|tsPGVVWcaa	You need to leave NOW if you have any respect for yourself.

I understand that in your marriage vows that there is a better and a worse in there, and this is a worst case scenario if I have ever heard one.  What are you going to do; wait around until he gives you some kind of disease before he calls it quits?  I would give him an ultimatum; either way something has to shake in this situation.  In fact, he wouldn't touch me unless he took his behind to the doctor and got a clean bill of health first.  Because what do you intend to do if he gets one of these girls pregnant; accept it or not?|`|tWD175Pjaa	leave. I just left my x and I feel "free". no women should be treated like that and if he is doing this now believe me he won't stop. If you have children talk to him and as responsible adults decide what would be the best for the children like where they should live and such but if you don't have children just go and tell him to go to hell and find yourself a better man and the next time you decide to marry make it clear that you don't put up with shitt.

If a female whose two marriages are annulled due to any reason  give wrong signal specially in India . In your case  though its prime facie appears to be the fault of your spouse but  before thinking of breaking this relationship should try to adopt all measures to save your marriage. You can realise him in many ways that your this habit can spoil the life of both and you can plan (May be some sort of Drama with te help of your close friend or relative)some thing in a manner which may open his eyes and realised his mistakes .    Finally if you think that he will not mend his ways , you should also start looking for alternative person . Develop the friendship(May be with in this forum to whom you know), give time to each other, gather full information about him and if you think that he is suitable for you , may break the relationship with your spouse .  Wish you best of luck.|`|Atm9n8zGaa	You go to see a lawyer and file for divorce.|`|AA11333145	get marrage councaling|`|TiOsIfi7aa	kick his a*** and leave him, he doesn't deserve you.
0gOWh0z2aa	It's normal that your teeth may "touch" him, just don't let them scrap against it or bite down at all.  For the most part he'll just feel your lips and tongue.  Girls normally can't get more than half of a guy's penis in their mouth, so don't worry about that.  A huge portion of a guys stimulation comes from the head of his penis.|`|SdYOAb62aa	Yes, teeth hurt very badly. Practice on some fruit or something sometime. That will help with the teeth thing and the getting in deeper thing.  I, for one, like it when it is in all the way, but I wouldn't mind much if it couldn't go in very far.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	The head is the most sensitive, but going deep feels good too. With practice you can increase the depth before the gag reflex kicks in. Teeth on he head are really harsh and painful, but a light scrape elsewhere isn't too bad. This just takes practice.    Believe it or not, if you do this voluntarily and seem to like doing it, then don't worry. We aren't going to complain. There is no such thing as a bad B.J. unless you draw blood.|`|JEUD9CzUaa	on the head is what i like... its the most sensitive.  A little practice and you will be fine|`|6IbrKgfzaa	ew thats gross why dont you look it up on the internet it probably will help|`|oxmkllnWaa	it's lips, tongue, and throat on his penis for oral sex... when it reaches the back of your mouth try to relax and let more slide down... you may have to time your breathing for this.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Well that's why "deep-throating" is so like special and sought after for guys, because of course it feels better. But guys understand that most girls can't do that and they don't want you gagging yourself.... And yes wrap your lips around your teeth haha.
iiUKFLY3aa	If you like him say yes, i had a lot of boyfriends like that, well not a lot but you know what i mean.    You can learn from mistakes, you can have fun, go to movies, hanging out.  If he likes you and he is nice you really don't have much too lose.  You have to start some where right.  Good luck.   So say yes, and give the boy a chance :)|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	If you like him, go for it. But don't let a boy get too serious with you til you're at least 18. Seriously, most people do not stay together if they start earlier than that and it's not worth the heartache. Have fun and enjoy being single, until you meet the guy you can't live without. Besides, when you get older and meet guys with more maturity, responsibility and priorities you'll be amazed that you ever liked guys without those qualities.|`|R2BBjtaraa	well how old are you?  what do you mean good year?  if you like him go for it.  dont go out with him just based on his looks though.  i'd say it's fine for 12-15 year olds to have a boyfriend but probably not a serious relationship until you're at the LEAST 16. so just know if you're young that it's not like WOOHOO LAST FOREVER YOUR GONNA GET MARRIED. but if you like him then say yes!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well...define boyfriend.  If it is innocent...then I think about 12 is a good age to start "dating".  By dating I mean like, holding hands, going to the movies, etc.  A real boyfriend...I would say around 14-16 is a good age to start looking at seriously dating.|`|nJSVwAxMaa	go for it. dont be a tease.|`|KkHtAQEmaa	go out with him|`|z0VH15veaa	go out with him|`|s4TMc1vqaa	if hes nice to you...yes|`|4uDEukF9aa	im sorry but duh. if u like him say ya.|`|FbyttXsvaa	I think 13 is a good age, if youre any younger, say yes.. More than likely you wont actually do anything.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	are you slow in thinking say yes you got nothing to lose|`|uKEDfFHWaa	Honestly the best time to have a relationship is around your second yr of college. Guys are still very immature in highschool and it probably wouldn't last.|`|VPJJdYCNaa	well my 1st bf was/is at 14. so idk... if he likes you and you like him and your parents are ok with that then go for it. :)
wpLgoBOsaa	Just a tip, don't spell words wrong in the actual poem, she might think your dumb.|`|NIzZm4b3aa	Well, I would go ahead & give her a rose, but not the poem. Ask her out, then if/when things are goin good, give her the [oem & said"I wrote this b4 we were goin out" Then she doesnt feel pressured or embaressed or anything GOODLUCK!|`|XcOAvMsBaa	I think it's too cheesy. A love poem is better short and meaningful, imho.|`|rghk8yMeaa	its a little cheesy and your ryme scheme is off so it sounds a little r-tarded. but kudos on trying :)
6rWZgS0raa	i would ditch your boyfriend, you never see him so whats the difference?
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	was the last compliment to you something like"you know i saw a breed of dog that looks just like you on the internet" or close to that;  that should give you some ideas|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Lol, he's a dick. If you're not together then forget about him|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Sounds as though he is insecure and borderline abusive.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	nothing in compliment on|`|UspK4SQBaa	People tend to ease up on the compliments once they've been in a relationship awhile.  Do you compliment him?  If you start it, he may get back in the habit.  He knows you know how he feels about you, so he probably doesn't feel the need to tell you all the time.  That said, he sounds very insecure, so I'd be wary.|`|dd07d44218c6f0cb9b4e55aae3015401aa	he's maybe scared that your going to leave him and he's getting more insecure, now that your relationship has gotten to the next level and is a lot more serious he's scared of losing you because he knows your everything to him, so without you he's nothing. i'm just looking at things from his point of view, so that's probably how he sees things. i think you should talk it out with him because maybe he's just getting insecure and thinks that it's too good to be true that your his forever.|`|XcOAvMsBaa	He's like that 'cause he's a loser.|`|AOlWXT4aaa	Try talking to him....|`|0fFaXhIIaa	Because he's a man. You need to talk to him today. Your not a piece of meat and you deserve to be treated like a princess! Make him treat you like the woman you are or leave his butt!|`|aIHSmRYwaa	you psycho|`|pLGMqqBFaa	maybe he just got to used to complimenting you and decided to stop and maybe he is really worried about losing you but doesnt know what to do|`|Gz26NPJyaa	hes a dick hes a loser and completely unsure of himself|`|sZePlWTQaa	As time goes on in a relationship the less compliments you will get..lol. I know sucks!! I want them too from my fiance! When he DOES compliment me I let him know how good it feels to hear so that hopefully he'll do it more. Try that!|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	Because he is jealous plus he doesn't play a role anymore - now he is who he is and he doesn't make more efforts to make you feel like you're the most beautiful woman on earth because he already conquered you.
WSlxwSlFaa	'man thing'    WHATS HE TAKIN BOUT?|`|1vZ1n0agaa	it's circumcision and some girls like it and some girls dont, i don't|`|aZxThVoYaa	Dude it will hurt for 2 weeks.|`|h1eBWehMaa	your to old to get that done, it will screw you up.|`|vOTcVMsdaa	I've never met a girl who liked it uncircumsized. It's gross.    So go ahead. Too bad your parents didn't do it when you were born.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	If you are doing it because you think girls will like you better, then don't do it. If you are doing it for personal or religious reasons then go for it.  But please don't mutilate your body for the sake of a girl.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	do it|`|jQpZnzQ1aa	get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... without it, its gross sorry. some girls either DONT like it or dont mind.|`|KBd3ek8Qaa	Girls don't give a sh1t creep.|`|UVW4yZsDaa	yourll *** more. having to use a condom, or having pikey babies running round.    & yourll be in a lot of pain.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	First of all that is a very painful procedure to under go especially once you are older. And you should not be doing it for aesthetic purposes. However studies show that it is much better medically speaking. Do some research. Most mature woman do not care as long as values, morals, and personal hygiene are in tact Good luck.|`|A8vsbah7aa	Its your body. What do you want.    I've never seen it...the result of it i mean...so i would'nt know any different.     And i hear you can lose sensation in it....so, think carefully.    My advice...don't do it. =)|`|FoH5cY0Raa	DO IT! It is cleaner, healthier and liked more by most...prob. all women.|`|UqRMjvFGaa	do it with out it it is gross.

t9cakxtfaa	a boy doesn't need something from the girl except love and love
5kjYFb9Taa	relationships are great as long as the both of you are happy. You do things for her, and she should do things for you. Always keep it interesting, Go places, do things, go out to dinner. etc.  Just go with the flow is the best advice I can give you.|`|fl3L2tUcaa	being in a relationship with a girl is definitely a healthy thing to have, while in your first relationship you are going to learn thing about people in general you never thought of before, chances are this is going to end in a bit of heart break, however it may not and i wish the bets for you    if you do become heart broken i segjest you just dont think about it to but remember, you are not worthles lowely or a peice of scum just because some girl brok your heart    have fun with it and learn from it if you can  best of wishes   -Johnney Rockett
Nqda6ulSaa	well i dont think you are really addicted to sex unless you actually have sex all the time than you are addicted..but you think you are addicted|`|U1WUNCwLaa	no, you just need a hobby|`|Tyj0gtqZaa	That's sick and gross!|`|f1fgR7VZaa	I was the same way in my 20's, its normal. you just need to work on your game a lil bit.   A sex addict is some one who's needs to get it like a bad crack habit. You'd be trying to get it from anyone, any age, any way possible, which usually leads to trouble.
1Qg9Izteaa	Take life as it comes. Expect the unexpected. You never know what will happen until it actually happens. Don't be afraid to try something cause it may work out in the end. You got to live your life the way you want it ...If you're always looking into your past you will never get a chance to look at the present...So do what you want, love who you want...and somehow things will always work out in the end if you work at.|`|A8vsbah7aa	Take every day as it comes. Rather than planning for the future right away. I know how it feels to be in your position. There is such thing as 'forever'. Stop putting a barrier up. Let people in. Everyone gets hurt. I know it's not nice, but grow stronger from it.     I hope i've helped =)
nvWvOyl6aa	you can ask him nicely to shave his facial hair off, u know, just tell him that you dont like it. and about your parents meeting him, well, i dont know how your parents are, if they are strict or if they care about looks. well, one thing they shouldn't do is to judge by look or race. but you should let your parents see him, if they dont like him, they should have a good reason to convince you that he is not good, plus if they say no, they are saying it for your own good. trust me, i know it is hard, but you should get him to meet your parents.    hope this helped
eO4y3m1maa	Technically relationships like that don't need any respect...thats what they are there for..you there when needed thats it...your NOT a friend NOT a girlfriend, your just someone he calls when he wants some 'loving' whether physically, emotionally or both....    You want someone to respect you, you shouldnt tolerate disrespect from the get go..ONCE the guy messes up make him apologize and beg you to come back....forgive him if you choose..SECOND drop him. Otherwise they will keep doing it because they know all they have to do is apologize to get you to come back to bed.|`|giCUEYsJaa	RESPECT YOURSELF GIRL!    DROP THIS LOSER!    There are better guys out there!  But as long as you keep hanging on to this loser, you won't have the chance to find out!    TAKE A GOOD LOOK IN THE MIRROR!    Now go out and find someone who will respect and love you for who you are!
dalNxu8zaa	i think u should try and ask her out on another date and if she says no then there is ur answer|`|WmM3XeLPaa	This girl seems very confusing.    She's acting as if almost it's a joke, but not.  Her mixed emotions are confusing me.  If you have a feeling she is joking around with you and messing with your head, then move on. But if you really want to get to know her, then go ahead, ask her for another one. Just walk up to her or send her a message or call her, ask her if she would like to go out to dinner somewhere and talk, and maybe see a movie before or something.     Face-to-Face conversations are usually the better solution. She probably thinks she said too much, or you didn't talk enough. Start talking more openly to her. Really act like you care.     That's basically all I have. Be yourself and...    GOOD LUCK!    |`|mpB2agPBaa	Wow... that was a REALLY long story, no, you should just ask her out again... even if she says no, then you just have to move on anyways...|`|adc2f928ad5c1e7ed865593e8e9aa8f1aa	From what you have said, I do not see what you did wrong. However, she may have just decided you are not the right guy for her. Sometimes people know they are not with the right one after one date.    I would send her an email (so she can reply on her own time and think about it), and tell her you feel bad you missed dinner and would like to make it up to her by taking her to dinner. Then ask her if there is a night that would work for her.    Good Luck|`|pLGMqqBFaa	ask her what her freaking problem is and then ask for a second date and let her know she can trust you   but dont make it one with an hour long drive  just make it a short one and barely make it longer bit by bit you definatly took it to far the first time.|`|AUB37xlyaa	Wow. Well my guess is that she was just tired. That happens to me all the time! I just stop talking!     Ok should you ask her out again?    Yes!  If you had fun...go for it!  Chances are she did too.  She is probably waiting for you to make the next move.   So make that move!  And if she doesn't want to...move on!|`|hEcKmleVaa	Try again.  Not all first dates are smooth.  I don't think you've done anything wrong here.  Be confident and try again.  If the second date falls flat, you have your answer.  But please try again.|`|uOGHOAWiaa	Ask her out again, and make it an amazing date. But be sure to ask her through a phone call, or in person so u know if shes REALLY not interested or not. if she says yes, try and make it a really nice, really fun date. Like either a nice restaurant, or like a fair or ice skating or something fun, so that she forgets last time, has a ball, and wants more!|`|AA10680754	move on my friend, maybe you should have threw in some moves after the show, or during;)  shes not interested anymore, otherwise she would have jumped on that second date.  its a mans mission in life: find new females    so make your animal relatives proud!|`|sZePlWTQaa	Ask her out again! What do you have to lose! I know when I am hungry (since you didn't eat) or when it gets late I get sleepy. Maybe she felt that way. You did do a lot of talking already too...sometimes there just isn't a millions thinsg to talk about.    Ask her out again tho! Tell her you owe her dinner since you didn't go last time.    Good Luck!|`|HPETZ7BLaa	i think you should ask her out again|`|CLvUYnRRaa	Have small talk when you see her and just move on. Don't never waste so much time in a person who given fix feelings. If she want you let her come out and say it|`|VJPVHH6uaa	sound to me she playing games just move on life to short for kids games
QkmoNX2Qaa	Yeah thats fine!!  As long as u don't do it too often, and also make sure she doesn't get caught.. Coz that will just embarrass her and u.    She'll think it's sweet. And that u honestly do care about her. And know that u were thinking about her and that u were on ur mind.  Just go for it.  She won't find it that annoying coz she's ur gf and obviously likes u 2!    I suggest not doing it while   1) Heavy note taking  2) She's in a convo with someone else or her friends.  It's something to look forward to.   Especially if u slipped it in her bag or something so when she found it it'd be a nice suprise to have.  It's also pretty romantic and shows how much u care about her!    Goodluck!!  xx|`|AA12221397	Uhhh.. i would call you a Dork. Lol but in a nice way. Say something more if your going to give her a note. Like Have a greaat day, I call you at so and so. I don't know I guess that goes with your Name. Lol Sappy.... Sorry that is so cute|`|A8vsbah7aa	Of course it's ok to do that =)     I love it when i find a surprise note in my coat pocket from my partner.     Not annoying at all. Shows how much you care.|`|XromiSSCaa	of course! I love it when my bf dose that|`|oTV3Bro5aa	Yes. I use to love when me and my bf were in high school and he use to write me notes in class. It shows that you are thinking about her and just want to say hey. I think that your gf is a lucky girl. A lot of guys wouldn't write notes to their gf's.|`|aOUwvVxeaa	of course ! Most girls love that !  that's wicked sweet & cute !  :)
Xprsabo9aa	I think you should  start talking to her more (:      And sooner or later ask for her number just don't be to shy or confident     And be your self 100%    :) good luck|`|n51t5pXeaa	I don't know, I usually don't have the balls to ask girls out but it seems like you have an extra pair...... If you think she likes you go ahead but if it doesn't look like to likes you a lot then maybe just hang out with her more.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	just talk to her and overtime you two will build a friendship.     dont rush into anything or ask her out its waay to soon.|`|AA10771653	text her.  be her friend first just don't rush into things :)|`|Ccf2bLutaa	compliment her, and try not to have such a big ego when ur talking to her lol.|`|9QUCw9Jnaa	go 4 it.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Just talk with her in your classes and invite her to hang out with your friends at lunch or just to go out with a group. Take things slow and see if something builds from there.|`|mvaPdekPaa	wow tht sounds like something tht just happened to me. just meet up with her b/t classes and stuff and once yall start talking ask for her number and c where things lead to from there... but if yall do go out then it would be good for yall to hang out on the wknds and all bc yall dont really c eachother in skl. good luk!|`|Nqda6ulSaa	just be your outgoing self and just talk to her invite her to lunch on a sat or somthing
ns9R0DWraa	bend over in front of him  or   make sure he knows ur flexible (guys go crazy over that)  yah lick an ice cream or a loli pop  lick ur lips or laugh wit ur tongue out|`|TMi1GhSHaa	ok dont do the licking strawberries of an icecream thing.. try getting to know him better and being all touchy flirty, that usually works.|`|uRcx9llkaa	say that u are a really good massager. alot of guys get turned on from this.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You could write him an erotic poem.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Idk what you can do.|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I would say to get to know him and be flirty. You can wear nice clothes that are kind of tight but no slutty. Walk by alot to show him what you have. That would get my attention.|`|Ccf2bLutaa	u have a huge ego, which guys don't always like, but that's besides the point lol. licking a lollypop does wonders, like licking it sexily. don't dress like a slut, but wear things that show off ur best features, like if u have nice legs wear skirts, they don't have to be hoe skirts, but like regular skirts.
zX01mIZnaa	if he smiles a lot :)|`|VUfT35UQaa	Be confident, and dont' act like a $l^t|`|ZbmBVpw9aa	Ask her about her and make her feel good! Make sure you have a good bod. be a little touchy with her!    ~good Luck~|`|S73k6sTAaa	by stopping asking stupid questions.|`|IKCLXVYQaa	working out, haircut|`|zdlS3fgDaa	When you touch a girl don't like rape her. Do things like touching her face, put your arm around her waist, give her hugs. Cute things. That's always sexier for me than, say, putting your hand down her pants
5FVyVS9vaa	Just look at him and then smile, look away and then look again and smile again. He will get the message.|`|CsAUb7vMaa	Write him a letter on your spare time. Send him a e-mail if you know it. Get his phone number and talk to him.|`|AA10208895	When you pass him in the hallway,   grab him, and throw some tongue   down his throat, that should work.|`|wB2xkkZwaa	Why not try flashing some body parts, or seductively eating a banana in front of him?|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Use your tongue ;)
Molu004zaa	Stop whoring yourself out at 14 then :/ You're just a KID! No wonder you're getting a bad reputation.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	you need to stop sleeping around ....  your literally never going to live it down if you dont stop NOW..  a few of my friends did the same thing in grade 9, we're in grade 11 now, they may not do it as much, but theyre considered big whore's still. by everyone. you'll never get a real relationship if you want one ..... slow down. you have your whole life ahead of you to have sex.|`|ACVKajUIaa	coz u r, get over it!!  haha fat|`|imgKqm9Laa	Just focus on your studies... in 10 years you won't remember anything about highschool!|`|6c5bcf7e051cb85d0792bb2edfdb04b2aa	Don't listen to any of the others in this thread.    In school, people pick on others that really don't do anything wrong. It's because they are treated like crap at home and they need to vent on an innocent schoolmate.    It's the animal kingdom until you get out of high school. People aren't really like that when they grow up.    You should not care what others think, and NO it is not the whole school that thinks you are a whore. It's only you who thinks the whole school thinks you are a whore.    There are things other people need to think about rather than that crap. Let it slide, the world is not out to get you.|`|Cxqz6LxUaa	Man, this sounds like something I have been going through as well .   Everyone at my school thinks Im a whore too . I am a very attractive girl, and lots of guys are like all over me. and yes I have done a lot of things that people my age haven't done. Im 15 by the way. Those girls are just jealous of people like us. Move on, enjoy life, and if you just want to hang out with the guys, do it . Because thats what I do . I am friends with mostly all guys , and that is not a bad thing.
6PNuFgTJaa	I started a little older than that. Its probably weird to some but for some girls they start young and others take longer.
0Q9FiDYqaa	She could be telling the truth since a few relationships are far distances, but she could be lieing also, go check out her myspace lol|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Well, either way, whether she has a boyfriend or not...she doesn't want to date you, sorry.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Either way she's not interested.
EfI4ET2oaa	Honey,   You said "He would never do anything to hurt me, but what he doesn't know is that he's hurting me everyday". They are contrast. You know he's hurting you (even though he didn't do it intentionally) and you're defending for him because you love him.      Since you were together, there have been 2 girls getting into your relationship. Even if you forgive him because of his "stupid smile and sweet talk", who can say for sure that he will not get attracted to any other girl later on?     One more thing, he said you're the only girl he ever like, but don't you see he is not consistent to what he said?  (he's too closed to Michelle, he has got attracted to 2 other girls when he's with you, he ignored when you wanted to talk seriously, etc).      You said "He was most possible the sweetest guy I had ever met.". That's right, because you've not known any other guy than him. It does not mean that he is the only sweet guy, the point is you have not met and known about other guys yet.     And the most important thing is you know this is not gonna work. So why are you frustrated? I'm sure when you get over it, you will find tons of great guys out there.  Get brave and move on.
4drQ38qZaa	Good. You don't really want a girl hurting themselves around your body.|`|j1fUNvmFaa	Wow, someone is conceded|`|zdlS3fgDaa	Very nice but don't try to get more muscular. it's just borderline on too much.|`|ozNXnNQIaa	A bit too much. But, the face is really handsome.|`|GQdxDkA9aa	that's perfect ur hot any more and it would be disgusting|`|TxgdMUvLaa	I think that's perfect. You don't wanna scare her away. But that's sexy. I say perfect|`|AA11425983	good enough...but leaning more towards too much.|`|dFQ5Xbj2aa	ehh.......i would have to say between good enough and too much but its more toward good enough.
pfm0wcEIaa	I've known guys who are really into that.  Everyone's got their thing.  But I could see why someone would find it exciting.  Personally, I just get too distracted and can't enjoy myself....PLUS I have this "no trips to the hospital and no arrests" rule when it comes to sex....I don't know why...|`|fj78wRV5aa	No, I haven't, but I can see how one might find that exciting.|`|ihfsrPlkaa	no, i like my privacy.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	Nope i've never done that and i don't plan on it. i'd rather have sex in public than masturbate in public|`|8cLLhDrfaa	ewwww.|`|JDQP0Phraa	I think that would be gross, but like you'd be unable to look away. Be careful if you're thinking about it, b/c that's a crime is someone complains or if a child sees you.|`|Pswqhimoaa	Uh.  no.  Seeing people self-please themselves is not a turn on.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	Kinda creepy..     but some people find the thought of possibly getting caught a sexy and sexual thing|`|4JqwBJTSaa	No I havent , But I have always wanted too!

Although you could get into a lot of trouble exposing yourself like this and end up on the sex offenders register or something which could ruin your life and career, so dont do it...maybe stand at the back of your room with the curtains open and do it, where nobody could see you unless they're looking in with binoculars, and pretend to yourself in your head that someone is.|`|MBqoeaEJaa	gee let me think!!!!....NO!!|`|ZcuMp7CXaa	That's not serious.

I guess it's perfectly normal to be turned on by the thought of someone watching...just don't do it someplace really public because there are children.    *edit   Isn't it funny how mixed people's opinions are on masturbation even though everyone has done it. Not in public neccesarily but still... everyone.|`|tSYB11xdaa	umm, to me i would honestly say that it is not a turn on.

QEqGukjZaa	two sides to this..not good at all.    not getting mad or jealous just eats you alive    but getting mad or jealous just makes it worse..    trust is very key, but she cant learn to just settle down, than you cant fix it.    dont you wish a woman can just stay loyal..
54P0TxR5aa	It's not literallly but your stomach or your gut feels really light and you get really nervous..That's what happens to me. I can't hold a good convo with him or start one, and I kinda look away :x|`|85tAhnM9aa	It's like going down a high roller coaster. There is an emptiness in your stomach, it feels like butterflies flying around tickling your inside. Usually means that you are nervous or scared.|`|gUtZszdjaa	pee pee in yo panties :]|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	Butterflies in your stomach just means that there's something inside you that is battering from the inside that restrains you from remaining calm and outgoing in front of him. In other words, there really isn't butterflies in your stomach, but it's really the feeling that you want to avoid him just to feel better because you don't want to look like a fool around him.    So ya you do have "butterflies in your stomach" if you felt restrained to approach him. Happens to me all the time, I always just look away to get the butterflies away.    ADDED:    Wow seriously answerers? You don't get indigestion in your stomach just from crushing on someone, but I do feel a sort of sickness whenever I catch my ex staring at me. Not that I hate her, but it's actually because I like her. I guess it's from the fact that I know that I will never get her back and that I just want to find a way out ASAP before she catches me staring at her again.     It's really hard to describe this feeling but I wouldn't say I felt indigestion, more like in my chest. I guess my heart was beating faster, got more adrenaline? I don't really know, maybe it was all in my head and it's playing tricks on me.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	the hormone dopamine is released|`|GBr9YngTaa	Getting butterflies in your stomach means that you're nervous. It depends on the type of person to whether or not you get nervous.     It's really just an expression. For some it could be this empty feeling in their stomach. Like when you're about to perform, or say a speech in front of a large group of people.|`|GeWGemUlaa	Getting butterflies in your stomach means that you're nervous.  It's like going down a high roller coaster. There is an emptiness in your stomach, it feels like butterflies flying around tickling your inside.|`|5vYlIDRoaa	You've never been nervous or scared before? It's pretty much the same feeling.    Maybe you don't get it because you're a very confident and outgoing young woman.|`|8htIwW9Haa	I get that too when I am around this girl that i like (im a guy). We don't really talk but i still really like her. I get nervous and for some reasons i try to walk away and try not to be noticed. If you aren't getting butterflies it means ur not nervous to talk to him and should start talking to him.|`|dvX11ttNaa	Your either nervous, or excited to be talking to him.|`|4M2QTN8faa	ha   i get those all the time with my crush  its liek a really nervous feeling in your stomach  iluv it everytime i get them and i get them ALL the time|`|DsIbGLYUaa	its just an expression, when i really liked this guy and he liked me back i felt something different then for other guys i liked, i felt light headed and  it was hard to balence myself at times and i felt like i was going throw up when i thought about him (not literally but my stomach felt mega weird though)|`|jfwmelYgaa	Have some shots of whiskey. that kills butterflies quick.
bD4mltz9aa	Awee that is cute :)  I had the EXACT same problem when I was 13-14 =/ But then when I came back from the school holidays, all the guys grew like 23986734986798346 meters tall haha. They hit like, 180-190cm, and I was still 169cm =[ When like, a few weeks before, they were only 160ish >=O    You didn't mention your age, so I can't say "They will have a growth spurt" but, guys will keep growing and have massive growth spurts til they are like.. 17+    If, this is not your case, and you're 20+  I'd say you should "bend" slightly when you try to hug, like, lean forward OR hug when you're sitting down? Or like, when you walk up to them, and they are sitting down, try to hug him before he stands up? If that makes much sense?    Don't be tensy girl! What's wrong with a friendly hug :} What is there to be uncomfortable about? Is it a "touch" issue you have? Or a self-conscious thing about your body? I'm sorry, but you didn't give much information about yourself for me to know how to help solve your hugging problem. It could just be like that because of that hug that failed? Maybe you're afraid it'll happen again? And you're unsure about it?    Some of the shorter guys of my age (I'm 16) I still hug, and they sort of realize I'm alot taller than them, and make sure their faces don't hit my chest =P they make it quick and snappy haha  Just don't worry when you're about to hug someone, just go straight for it. If you like, try hugging (practice) on a friend of yours that is shorter than you, so you can work out how you'll need to position yourself =P    Good luck btw
uFJXz1x3aa	webcam?? ;]|`|SnpP6dGFaa	It depends on your guy.  And when's the next time you are going to see each other.  If valentines day is a bigger deal for you guys than others, it depends.  If you are going to see each other soonish I'd suggest maybe a sweet little coupon book, especially if it's not a huge deal for you.  Also, some guys do like to get flowers believe it or not.  Maybe have him sent a single rose with a card.  Online sites....like www.flowers.com.    Or maybe if you like it really casual you can send him an Ecard from hallmark.com.  They're cute, cheap, and simple way to show you care.|`|G85fgFDLaa	stay at your place and cook him a special dinner. Listen to some mood music and dance a bit. Hopefully, the night will go well (if you know what I mean!)    Roo.|`|rLvcVrMzaa	send him Knicks tickets|`|1W4e8JBIaa	you should hang out with him and fly to visit him for a little spend time.

Just an idea :P.     Sorry, that wasn't a serious answer. What if you made a road trip to surprise him for Valentines day, i bet he'd love that.

He is being deadly serious and straight to the point.     Good Luck
lQGDV7MEaa	This might be a simple placebo effect. You think that because you had sex, you're pregnant, much in the same way how a person feels better by taking a sugar pill.  if four tests and planned parenthood person told you you're not pregnant, there's a great possibility you're not pregnant.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	go see a doctor and get an exam  you can be faux pregnant   you can actually make yourself seem pregnant with all symptoms|`|fBdtvrWdaa	You might be having symptoms of pregnancy because you are so paranoid about it. Happens all the time; you become convinced that you display certain symptoms and then you actually start to show them. It could just be your mind tricking you. I read about some woman who didn't want to go to jail, so she told them she was pregnant. And the woman actually grew a big stomach and had all the signs but when they did an ultrasound, nothing was in there. Her mind tricked her because she wanted it so bad. If you took all those tests, had a period, AND went to a doctor, chill out. You are fine :)|`|IK5PoN4Laa	If you had sex on the 8th and had your period on the 20th, I really doubt that you are pregnant.  You can miss your period because of stress too, so if you miss this month's it could be the fact that you are stressed to the max worried you are pregnant.|`|5LT6LRUZaa	you say you went to planned parenthood...so all they did was a pee test huh?  they must not have done a physical exam...if you went there with these symptoms and the urine test didn't confirm pregnancy they should have given you a physical exam...you could be pregnant...or...you could have an STD!    You are also working yourself up...you did the right thing by going to PP but you have to insist they give you a physical as well!|`|EjID9iWyaa	If Planned Parenthood said your not pregnant your not pregnant.  But your so stressed that your messing your body up.  Go take a warm bath, stay in a long time and go to bed while still warm.  Warm baths bring on periods so just relax, your not pregnant just a nervous wreck.|`|UHw7Vc3Faa	Try going to a doctor.

QlBLZ4tVaa	I just be myself. My friends accept me for who and what I am. I refuse to change my personality in order to please other people, because then I would be a fake.|`|DOoHDBTiaa	i look away. or look down. or else i blush|`|orz5dUJaaa	talk funny. my tongue gets twisted but clear enuf to understand|`|HRXTcAxQaa	i'm shy so i hide|`|3sByd1iIaa	I get kinda shy. If i know them pretty well ill talk to them and laugh at wat they do. If i don't know them that well tho i get too shy to talk to them unless they ask me a question|`|fVSyy8rOaa	I find myself more attentive to them than usual.Making more of an effort to keep eye contact,smile,laugh,say something to keep the conversation going.I still feel I flounder though,if I really like the guy I find that I'm tounge-tied and laugh at his jokes even if I don't find them that funny,just to be nice.I guess for me,when I really like a guy,I go out of my way to be nice to him and less appearing 'hostile'.I find that I don't want to huert his feelings by being too direct or honest,I find that I want to be more supportive and understanding.More inclined to listen to him.I'm more of the type that prefers the guy I want to approach me rather than me chase him.Mabe that's old fashioned,but I'm just not comfortable being aggressive and asking the man out.At least not initially,once I'm dating the guy things change,but untill then I'm still rather shy about going after the guy.
kOo9KgZ5aa	if she wanted me to, sure, and I'm certain she would like it|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Yes.  Don't know - I'm not prophetic.|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Yes I defiantly would. I'd hope she would I'm not in bad shape. I think it's horrible when larger people do it.     It's like sharing whose days it is to do the cooking. "I'll do it today if you do it tomorrow!"    Hope this helps!|`|L2RqeYedaa	Well, this question made my day. That's what comes from an ironic sense of humor.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"NOPE.  I'd just dance naked in front of her."    "Step back when she gets the urge to reach   for my Legs, or for my waist, and keep up    my dancing routine."    "The whole idea, is she stays fully dressed."    "I'd do that while she's watching her most   favorite television show, or typing away on   her computer, Like she's too busy for me."    "Something I'd NEVER DO while she's talking   to somebody on the phone.  Too disrespectful."
7e96535a87be5e466413f7c6ab0e8a7baa	Go for it girl! You are NEVER gonna get anywhere if you don't take a chance once in a while. All you've got to do is say "Hey, you know what? I really like you. More than a friend, you're awesome and I like so much about you" in a serious, confident tone.    Be straight forward about it!   CONFIDENCE. RISK. REWARD. :)|`|KWZdVwQ5aa	Just tell him!    Or you can try to let him know that you want to be more than friends. Right now he probably just thinks of you as a friend, maybe dress a little cuter, smile a little more and try flirting. Once he realizes that you are into him, and if he likes you back, he'll make a move.     Good Luck Girl!!!|`|BPpCQ6traa	Popularity? In a few years none of that will matter. Either he likes you for you regaurdless or he doesnt and if he cant date you because you're not popular then bumb him. You'll find better.|`|h8WC1zDGaa	Well, this is a little tough.  I would suggest really, really talking to him alot.  And flirting more and then FINALLY tell him you like him.  Maybe ask your friend to ask him if he likes you.  If he asks why, just have her say she might be interested.  I wouldnt totally go up to a guy and say "I like you"  Guys can't really handle that.  Good luck!|`|o3ECMDqXaa	You should get him in your arms b4 this sonya  girl can!|`|QrUWtvH8aa	he won't know you're interested if yo don't tell him.|`|H7XOsgRCaa	just get over yourself and tell him you like him     and if he likes you back it wont matter if your a nerd or not     and for the popular girl that flirts with him,...if you all end up going out then you just need to tell her to shove it and keep off cause hes yours!|`|spkpQ2C2aa	slow down he is popular and your not number one problem if anything if you feel like that about yourself you will probaly end of doing something on the side with only you and him knowing so watch yourself, if you really like him like that just tell him alone that way your feelings can be hurt and you will get over it|`|tLNb8L8Vaa	i think you should say i know we are just friends but maybe we can be more. dont be scared to ask if he's your friend he wont be mean about it. and if you do ask dont ask when all of his popular friends are around. and dont be negative calling urself a loser nobody nerd.|`|BZAYjbmjaa	Well one thing ignore Sonya she means nothing and since your mom's know each other perfect bf gf zone to be in.

Before you get a boyfriend you need to sort things out. Why do you care so much about popularity? Straighten out your view. You hate this girl but do you even know her?   I agree, how DARE she be popular and show interest in a guy!   Noo   I am not a popular person. No I would not consider myself a nerd/freak/nobody. I am NORMAL!  We are all people!  If this guy is as caught up in popularity as you are then he is not worth it.   You could be a great person if you just looked at the big picture. Be happy with what you have.  Sonya probably does not think about him as much as you do  (Go for it haha)|`|KJCwUW6Laa	that sounds just like my problem except the popular girl is also my best friend!!!!! just keep hanging out and keep him laughing find out if he likes girly girls or tom boys. be your self but maybe a little differnt around him.|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	don't let nerves get to you just take a risk. invite or ask your mom to invite him and his mom to your house and while your mom is talking to his mom take him aside and talk to him alone or talk to him alone at school. im sure you will do great and hey you are not a nobody i bet you are a somebody but you just don't look at yourself that way but im sure everyone around you sees it and that other popular girl sees it to thats way she hates you. she sees that you have certain things about you that she does't have. maybe its your clothes or personality.

But i really wanted us to be more then mates so i started talking to him through text cause my nerves kept gettin the better of me wenever i thought of telling him. And i started talking to him about how good our friendship was and he started talking back about how he wouldnt mind it being more with that in mind i went to him face to face took him aside and just told him how it was that i liked him and had strong feelings for him.  you have nothing to lose and you just need to try and put up the courage to tell him how u feel pull him aside or tell him at lunch or while your walking some where x x|`|N53oHiwNaa	well if you say as your as low on the pecking order as you are....go for it you have nothing to loose and alot to gain if things go well :) good luck ;)|`|usXTpoSwaa	kill sonya|`|NwpGhT31aa	Haha.

It may be hard, but it is what u gotta do|`|FljIic6Iaa	Is there any chance you already hang out? if not try and meet up with him sometime and just talk, you'll probably have a rough idea after that whether you should mention anything or not, good luck!|`|3f4jZwLlaa	im not the best one to say how to tell him (cause i have had the same situation and couldn't handle it) but when ever sonya starts flirting with him just kinda interrupt them and talk to him about like an inside joke that sonya doesn't know that way she feels isolated.|`|l344RtC8aa	well since he's your friend you shouldn't get nervous! just think to your self if you really like ihm then its worth it and if he's your real friend he'll listen to what you have to say. you have so many ways you can tell him. either come right out and say "i think i like you more than a friend" or maybe kiss him, even if its on the cheek and when he looks at you smile and hug him.. do somthing ot let him knwo you like him just make sure its not too much that he'll be overwhelmed. i think you should just go for it girl!|`|gew4KVFfaa	all u gotta do is just go for it! dont even think about it to much or else u'll sike urself out. just go up to him and tell him straight up how u feel about him. trust me... he will admire u for it and think u have alot of confidence and guys LOVE CONFIDENT girls... and who knows... maybe u'll get the anwser u were looking for, but u'll never know until u tell him;)  good luck and hope it all works out for u! =)|`|3ijLQe5laa	hold out, let the guy approach you!|`|xQGkWlSKaa	If you are such good friends with the guy, have him over to your house or go somewhere to hang out sometime. Flirt with him all night and see how he reacts. If it goes well, tell him how you feel, but make sure you two aren't with a big group of people so that you can both act like yourselves.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Are you really good friends with him..are you sure? Because it's always best to be his really good friend first, you need to build your relationship with him on a friendship level first off, because those relationships that start out on friendship first, last longer. Once you're his really good friend, then you can tell him how you're feeling about him, because then hopefully you'll be able to tell him anything. Also, if you're feeling really nervous around him, you should wait until you're feeling a little more comfortable around him. Go out and have fun with him, maybe with other friends, or just alone, maybe go to the beach, the movies (don't make it seem like a date-date) but just try to laugh with him, have a good time. If he's a good guy he wont care if you aren't "popular", most guys don't really like popular girls because some are just really shallow, I'm sure you've noticed those kinds of girls. So he could like you too, just because you are shy or however you label yourself. Also, forget about this other girl whos always flirting with her, don't get upset or jealous, she doesn't even deserve your passion for hating her.|`|VsXWA8CCaa	just tell him when you2 r alone.    and this sonya girl sounds like a *****.|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	dont let the fact of being a nerd or a freak stop you from stepping up the game. i am a nerd/geek too.but i still have friends who are somewhat poular. and you should tell him. if he says your pretty he has SOME feelings for you. so he will probobly gain more when you confess to him    Good luck!   :)|`|Q53LzFCpaa	get some bad thing on the other girl tell him causally and then start doing ur Hair nice if u have glasses stop wearing them inless you cant see without them then idk keep em on. try to migrate to the popular crowd me a dumb and funny around the popular girl they'll say shes funny lets hang with her. well good luck|`|SlOU6v3Zaa	popularity is the biggest load of crap ever. youll figure that out when you get out of high school. but just talk to him. guys arent gonna put someones social status before the respect they have for someone.. atleast i wont i would say who cares if at school you dont know as many people. you know him everyone else shouldnt matter ask him to hang out then just keep hanging out... thats called dating.. i say dont worry about her. and dont be soo scared the social structure is not what you think it is|`|m7eT8f58aa	Tell him:  We should go out.|`|2MTStFdbaa	If sonya can flirt, so can you!! =D|`|wwWUIvopaa	I think the best thing is to tell him you like him asap  screw popularity  and slap sonya :)|`|JHV3dOOiaa	just go to this website...|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	you need to just be honest with him. tell him that since you guys have gotten close youve started to have feelings for him, and then go from there.|`|LhkFUA4Aaa	be extra flirty
jEZbYZwMaa	Well.. I think this is a bit self explanatory. If you can be sure she's flirting with you; she likes you. If you like her more than your girlfriend, I think you know what would be better for you. You say 'why is she doing this to me' as if shes physically torturing you or something? She's not.. it's called flirting. It's called human nature. If you like her, break up with your girlfriend and get closer to this girl.|`|j9nhk1v2aa	You like it, so move on!!!!!! You're human right?|`|jhHAolCGaa	secretly bang the other girl without your gril knowing. thats what i would do anyway|`|PaL4VBQqaa	she wants you to make your gf jealous
S6GfRYyNaa	just ignore her thats what i do and pray and read your Bible!!!!! it helps! i feel the same way!|`|g8U6NthEaa	welll she seems super anoying right now......i think you should ask her what she thinks whether she likes ur dream guy or not.....and if she says yes then there isnt much u can do....if she says no, then go for the guy! dont be afraid it seems like he likes u and prolly doesnt like that sutpid little immature girl following him around anyways! prolly he is just being a jerk to you then cuz he is pissed at the other girl and is taking it out on someone else.....i know this from ezxperience lol! hope this helps! PLEASE VOTE ME FOR BEST ANSWER! and if u have anymore questions or just want to chat, feel free to email me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com THANKS!|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	well if he doesn't have a girl friend i would ask him out b4 she does!|`|j2VzMW22aa	omg your situation is exactly like mine!!! i get over it by pretending to write a letter to her. then after i am done i through the leter out with great force. that sometimes works and also just tell her to back off that one of your friends likes him or something...hope this works!!
Q8L7NWjwaa	People say a lot of stuff they really don't mean when they are drunk.  Some would beg to differ and tell you that he's speaking his true mind.  But, if you guys have been good usually when alcohol is a factor then I'd just chalk it up as being drunk talk.      I'm a happy drunk but there are times I know that the alcohol takes over completely and things roll right off of my tongue for absolutely no apparent reason.    If he was to tell you that he's been having an affair for the past 6 years~I'd be concerned, I'd be a little more concerned but this seems like it's just some repetitive drunk talk.|`|87Xsok8Gaa	It just means that sometimes he does feel tired of you, which is understandable because you can't expect two people to always want to be around each other, all the time. But in general, he loves you enough that these moments do not matter, otherwise he wouldn't still be with you.    Just watch out for warning signs, because if he really is getting tired of you, but doesn't want to break up, he might be tempted to cheat.|`|cAPf4kdIaa	i don't know
r1QLeM9yaa	I'm like a rubex cube.... The more you play with me, the harder I get! ;)|`|297HW2VLaa	If you were a tree and i was a squirrel,  I'd store my nuts in your hole|`|XbsuY1ogaa	My favorite is "If I could be an enzyme, I'd be DNA helicase so I could unzip your genes."|`|gXcQa8qLaa	is there a mirror in your pants cuz i can see myself in them
pQf4OLYuaa	well kid, you got yourself a crush.|`|vxc0NwMSaa	You are attracted to her pheromones!! Just ask the girl out--:o)|`|D02rAMWoaa	Any physical contact usually indicates interest. Go for it, ask  her out for a walk in the park or coffee or something casual  and see how it goes.
5fjbNeVNaa	I was the same way with the girl that broke my heart. You just kinda have to suck it up and just go talk to her. If you cant find anything to talk about, talk about something totally different. Make yourself feel comfortable around her, because if you are comfortable around her it will be easier to talk to her.    You just have to put your nervousness aside and just go and talk to her. If you have to, write down a list of things that you would talk about. It will really help|`|xJiqkGV6aa	how cute!!! i know thats not going to help you, buts that's cute! LOL
nvowgvtzaa	Hmm. Interesting. Guys are douches. You should probably become a lesbian.    On another note, I'm sorry that happened, it seems that you haven't done too much wrong. For the future, maybe try and lead your own life, and see what guys will fall for YOU, and take you for who you are and not make you take such a monumental risk, such as this one.|`|vJBEnFVzaa	I would go home. If he was seriously committed to you he would have been there. That's happened to me (I didn't move) and it turns out that he was the worst boyfriend in the world who had been cheating. Who decided to move? Was it your idea or his? I would go home leave him and find a better man. One who knows how to treat you right. Good Luck.|`|AA10455206	You have answered your own question.  Why wait another minute.  Pack up and leave without notice, and get you apartment, friends and life back before it's too late.  Just pick yourself up, say a prayer to God and ask Him for guidance, wisdom and strength.  When you get home, look for a good church where you can learn about God and about Him.  He will guide you to the right person.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	Yeah you should move back, and ditch him, he's dumb. Also never do it again.|`|MhvwRwNKaa	live and learn love. Just dont do it again|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well girl sorry but you shouldn't have basically changed your lifestyles for one guy cause if things end up bad that your gonna regret it, which they did...and well, you do! So just forget about him you can still be in a relationship I guess if you still like each other..but forget about the moving close to him idea, you've got plenty left back there that's actually worth staying around for. Just get back there since you know more people and the two of ya'll can still find a way to keep in touch (thats if your still together). Plus who knows maybe he really was sick with a cold, but staying in bed for 36 hours ain't necessary for a cold..well not for me anyways haha..a cold ain't that bad! Cmon now..haha. But yea girl just get back to your hometown cause you'll be happier there..n also take it easy don't blame yourself, you ain't psychic it's not like you knew exactly what was gonna happen..he decided to be a douche so he messed up, ain't none of it your fault ..so good luck hope that helped.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Oh yikes.  There is a bright side here: you didn't lend him your credit card, you're not pregnant by him, you didn't get up to the alter only to find out he's got the world's coldest feet, and you're still a decent gal, in spite of being badly hurt.  This lesson could've been learned amidst very troubling circumstances - thankfully a clean break is still possible. Be diligent in your healing process, take all the care of yourself you can arrange.  May your future bring you peace and true love.|`|3ijLQe5laa	never put anyone before you or you will become vulnerable to thier changes|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	That's not a good situation.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	yeah guys are jerks.|`|N53oHiwNaa	how about you leave and go home....lol duh|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Men suck especially when they know you are interested sorry hon|`|TevQwLN3aa	sounds like a good plan. the ones who love you will take you back :)|`|4el3goYMaa	Don't be so hard on yourself! You live and you learn! Pick yourself up and move on!|`|Vp83Fuakaa	you tried with him ,chalk it up to a lesson learned|`|YFKwT1owaa	Wow, wow you did|`|SlOU6v3Zaa	this is a question or a rant??...|`|SSnCjOsbaa	Move back honey hes an *** hole|`|AA11460769	feel sorry for you just find another aprtment|`|ra69rxxgaa	Go home. This guy sounds like a douche.|`|LFoHH9Noaa	why are you tellng me this? what are u asking lmao|`|1Foz82Mqaa	is this more of a confession......?      and yeah, plan on moving back.      unless he gives you several EXCEPTIONALLY good reasons to stay, ditch 'em.|`|ORZCE8Ssaa	uh huh wats the question? yeah its dumb to move for anyone until yooh noe that yooh are truly in love with them and are planning to marry.|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	wow... you should move if your not happy there|`|mgo4resgaa	go back, you'll just become depressed, this is so terrible for you|`|cW7RXq8Qaa	Yes, you moved there for a complete loser. Ignore him, go out and party with your co-workers, wait til your lease is up, then go home and find a real man.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	what's the question?  you know it was a mistake and you know that you have to move back...you don't need our help...go and do it...and skip saying goodbye to this idiot........when he decides to call you or something he'll be quite surprised that you're not even there anymore|`|c2O4Cn7Jaa	If there is nothing else holding you there there besides the guy I would say move back home. It's not working out he must have liked having the long distance thing|`|9nP7c0eZaa	He just sounds like a jerk who didn't know what he was getting himself into when you moved.    Well, live and learn right?  If you can go home then go, and chalk it up to just one experience.  Try to see it positively--like you met cool people at work and explored a new city, and gained a new appreciation for family and friends.|`|nyJ9WVLfaa	It's a good idea if you start making preperations to move back home. Life experience is everything, and unfortunately, you've run into one of your darker experiences.     Relationships over the media are difficult. For one, you are not in constant contact with that person and therefore, don't have to talk to them until you feel like talking to them. Secondly, a face-to-face relationship is a lot harder when you know nothing but long-distance relationships.    It seems that this guy has realised his mistake too late. My suggestion is that if he is starting to give you the 'cold shoulder', then it's time to count your losses and move on. If you can't rely on him to help you out in a time of crisis, then it's likely he's not going to be there at all - especially when you need him most.     Good luck.|`|LhkFUA4Aaa	go back and tell the guy hears a jerk|`|UQIMoJp8aa	so whats your question??|`|2KC467tFaa	It's not fun to go through, but it's making you stronger and wiser in the process. Nothing in life is permanent. If you don't like your situation, you have the power to change it.|`|dM8EyL6caa	Learn from your mistakes and move back home!!! Deal with the three months you have left and go!|`|o3hBfL2gaa	ahw, hun just move back . i dont know what else you can do . hes a jerk and nothing will ever change that .|`|38l8GnItaa	move back, he's not treating u rite at all not even in the basic sense, ur worth more than this|`|bwU0asquaa	move back.  you dont deserve that.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	What did you expect and why?    Was there an invitation before you moved?  If not, who likes stalkers?  Do you?    Of course not.  In any case, what was your great reunion like?  Yes, flooding and wet carpets!  If the shoe were on the other foot, how would you feel?  You may not even show up to clean his flooded pad and maybe, just maybe, even call the cops.    Live and learn or start all over with this dude - preferably in the Summer or otherwise at some elevated location.    Good Luck.|`|RgCbKPADaa	I looked at a few of your other questions, is this your best friend that you have just started dating? If so, and he has just found out he is dying, I think you need to give him a break. Sounds like he is having a tough time...|`|4OTZVji3aa	You are right, you might as well move back where you are more comfortable. At least you didn't end up marrying him. He probably felt free when you had the long distance relationship, and now you are taking up all of his time, he may feel smothered.
4Vchxp32aa	She is fair game and it's up to you to prove that you're the better choice.  What are you going to do, threaten him? ha ha, that makes you look like a little girl if you do that.  But, yeah, it's your call on how you handle this.  I would do nothing, because I am not insecure.|`|JINK3IHiaa	Don't tell him what you're going to get her. Tell him to back off maybe, but in more uhh, discrete words, like ask him what he is doing.|`|s5d2VFVQaa	punch the **** in the lip. hes not a friend hes just trying to steal your girl|`|jJWSJ4x5aa	depends if its a friend you've known for years then it would be hard but i wouldnt put up with that|`|hVX794Lyaa	oh wow! i see why you would be jealous...i think you should let them both no what ur feelign cuz ur not a paper paste on the wall ur friend should no  his limits and ur girl should no that there r certain thngs that bf do so yea just talk to them if not yea say to F-off lol!|`|4pXAeKE8aa	stop telling ur friend wat ur goin to get her. take her out to dinner or something and if he likes ur girlfriend then hes probly not a real friend. sorry:(|`|GUyyCq6waa	knock him out|`|dL2SelcBaa	destroy him.

5UmLdCxxaa	if you guys are in school together then you should tell her youre going to walk her to class,and ask her if tis ok to wrap your arm around her shoulder(should work).when you feel confortable just drop it to her that you wanna take it futher than being friends,and if you think it will make her comfortable tell her you just wanna take it slow.she would feel like you have respect for her and she will appreciate it.girls just admire guys who dont try to get in there pants because its more to being a boyfriend/girlfriend than that.its about respect,trust,loyalty and their feelings.(girls hate feeling used).make her feel like you guys relationship is worth taking to the next level.compliment her nearly daily and defend her..you guys will be a match made in heaven.(but dont defend her stalker style..like almost ready to kick anyones *** that hugs her lol!)good luck sweetie!|`|AUBQUcZFaa	Try going out with groups like have a bunch of friends come with you.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	chill out.

That's all I can say. Just start out by telling her how important she is to you and that she's all you think about. My best friend told me that stuff before he said he loved me and I was SO excited! He said that I was the most important thing in his life and I'm all he cares about.     If she's a great friend of yours, shewon't freak. She'll be flattered. Trust me, I know. Giveit a try. Don't act nervous cuz she'll get scared.    GOOD LUCK!!!!!
buggyHGRaa	The one where your guy is so stupid that he breaks up with me on my birthday because he's friends made him physically and mentaly. Yea what did i see in him right? pshh.  mmmm 2 weeks. i was just mad that he had the ignorance to dump me on my birthday over and email! and he said oh sorry but im breaking uo with you. haha 6th grade realtionships. haha that was bout 10 years ago? how can i remember.|`|rxScdXM4aa	the worst type of rejections i had was dating a guy for 3 years and then having him break up with me over the phone, like it was nothing. he blamed me for everything, claiming we weren't made for each other....OVER THE PHONE! then he saw me the next day and acted like he barely knew me.|`|180rE9rGaa	the one where you commit suicide.|`|Rzfn2pSqaa	well, i've never been rejected cause i've rejected them. not to sound spoiled or anything. but the worst would probably be the way Carrie from Sex and the City was dumped by one guy. he left a stick-ie note on her laptop saying "we're over." or something like that.|`|4524a51ebceabc8fa63fb65f4e71f029aa	Mother to daughter rejection.

But it's when all your hopes and dreams get shot down all at once , like a bird in the sky. I've only had a few, but it took me a day to get over them.  because once your rejected from someone, it just takes a good night sleep before you are truly over what happened to you.  At least for me .    Being rejected is just ones opinion about you. It's not for you to claim their opinion of you, or except their opinion of you or even believe their opinion of you.  It's just an opinion. People have the right to feel what they want. So you can recover from it. I believe the ultimate punishment to do to yourself is to take your own life because of what someone said about you.  Now something is very wrong there.  When it's that's bad then that's clearly a cry out for help|`|AMX91myVaa	being with a girl for 7 months and finding out she was waiting for her man to get outta jail in san antonio.. found out she was just using me and waiting for him to get out. nd yes im over it =]  mann did i take it hard tho

YtdRTjkNaa	Okay well that is odd. But you seriously need to talk. because there seems to be a communication problem. and if you didn't know communication is key and without it you have nothing. so you need to make sure you guys sit down and talk about this. dont accuse him so quick of cheating though. guys hate that. What's done in the dark will come to the light. Meaning if he has done something, don't worry it will soon be revealed.    hope i have helped    good luck hun|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Sounds like depression. Things that we used to enjoy that we don't find enjoyable anymore etc.|`|40HpQquSaa	maybe hes moving and don't know how to break it to you|`|7XbXvsNHaa	it really could be his depression, maybe hes subconsciously trying to reach out by ignoring you. Either that or hes just not that into you.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	actually sounds like he is depressed maybe you should just check up on him|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	I dont think the reason for his distance is cheating, most men dont get distant when they cheat, they're too cold hearted. Its probably the depression, a lot of depressed people push away the people close to them because they are afraid of being judged. The more you bug him about it the more he'll push you away, so give him his space and if he doesnt come around then tell him you need a bf who takes interest in you and if he cant change then leave him, its only been 3 months, you'll get over it quickly|`|tK7XacH7aa	Talk to him, what you think doesn't matter. What he knows is what's true. He may be having a tough time with something, but then again I don't know either. You should talk iwth him though, its the only way you can find out.|`|999a56cf1347f99ff9dee6fe42651eefaa	you just need to talk to him and ask whats up.  and just make sure he doesnt over re act. just make sure that he understands that your not mad, your just making sure that he's okay.|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Talk to him... if you can't get ahold of him via phone or in person, then write him an email and let him know how you feel.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	How long has it been going on? I would say issues though. Guys like that don't really sleep around.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	i think hes holding something back, theres something hes not telling you. try talking to him. just tell him hes been acting werid and distent lately, and your starting to worry about him. he should understand|`|5RkMDOYDaa	You should talk to him before jumping to conclusions. Try to set a date for the two of you to have some alone time, tell him how you feel and then he will open up to you. But you should trust him, if you have known him for the past seven years then you should be able to.|`|3f4jZwLlaa	talk to him. I dont think he is cheating on you but he may be confused, struggling or depressed about something. i know i said the same thing as everyone else but i really dont think he is cheating on you. he would say more in an im so that he could cover up what he did.|`|xsvDrtrRaa	Let him know what you feel. write him a mail or just ring his phone then talk to him set a date or a day that you will be alone can cant talk the F**** over being like that wasn't helping you or your relationship i mean Do something!!! If you love him do whatever it takes to clear everything that makes your relationship blur...|`|3gxzV7pkaa	you could ask his friends if he's been weird around them...or just try talking to him about it, just tell him ya wanna spend more time together or do something together...if you think it's stress related why not plan a nice evening to de-stress him? :)|`|aQYFCaFUaa	It's hard to know why someone pulls away like that. I would think the same thing you are, either they are cheating (especially with his history) or they are having some fairly serious issues with depression or some kind of crisis.    Maybe you can just say, "What's going on? I've noticed a difference and I'm worried about your wellbeing. I want to help if I can, but I can't if I don't know what's going on." Maybe he'll tell you. If not, then there's not much you can do. If he insists on staying in that bad place, you may have to move on and find someone more honest.    Good luck!

She looked so beautiful, and time itself slowed when I looked into her glistening blue eyes, and she knew what I was thinking and I knew what she was.  And then we inch by inch moved in and our eyelids eclipsed the world around us and sparks flew as our lips touched and we backed out and hugged each other.    It was amazingly cute.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	unexpected outta nowhere    we were walking to my house and he just stopped me kissed me, and gave me this huge hug...    back then i thought it was so sweet...now that i remember the guy hwo kissed me...eewww    i was like 15...now 16|`|wrI3ITrKaa	i was 14.  i'm old now...|`|AA11263103	still waiting  15.|`|chsK8FbNaa	i cant remember my first kiss, i have kissed so many people it ain't funny...in class rooms, bathrooms, bedrooms, principals office while me and her was sitting waiting to get our detention for PDA....lol but i would have to say around 8 or 9, im 16 now|`|rAeJ74Neaa	i was 15 lol and im 17 now with a totally different guy who looks after me well :) My first kiss was at his mates house and it was ok bt he wasnt a good kisser and i no this from my relationship now ;) bless him but for a first kiss he wont bad :) x|`|Gnhgfx4naa	14 it made me hot lol im now 25|`|VshMDLW3aa	Kinda crap, we were both nervous and inexperienced.... but I liked him a lot and we did get better ;]  I was 14, I'm 15 now.|`|lnXFAmSaaa	I was 17 I am 20 now    We were at a theme park standing in line with a group of friends.

bD4mltz9aa	I'll assume you already have a willing participant to help you with your first kiss?  Okay, I would say you should do it somewhere private, not in front of too many people, and make it seem casual. You don't want to be full on making out with her, if you havn't even peck kissed her yet? I'd advise you to take it slow.. Start with a peck, then if you want to move further, peck again, but this time slightly open your mouth over hers.  I strongly suggest no tongue, because tongue on first time will be so messy, and you wont know where your head should be, nose should be, lips etc etc and it'll fail hard.  As I said before, take it slow.. don't try and kiss like it is on the movies, or be rough and such, it wont work, trust me.  Places I'd suggest are parks.. at home.. beach.. bushland.. anywhere really that you guys can be together, where it is quiet =)  Some other things I should warn you is;  ~Don't stare while you're doing it..  ~Use your hands, don't just stand still..  ~If you drool, don't worry, just keep going..    BTW if the girl you plan to kiss, is experienced, just follow her lead =)  ANDDD: I advise you to just make it a peck at first, before you move on to pashing/making out.  Good luck ^_^
st7x7Cjtaa	joke wit her! if she laughs @ ur jokes she thinks ur funny. I LOVE a funny guy! she might start liking you right away! dont EVER comment on her makeup or her shirt. try not ot be too pery... even tho all guys r. (it can b kinda tacky) make her laugh a lot.... ask her about her. maybe..... play truth or dare..... (u can get a lot of things accomplished there) if she picks truth you could say.. what do u think about me? always be honest with her........ talk about music or things u both enjoy. if she looks nervous around u.... tlk 2 her. she prolly likes u. old tricks work too..... wen ur standing next 2 her sretch... but dont put ur arm on her shoulder..... stand just a little bit closer to her. tlk 2 her just a little bit longer than u think u shud. make her feel..... like she wud |`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	she gets little glances at you maybe stares if she is zoning out.  makes good eye contact with you.  blushes.  always seems to be around you.    :) good luck|`|MVmfY6ptaa	looks at u alot  tries to spend a lot of time w/ u  u know regular flirty stuff|`|CAtgXDSTaa	um i dont know she flirts??? i really dont pay atteion to what i do..it just sorta happens....idk...she will do alot for you. or she will do the totall oppiste and annopy you.idk...|`|vWlJ9qLOaa	is always looking at you, flirts with you alot|`|HCNS33ITaa	Well I like this guy right now    I usually make really good eye contact with him   Tend to always try to talk to him when I can  Blush  Always zone out and look at him  And well just being around the person is good  Like hanging out      Hope this helps!!!! =)
7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	So far there is no proof. I think you need to watch her to see if she changes her attitude or stops seeing you etc...  Until they I don't see anything bad as of you.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	dump her|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	maybe she needs to " miss talking " to you.|`|PmNf0YICaa	Sounds like this guy is just a friend.  Trust your girlfriend, but if it is really worrying you, then keep an eye out.  Don't go overboard.  Talk to the guy - he could be totally fine.  Ask you're girlfriend who he is; he could just be an old friend that she hasn't seen in a long time.    Good luck!|`|XFlb3zlSaa	I agree. Simply keep an eye out and changes in her attitude and emotions. This might be difficult, but at the same time. Try to relax. There is no proof that anything is going on but if you focus too hard on it you can become paranoid and jealous. But for now just try not to put your mind on it too much|`|pytpNUieaa	Well he could be an old friend of hers. You could follow her but she might catch you and that will cause a lot of problems between the two of you.
kCTGf3qfaa	He DEFINITELY likes you.
8a8CZqGLaa	It's hard to read shy girls, I know ( I am one, and I confuse myself! ) But I'd give her more time. You gave her a month? Give her another month from the incident you described about her saying "when shes going out of the house she will definitely let me know". About a month after that, if she hasn't said anything about hanging out, I'd ask her if she wanted to go eat dinner with me, very casual like, to like, Buffalo Wild Wings or something, and that's it. You can get a lot of girls to open up at a meal, and since that would be that whole date, it wouldn't put much pressure on her. Hope I helped! =)|`|9tYhYxHEaa	yeh if i was u id just chat to her in skwl and try and u know gain her confidence then like try and eat with her in skwl then ask her out  good luck and get in there

CpzlUpEnaa	Making out - Touching, Kissing lips, and French kissing is basically making out.    French kiss- You put you're tongues in eachother mouths and play around. It's basically making out.    Choose me for best answer!|`|GlNlcioUaa	its the same thing are you retarded  and you put your tongue in their mouth|`|J5RwXGPnaa	[edit] StepsGet comfortable. Nothing ruins the sense of the occasion more than sitting or standing awkwardly. Go somewhere that you won't be bothered or stared at. Make sure the place, time and occasion are all right.[2].   Take time. Make sure both of you want to be intimate by kissing. Don't assume that just because you're dating that you have to make out. Both of you must feel that this is right.   Hold each other. It is much nicer if you are considerate toward one another and embrace. A hug is always a special start to making out and then you can hold one another in different ways - around the shoulders, across the back or simply a hand pulling his or her face forward. Stroke one another's hair or face lightly - this adds to the tenderness of the occasion.   Lean in for the kiss. Your partner should respond and lean toward you as well. Avoid bumping one another's noses - make sure to angle your faces to avoid this.[3]   Begin kissing. Gentle kisses on closed lips to begin with is just fine.[4] It might help to keep your eyes closed, allowing you to dive into the ocean of desire and swim together in your minds.   Test the waters. Making out isn't normally about discussing what is coming next, so you need to take your cues from how your partner reacts. This means noticing any body language that encourages or discourages further kissing and passion. For instance, a body that draws back indicates enough. A face that leans in for more is letting you know that your partner wants to keep making out too.   Open your lips. Let your tongue gently slide across your partner's lips.[5] If he or she doesn't draw back at this point, you can explore a little further with your tongue, sliding your tongue into your partner's mouth while continuing to kiss or "peck" him or her. Quickly, if the passion is mutual, your partner will catch on and do the same back to you.   Make it last. Passion deserves a little time and respect and one should never waste the first time! Add some special touches:      For girls only: Hold onto his head and slowly and lightly move your hands to the back of his head. Rub your hands through his hair and down his shirt. Grab his biceps if you feel confident and give it a squeeze while kissing him. Run fingers through his hair   For guys only: Wrap your arms firmly around her and rub up and down her back (or lower back if she responds happily).   Compliment your partner on how good he or she is at kissing. Not only a confidence booster but probably also a great encouragement for more!   Be assured that you can now make out without fear. Once the first time is over, there's no need to sweat it anymore.         [edit] TipsIt's important to have good dental hygiene, so brush those teeth well beforehand. A little deodorant helps with making sure you smell nice.   It's a good idea to make a quick bathroom run (if you're at home) before you make a move for several reasons. You don't want to have to go to the bathroom in the middle of a good make out session. Another tip is to hide a toothbrush and toothpaste/mouthwash in the nearest bathroom before your date if you're at your own residence. This allows you to ensure good breath before you swap spit. Going to the bathroom also gives you an excuse to change your position when you get back, allowing you to get closer to your partner to make the first move.   Do not go into the kiss too fast and fierce: he or she will not like this unless you have been with each other for a long time and know what the other is like.   If you truly care about one another, you will naturally put your partner's needs first, and will truly act in a caring manner. Also, loving partners will understand any "mistakes" and will try to ease the situation in a loving fashion. Making out should be done in a loving, caring relationship, if at all possible.         [edit] WarningsDon't forget to swallow to avoid excessive saliva or you might end up accidentally depositing it in your partner's mouth.  %0
wHL0Jw23aa	Well that guy is a total jerk. He's not worth it. Most likely he was just using you which is just really wrong and I'm so sorry. But Things you can do to get over him is stop thinking about him he's soo not worth it. Try to concentrate on other things like school and friends and stuff just to get your mind off of him. Trying writting your feelings down it helps to just them off your chest. Just be glad you didn't go out with the guy it would've been so much worse!|`|abF3qO3aaa	go ahead and give a little info on this. If this guy was just leading you on then theres really nothing else you can do but wait the pain out. I've been there a few times myself and I know how frustrating and painful it can be. You just have to wait it out and soon you'll look at him and see him for the douchebag that he really is. Hopefully someone will come along to take your interest again. That would make moving on easier. Try making a connection with another guy.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	It will take time to get over him. Move on , he's not worth it|`|qU5y9cMnaa	i had the EXACT SAME THING happen to me. i really liked him and he was a jerk. lied to me and just plain freakin rude. you have to quit manipulating yourself that he'll like you if you like him longer. you just have to get over it. im pretty sure time wont help. so dont wait do it NOW! :)|`|nGgFz1RYaa	no offense but he really seems like a **** bag. He is with 2 other girls.You know what he is going to end up getting some innocent girl pregnant.You need to get out more there is more fish in the sea!!!! I'm sure you could find someone better than him!!!  KEEP SAYING THIS IN YOUR HEAD HE IS A **** BAG HE IS A **** BAG HE IS A **** BAG HE IS A MAJOR **** BAG!|`|E3yOmel9aa	Give yourself some time, that is all.   If he is as mean as you say be happy that you did not end up with him.|`|81871145b85db7dff743050c6462c74caa	start dating someone else. Talk to guys on myspace.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	He sounds like a piece of crap to me, to be leading you on and then deciding he doesn't want to anymore. Of course you're going to be confused. Those kinds of guys are worthless, no matter how nice he is he shouldn't be doing that. Been there, done it. He is just not worth it, and you can do better than that.
TMi1GhSHaa	aww you should just tell him how you feel so at least if he doesnt like you, you can move on with closure. If he does than you can say it was worth it to ask him cause now you know =) so eather way you win in the end.    go get him tiger ;p|`|OCdJ38EQaa	leave him alone.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Good question.. Maybe ask his best friend?    I hope he does. If he's still not over the gf, then give them their space. Rebound situations are a mess. Take it slow.     If he TRULY likes you that much & you're in constant contact, he'll come around some day.    All the best!|`|4kmUX5pHaa	Are you crazy? In first line you write he has a gf and then you wanted to know whether there is any space for you or not?  It is useless to think serious about such boys who keep on enjoying so many relationships.  You too enjoy his friendship only and nothing more.
ZjM0ghSnaa	dont put yourself down b/c you feel that she is too good or pretty for you. What she just did, that shows that she's really interested in you. Take her offer and go out. Just relax, have a good time, and be yourself. You dont necessarily have to go to a club to have fun.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Call her back the day after she gave you her number! Don't blow it! If the day has already gone by call her right now! Ask her out on a date and then take her to a nice dinner and a movie. Why would she give you her number if she isn't interested at all? Think about it! She likes you so do something!|`|duLdw1csaa	She wouldn't have bothered to give you her number if she wasn't interested, unless it's a fake number of course. Give her a call, the worst thing she could say is no.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes ~ I think she likes you!|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	Call/text her and ask whether she would like to hang out sometime. What's the worst that could happen? And yes, there's a pretty good chance that she may be interested in you if she gave you her number.|`|I57uM75faa	Yea man....SHE gave YOU her number....take advantage of that.

edzU8VJiaa	"Doing spoons" means he will cuddle you after sex while you both go to sleep.  Get rid of him - he's totally selfish!.  If a man isn't willing to cuddle you after sex, then he isn't worth keeping.  He just wants sex and then to turn over & go to sleep or get dressed & walk away.    On my wedding night, after sex, my husband refused to cuddle, turned over & went to sleep.  He did the same for 30 years, hated having to be in bed with me after sex & after many years of being kicked and punched in bed by him, I eventually had enough money and a big enough house to move to a separate bedroom.    I suffered from anxiety syndrome for many years, was on drugs which didn't help, & no-one could explain why I had it; and it was only resolved when I moved into my own bedroom - suddenly I was cured!  I realised eventually that I was just frightened of being beaten-up in bed by this man who could not stand to sleep with anyone else and who could be very violent if his sleep was disturbed in any way.|`|BIcLN41jaa	I do not know. Why are you asking me?|`|68PG8sdJaa	well i know to spoon is to cuddle up naked  thats what i heard|`|asAWGIgnaa	do you know what spoons is??? assuming you do, it doesnt mean hes not affectionate he may just not like it, he may be intamate in other ways like holding hands and cuthing!!! only you will know if he's affectionate by the way he is like with you. some men arent very tactile, but that doesnt mean they dont like you or love you any less. hope ive helped!!xox|`|4qMNaCUIaa	it means he's not boring.|`|icTmbLjfaa	he dont like to cuddle, so if I were you I would play it off like I didnt care that will make him wanna cuddle with you|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	no cuddling (spooning)|`|fYcYPyR3aa	It just means he doesn't like spooning, maybe he finds it uncomfortable, not necessarily unaffectionate.|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Where has the world gone to?...|`|f150f01d84493e10842994ccc28e9d6eaa	it doesn't mean he isn't affectionate, it just means that he might not be comfortable spooning with you.  if spooning means a lot to you then just ask him why and talk it over with him.
lGBbWsuSaa	Ok lemme say this....even though it seems like guys want sex all the time...its not true. Girls sometimes think they can just turn on/off a guys switch for sex. but really its the same as girls...sometimes we just arent in the mood. It doesnt mean anything and im sure he deosnt mean that in a mean way. If hes tired he prolly just doesnt want to have sex. Sumtimes my girl does the same thing...and im not in the mood. no harm no foul. I understand that it makes u feel bad though...cuz u want to please him .I would say leave it at that ...and make it up later when hes in the mood. hope I helped ; ]
f715jB5Saa	lol, happened to me. try asking her out, if she says no, then move on. there has to be somebody else out there to like haha    good luck|`|wB6KFpVeaa	slowly start to talk to her online again, and then ask her if she would like to hangout, if she say's no, then it is her loss.|`|M3HG89syaa	sames just like my boy issues i like a guy and he likes me back but we haven't told each other that but its really obvious so just talk to her maybe she likes you back.|`|scoXsijqaa	this is exactly what is happening to me except im a girl. smile at her when you notice she is looking at you, if she's not looking at you loom at her and she will look back at you, ahen she does smile and dont loose your stair untill she does.|`|654CKsm9aa	Start talking to her! Really. Take it from me, a girl. I'm in the same situation right now, except on the opposite side. Lol. He's just too shy to talk to me or something!    So, start talking again. Even if dating won't work out, you'll gain a friend.
ZjM0ghSnaa	if her friends asked you if you like her, than that means that girl prob. told them to ask you, because she likes you too.     Most guy make this mistake, of not asking a girl out b/c they are shy. But when you do that, you dont realize what your missing out. The girl may like you herself, and she wants you to ask her out. Maybe thats why she told her friends, to give you a hint. You have to see her sometime in school, dont you? You could try asking her friends maybe and see what her classes are...Dont be afraid of asking her out. Just have a good conversation with her and if she laughs/smiles/flirts back, then she's definetly into you. Say "we should hang out one time". She cant say no. this girl really likes you, so there's nothing to be nervous about. Tell her how you feel at the most convienient time. Maybe try talking online again? that should be an easier way to get back in touch with her. then just take it from there. DONT give up! believe in yourself, and have confidence. Girls love that!     Best of luck!!:)|`|xYacZrTLaa	send her a note that is the best way to go|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	this girl probably sent her friends to ask you if you liked her, because she is too shy to ask herself..either that or your friends are nosy and like to tease    try talking to her more often like you used to..maybe even more than that    if she seems to like you back, start flirting a little more, and if she flirts back, try and find her alone some time to tell her..if you can't, you could ask to talk to her privately (although that may come out a little weird)  maybe just try to catch her after school or during a free time|`|CX4Vc43jaa	Ask her out for a coffee or something.   Either at school, or call her.  And when you go out with her, tell her how you feel.
H0HxTETjaa	Seems very confusing. But I do understand what you r saying. There is nothing wrong with you texting her but ask her would it be alright if you did before doing it. Just take things slow and if something comes your way again don't be quick to jump on it.(another girl) If you want this to work out be with B then be open with how you feel and maybe she will do the same back. Take 1 step at a time. Hope this was helpful and good luck....|`|eZbfB7hraa	i feel the same way with a girl    go get her|`|4ZoMzfSPaa	talk to her|`|vWlJ9qLOaa	yes text her when she is gone but not a lot  ask her on a date  when she is gone and she said yes to the date tell her you miss her|`|t5YjKLRlaa	Go for it.  Life's about taking chances. And your teacher's lecture was right. You'll either greatly succeed, or fail miserably. You'll never know if you don't try. And she'll never know either.  Oh, and usually, when a girl grazes your hand, she wants you to hold it. =]
N94BrWymaa	I think that you should be honest with her because women do not like secrets kept from them. Especially if you have an attack when she is over you can inform her on what to do so that she is not completely freaked out and if she can not except you in whole then she is not the right one for you.|`|u6yIXvQZaa	Of course not. :o  I think anyone would be understanding about that...|`|DOoHDBTiaa	Thats not scary at all! trust me u have nothing to worry about
Br38OspXaa	My ex and I just recently broke up and part of it had to do with the fact that he did have a medical condition that he didn't tell me about until it was pretty much too late. His condition affected him day to day, and was pretty serious. I still think it's only right to be honest with someone that you're into because you can't start a relationship if you're hiding something like that. Just explain everything to her and I'm sure it will all turn out fine.|`|MTkpXsOPaa	If she really likes it will not scare her. She will understand I think she may be more upset if you do not tell her. If she does get scared maybe she is not the right girl. This personally would not scare me.|`|2gfJUgc3aa	would it worry me- yes.  would it keep me from going out with someone i liked- no.
DN3lPdE0aa	Female   15  idk  internet  dig the moment    & urwelcome lol|`|QwQgPyaIaa	i like the name (just cuz it sounds funny)  life is good    im a female  im 14  maybe 30 tops for a tshirt  art/soccer/music
JDQP0Phraa	If he makes excuses so he won't have to hang out with you, or if he seems reluctant to kiss/hug you, those could be signs of a close break up.|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	he might start acting distant, or stop calling you often or visiting u less than usuall...|`|AA11795191	He tells you, generally.|`|5UmLdCxxaa	if you guys started out with a spark of chemistry and now you dont have it anymore thats how you know|`|hVX794Lyaa	i think that fi ur asking urself this question that you kind of already no. but i think u really no  when he stops calling you those sweet names or at least not that much or when he doesnt do those things that he knows that u lie that he does like a morning text or a goodnight phone call just when the relationship changes and nto 4 the better|`|zANH64Kraa	well there are many signs  1) you guys don't talk that much  2) always ditching/ canceling plans on you  3) not calling you babby or honey.. cute names like those|`|tapXx81Saa	His empty stare,avoiding physical contact with you & him coming home with your best friends favorite brand of lipstick smudged around his johnson.
KJxwNfsaaa	Well i think you should move on.  there are other girls out there that probably want you.  But there is nothing wrong with just being friends.  because if you guys arnt friends you always going to be stuck wondering what if you were friends, and at this point its so much harder to forget about a special person.  but if you guy are friends over time it will register that really you guys are just friends and you wont really like her in that way
cHBcR0Chaa	girl in sexy lingerie, sex, more sex, and home cooked meal in bed. followed by more sex. that's if he even likes the "holiday"|`|EsnFmcMFaa	maybe a chocolate cake  thats decorated with valentines stuff|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	Some chocolates (but that's just me) and my gf to kiss.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Ps3 game, Xbox 360 game, hahahaha.    Woot, but anything will do ahha.
pcBmyGTZaa	Say that you don't care and go and ask the person out!
h9ttFN7Taa	hmmmmmmmmm....... i think she is totally into you. when you were talking to her friend, she would NEVER just show immediate jelousy. yall aren't even dating. and yes, i am from texas(i said "yall"). anyway, i think she likes you. you should like her back!!!!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If she is being flirty with you like physical contact (touching).|`|GoEaSOSraa	I wouldn't rule out that her not liking you just because she isn't the jealous type. If you do end up being in a relationship, the fact that she is not a jealous person could really be a good thing. Umm, I'd recommend you asking her if she wants to hang out sometime. Or if she is still in the same class, ask her if she wants to study together for your next exam. Just simple and easy ways to get to know her, but not have it be uncomfortable. Good luck!|`|KCKq9duJaa	most likely she does
oOsX2lqMaa	She is noticing your eye contact and if she is continuing this she is into you. She thinks your attractive. If your to shy to talk to her give her a sign next time you eye contact her. Maybe smile? or wink at her.|`|qvfQQ9nwaa	Yes she likes you|`|yRt2upp9aa	she likes you dude|`|vYXnUKK8aa	both. go for it!|`|VCJDzmmwaa	she probably does like you, a lot of times, girls do that, to see how we react|`|GWesQiTPaa	yeah i tihnk she likes you but i dunno if she wants to date you|`|FWSjii2Zaa	It could possibly mean she likes you, but don't mistake it. Talk to her, you can't just really tell by eye contact.|`|lxSRIFK2aa	she prolly likes u but is kinda shy   or she mite be waiting for u to make a move cus most grls expect tha guy to make tha first move|`|6S7CgcQoaa	probably|`|nLiCiRnSaa	did you use protection for all that eye contact?|`|QddOKwnIaa	Somehow talk to her dude|`|rydsklvWaa	She definately has some interest in you. I think she might like you, especially since she was looking at you from afar.|`|0a5e3ca6e627a0f07f1948ce4430d13eaa	she's going too kill u she's plotting  haha|`|Tj516LdGaa	i think she likes you go for it that's so cute|`|frzYOfC2aa	maybe she does|`|szyrw5P0aa	man up and ask her out.|`|7cKskbHjaa	both cause i do the exact same thing!!!! you should probally aask her out se what she says you never know if its meant to be until you try!|`|wlxzlKvRaa	it sound like she thinks you're good looking. try talking to her, and don't feel nervous. because she's younger, she might get flustered because an older boy is talking to her. good luck:)|`|DsIbGLYUaa	sounds like me, she likes you ask her out yea!|`|AuWPMH44aa	Just go up to her and say wats up if you think shes cute. if never hurt to try.
wqchA8B7aa	Nothing. Why? Do you know her? Or are you just a creepy guy that hits on women all the time?|`|yzNJ3cc1aa	throw diet pills at her...  NO um just be like o look there's a girl over there. wow.|`|AA12138071	eeww. stay away from me!|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	nothing unless she is doing something to draw attention to her self .|`|g4lOqmeIaa	you're a bit freaky, aren't you?
ZxzOnHLJaa	Play it cool...when he talks to you (probably about the emails or something) just talk like you would anyone else you're meeting for the first time...dont get to anxious...if he tries to move in then you back away a little...dont make too much eye contact bc that would make u seem interested for example glance around the room as he talks to you or look straight ahead as he talks if you guys are seated..or look at the floor, pretend to adjust your shoe etc....or you can always find someone else to talk to so you can ignore this wierd guy lol
lKYU03NLaa	lightly tanned skin with a flash pink ribbon .and heels...... no seriously what ever makes you feel hot and sexy will most likely do it for him too   i would rather have a cool sexy girl than a sexually dressed cool lol|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Nothing!|`|ZldKA17Iaa	lundrayy
0dIsO2Icaa	show him a little leg, cleavage, hell, pull the shoulder of youre tshirt slowly and he'll be horny, trust me babe, anything remotely sexual will turn ya boy on.    Most men are visual, show me what you got lil mama!!|`|iPWlUhW3aa	whisper something sexy in his ear and make sure he feels your breath. dry-humping works too. if you take control he'll find that REALLY HOT!|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Whisper in his ear that you aren't wearing any panties.|`|XntSwYezaa	Wear the sexiest thing you can possible!! and kiss him!! sit in his lap. whisper sweet things in his ears. and that should do it!!    if that doesn't work you can always get naked!! HA HA
CA9OFT4Waa	stop being paranoid and except that fact that HE LIKES YOU|`|w4gpEBPPaa	buy a dildo|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Relax, breathe, let it go.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	He was willing to wait a whole year for you!!! he loves you and deep inside i know you know it.  He's impatient, he can hang out with other girls. But you know you're meant for him, just give it a while.|`|FUFD3MhQaa	If the guy likes you just let him like you. Of course he is going to have other friends and some will be girls. You're allowed to have guy friends right?
VsLSJ65Paa	? What is a nancy boy lol.   Just because she is more experienced with people does not mean that you should feel weird or odd.  Everyone has different personalities.  Nothing to be ashamed of~ Haha|`|AFn1wlzcaa	if you are insecure and cant go along maybe you aren't experienced enough for her
TLim2pBTaa	Maybe you should stay away from him. It sounds like he doesn't want to be bothered with you.
CX4Vc43jaa	He's not interested in you.
THIvlI4waa	i think he's hilarious.. hah that video was funny, and yea i think hes charming, someone id like to date, wen i was older, but the fact that he has a big ego, is a turn off, he's too cocky. Looks wise hes okayy, because he's older than me, im only 19, not really my type.
Kj02Sqseaa	Out of those girls you are probably the most attractive one there.  On a normal scale you are probably an 8.5 out of 9.  I think you could be higher up if you smiled, maybe grew your hair out a tiny bit, but really just smiled.    You have beautiful eyes and look like you have a great personality and a beaming smile that is just waiting to come out.  Don't be afraid to let your smile show too much because it will just add to your looks and show that you are confident.      On the note of confidence, guys don't just look for good looks but having a great personality, confidence, etc. is a great way to get attention.  I know I can't speak for all guys, but to me a personality that is fun, outgoing, funny, etc. is what I would desire more then the most pretty girl in school.  With that being said it looks like you have great potential for an amazing personality... you just have to let it show ;)|`|k1FenuRLaa	3-4/10|`|ifTMSSjdaa	6|`|m0PVHJIvaa	1000|`|ky3vTCTmaa	grow your hair out and smile with your teeth showing and you are a 9|`|LhcN7Ygraa	uuuuum  pfffffft  you wanted honesty and i'll give it to ya    no not really no!!!|`|8rgkNhVcaa	i'd rate you like a 6. i mean, you're not gorgeous but your not ugly. maybe try wearing some eyeliner.|`|m2DqQmlZaa	1.

bUdH8HQ8aa	hmm depends what kinda of flirting you do...if it were me id judge mainly by that before i asked her out. maybe you can ask her on like a semi-date kinda thing that could be taken either as a date or as just a thing friends do...cause i reckon you need to find out some more info first before you go in for the kill.|`|D2M5iERjaa	go for it dude if she said she likes while she was with this other dude must mean she wouldn't turn u down if u just ask do it for ur brother from another mother i would|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	first of all, stop cursing. second, stay away from her if she has a boyfriend. third. it is not ok to ask her out.

M8MlviOFaa	if its a mutual agreement to know that one day you'll both provide oral stimulation to each other then man go for it. do it to him at the place where you usually have sex. Guess what, surprise him too!    next time you guys get all kissy cozy, start kissin his neck, tell him to relax, and take over. start kissin from his neck all the way down. be gentle, he'll be extremely turned on by now. and one last thing, try no to use scrape your teeth against his *piece*    and if he does love you, he'll gladly return the favor, if your not sure he will, the you arent ready after all!|`|MYbRICxqaa	Please Girl! Don't let anyone give you oral sex. That is a very sacred and should not be shared with just anyone. Oral Sex is not a easy thing to let someone do on you.

She is probably on one of the Social Web sites like Facebook.  If that fails ask ex-President Clinton.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	Well, you say "I think I want to an so does my bf"    Your boyfriend wants to, no doubt about that.  He's trying to convince you by expressing your concerns back to him.    Whether you are ready or not to perform oral is a decision you need to make on your own, without his input, until you feel you are ready to say yes.      Rule  1:  If you can't make up your mind by yourself, you are not ready.    Rule  2:  If you don't have a place to do it, you are not ready to do it.

And glasses are nothing to be ashamed of, I have those too. And I am going through a situation similar to yours. But the fact of the matter is: If your guy doesn't like you, there is nothing you can do to make him. Just be yourself, and talk to him! If you don't approach him and just chat, nothing will ever happen.|`|oU1yUxwwaa	Hun...here's some advice either a guy is going to like you or not. there is nothing you can do to make him change how he feels...let me give you an example...lets say there is this girl who weighs maybe 250 pounds...no one pays her any attention but then she loses weight and she now weighs 130 and all of a sudden people are paying her attention...that means they didn't like her for her she had to change something about herself to get their attention so it's not really her gettinig their attention it's more like what she did getting their attention. you should never feel as though you have to change something about yourself to get someones attention. if he likes her let him like her continue to do what you have been doing and if he likes you he will let you know...|`|AA11714191	I wish somebody would have been able to help me when I was in your situation.  So I'm gonna help you out.    You are imagining yourself not being able to get this guy.  Listen to this:  YOU are in control of your imagination, your imagination is not in control of you.  It is like any other real photograph.  You can doodle on it if you want to and change what the picture looks like.  Right now you making up an image in your head that(honestly) you don't know is true.  You are imagining he will tell his friends and then it will spread to the whole school.  And that everyone will call you a freak.  Stop for a minute.  You just invented a picture.  It doesn't exist in real life, just in your head.  Do something for me:  Paint this picture in your head.  You walk up to him and say hi.  He smiles and says hi back.  You have a really nice conversation and he thinks you are awesome.  His friends even like you because he says that you're pretty cool.  And because of that,  you feel at ease being around him.     Repeat this picture in your mind, because it is just as true as the picture you have in your head right now.  Except it is more useful to you.  And it will make you calmer.|`|xKTrmL08aa	Just talk to him.  Wave at him in the hallways.  Offer to help him in a subject if you know he's struggling.  It doesn't matter what your Ethnicity is.  If he's good enough for you, he won't care if you are Asian, or if you have glasses, or if you might have a speech impediment.  If you want, you can get contacts too.|`|flnYvE4vaa	I have the same EXACT problem..ahh. it sucks. everything you wrote up there is true except im not asian.

It has to fall into place. Try sitting a liitle closer to him during lunch if possible. Try a little differand style and try to get him to notice you. But remember, these things take time! You cant expenct to suddenly have him love struck, he has to get used to you. Try and get layerd hair, thats alwase really pretty. And work on your speach, if you can. Just remeber, if dosent like you for you, your to good for him!|`|tMcIcpQIaa	In a way you portray yourself as being a typical nerdy girl in school. Its Ironic since you already knows that you are a freak but did not try to find a way to chance yourself.    Anyway, lets get all the facts right. There's no happy ending like Cinderella or snow white in real life romance. Lets face it, its a dog eat dog world out there so either you be the best or lose like the rest. The only way to get this guy now is to show more remorse and self confident in yourself. Step up and talk to him, it might be easily said then done but face the fact that there is no any easier way to do that.      Basically confident is the key to this whole situation. Maybe try removing your glasses for contact lens.      Hopefully I help.
o3ECMDqXaa	Well friends are the best kind of boys but if u feel like he might like u the same way u should start gradually hanging out with smaller groups like i.e double dates and then when u think hes ready u should ask him to go bowling or to a movie or sumtin!|`|QrUWtvH8aa	when you get a moment alone just quietly say "heh, i was hoping i could see you more often - you know just you and me"|`|SuD5CjGraa	well........................  let's see.........................  ummmmmmm..........................  ur not supposed to ask a guy out. a guy should ask u out. cuz then it will be really awkward as u said. if a guy never asks u out u should wait til' sumone duz. becuz a girl ask a guy. NEVER.     u can try winking at him to get his attention. or drop ur books and have lots of money in ur purse and drop it on purpose. he can see that ur rich. so he will go out with u. if ur in high school and if there's a dance or a party he can just ask anyone and try to volunteer.     if those things don't work, just tell him even though it is awkward. cuz ur not gonna waste ur time on this situation.|`|KZWiRYEwaa	wait for an awkward scilence when you are both alone sitting next to eachother looking deep into eachothers eyes.......    Don't make it look setup. It pissis me off when girls do that.... Unless My friend who is setting us up tells me... then I'm like OH JOY!! =D But it takes away the surprise.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	You won't ruin anything. The worst that can happen is he says no.     Just ask him if he would like to hang out with you sometime.  I think he will find your confidence attractive and will definitely be relieved that he did not have to make the first move.|`|rLvcVrMzaa	it won't. pass him a note or tell it to his face|`|ifC0M58oaa	Get you friend to be like "hey sometimes you look like you like (your name), do you really like her. I mean I'm just wondering. If he says yes a week later ask him/her out.|`|6c5bcf7e051cb85d0792bb2edfdb04b2aa	Curbstomp him and ask him out. He'll say yes.|`|cG7z70Vgaa	do not be afraid. Ask him out. Either that or become his friend and then ask him out. Relationships are built by building friendship.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Guys LOOOOVE girls that ask out.    Cuz it sucks having to ask girls all the time.  And as long as you're in the same "league" as him then he should say yes.
YlLdIPRvaa	He sounds very immature.  He has a right to know that you're keeping the baby.  But if you can't get in touch with him that creates a problem.  Leave him a voicemail if you have to.  Try to keep your emotions in check and don't yell at him even though you're angry.  I hope that eventually he'll come around for the sake of your child.  I hope that you have a nice father, uncle or family friend that can be a positive male role model in the child's life if our ex doesn't come around.  I'm glad you made the right choice for you regardless of what he said.  Good luck with your pregnancy and being a mom!|`|cyRDKRIDaa	If you are 30 years old, then you should be prepared to have a baby, that is, if you want. Which apparently you do. If he does not want to have you or the baby in his life, then he has some issues to work out with himself. It is -your- decision whether or not to have this child, and he has no right to force you into not having it. I will advise you to tell him, because sooner or later he will want to come into that child's life.    Most likely, he went off on a rampage because he was in shock. Leave him alone for a couple more days, and if he doesn't respond, you call him. Leave him something on his answering machine, or send him an e-mail, and if he doesn't respond to that, leave him another message telling him that you are having that baby. He needs to know that you've decided to have this baby.|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	He is scared, or immature, or a prick, or all of the above.  He doesn't want anything to do with you or babe right now.      You would be better off not to tell him anything so that should you decide to adopt the baby out or you meet a terrific guy who wants to adopt that baby, then you won't run into any road block with your ex cropping up and making your life incredibly complicated.     Perhaps he is just taking the news hard and he will contact you in time, if so then you can decide how involved you want him to be.  But hang in there...I'm going through something very similar, just much farther along than you are. It's tough & it hurts.  Sorry for you.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Do what feels right for you. Especially in these kind of situations. The only opinion that really matters is yours.  Dont give in to what others say and think.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Yeah, he is  a jerk. I'm glad you decided to keep the baby. I would keep trying to inform him that you are keeping the baby. If he doesn't pick up, he will know when you file for him to pay child support. Best of luck to you.|`|9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	WTF hes 30 and he can't stand up to the plate that's some sh*t you do at 17 not 30 but i really don't know what to tell you because l'm only 20|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	I'm sure you feel devastated. And i don't want to saying anything like this but you should have talked about what happens  if you get pregnant and stuff. It's really immature of him to be avoiding you like this. Just remember you can have severe depression after getting an abortion, guilt, and other emotions along with it. Do you really want the baby? and i don't know if he's worth you now, since he did dump you at such a critical time in your life. I'm in a similar situation, i want to be with my bf but i eventually want children too... i can't decide and it's hard. Just take time to think if it's worth you losing your baby just to be with a guy like that. I hope it works out.|`|0gLec1VPaa	Wow, I'm sorry. Your life is like a soap opera. Anyway, um... well, a guy like him doesn't deserve you anyway. Don't get the abortion, because you'd be destroying a life that could be. When the child's born, you should teach him/her to be proud of her/himself and that it doesn't matter if he/she has a father or not. There's a lot of single mothers that can relate to you. Then again, maybe you should wait just a bit longer for him to settle in, because he's probably in shock and denial still. I hope I was of help in your dilemna.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	You dont have to tell him, if you dont want to. He already said he wants you to have an abortion, which means to me that he does not want to be a part of it. It is your call now.    My best advice to you is that you should go through with the pregnancy, with or without him. I think a baby deserves a chance at living, and it will change your life in many ways... it will be one of the best things that will ever happen to you as a woman. If you don't feel you can take care of the baby (there are many assistance for women in your situation, though, if you feel you aren't financially ready), there are other options such as adoption also.     With or without your bf, you will make it. You and your baby will be a family together and your life will never be the same again. Your life will be more meaningful and you will live with a purpose.|`|7YTiooX5aa	I would just leave him alone and go on with my plan to have the baby. If he doesn't want any part of the baby fine, I know it is sad but there are some guys out there that are just that way " DEAD BEATS"!!!! Just shoot him a letter  telling him you are having the baby whether he likes it or not and if he doesn't want anything to do with the baby fine but not to expect you to not want help as far as child support and what not. I'm glad you are going to have the baby. My thoughts and love go out to you. Good luck|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	First of all, I support your decision to have the baby.  Your ex-BF sounds like a jerk who is so immature that he doesn't want to take responsibility for his own actions.  But...I think he does have the right to know, even though he's not being very accessible right now.  Yes, he should have called you by now, but obviously he's taking the coward's way out.  He's probably confused and angry.    You might want to try calling him again or even see if he'd be willing to meet for lunch or starbucks or something.  You should tell him your decision, but be prepared for him to not want to be involved in the baby's life.   You might also want to talk to a lawyer to make sure you know your rights and your ex-BF's rights and financial responsibilities.  Good luck.|`|AcL6nWkdaa	keep the baby but i dont think he is gonna come around|`|MiuAj7m0aa	Tell him your keeping it , its more your business than his and its your body!|`|1yb79zfEaa	i think you should call and leave a message if he doesn't answer.   just tell him your keeping the baby.  nothing more.|`|bBsbuMPZaa	i think you shoudl definitly tell him , he has the right to know cause its half his. let him know and give him the choice to be in the babys life or not. if he doesnt then move on and he doesnt have a part in raising a beauitful baby...and he cant come crawling back trying to be a part of its life when the kids like 10 cause that can be really emotionally hard for a child|`|UjJCW0goaa	i wish i could say that this was not happening a lot, but it is. and if hes going to be a prick about it, then f*** him girl. none of his bussiness    oh and send him to this site...  http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=How+...|`|3IXj7jQNaa	its your body,da as you wish. good luck|`|vk6sczbLaa	If you feel like it's the right thing to do, just call him and leave a (short and sweet) message that you're going to keep it. Then give him the option to step up and be the father, or stay away and never come into your life again if he's gonna be dumb about it. You'll find someone better that will be a real father to your baby.|`|9VYIxkLIaa	It's your body he can't make an decision for you although you can't make him be there you have to do what you feel in your heart is the best thing for you hopefully he will come to his senses but if he doesn't you need to be prepared for that your baby is a blessing girl you will be just fine.|`|JHSCDSaFaa	Him  not calling is not that odd to me. He probably doesn't know what t do. I don't know him. I can only tell you that a week is not as long as it seems. Take this time to realize if this is what you really want. Because as of now you are the one that will have to do it all, yourself. But a guy in his 30s not a big suprise he ran. Scares, lose of control, life flies before your eyes, does he wants kids. All sorts of questions run in both your minds. You can't force him to be a part of a babies life. All you can do is wait till he calls or until you are sure you want to keep the baby. Then wait till the three month term and contact him again. It will seem like forever to you, but realize this is a life decision. The least of your worries is an insecure man you love. Its more than about you two now. This is just my opinion. Email me if you need more help. Paulaa9705.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Forget him and make a life  for you and your baby.  You can do it. And don't look back.  He's an idiot.|`|FKf67HXaaa	you do need to tell him, but dont worry, if he doesn't help out with everything like go to doctors appt. with you then once the baby is born he is going to be the one feeling like a complete ******|`|1gJ92tJaaa	dont talk to him no more there is alot better guys out there. its not the babys falt. he should man up and be the best father that he can be.
BZg5TFlqaa	1. overprotective  2.smokes alot ( sorry i dont like kissin an ash tray)  3.horrible teeth  4.too arrogant  5. horrible kisser!!!|`|P3gwELLcaa	umm...thank you for letting us know...?|`|BDWX5bkQaa	depends on the person|`|LLgLPEPUaa	1. smoking  2. doesn't dress good  3. unintelligent  4. rude  5. always comlaining|`|Jwa3Znbfaa	1. bad breath/teeth   2. no makeup  3. bad clothes choice   4. tattoos   5. smoking|`|q9LxIdJzaa	1. smells bad  2. no sense of humor  3. alwasy serious  4. stupid  5. selfish

m2jeeo4Laa	My boyfriend was married and has a child, but his child was from a relationship before the marriage.  I actually get along good with the ex-wife, but his child's mother...not so much.  At first, she did everything in her power to "get rid of me", by telling lies, calling him about every little problem.  When she realized that I wasn't going anywhere, she started telling their child lies about her father.  The best thing to do is to stay out of it as best as you can.  It's hard to do this when he has to communicate with her about their child...but HE needs to set the boundries and enforce them.   If you buy her a gift, try to keep it at her dad's house.  Make sure that when she comes over, you spend time with her by doing fun projects together.  If she acts disinterested, you just start doing it right in front of her.  It worked for me.  She would pretend to ignore me, but after ten minutes or so, she would join in.  I wouldn't talk to much.    Just say things like pass the red crayon?  Then lead it up to things like I'd like to put this on the fridge help me put it up.  Make sure that you aren't showing your stress about her mom around her.  Kids pick up on that quick.  And hopefully, your boyfriend isn't saying things about ex either.  This can be super stressful, and if it's something that you don't feel like dealing with, no one will blame you for gracefully leaving until he can gain control over the situation.  Edit.  I also noticed that his child would get emotional over us being physical with each other.  You have to cater to that a bit, by not being all over each other.  And make sure that dad is giving her lots of hugs, especially if he gives you a hug or kiss.   Then, after she is more comfortable with you guys, and starts to see you a constant (if he's had girlfriends before around her, maybe she thinks you will leave too?), then she'll warm up.  You just can't expect her to right away.  It takes lots of time for some kids.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	that's why you don't have sex without a condom|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	i wouldn't like you either. some girl who is shacking up with my dad and taking up his time when he could be spending it with me.|`|iXTsCDWRaa	Well, thats very immature of the mother to do that. Speak to your boyfriend about this, I am sure he can help you in some sort of way. The girl should listen to her father as well. The mother is just being dumb and childish. It's not like you're still in high school and need all this stupid drama. Tell her to grow up and get her own life.
PMb7Db8Raa	You should definitely tell her. My friend had the same problem and he finally got the courage to tell her. They have been dating for three years and he might pop the question soon =) This is finally your chance. I hope it all works out for you in the end.
dyV5gDx3aa	The time will feel right and it will all happen when this time comes. Dont rush it but go with the flow of things and everything will happen accordingly!|`|gGE5TrFyaa	i waited one month. and no im not a nympho.|`|q9LxIdJzaa	don't do it.  you'll regret it.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	couple of months if your over 18|`|x4jZuA9Daa	Until you completely trust them... In love and know that its something you won't regret later.... You need to talk about all the consequences of doing it as well.....
qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes that would make him happy.|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	yeah that is a cute idea. best luck to both of you!!!|`|da2KJ9fXaa	sure that's a good idea, just make sure that he likes you first.|`|EFXT4rj2aa	yea|`|2c27e0995a08bf926614dc941ff77a61aa	Thats cool but the $15 dollar iPod gift might be kinda pricey for a kid.  But hey go for it!!!  Whats the worst could happen?  Good Luck!!|`|HfDHPbfRaa	$15? that's quite a hefty amount for just a crush. maybe just $10. even that's a lot. but good idea!|`|3glmptC7aa	i think its a cute and great idea.. i would maybe get a card to put the itunes card in that says how you feel with out having to say anything to him. so if he doesnt respond you know where you stand|`|rk8VogkWaa	It depends. are you trying to win him with this gift? if you are, i would recommend something a little more romantic like a heartfelt card and maybe a heart shaped box of chocolates but if it's just a friend thing, that is a great idea.|`|UBMTDMvaaa	eh i would definately think you are coming on a little strong for not dating him|`|H28ALuJsaa	Your thought is good..but is it really worth spending the $15 ?  Stick to the candy. A card would be nice. And i am sure if there is something between you both, you wil have several occasions where you wil be able to give him more stuff. but hey, if its the first time you both are exchanging gifts, keep it nice and sweet. and its really my point of view. Rest if upto you to decide. Good luck! and hopefully this valentines day comes out to be a memorable one for you (in a good way ofcourse).|`|TMi1GhSHaa	NOO WAAAYYY dont get him anything unless your dating him.. the MOST i would get a "crush" is a card and SOME candy.. but deffinitly not a 15 dolalr itune gift card.. thats alot lol.
elY5vkVyaa	You seriously don't know? :-$  Start simple with silk-scarf binds but if you want to get an idea of what's out there take a look at this web-store - 18+ Warning!  http://www.extremerestraints.com/bondage...|`|804d9265307b0187163e4c7e05636332aa	Bondage is tying someone up during sex to enhance sexual arousal. The one being tied is the "submissive" partner, and the one doing the tying is the "dominant" partner. In heterosexual couples, the male is usually dominant and the female is usually submissive, but not necessarily. Some couples switch roles, but with many the roles are fixed.
lNGGCEYtaa	It means he ties you up or you tie him up......... for sexual reasons. Not necessarily sex, but sexual situations.
pr40exIGaa	he cares a lot for you but has some other problems on his mind about being committed to you? maybe hes just afraid of something..but ultimately he loves you.    well that's how i feel towards some girl, my own faults and problems brought me down and felt unworthy and too afraid of what will happen.    but still i love her like nuts but we just ignore each other and do not know anymore haha|`|hkdP9Rtyaa	Because humans are weird towards their opposite sex. But hey, you can't live them and you can't live without them.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	maybe he doesn't want you to forget him and give up on him...maybe he wants a relationship with you after the custody thing is solved, when he has more free time...maybe he wants to have you but without you having the right to argue about him not dedicating enough time to you......I don't really know, it's kind of strange.....I would normally think he just wants to haveyou there incase he doesn't find anything better but I guess he wouldn't bother to call every day...|`|RgbARcJTaa	Think hes going throgh a rough time  Hes proably in loads of stress and   He said he would choose you  And he knows soon hes gonna want you back   This way he doesnt want to lose contact  So you cant find a reason why to reject him  ect  He wants to keep close so when the time comes   Your already there.|`|E2Yns4v0aa	forget him tell him he is the one that broke up with you and you and you are fed up with calls and texts and you want to try with other people and he should too.|`|q2H9jgDSaa	i don't know why.   haha i like the first person that answered this question though. :)|`|M7r7gHNGaa	He is too newly divorced to become involved in another relationship. He won't want to deal with any type of hassles or arguments because that just reminds him of what was bad about his marriage.    You are the rebound. That is not a good thing because rebounds don't usually last. He should get over his divorce and settle things emotionally concerning his little boy in this new relationship with him.     A divorced individual should just take things slowly and not get too involved with anyone else for about a year after the divorce. He/she needs to go through a period of mourning because no matter how nasty the divorce, at one time they were in love with that person they divorced. You rarely here of a widow or widower immediately getting involved with someone new right after losing their loved one.    He calls and texts or emails because he wants a friend to talk to about things like his work. Don't look for anything to change soon. If it does, you will be a reboundee and will get hurt.
F3LBgfvwaa	your question scares me|`|Wa1kwOHkaa	Let me just say that a 13 year old girl should not be dating.|`|3l7IkyX4aa	Popularity.  hey thats how Middle School is.  Dress nicely man  dont be  a BUM!
SP3a6fGiaa	confront her about it because maybe she likes you but you are slow as hell and she thought you didnt like her so she went out with the other guy|`|xJBJn6dOaa	It sounds like she did like you at one point, but that feeling passed when you never asked her out. When someone did ask her out, she jumped at the chance. She may still have feelings for you, but if they were strong enough, she wouldn't be going out with someone else. If you really care about her, you should talk to her about this.|`|L69jZMXQaa	yeah.. depends on how strong the feelings are|`|lVNYRSs8aa	she still has feelings for you    my guess is she got tired of waiting for you and is attempting to move on|`|kE2CuYP3aa	happening to me!!!!!! She has mixed feelings about u.I am dating this guy and he is the most AMAZING guy ever but im having mixed feelings about im.|`|GtgQqDyXaa	She probably still has feelings for you. And yes, a girl could date someone while still having feelings for another person, but that would be kind of like cheating.  ~He Passed Away :-(|`|STNnndJwaa	Yes it's possible lol.  Sometimes when i have a boyfriend..i'll have another HUGE crush on a different guy haha|`|EtstG6TMaa	its not a problem if nothing happens between you and her.. if you guys are just friends its fine (even if she likes you) .. but if something happens. like you kiss.. or shes cheating on her boyfriend then its a problem... so for right now.. if nothing happens between you two its okay =)|`|f8bd5677bcf38585dd6016bf3f2c4687aa	Yes, it's EXTREMELY common for girls to still like other guys than their boyfriend. Just start talking to her a lot and see where it goes from there.|`|ib10oHUZaa	clearly she had a crush on u n neva got to be with u so prob moved on....but it doesnt mean shes over u. she just needed 2 get ova u n is prob trying 2.|`|j48cLUiLaa	yeah. i had the same problem. if her and the boy isnt going ouy you should ask her out and try to win her heart over the other boy.(only if you like her.) you should have got ahead of the game and asked her out in y'all freshman year.
TFZZ2E0Gaa	Yes,I think so. Honesty is the best policy. Although,it is,truthfully,hard to be honest all the time or most of the time. But a guy who is honest will stand out to a girl. At least that's my opinion.|`|oKoABzNtaa	Yes, but it gets you in her friend zone.  There's too much competition from jerks who tell girls what they want to hear.|`|fhJtB39Taa	wiiiiiithout a doubt!.....the more honest.....the better|`|mIvVWFdmaa	yes , it's a breath of fresh air|`|P3gwELLcaa	Absolutely. Honesty is so hard to find these days and is suuuuchhh a huge turn on ha ha. I would pick an honest guy over a  smooth talker any day.   What do you mean by honest? Do you have an example?|`|cdANjmf2aa	yessss, but if your nervous about her reaction or dont wanna make her upset, choose your words carefully :D|`|HRXTcAxQaa	very much so. just don't say "you are fat" if she is fat.|`|ma1zKpdpaa	hell yea.|`|161d3765d7ef23bf06f3462bf7d62d61aa	sometimes its the best part :)|`|KJCwUW6Laa	definite yes. girls also like humor|`|O0pYOOpAaa	Brent go it right! Women tell you that, but they will still fall for the bad guy even though they are talking to a good guy at the same time.|`|xlbMRcesaa	YES!!!
iU4Q2GOdaa	ASK HER!    i cannot state this enough... NOONE can answer this question except her. and yes, it sounds like she likes you. so just do it.|`|78yvmiZ0aa	Grab and a good handful of her hair and pull.  do not stop pulling until she is in your bedroom.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	maybe she just feels that conection but keep talking to her

Its hard to explain but the guy usually is the one to start it the girl continues it if she is intrested.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	sex  what i would do to him if i was with him  he replies what he would do to me  we both get horny and touch ourselves lol|`|itYmX2t8aa	*I kiss your lips and rub your ******    Oh god that hurt to type out...Yucky.|`|kTvn2Nltaa	hahaha dont do it! it can only end up bad for you trust me! best case scenario, he doesnt show anyone the texts and he jacks off. No benefit to you at all. Worst case scenario, he shows everyone and you get the reputation of a slut...
uO8sFIuCaa	He asked you to dinner, but didn't profess his love for you...    Sounds like a nervous guy who isn't sure whether you like him, but has made the first move!    It would be incredibly hard for him to ask you to dinner AND say he likes you all at the same time, but I'm pretty sure, if it is just the two of you going out to dinner... then he's interested.    Just have a great dinner, and when it is finished, give him a kiss on the cheek as thanks... but make it linger a little... Kiss him on the cheek a little longer than a peck...    this length of physical contact should allow him to know you are interested enough in a non-threatening way.|`|ymHUs2aFaa	try to kiss him in the chicks first.. to see if whats the reaction|`|DklyEeTpaa	Give him a signal or some kind of hint that you want him to kiss you. Just tell him to make things easier.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Say it with your eyes. Eyes say A LOT!! lol-|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You kiss him, guys are dense, this one may be shy|`|fsddd1paaa	Why don't YOU kiss HIM? I thought guys like a girl with confidence.|`|uRQEubkPaa	Don't be afraid to be close to him  Have as much physical contact as possible...  You can start by hitting him gently on his arm when he says something dumb, or teases you...  When you talk to him, look at his eyes and slightly turn your sight to his lips... do that constantly.|`|B7idbFNVaa	Well, you just have to ask if you want to go out on a date.  And go to some live band event where they play slow song, and see if he wants to slow dance with you.|`|drHEPb1aaa	kiss him first =)    go for it|`|ENyb91iKaa	i find that glancing at the person's lips then back at their eyes works pretty well|`|6o6Ao1Paaa	Simple. Tell him to look into your eyes. He should know that when a girl want a guy to look into her eyes mean that the girl want the guy to kiss her.|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	omg, i've been in this same situation. What girl hasn't tho?  Honestly, this one guy I was into on the first date, I leaned over the table, and propped my chin on my hand, while he was talking about something, and started to bite my lip a little, and when he looked up at me, his eyebrows raised, and he admitted later on that he wanted to jump my bones when he saw that.(we've been dating for three years,lol)|`|jpmDjFNeaa	No make sure that he is interested in you. Which he should since I doubt he asked you on a date for no reason but just be playful and be like are you ever going to kiss me. But in a laughy silly way. Not in a serious way because youll scare him! But maybe you should just go with the flow! Good luck.|`|8ZARrsnXaa	have a huge flashing psychedelic sign that says KISS ME NOW!!! haha j/k...nah just keep laughing @ his jokes even if there not funny, be in a fun mood, flirt and lead but not to much, then your kiss should come before you even no it. =)|`|AA11494685	If he has asked you out to dinner it means he wants to know you better.  If he asks you out again and again it means he likes you.  Listen to him talk and watch how he behaves and if you feel he suits you, then you have nothing to worry about.  Going out with him will tell him that you are interested in him and the kissing part will eventually follow.
6SxVuHjNaa	did`nt u ask that question before and i answered that question already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|MEr99qKraa	if u pay as much attention to ur school work as u do thai i suspect u'll go far....ur to immature to be dealing with stuff like this..wait til ur older
CgwEfwOZaa	a hug.      since you guys JUST started dating, I wouldn't worry about this v-day.|`|KVd8aKDoaa	The thing he would enjoy the most would be a *******.  A good one.  Don't waste your money on a plushy teddy bear he'll throw away.  blooooowwwww|`|5gBhIrQSaa	A bear [:|`|zrStxob6aa	oooh that's so tough. hmm. well i say a mix cd's generally safe because last year i was in a similar situation... but i don't know what else.  good luck though!
SupWrLRIaa	She is somewhat insecure because she is dating a guy who A has a connection with his Ex that will never be broken (the baby) and B declined to notify her of that. Her response, infantile as it is, has been to try and debase you such that she can feel like you have no chance in hell and she therefore no longer has to feel insecure about him going back to you.     As for how to respond, you have no options. Let me repeat: No. Options. Walk away from the situation, don't talk to her, don't listen to her, most certainly stop getting on her Myspace. You cannot win that fight. It will never happen, and the only thing that can come from it is a divide between you and your baby's father (and consequently, far worse, between your baby and its father).    I get that its frustrating and humiliating and degrading but the fact is that you started it. You came to her trying to upset his new thing with the baby comment (admit it, you didn't do it for the love of his new squeeze, you did it because u were upset) and now you have gotten what you wanted: she is upset and insecure, as you expected, only her response isn't what you expected.    The whole situation is bad, for everyone involved. The only thing you can do now is ignore her until either she loses interest or he does. And remember, he checks her myspace too. If he finds his blushing beauty bitching about his ex who hasn't spoken to her in six months she may not look very good :). She who laughs last laughs loudest.|`|F3S8BASyaa	ok...  for one, she needs to get over herself.    and for another, you are the bigger person by backing off and not doing anything.  Just remember that hoes come and go.  hehe!  not tlkin bout u!  if all she wants to do is sleep with him, then most likely that relationship will probably not last, and if he doesnt have the guts to stand up to her then right now i would probably say that he is not man enough for you.  you are keeping ur part, and he needs to crack down on her.  has he even read any of her comments on myspace?  I wouldnt bring them to his attention until he makes the choice not to stand by your side.  you are his baby's mom!  so there for he should try to see that your son has more weighing on him not tlking to you than getting into bed with the hoe|`|CuqU523Paa	she's an immature idiot and just has to fall flat on her face before she'll be able to get over it.  just ignore her, or if you really feel the need, be really nice and wish her luck with your ex... and his baby (that should drive the point home that the baby will be a part of her life now too, if you and the dad have joint custody)

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I've heard statistics that about 80% of people will have sex before marriage. I think part of the reason for that is more and more people have a negative opinion about marriage. Having been raised in a divorced home and having gone through a divorce myself, I don't see any real importance to getting married.     I can respect that you want to save it for marriage. As long as you're doing it for you, rather than because someone told you that's what you're supposed to do.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	I think marriage is sacred and only one man should be with one woman. Most adhere to this because of the guided teachings in the bible. And, you are not alone while some maintain their purity.. even if they decide never to marry. Its more about our bodies being the temple not to be used for sin  than anything else.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Marriage is just a stupid legal bond... doesn't mean sh!t to me. Having said that, that doesn't mean I'm going to go out and do it with whoever.|`|rhreN8wbaa	I wish I had. so so so badly|`|VzsEEhRhaa	I'm 18, a guy...and have a girlfriend of 2 and 7 months...were both virgins and i dont pressure her into it, a real, true, nice guy....i think we are my friend...i think we are...='[|`|ZVfxJacvaa	I'm a girl, 19 and still a virgin. I do believe it's good to wait and I am going to too. I'm proud of it. Most people these don't don't even believe in getting married. I how on the other hand, I believe there is omsone for everyone and you were only meant for each other. Why do peolpe need to sleep around anyway? Sex is so much more when you're truly and honestly in love. I have to say, that is really awesome you're still a virgin.|`|IMpnREJqaa	Im waiting! Im 17. I have a lot of reasons.     im a Christian and I know God created sex specifically for marriage     If i had sex now i know the relationship  probably wouldnt last and i would feel used.    i believe that when you have sex with someone you are giving them control over you not only physically but also emotionally, and i dont feel comfortable with anyone having that control over me unless they have commited the rest of their life to me.|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	I didn't wait for marrage but I don't regret losing my virginity to my one and only love (we've been together now for 2 and a half years) I thought a lot about keeping it until marrage for your exact same reasons but I decided that if I was ready before and knew that I would be with him for a long time then I would go for it.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	you are not the last breed. there are lots and lots of them like you in this world. don't worry about it. :)|`|Pg3voqXkaa	It's good to hear you're not giving into it and waiting until marriage.  Not many people do.      I waited until I knew this guy was the one, the one I knew and sure I would marry.  And although I didn't wait until wedding night, I'm glad I waited for the right person.  It just makes it that much special.|`|CCqqTw6paa	what makes you think your future wife will be intact?|`|WDZgG4wfaa	what!? hell no!|`|eF92uM2Saa	I have 2 nephews that I'm positive are planning to wait until marriage.

So, you aren't alone.|`|lrfdnhsjaa	Im going to, so your not a dying bread.            :)|`|mNDimov6aa	oh snap! doood i dont wana tell you what ur doing is wrong cause its ur own personal choice and all but i feel like its a must to do it a few times before marriage. you should be able to please ur wife on her wedding night and make it an really good experience. u dont wana go up in that room all nervous and sucking at it and shes pissed off cause she didnt get anything out of it and u just busted a nut and she busted nuttin' playa get er done|`|3WfAOPD9aa	    Can I commend you on your decision? We may very well be a dying breed, but that doesn't mean we should cave in like the rest. Virginity is a very special thing no matter what others say..... I'm 22. :)|`|UXNXntARaa	You're not alone. Although it may seem like everyone is doing it, there are plenty of people who aren't, they just aren't advertising it in the same way your sexually active classmates are, or there are some who are saying they've done it and they haven't.  There are plenty of reasons to wait until marriage (or at least until you find out more about your partner) far outweigh any reasons there would be to do it before you establish a strong relationship with your partner.|`|nGR3IfgXaa	yes im 18 and a virgin till marriage!  and im saving it because of religion purposes its a Sin to fornicate  and i Do Not plan in going to Hell so thats a huge reason why  and because i believe it is special and shouldn't be given out right away to someone just because.|`|OXcApjPzaa	There is a reason religion is dying in our society.   Making people "wait until marriage for sex" ... isnt the best way to lure people to religion.   God is going to have to start making some compromises and update the bible. More people will believe in him than  what do now.|`|hubrdh3Vaa	No, why on Earth would we?|`|07YBD5mJaa	society devalues marriage. It's pretty sad, we have more teenage mothers, more adolescent students infected with a sexually transmitted disease, and higher divorce rates today than ever before in our society. imagine our future, when these 16 year old parents teach their child that it's alright to have sex out of wedlock...children will be having babies even younger. When 12 is the average age to become a parent, then we know our world is screwed.|`|DklyEeTpaa	Never get married unless you are prepared and know what you are doing!! Only if you really bond with your gf|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	how would she know?|`|hxG4zLX5aa	it's all about who you associate with.  there are still plenty of people who wait.  if you believe it's the best and most personal gift, then stick with it.  when you're out of high school, you'll be away from that crowd anyway.
SupWrLRIaa	You are mad because you feel like he is leaving you behind. You wish you could go and do those things with him, but since you can't you feel like he is being forced to go without you. Somewhere inside you are beginning to wonder if he wouldn't rather find someone he can do that stuff with NOW rather than having to wait, which is exasperated by having him in a situation you don't fully understanding, not having been there, with people you do not know. You are transliterating that insecurity to anger because anger is a very safe emotion, easily understood.     His sad faces and such are an attempt to show you that he loves you and that he isn't going out to replace you. He senses your insecurity and is attempting to mollify it, but it isn't working because you haven't acknowledged the insecurity in the first place.    Now for part two, what to do about it. You need to work this out either by yourself or with him and get to a place where you realize the truth. If he wanted to be with someone else, he would be. He is with you because he loves you and he wants to be your lover. It isn't fair to either of you to let your insecurity and anxiety get in the way of that. Just talk it over with him, explain how you feel. Try to remain as calm as possible; the point isn't to vent, it is to show him that you are being hurt by this situation.    Don't expect him to stop going out - that is not a reasonable request. He has friends who he wants to spend time with, and that is the prerogative of any human being. If you attempt to interfere with that, you will ruin things.     Instead, talking to him will let you get everything out in the open, and give him a chance to respond and reassure you. That should help you start to move through and past these issues.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	You shouldn't be mad. Why should he have to miss out just because you are underage. That is just how it will be for now. He is just out with the boys, nothing to worry about. Controlling behaviour like this will eventually lead to him resenting you if you try to stop him from living his life.|`|wWzO9xARaa	maybe he could have his friends over at his house instead or something, that way you could join in, but you have to understand sometimes guys need time with the guys.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	youre insecure|`|0HFL3vocaa	maybe ur just a little insecure or mad at tha fact that he's going out without you but you and your girls should all go to an 18 and older club while he's out with his guys that way you wont be bored or be thinking about him all night being mad|`|6qDoUZUAaa	i think that you just want to see him and you miss the attention. Thats why my last girlfriend broke up with me, and i kick myself just thinking about it but just let him know you miss him because if my ex had told me i would be oh so damn happy    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1785549 6dzz5z5...|`|b6oepGdsaa	aw my bfs 21 and im also 18  geta fake id!! haha|`|MTkpXsOPaa	You are probably mad because you think about how much trouble 6 guys could get into exspecially when there girlfriends are not around. And maybe he did someting to make you not fulling trust him Suggest maybe a party or something that you can be involved in. But you still have to trust him once in while to go out its part of the fun of being 21. Youll get there and understand more. Maybe you could get in being the DD that works sometimes it all depends on the bar.|`|BadVazMGaa	Well your probably mad because of the fact that you can't be with him when he's is out having fun with his friends.Your also probably mad because he's having fun.Honestly i would be pissed too. My boyfriend is 18 and im 16.It pisses me off when he ask to go to parties or just even places with his friends. Maybe we are just jealous people..Or maybe it's just a thing girls feel. You should try and hangout with your girlfriends and try and him jealous..kk bye.   gudluk.|`|drHEPb1aaa	yeah agreed u seem insecure.. hugs
TCrV5hsyaa	It can mean "you look good"..    Or it can mean "I want you back"..    Or it can mean "I am horny"..    Or a combination of the three ;)

UGKyGDbMaa	I guess it seems romantic in the movies when I guy says that he will wait for a girl and put his life on hold for her, but in real life, it does seem like a pretty desperate thing to say to a girl who just told you that she is not interested in you. Bottom line: it doesn't really matter what you told her. if you said you would wait, it's not like you really have to follow through with it. this girl doesn't seem to care too much about you so stop worrying about her, just look for other options, who cares what you said to her, she can think whatever she wants.
8CWBIKRZaa	Haha I liked how you made people think you were going to jump and go suicide or something.    Yea you should! As long as you can swim then there is no way you could die from jumping off a diving board.

sjDGLQBfaa	most guys i know are into girls with curves.   guys like gils with something to grap onto, not those girls who look they they havent eaten in a year. and besides if your built like kim kardasian you've got nothing at all to worry about.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Kim has a nice body but her butt is too much for a skinny white boy like me.|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	The wide hips means she can support the weight of a baby easier, so the baby will be healthier.    The upper body curves means there's more room for the breasts to enlarge, and thus she can feed the baby more, so the baby get's healthier.    Also if her body is full and not malnourished..well you know where I'm going..|`|AA11447210	Some do, some don't...people have various preferences. It's an individual thing more than a 'white' thing.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	some do some dont    i personally love it|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	no us white men like skinny twig ********* e s lmfao. no dude. it really depends on the person. id bone kim kardashian in a heartbeat|`|igkbUflbaa	WhoTF is kim kardashian??!!??    All guys are different, as for me, it depends on the personality, well, actually on the ability to tolerate me; which is rare. But, since were dealing with steriotypes, Id' say that a certin class, yes, and another class, no.|`|DHapsa7Daa	"Race" has nothing to do with likes or dislikes.  Unless, it's religion.  I know a Mexican guy who likes white girls better.  Which suprised me.
0xR5UNRpaa	I would be totally pissed that it was like a game to him.
9h29IH22aa	no
bNjjC8jMaa	yes...Where has the world gone to?...
DytfqrkSaa	I would move on, but still be friends with her. When you say "Her friends said"...thats where you messed up. Don't listen to a girl's friends, get all information from HER mouth, go up to her and ask her about it, it shows confidance and maturity, and let's her know that you don't like the middle school games. Now this dosent mean that you shouldnt be friends with her, I would still try to be friends with her, but don't pursue her at all, that will probably get your *** kicked or just into trouble. So just be friends.|`|E6lcqBReaa	That really sucks.    The maker of this website really knows how to get over a girl.

Oh well next time don't wait too long.
LJkPRqN0aa	you need to ask her, how would we know the answer if we dont even know you?|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Smile a little more. Get their IM and communicate via internet until they get to know your real personality. Could be that you are kind of stern in person when you are nervous. I'm like that. The guys I end up with I started out doing lots of IM (because of distance or work schedules). You need to develop a strategy to access the girls you like so come up with something or you'll miss lots of fun dating years.|`|XwyR8uHCaa	ask her|`|che6yXYNaa	ask her why and click her  http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1780845 6dzz5z5...|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Its something new that doesn't usually happen. By asking its not going anywhere but if you think necessary then you should confront her directly and try to understand and acknowledge the counter parts needs.|`|u2USmGcMaa	Ask her. Make a move and get a girlfriend! :)|`|r3te0Bwkaa	ask her|`|Z8WGDv5paa	well...do you treat girls like ****?  are you mean?  are you sarcastic..which you think is funny but maybe offensive?  are you really attractive?  are you shy?  are you really tall?  are you assertive?  these could all be really good questions to ask yourself, I dont know you but maybe you can figure it out or give me more info.|`|zvbjtfayaa	confront her|`|5fjbNeVNaa	because she has you on a pedistool...thats why|`|J2myCXE5aa	just ask her.     see what she says     (:    good luck.|`|GhtqGf6jaa	maybe its becuase you're really attractive, or smart or something.  for example, i have a friend that likes a guy but finds it impossible for him to like her becuase hes, i quote. "too hott" sounds dumb to me, but i guess|`|FTvhr9fLaa	I'm 18 and never had a boyfriend. =(    guys say they're intimidated by me. although im not sure why.|`|3wyk6dL3aa	it depends, maybe she feels intimidated because she like you and she wants you to ask her out. Try asking her if she is and make a move. you might get your first girlfriend! Good luck! :)  Hope i helped!
fP46meSmaa	I wouldn't be worried,even if she says no,she's not gonna drop you as friend(good friends are to hard to come buy).Hope she says yes though.Good luck.**
MQVmh5hiaa	Just stay with dylan because if you break up with him for matt you will regret it. like they say you dont relise wat you have till its gone.|`|KkOzs2Czaa	wow.    That's all i gotta say is WOW.  srry cn't help.|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	Well, if you really don't like Dylan maybe you should just tell him. You can't just hurt the poor guy like that. Is he doing the same to you? I say you should just break up with him before you hurt him.|`|zyoGZ3sxaa	stop middle school play dating. its so immature. be serious.|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	I think you should stay with Dylan and live the other guy out of it.

I DID. HURRAY FOR DILDOS|`|vxjOpKruaa	I think that you should stay with Dylan. You guys have only gone out for a week and a half. See how things go after maybe a month. The first week i went out with my boyfriend, I always thought about breaking up with him and I'm so glad that I didn't because we've been together for two months and have never been happier.  Life is great with him and I don't even know what I was thinking.    See how things go with you and him, I think that things are gonna work out. And I think you should just see what happens. Besides it's almost Valentine's Day, you should at least stay with him until that day.    You may even forget about Matt. you never know.|`|i8Cbh88jaa	ignore the other guy and stop flirting with him, if your not intrested him. if you are, break up with 'dylan' and go for the other guy.|`|dYChNv3Vaa	Break up with the guy if you don't want to be with him, it's messed up to lead people on.|`|AA12159454	If you don't like dylan anymore, then end it with him, if you really like this other guy, matt then ask a friend to ask him without being suspicious.  Ask him out depending on what your freind says.  If you really like someone and you think they like you dont miss out on it.|`|YPVLgV3baa	well i'd just get to know dylan more because who wants to end up being called a **** when its not true?!  not saying you are but people are assholes and will probably think that.i know how you feel.that happens to me sometimes...but now i finally found another boy who i really really like...so if you want maybe tyou should talk matt and see whats going on...you dont want to be dating someone you dont want anymore and if that happens to you then hes definatly not the right guy...|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I think you should either stay with Dylan and give it a chance to really go or just take a break for a while and reorganize  your relationship priorities...there is more to dating than switching boyfriends constantly and going after every guy you see and ending up in rediculous drama.|`|fea8051740e0d43c1361441741cb9e53aa	dont talk to matt|`|tPdwmZKzaa	haha go out with dylan lol|`|bSQgVqtiaa	Yeah I'm a boy so Ive got plenty of those|`|6504db2beca110ba901f2a4cf63625ccaa	ST0P SWITCHiN FR0M B0Y 2 B0Y BEF0RE U GET Y0URSLEF IN SERI0US TR0UBLE 0R END UP BR0KEN HEARTED U NEVER KN0W WH0S THE 0NE F0R U IF U KEEP LAYIN GUYS 0FF SWEETiE.|`|ZGLokR96aa	well, i guess you should stick with Dylan.

No offense(: just pick who you think is cuter!|`|3hzswoExaa	dats da way gys r|`|zUhYQyUNaa	!?!?! wait til u find the right guy.|`|4Q9UFjK2aa	do whatever makes you happy.|`|evEYVoqMaa	try telling him wat you feel is he cute keep him if he is i went  blue once green once i went orange once i went pink once i have gone alot of colors|`|o3ECMDqXaa	maybe you should confront this Matt dude and ask him straight up if he likes you, and if ur bf gets suspicious than just say that u didn't want Matt interfering in ur relationships and if ur not feeling OK w/  ur bf then u should tell him ur uncomfortable!|`|y4qNVFxYaa	well dylan is your boy friend  so why would he be jealous?  but if i understand what you are saying then  yea i think your boy friend is jealous if you and matt  are always flirting you are his girl  and i say you just set limits for yourself and stay away  from him especially if he has a girl friend it can cause her  promblems with you as well as her having promblems with him.  and if you dont like dylan then just break up with him.  but dont go for matt either just be friends with him  and dont be a mayjor flirt cuz his girl friend might get mad  if she finds out just try to do what is right and countinue  your life with out neither of them or just being friends :)  i hope this helps :)|`|C4Wlly1waa	first of all....  who do you like more Dylan or Matt?  second, you are already going out with Dylan and Matt has a gf.  so stop right there, dont think anything more of it than harmless flirting.  if it turns out that Matt really likes you back and wants to be with you and dumps his gf then you have a problem.  Ignore you're friends when it come to things like that cuz i've realized that friends can be more hurtful than helpful cuz they could be jealous themselves.  if you're bf is jealous then he needs to talk to you about it. But if it turns out hes is truly jealous then maybe he has a reason to be since you do like matt and are flirting with him. think about what you're doing.|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	Do whatever you want.

AA11542500	You know, sometimes you have to meet a lot of geese before you meet the swan.  It's really up to you though.  Your chances are greater if you do both online and RL but you have to go with what you're comfortable doing.  I've met my share and then some of duds online but that doesn't change my opinion of where I am going to meet someone.  I keep my options open even though it may seem kinda pointless at times which I'm assuming you're thinking that about online dating now.  Anyway, my advice, is just do what you feel comfortable doing, maybe take a break from meeting people online but I wouldn't shut it out completely because you'll never know where or when you'll meet that great guy you're looking for.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	well it is up to you not me so decide|`|Midbg5BJaa	Windmill Jouster has it here!    No risk-= no reward.    Sometimes you just gotta take the knocks...|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	i just joined a few dating sites. if things work out well on line. i wold say this. if they are real then have them prove it. im worried myself but what do i have to lose. give me some info on how things are going so i can see if this is worth it.sorry for your bad luck|`|HjoDyiUnaa	Well one of my friends met her bf online & he is awesome & they have been dating for a year.I met my ex online(he went to my school though) & he wasn't weird.We both met them on myspace.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Life is about risk. If you don't put a bet on the table, you'll never win any pots. Meeting on line is just one tool, just one way to meet people. But it shouldn't be the ONLY way. I know some people who have met on line, dated, and married happily for several years.    You can meet nice people, and you can meet freaks and weird-o's wherever you go. You just have to use your best judgment and take your chances sometimes.|`|JukGKm2paa	well as that saying it goes threes somebody out there for everyone  but i think your shouldn't meet them online get out of the house meet a guy don't meet freaks online
drHEPb1aaa	talk to him about it.. dont break it off over text.. BAD... call him and say it nicely.. like u dont think things are working out and orther stuff u wanna addd...and if u still wanna be friends.. ask him, but dont expect him to be goood with it.. ya never no.. he mite be feelin the same.. but too afraid to hurt u.. good luck.. the sooner the better =) the longer the wait.. the more stress|`|Q27cXlGbaa	just tell him you dont wanna keep doing this if its going no where and thats how it seems to you.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	This is the problem with "friends with benefits" relationships. One person takes it as being just that and the other wants it to mean or develop into something more.    If the situation isn't working for you, just call it off. If you feel like you have to say something about it, just tell him you thought you would be ok with a no strings sexual relationship, but you've come to realize you can't do it.|`|GLQL2IEaaa	slowly loose contact.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	just stop answering the phone and texts. you don't owe him any explanation. that's what FWB is about: no committment.|`|hj1qszQtaa	Just stop calling him.  If he calls you, don't answer.  When he finally goes out of his way to contact you in person, tell him, "i'm sorry, I just got tired of waiting on you to show some interrest".  See what happens from there.  If it ends there, it just ends.  It wasn't meant to be.|`|PoTY8CNFaa	Your probably never good at expressing yourself. What does "this relationship is going now-where" mean? You mean nowhere? This guy should break up with you
alowAmfqaa	Take it from someone who was just like him.     He just needs companionship and ANY GIRL will do. If some other girl is willing to spend time with him, you would not even be on his mind.    The faster you get rid of him the better off you will be.    "I hope you will take my advice?" hahahaha|`|bljEhh86aa	of course he want sex but sounds like he loves you too, so just wait cause if he love you like you know he does he would be willing to wait since he waited all this time.|`|2nqmoerIaa	He misses you obviously so give him another chance but dont have sex best if luck Dom K|`|RiLqR2r8aa	let him chase for a  week or 2...then meet him and suss it out!!!    take complete control darling!!!    wrap him around your finger ;)|`|cAPf4kdIaa	btw today is wedsday. you did the right thing telling him what you did. and i agree he should try harder.|`|D6Z2rYqsaa	all you can do is give him a chance.  but when he put "cuz i miss you?" its not that he didnt know, its because you were acting weird. and if u wana try it with him again, then you shouldnt be like "try harder hehe". because u never know if he really likes you or not, so dont blow it before you find out.|`|jmzKBenBaa	he put a question mark because he thought it was an obvious answer. Give him a try. Maybe he has changed and if he hasn't slap him and walk away|`|7zMMXmfWaa	your question was too long. i didn't want to read the whole thing.|`|uGVOB8Z1aa	jese lady obviously he likes you.....do u even like him, if you dont, you did a right thing.|`|AA11178598	Stop stressing- go have dinner with him.  It's just dinner- it's not rocket science my love.  You're over complicating it- he wants to see you.  If you enjoy his company- see him.  If you don't... don't.  Very simple- like most of life.    Slainte,      -Dan|`|TphtpnPraa	well it sounds like he still likes you. misses you alot  and also seems as if he wants to try again..  play it out see what he really wants from you..  i mean if you like him..why not go for it again.|`|T9VFEZVEaa	honest?    you have to be honest with yourself first.  If you don't want to see him and were "honest" you would have simply said, "no."      Try being honest.  Write down what you really think when you're alone.  Then write down what you ought to tell him about what you really think.  (Being tactful, does not mean compromising.)  Then DO IT.  That will be the end of the matter.    If you can't do that, ask yourself why.  maybe you're not as honest with either yourself or you ex-bf as you think you are.|`|mBx14UR8aa	I reckon this is a total booty call.  Hes obviously trying to make it seem likes hes very sweet and loving.  And the reason he put the question mark was probably because he didnt know why you were asking.  Now MSN is a very dangerous place to organise things as, it might not be him, just his friends playing a trick. Or you dont know if he means it as a joke because you cant hear how hes saying these things. I suggest you dig a little deeper, maybe talk to him on the phone to suss out if this is real, and if it is..  theres only one thing to do..      Play hard to get ;)|`|iKJycf6Zaa	He wants to see you, but he also wants to see if you have the same feeling. It looks like he doesn't want to be the only one trying to get together. He wants you to be excited. More than that he wants you to take the step. That's why he gives you a taste of him and he backs off. So now its up to you, if you are interested in being his gf again. I would do this, I would definitely initiate getting back together and than make him realize. But if you are not interested than just let it go.|`|xhmUsuDjaa	i think you should give him a chance and see him. he must miss you if he asks for your number and wants to see you. guys are hard to read sometimes. and while your out with him make sure he understands that this is just to hang out (unless you want it to be more than that) . it's good that you asked him why he wants to see you so bad, that question mark to me doesn't mean anything, probably to emphasize tha want to see you part. wish u the best of luck ^.^
iJOKKfdIaa	I totally just answered this question.... do you still have feelings for him??? if so just go out with him but if he like has a girlfriend don't just stay away cause he is a playa
XkYhr4Vlaa	Im sure your not ugly hun. Everyone goes through things at different times. My fab 5 friends and I were totally far apart on the stages from first boyfriends to kissing to the real thing. Dont worry, It takes time in high school. Trust me...your on track. You'll get a boyfriend. be happy for your friend, be there for her...then when it happens to you...she will do the same... This is high school. ONLY  4 yrs....have fun. Not tooo much though. If you go to 2 different schools ofcourse your not going to know the news first. You'll have different friends, different classes, not to mention two different people. Dont worry.....our time will come, and when it does....it will be crazyy....Have fun girl|`|jqKbyzQdaa	dont worry..im actually going through the same situation. im in the 9th grade too! and my friend actually has 2 GUYS AFTER HER! yea...and now she doesnt even care about me so consider yourself lucky :)    and just wait...the right guy WILL come|`|01wTbVEMaa	Seriously? You should be happy for her. Just because she has a boyfriend and you don't doesn't mean no one likes you or your ugly. The right guy will come sooner or later, trust me :D|`|N53oHiwNaa	dont worry your only in grade 9...just go with the flow girl :) youll be fine and dont rush things|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be happy for you friend now.  I am sure that there will be a perfect guy who would love to go out with you in the future.|`|3ijLQe5laa	its okay. in life people grow apart. it happens babe! just think of all the friends that you will meet in your life...your only what? 14 or 15, your not ugly unless you say your ugly. people will think of you in the way that you think of yourself, remember that!|`|CA9OFT4Waa	for all you know he is really ugly and some freak. dont sweat over it, its not big deal, someone will come by for you, heck youre only in 9th grade! just dont dwell on it its not that important but i would talk to her and be like listen we use to be really good friends,( best friends you said? ) and i thinks its really shady just because we went to different schools and havnt been as close as we once were that you couldnt even tell me you had a boyfriend and let her know whats up, shell never know that it bothers you unless you tell her, trust me.|`|G85fgFDLaa	you are just young. stop crying over it.|`|xvwyv7Gdaa	You will be fine!  Dont hate on your friend, be happy for her.  your turn will come, i promise|`|3f4jZwLlaa	the same thing happened to me and i am younger than you. just be happy for your friend.

Guys and so afraid to ask her out bc shes beautiful. Ever think that maybe THATS y?|`|5WB2yZUFaa	awww, i'm sure you're very pretty! what do you mean no one likes you? are you talking about guys, or people in general? i can imagine how you feel right now. i'm totally AD-HD and i don't take meds, so my mind races all the time, especially when i'm upset. it sounds like you have low self-esteem. take some time out and write like 10 things you like about yourself. what are you good at? do you have a great sense of style? are you a good friend? an artist? a musician? a good listener? are you compassionate? i'm sure there are a hundred great qualities you have. just hang in there, sweetie. high school is the most awkward time of your life, but you'll get through it, i promise! but you should be happy for your friend!|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	just wait it out. i didnt get a boyfriend until the summer going into 10th grade ;)|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	You are in the 9th grade. You really need to relax and calm down. I wouldn't reccomend getting into a relationship at your age anyway.   Don't compare yourself to your friends. It doesn't matter if they all have boyfriends and you don't. You should be the smart one. All that matters is that you love yourself and have great self esteem.   If you feel you are a quiet person, then try socializing more. Take more risks, go up to people you don't know, etc.  You will grow out of that quiet shy phase over time, don't worry.  Good luck.|`|xlbMRcesaa	OMG THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... weird, okay so i got really worried, but I wouldn't if i were u. I'd just flirt a lot, it makes you feel better. and u never no, maybe a guy will notice ur intense flirting skills ;)|`|jrl6d9g7aa	Dont rush it sweet heart there is someone out there for everyone. When it's time the right guy will come along and he'll be all urz then someone else can hate on u! lol|`|PrlXK1fEaa	no you really should not think that way  you should be happy for your friend and hope/pray yours would come to.    ive come to realise that because your going through a tuff time doesnt mean your friend should be in that situation to.  just be happy for.dont be envious it makes you look bad and im pretty sure your not.You just want a boyfriend which understandable.    like i said.Be happy for your friend.|`|38l8GnItaa	she just grew up everyone goes thru this at sum point, don't feel bad thinking ur falling behind, everyones is diff. and has their own time to go thru things, i'm sure ur not ugly or a horrible person or n e thing like that, just wait for it and it'll happen to you too :)|`|8YJeQdlqaa	yeah i understand how you feel. but honestly, would you like a guy for your LOOKS or your personality; you said you're quiet. from my experience, don't rush into a relationship, or the thoughts of having a boyfriend, trust me, SOMEONE out there thinks you are very very very attractive, remember that. and i know you'll get all the same replies from people, but seriously, it's true. you're in grade 9, have fun! once you have graduated, you'd wish for all of it back. you have LOTS of time for boyfriends. just wait, the right person will come along :)  and as for your friend, i'm sorry. depending on how far away she is, you should call her and tell her you don't want to grow apart from her. meet up and catch up on each other! :)|`|MmIYDoGkaa	First you need to calm down.Then you need to make more friends, but still remember and cherish the memory of your old one.Then when  you are ready...get a boyfriend, or as girls say it a BF.After that your life will be back to normal.|`|mYMjDgdhaa	your still young people CHANGE my friend was the same way quiet never had a gf and the next thing i know he had a kid after a year, dont worry ur time will come|`|7KO7t17paa	dont worry   lots of guys like you   you just dont know it  go to school and try to pay attention to the guys looking at you  for you friend she will tell you   and you should be happy for her   also have her hook you up wit a guy then you can double date  but dont ever say you ugly   it cause more thing then you think   i know people who convinced their selves they were so ugly they try killing themselves  now she has a boyfriend lots of other guys wanting her    im NOT saying try to kill yourself just keep an open mind|`|c2O4Cn7Jaa	Its normal to compare yourself to your friend just because she is dating does not mean you are ugly. If you are ready to date smile a little more and maybe make some friends with boys in your class. Boys that age are just as nervous as you.|`|ymAOyewwaa	you need hto have confidence with your self if you want to be noticed. remember. its ok its no big deal that ur bff has a bf. your time will come sista. just be patient. trust me. this happened to me too and then i got more confident and things turned out fine for me.|`|3Rq86sYYaa	Well call her and talk to her about it and ask her why she didn't tell you she had a BF! Also looks aren't everything to a guy, personality is a big part too. Don't just sit back, ask her to hook you up with one of his friends lol.|`|08C2DIE0aa	aw.. okay so first thing you need to do is boost up ur slef confidence,  and number 2, people start their relationships at different ages.. i have a bestfriend too, we both go to different schools, and shes pretty and very outgoing! im usually quiet and shy. i've always expected her to get a boyfriend first and she did in 9th grade, but they dated for 2 days. and in 11th grade, i started dating my man and we've been together for soo long and yes he was my first. and my best friend still hasn't found anyone yet. soo maybe now you can tell that different things happen at different times for different people..=)  and seriously, ur personality makes up you, not ur features. so i hope you feel better =)|`|H7XOsgRCaa	shes just moving on faster then you are its ok your time well come,..  and my opinion you don't want to rush into relationships     LOVE SUCKS|`|gv9X0LeQaa	I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, GIRL!!  my two best friends in the world have boyfriends and i dont. it sucks balls but you just have to be confident in yourself and know that it will happen eventually.|`|2ZiIiO7Raa	Its ok take a deep breathe and be happy for your friend don't worry about having a boyfriend i did i freaked and thought i was ugly but then i started looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself things that made me feel better! (i know its sounds vain but try telling yourself your beautiful in the mirror.) I understand that your a quiet person but you do needto work up a little nerve and talk to at least one guy.|`|FQMtow2caa	look i went though the same thing your goin though it seems lyk all them boys are flirtin with all the pretty lite skined gurls that have the *** in stuff not sayin sum of those things u dnt got but thats the way it is but i found out dnt worry about ppl nd wat they say about u becuz ppl goin to tlk about u til the day u die ! so thats never goin 2 change nd every1 has there flaws nd jus becuz ppl put u down dnt flow nd dnt feel lyk u got 2 change u to be sum1 notices !  but sumday lyk wen ur 25 ther goin 2 be the 1s lookin ugly nd u goin 2 be sexy as hell!  i hoped i helped!|`|lxJaqQ95aa	i never had anyone ask me out till i was graduating highschool. most of my classmates had bfs then.   i never felt bad. i know its not my personality, not my features. sometimes its just meant to be. i had my first bf when i was 20, from that time til now i had only two bf. my ex back then (which lasted 2yrs) and my current bf (we've been together for more than a yr now)  im happy, ive waited for my guy and he's perfect  dont rush|`|8d74IGuTaa	it natural for you guys to go a separate way... is there anyway way you could talk with her... i would help with the boy friend drama.

So look around for some guys that peek your interest. you'll find the right one...

CuqU523Paa	You could say that you don't have any definite plans and that if he has anything really fun in mind, that you're open to suggestions.  you don't want to play too hard to get because then he'll just give up, so make it seem like you're available, but you have a life outside of him and will have other things to do if he doesn't want to hang out with you on v-day -- just make sure you don't give yourself another date, so he knows he still has a chance|`|0AYPgUQIaa	Is it better to be alone just to save your pride?  If he asks you out, go with him. If you don't you will regret later(when he goes out with another girl and you lose him).  I don't have ANY plans for V-day and you know what? I'm happy because V-day is not about love anymore, it is about buying crappy and expensive merchandise. Not for me, thank you.|`|jrXdmAxqaa	i say spend time with him. if hes asking you to spend time on valentines day that means he must not got soo much in his schedule either.  just cause your free doesnt make you a loser.
TKf6z1vHaa	First and foremost, I would suggest some therapy or counseling for your boyfriend and yourself and his family. Some of these problems seem to have emotional attatchments to them.   Secondly, your boyfriends seems like a great guy and that he has a good head on his shoulders. I'm sure is under a lot of stress as anyone would be having to deal with his father becoming homeless. He probably feels that it is his responsibility to help out his dad.   Third, the fact that he helped you out so much and it seems like he's made you a better person, should tell you right there what kind of a boyfriend he is. He seems to be good for you.   This is really a tough time for him, honestly, try putting yourself in his shoes. Sit down and talk with him about what is going on with his family. You might not agree with it, but you also don't know what he is feeling about the whole situation. Just have a nice sit down with him. With just the two of you and give him the chance to talk to you before you break it off. He really does seem like a great guy.   Good luck!|`|VN8kBnuRaa	Your boyfriend sounds like a wonderful guy!  I wouldn't want to loose someone like that because of his messed up family.  I have a messed up family myself and if I loved someone and they left me because of it I would be so depressed.    If ya'll love each other stick it through!|`|MYbRICxqaa	To be honest with you, I do not feel a love relationship with you too. I will just continue to have a relationship with this man as a friend nothing more,nothing less. Just because his father is reaping what he sow does not mean it will happen to your mentor or you. I wish you luck. I think you are going to need it.|`|UjBqVl7faa	if you truly love him then you should stand by him and support him through all of this. yeah it's an awkward situation but like if you love him just be there for him.  and you shouldn't think that just because his dad did something doesn't mean he will and from what you're saying this boyfriend sounds like an amazing guy.|`|TebGjfjXaa	if you love him stand by him and try to live separate from his family he can deal with them if he wants but you just love him for who he is not the whole family.
naequcqlaa	You know he's at work rite now, so I would NOT call OR text him.  Let him call you.  What in the world are you so afraid of that you couldn't even answer when he called earlier?  He can't do anything to you thru the phone!  Because you didn't take that call, now look at all the problems it's causing you.  Next time he calls for heaven sake answer the call.  If you want to talk to him then talk to him when he calls.  If you don't ever want to talk to him or have anything to do w/him, then don't call or text him ever again.  You're just playing games at this point in time & you're getting yourself all worked up over it.  Take the call if you want, if you don't then don't & you won't have to worry about him calling again.  WAIT for him to call you...:)|`|mBXu5G5saa	uh try writing in english next time, This is confusing, and does not make much sense!|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Call him. No worrys.|`|RNLGfM1Waa	Wait 4 him 2 get back to you....unles yu called by private number...if not he nows you called soo wait :)..good luck xx|`|bvwYVGJOaa	wait 4 him!    talk to him when ur ready if ur scared.
dGeyvUahaa	No. Some people say it just to show affection instead of just saying "i like you" in a relationship. Or..he really could be in love and say I love you.|`|MEd22BHMaa	boys will tell you what you want to hear to get in your pants...  trust me... they are all "LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR PENISES".|`|NP7pZiOeaa	yeah
gWlmU1KJaa	just be into what he is into    watch the same shows or visit his myspace page|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Well why do you want to turn him on if you don't want to do anything sexual with him? Thats called being a tease. Men hate that more than anything.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	stroke his thigh.  guys like that.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	How do you turn on a guy without being sexual?  That's an oxymoron.|`|39ixfEIraa	well he either likes u or he doesnt. he either thinks ur hott or your nott...idk wat u look like so cant help u there, but u cant make him want u as a gf, and the problem these days girls fall for the guys and give him sex then thats just hormones so dont fall into that, im 19 just graduated highschool i know all about that believe me, and im not proud to say i took advantage of girls, but they wanted it so they got it...dont do anything like that|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Just be yourself.  If that doesn't turn him n then he's not the right one for you.  As a guy, the person/girl turns me on, not what she wears or the things she does.  My wife and I met in college.  She looked at me out of the corner of her eye and blinked (not winked).  That was all it took, I was hers from then on and that was 24 years ago.  Just be yourself, if that's not enough it's not worth going after him.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|zujFYopvaa	Try and make your self look really attractive and make your self smell really good, so when you walk by him he could get a really nice sent off of u! ^_^|`|3ijLQe5laa	this really scares me that instead of wondering how you can get better grades you are wondering how to turn some 12, or 13 year old boy on... slow your @ss down|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Grab a hold of his hand, while you're   both walking together, someplace."|`|bM4zYt44aa	You can't follow "how do I turn him on?" with "nothing sexual".  Turning someone on means making them horny.  And the simple fact that you don't know the difference should tell you that you shouldn't even be dating.|`|AA10155617	you need to look cute and make sure your hair is nice.|`|TKA2mgFBaa	dont be shy just be yourself and make him have fun with you, then he will drop his gf like a bad habit|`|MKRemZkuaa	just talk to him. that is the best thing that there is in a relationship is communication. being open about it wouldn't hurt either.|`|ymAOyewwaa	dont ever hold his hand in the first few days u two r dating. just start talking about the sport that he plays if any and ohhh that will sooo get him started and wanting to hang out with you way more. trust me. im your age lol im in middle school.|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	just be yourself. maybe he likes for who you are. you don't need to turn him on by doing something you don't normally do. just start off a conversation with him a few times. that should get him in to thinking of you in a girlfriend kind of way. just keep hanging around him. BE YOURSELF though. good luck! :)|`|ztrl649aaa	showhim that u like him seriously|`|PrlXK1fEaa	honestly you rili cant make someone like you  if yu do,its only goin to be temporary besides you would want the person to like you for you.      just be you|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well you can't really do anything about that you can only be yourself and not be a fake girl because that will just lead to a lot of problems trust me!|`|Nnb02ZZYaa	Well to turn a guy on u would kinda want to be sexual. thats kinda the point. not like ridiculously sexual. just be flirty! give him a cute little sexy look when u see him. :D|`|IlRkozZnaa	um..   yeah u lost   dude pay attention in school   then on boys!   seriously girls this days cant wait.  that's  sad O.o|`|XeQdKaYiaa	ok umm hmm... you can do many things. if you asking how to make him like you. First of all get to know him more if you dont and talk about yourself. dont be shy.. you only live once so just do it. Sooner or later tell him that you like him and he will prob like you too.    If you already are going out then when you see him try to look like you want a hug if he doesent notice then hug him anyways trust me. He probably wants signs that you want to be loved. So just try giving him some signs =). Good Luck|`|lsZDiqavaa	You need to know the difference in turning him on & making him like you. Since your so young you should focus on your education not boys but I understand cause I was young once myself. A the worst thing you can do is have kids before you finish school. I had my first kid at 15 then I quit school, I wish a million times I had finished. Don't get me wrong I love my kids with all my heart, and I wouldn't trade them for anything.But I wish I had finished school first. It's okay to have a crush on a boy, just let him know that your not ready for sex. There is nothing more important in this world than an education, and marriage should come before sex anyway, but we all know it don't work that way. But when ever you decide to have sex make sure you know the guy. His favorite food, TV show,what he like to do for fun, and anything that may or may not be important later.
6497e09c38204ed52fb5c6298df721abaa	I have the same problem, but for me it's because I am shy. If this is your case too you should try to get out of your comfort zone and compliment him and do cute things like that.

oSxgDvUraa	All you can do is ask.  Maybe try emailing or talking on the phone first to warm up.
cr8J3hPqaa	This is the GAME. Its a woman's duty to play the game, women are experts at the game, they are the womanisers.     If she was too easy, like you walk up to her and say 'wanna have sex', and she says 'yes', life would be one cheap porn flick.    The golden rule of THE GAME:    When you want them, they don't want you; when you don't want them, they want you.    Havent you noticed the girls you dont want, want you; and the girls you want, dont want you.    Use this to your advantage, treat the girls you want, as if you dont want them, as if you wouldnt touch them with a 10ft barge pole, treat them as if they are butt ugly, overwieght, bald, acne filled face. This will come across in your demeanor, and behavior, these hot women will pick it up, and they will WANT YOU!    Give it a go, at least once, what do you have to loose?|`|Rc1351g4aa	they like to play hard to get i belive they do this for fun and to see if you actually really like her and go the extra mile and it makes it all the better when you have caught lol|`|IfwpibHqaa	its only the desperate ones hun|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	It's the game, like Monopoly|`|0xR5UNRpaa	I hate being chased. It makes you seem desperate.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	they don't want to be chased...they want you to leave them alone!! if you chase me i'll kick your asss.........|`|7QtY1cSmaa	Shakespeare said it best in "The Tempest"    Prospero; "They are both in either's pow'rs; but this swift business I must uneasy make lest too light winning make the prize light."    I'm sure you understand the sentiment. Just think of how you value your beret, would you value it as highly if "they" had just handed it to you?|`|g2cYsy4Caa	Its makes them feel more desireable|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Because then you would leave! You work for us then deserve. So we like the chase. Its fun and very entertaining for me! LOL. Im married and I still do that!|`|PHKSoUTDaa	It's the ultimate ego trip.|`|e1a3404dac242d9550e7aca980556e49aa	It a measure of how much the are liked (like to be liked) or desired. As some said an ego trip.       They want to see how much they are wanted so it a test etc.      Also they can bum to their mates how much Better they are than them by just how much someone has or is doing for them.    Giving in destroys the power and the game.|`|c6g92RRVaa	because when he hand it to you on a platter the guy will always take advantage, or take us for granted, or just use us for sex!|`|fzvFGmelaa	I can't speak for all women, but the prospect of someone 'wanting' you so much they'd take a challenge makes me feel more worthy. Yes it may be pathetic, but these days men are sending out mixed messages left right and centre, it feels nice to be pursued and wooed and to know that you mean something. It's a way of showing how much you care. And gives the women a chance to prove to themselves they can trust you.   However I do agree that some women take it ridiculously far, or even some men only go for women who make them chase them- some men like the challenge, and when they get to the end it's boring and they drop her like she means nothing. It just depends on the person and what you find attractive, if you dislike chasing, you shouldn't be with a women who makes you do that. After all, you just won't be compatible later on.
g3zYUk3raa	Beauty! body language is 90% of it all so you're lucky you depend more on it. The biggest giveaway EVER: the moment u catch his gaze once (it has a be a strong one, not a glance), shyly look down and tuck you hair behind your ear with a smirk. This is code for come talk to me. When he comes by, dont cross your arms, this is called blocking and sends a uncomfortable feeling. keep your arms open, and if the flirting starts happening, lots of contact, especially around the elbow (sounds weird but it is uncommon so it's more likely for him to REALLY take notice). He'll know after even just the hair tuck and shy look, so emphasize it. A guy doesn't care if a girl is subtle or not most of the time, so dont be afraid to be clear about it.|`|n7cetvuUaa	smile at him, get ur friends to introduce u to him at a party, or let ur friends know, if they already dont, and get them to invite him out with ur friends group. then use body language, like movie closer, a smile and be urself around him.|`|RYDwwTITaa	You can do the traditional look at him, and when he notices, you smile, then shyly glance away. Generally, you can be happy when he's around (tho, i'm sure you don't need to try to be happy lol) You can compliment him on his sports skills in pe as well. Maybe ask him for tips for improvement for whatever sport your playing.    With your friends, you can kind of get them to "probe" for answers i guess, or what he thinks of you. You can get them to ask, "sooo... what do you think of so-and-so?"  Stuff like that.|`|bUdH8HQ8aa	yeah best way is to look him in the eyes and smile..also you should hold it for a bit. if he has any sense in him he'll know what this means. i sure do...ive never been wrong lol|`|yLTDUZIDaa	Talk to him...|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	The best way to show good signals is:  -Smile at him.  -eye to eye contact.    For your friends who knows him, you could let your friend ask him who he likes for advantage etc.|`|Agad3Oc4aa	if you ever watched memoirs of a Geisha there is a one part in the movie where as a woman to let a man know you are interested in him and still remaining a lady is the way you glance at him sideways but briefly with a little smirk.  Then act like you didn't notice him and he may come after you.  Men usually like to be the pursuer once they know the interest is there.
G0xw0JqAaa	Firstly, a LOT of kissing! Before and after you handcuff her. Slowly undress her down to her bra and thong before you lead her to the bed and gently handcuff her one wrist at a time. More kissing. Hold hands with her for a while after she's handcuffed, then start to stroke her legs and belly, feel her bum etc. Don't stop kissing! Take her bra and thong off, and back to kissing. Slowly take the kissing lower. Lengthy oral sex (you giving it to her) before making love.|`|EcCLlRtTaa	Perform non-penetrational sex with her. Blindfold her and make her reach multiple orgasms even against her will.|`|97eFBAS7aa	Well tell her to trust u and try just tieing her hands to the bed first that easier and less dangerous and remember don't loose the key to the handcuffs|`|lNGGCEYtaa	Kiss her, caress her, explore her body with your hands and lips......... if she trusts you enough to let you put her in cuffs, make her want to let you keep doing it.
uiO590WJaa	take your pants off then try it|`|GfYP5Ku2aa	Suck in as hard as you can then chomp on her lip.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	i dunno you just have to do it not everyway works for everyone. Im not a guy but im a girl and i know if there is alot of chemistry between me and the guy the kiss usually means that much more.|`|LhcN7Ygraa	by wearing a cherry chap stick  duh!|`|R2BBjtaraa	lol -katy pery song flashes into head-  i honestly wouldnt now cause im a girl but umm as long as she likes you and you like her im sure she'd enjoy it.|`|2Cvdu454aa	start off slow and soft then pull her towards you and kiss her hard, bite her lip softly and pull back but look into her eyes when you go it :) xo|`|VOAyAhsSaa	If she's dramatic and likes gushy things: Pull her aside during a romantic time (do it forcefully, like you're really intense, but don't actually FORCE her), and kiss her, long and hard. Stop for a second, look her deep in th eyes, and do it again.    If she's shy, put your finger on her chin, raise it up slightly, and kiss her for a second, and smile.    if she's neither, just put your arms around her waist, pull her close to you and kiss.|`|31eKG6Hraa	Slow.  They hate it if you go too fast.  Suck on their lip a little too, but not too hard or too much.|`|UhmrCbHuaa	I kissed a girl and i liked it, the taste of her cherry chapstick (8)|`|d67c7dc2486e90e8c6c91365dfdf1eacaa	lock lips with her for about 10 sec nd hold her afterwards and kiss her again for about 5 sec.|`|FPLIBcUwaa	look into her eyes, move in towards her slowly, softely kiss her lips and put your hands on her hips, or jaw......dont rush it x|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Slow they hate fast.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Softly without a lot of spit. Be patient. GENTLY slide your fingers into her hair while your palm is LIGHTLY touching her cheek.|`|nTb2rELWaa	Look her in the eyes, like there's a story being told in them.   Slowly move your head towards her face and gently kiss her on the lips. Not a tongue kiss, make it more like a butterfly, like you don't want to break her. Then pull away. She'll want to kiss you more after that, so let her. Or once you've pulled away, pull her into your arms, hug her tight, and give her the most passionate kiss ever.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	wear cherry chapstick. that's all i got for ya!|`|kZgbegS7aa	you'll never be sure that one kiss will fit all, but move in slowly and french for 5-10 seconds, while about to make contact put ur hands on her middle back.
AA10529674	It means that she wants to go out with you as friends. Maybe she just wants to get to know you first and then maybe she'll want to date you once she knows you well enough.|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	no it makes sense, she is going on a date with you but as a friend until she gets to know u better. thats how dating works i had to figure it out to|`|sZePlWTQaa	People can say whatever they want. If you two hit it off then her feelings cant be controlled-call it a date or not. Feelings are feelings. Go out, have fun and see where it goes from there. You don't need to label anything.     How about pool hall or bowling?|`|pORmp0tfaa	Guys these days make it so unclear whether they are asking you out on a date or asking you to hang out as a friend. She was probably unsure of which one you meant when she accepted and wanted to clarify that she thinks its better if you hang out as friends. It doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't want to go out with you, but she wants go get to know you better first before you official "go on a date". Although I agree with you that part of dating is getting to know someone, I guess she doesn't want to give it that label yet.   Take her out to a casual restaurant.|`|cutfMQ4xaa	Of course she is going as a friend, she can't just jump into a relationship with out getting to know you first. she obviously want to get to know you that is why she said yes. I would be happy she has said yes and look forward to the night.  you should take her to a nice restaurant then a nice walk on the beach or something or park if your not near a beach.  Good luck!|`|q8vILEpfaa	She is talking, you are not listening! Slow down, sounds like you have the wedding planned! The rest of the answers are right on.  You should be friends first. What if after the first outing (date) you decide you don't like her as much as you thought you did?  You may not want to take her anywhere tomorrow. There is no commitment and no one is hurt. Go with her and see what happens.
IgRQp58Waa	it depends if the guy is happy with his relationship. If he likes it, he will not complain about it. if he is not, he will complain (mostly to other guys)|`|G1R4pJegaa	Honestly if he's worth anything more than a pile of CRAP! He shouldn't complain even a tiny bit about being with a great girl like you! Then again i'm pretty biased considering i never had a gal, but still what i say is true.
SdWob4deaa	alright, i would definitely go to her house and pick her up. then have your parents meet yall at the picture party and take your car home.  and i would suggest spending the night, what else will you do if you don't? all of your friends will be there  buy her whatever you feel like buying, talk to your guy friends or your parents and see what they say/ are doing|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Prom tickets usually ain't free nygga.
abF3qO3aaa	Put yourself in her shoes and see what you would do. If you want him and he wants you then theres no stopping it and he's being kind of a douche by staying with his girl and leading her on if he really wants to be with you. I wouldn't try to take him from her. Just let things pan out and see what happens. What if he did this same thing to you?|`|ENspyhzUaa	if you're willing to sink to that low to satisfy your selfish desires, by all means go get him|`|kTvn2Nltaa	your a bad person|`|13mDJotJaa	depends. are you either depressed, overweight or have a history of psychotic trauma? if not go for it follow ur heart.     DONT LEAVE URSELF THINKING WHAT IF!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|MDtBuOaMaa	go for it it i always fun stealing people. and since you really like him and it seems he's ok with his current gf so it should go well.
J8uhpecYaa	Just be yourself. People who are excessively flirty are obnoxious. If the guy is worth dating, he'll accept you for who you are.|`|IG4A4nuDaa	do lots of non sexual touching, joke around with him, play hits  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|9e4f17e04f6a518df825311a06f819d2aa	He likes you as you are. You don't have to be hilarious or gorgeous or ingenious.  Just be you.|`|ijCLcCl6aa	oooh ive had that problem too :) i think you should talk with him alot and if yall click really well the flirting will come naturally. trust me|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Since you're already going out with him why do you have to be flirty? Don't feel awkward because he already like you.|`|jxseTHg7aa	smile a lot hold his hand maybe out your arm around him during the movie|`|uFJXz1x3aa	do the 10 second rule    if theres a silence, you need to come up  with a conv. starter within ten seconds like:    "so do u always come to this theater?"    it works, and it keeps the talking going|`|1Foz82Mqaa	....make witty popculture references.      xD|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	be yourself|`|xnVMXi6Gaa	just be normal  take him as a freind  let time take its path.|`|XeQdKaYiaa	its simple. To tell you the truth just look like you want to give a guy a hug or something.. dont feel shy its not like your asking him out or anything its just a friendly hug but for them inside there head they will like you more trust me =)|`|MXAZ7Vohaa	well what you can do is always be a little touchy like for example touch him on the hand when talking but don't be too touchy or he will think u are a weirdo. also make eye contact and lean in when talking to him|`|999a56cf1347f99ff9dee6fe42651eefaa	be your self :) Guys like it when you're yourself. and smile, don't just sit there and be quiet. Just make it a general conversation, then it gets more fun..like flirting :P no but really just be your usually..no quiet ;] self.|`|KCKq9duJaa	you'll feel comfortable over time|`|TFmWXt4eaa	I have the same problem with guys. Just give it some time. Once you get to know each other better it will get easier. Try hanging out in small groups you may feel more confident to talk to him. Don't think to hard about what to say.. be yourself ever ones a little shy!|`|bgnHRESjaa	talk about something that you know real well. that way you don't feel silly. also smile so that he know that you are interested in him. you can casually make gentle touch on his shoulder or on his hand when you laugh. maybe think of a couple of stories that you want to tell him on your date. that way you won't have an awkward silence, but you also don't want to keep babbling. good luck.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	take a shot or two and that will open you right up....j/k just be natural like give him a hug when you see him and stuff like dat...dont be to touchy feely unless you want to lead him on but do enough to keep him interested|`|onTSAWpmaa	Just relax, if your going to the movies you should see a comedy. If the both of you are laughing the less tense things are and the more comfortable you'll feel. As for flirting, just make sure to laugh at his jokes even if there corny ( although I tend to make fun of the corny jokes myself) physical contact, just subtle touching his arm, hand. Smile a lot too because it is contagious =0) Good luck|`|DBvjwPTcaa	Don't worry, the guys will do the work. Most guys love shy girls. Flirty girls will attract many but may give them the wrong message too. Be yourself.|`|D7PVGojZaa	dont worry about it your nervous and wanting to be liked its normal even outgoing and confident people go shy with someone they like just be yourself and if you find it hard to talk smile and do alot of looking at him|`|vpHcS3Suaa	I'm just like you. Once you get to know him a lot more the conversation will go on. Just be yourself and make sure you got a cute outfit on.|`|Nrk9fT8waa	JUST BE YOURSELF! It always breaks the part to feel confident!|`|XPKtCpbraa	Get the kiss out of the way in the first part of the date.|`|PTZa1nSAaa	talk to him|`|WYPEG8l7aa	If you can't make yourself talk then make a lot of eye contact and smile a lot. Make it seem like everything he says really intrigues and amuses you.|`|dMTx6QRaaa	sorry cant help there|`|hF7HyDXEaa	i'd mabye you can practice with a good guy friend or your bff's boyfriend, so they can help you to be more comfortable with flirting i guess... idddkkk i never went on a date before|`|0qSpreVyaa	quiet and shy isn't always bad!!! In fact! I think that's a cute quality! That a girl would be shy of a guy! (Usually it's the other way around! Guys usually have more riding on it... they have to pop the questions)    Good luck! But don't change who you are to get the guys attention... that's not right.|`|Gnhgfx4naa	Think about it, you've gotten this far by being yourself so that shyness must be working !    ;-)  Just relax, he is into you so go with the flow.|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	Ah i know how you feel! I'm so shy too! If you have nothing to say or are too afraid to just giggle and make a lot of eye contact. Oh and keep smiling!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Be yourself and smile
qsgiZtwWaa	im only an eight grader, and dont know alot about this, but you just have to give your problems to God.  He will take care of everything, you just have to be paitent.  In the meantime, I know plenty of single parents who got along just fine without the fathers, and if you have a problem with his wife than you shouldnt just let yourself go, a mother has an instinct.  I know you just want whats best for him, but you have the capabilities to give it to him.  Look to your church, and in the meantime, I'll be roooting for ya.|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Since she is so religious she would also know that God dont like ugly. She cant keep that man from his child. And if she tries to she will reap only heartache. Yall go to the same church? Get the pastor involed have a group meeting about it.  and she is right the two become one when you get married and i believe she should be included in on things with the baby, maybe try another meeting place or have your mom or some one you trust there in your place when they visit. If she keeps this up that man is going to leave her. sounds like he married her on the rebound. not all marriages were made in heaven. good luck and take good care of your little one.
ykPN1GCPaa	first become good friends with her. that guy wouldn't get pissed if your friends with her. then start hinting towards her that your interested when that guy is not around. then if she falls for you, it's her choice so that guy won't get pissed.   good luck ^.^|`|yQn34zO7aa	no guy has dibs on a girl so if he hasnt already made a move then go for it. before you ask the girl out flirt with her a little bit and if she flirts back then ask her out to the movies. if you're afraid to go out with her 1 on 1 you can go out as a big group then just single her out later
BeIX5pH1aa	get er email  talk to her on msn first  talk a little  approach her the nest time you see her  there will be common ground and more to talk about   and she wont be creeped out, so maybe her friend will back off, knowing that she knows you now
xqoc4poWaa	depends.   some have the size but no motion and some have motion and no size.
4BoteYDwaa	I think it's appealing. I don't see any negative aspects of it, except that the first time would be kinda awkward, but not necessarily bad. It's nice knowing that the girl hasn't already been with all of your friends (with respect). You really want your first time to be worth it, don't just be a statistic. You want him to truly feel honored to be your first. Don't lose it to a player.|`|LXherojjaa	thats hot|`|S4EKcn8Waa	"Sara" should be happy she is still a virgin and staying that way was obviously important to her so the guy she likes should not have a problem with her being a virgin if he shares in the same morals as she does and if he does have a problem with it then maybe he is not Mr. Right after all.  Totally hot!|`|L1jrlQSMaa	Hey.I think that hot? why? It's had to finding a virgin girl this days? Also A girl who's never been touched by any other guy. Dame i bat he is thinking he hit the jackpot. I hop he is a keeper or......|`|JbKerMCkaa	Very hot and I would be respectful of your decision. I woudn't care that she hasnt been kissed or that she was a virgin...I would only be worried about getting to know her.      Can you answer my question?  Just put this in your search block:  Ladies- have you ever been turned on by show of power? What do you think about this?    Tried to attach the link but it didnt work...thanks!|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Oh please....a guy that young would think it's hot. This way if they do actually get to the sex part of a relationship, there isn't any pressure for him to be good at it, lol.|`|iXQuSNtqaa	Hot.|`|HfamMJIqaa	super hot|`|KZWiRYEwaa	Hm.... It is if you are both virgines.... but I like my lady experienced and if she is not I'll just teach her. It doesn't really matter to me.|`|TPdQBF2yaa	def diff, id give it a go  good luck for you *cough* i mean to sarah|`|Asm4AKOOaa	it shows a lack of experience , thats not really a turn on to me and i might wonder what if anything she could do ?|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Where has the world gone to?...|`|ddWyRjmVaa	uhh...                                                                wow|`|sZePlWTQaa	You shouldn't be telling a guy all your info so fast!! He doesn't need to know your past.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	Hot.. and I'm a girl =)  buuut after he tells you he likes you, you don't need to rush into telling him everything about you..  take your time|`|MDtBuOaMaa	defiantly hot because then you can form a real relationship then you can have sex when she's ready|`|cW7RXq8Qaa	Depends on the guy. Some guys like experienced girls because they know what to do and no explaining is required. Those guys like being pleasured. And other guys like being the teacher and showing the girl what to do. And then there are the self-concious guys who want a virgin because they can't handle being compared to other guys.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	If I were that age I would be neutral on that. It would not be an issue at all. It would be nice to be your first though.
My83BMB5aa	if they act different around you. observe how they act around other girls and compare it to you|`|cTyeHg1maa	when they stare at you and stutter.|`|4HMgSsmGaa	Well, the easiest way to tell if a boy likes you or not is to see if he does anything out of the ordinary or if he goes out of his way to do stuff for you. For instance, if you notice that he txts you more frequently or just to say hi a lot then that's usually a good sign, or if he goes out of his way to walk with you in school or just say hi, then that's usually a good sign too.   If you have any classes with him or if you see him and he's looking at you and when you look up, he smiles at you or waves, then that's a definate sign.  Oh, or the opposite of that, if you look up and catch him looking at you but then when you make eye contact, he looks away or starts fumbling with his pencil or something, that usually means that he's just shy about liking you.  A big sign is if he does this and then blushes.     Hope that helped. :)|`|30Hk5bazaa	when they act stupid around you and do crazy things, to get yur attention|`|F4bP39lxaa	Hell if I knew. That kind of thing goes right over my head too.        Let me know when you find out.|`|AIMwH4xOaa	when they act funny and weird around you. its to get your attention|`|lf4RDGDAaa	Well i realy am going throw the same thing i want to now some stuff to like he has to go pick up his little bro and they always stop to talk infront of my house becasue my room is all the way in front of my house and becasue he always is shy and silly around me when we walk by but i dot even now his name or what to do around him because i sorda like him to i was hoping one of these answers can help me thanks     please right fast
wHL0Jw23aa	No it just depends with who. Some do and some don't. But your girl seemed to like it =)|`|JWZEuuhTaa	GROSS! That is way weird. I would be freaked out if that happened to me.          Sorry but that's me!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Cute.  Nothing wrong with it (although one always hopes the feet are perfectly clean, right? )    Have fun...    Sincerely,    Grace|`|zecLsI8oaa	Some girls don't mind it, some girls do.  I know a LOT of girls that hate their feet.  So I suppose you're lucky to have found a girl that likes it too! :P|`|zdlS3fgDaa	The foot-in-mouth thing is a little weird but I wouldn't mind a guy who gave foot rubs and stuff.|`|258mrT2Paa	they love it|`|xhDdYnHTaa	Some women (and men) find it gross but some (like me) think it's very sexy and feels wonderful!|`|OWXik8Ruaa	the rubbing the feet is normal. but the feet in the mouth is gross and something that i just couldn't do or want someone to do to me.      yuk!|`|CXCkH1Rzaa	wow...some girls like it  personaly i dont
L1g3OKauaa	obviously you have to ask him, because you know you want to go with him and have a good time with him. I seriously just think you should have fun and make friends with his. They won't be purposefully rude to you and you never know maybe they'll like you. Just don't be an annoying date. You don't want to suffocate him. You can hang out with your'e friends at the dance but just take pictures with his group before.. so it's even!!  Sorry i'm just trying to help:)
dT5jDb2waa	Yeah it kinda does...but who said being a **** is a bad thing? Its better then getting emotionally involved with someone and tearing their heart out.|`|gKQDNpS3aa	uh yeah, that's like the definition of ****. why would you do that?|`|q8vILEpfaa	yep big time
h8WC1zDGaa	Yes, you definetly should!  I used to have this problem where I couldn't be able to even look at my crush, but then I 'pretended' that my crush was my best friend.  I flirted with him and we've been togethor for 2 months.  SIT AT THAT TABLE! haha|`|AA11599430	yes sit their|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	yeah you should|`|2MTStFdbaa	YES of course, if you don't your friends are going to be offended and your crush is going to think you hate them. Which, im guessing, is the exact opposite of which you want!|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	i dont see why not. its a good way for you guys to start a friendship that could lead to something better.|`|xQGkWlSKaa	YES sit by him! It is the perfect time to flirt.|`|WiBtCEowaa	yeah, just sit confidently and pretend to pay no attention to him unless he talks to you. that way you won't look like you're sitting there just cuz he is|`|o3ECMDqXaa	Definitely AND if you could start sitting closer and closer to him gradually it would really  make him feel like you arent afraid!
gWlmU1KJaa	make friends first, take it slow, just talking and you learn to trust, way later you might feel like you want a kiss, just enjoy the journey    your not the first one to feel this way    so dont rush into sex, let that be way later
7AFLaiYjaa	its not as much is what is wrong with you, its how you hold yourself. If your a real happy person, then guys will talk to you. Its also CONFIDENCE!|`|258mrT2Paa	mixing with wrong crowd|`|0oCVN8zKaa	jus talk to them if you want
M1vaxvUZaa	if he uses you as a rebound ... just stop talking to him find a bf that rely appreciates you... one who you deserve and all in love and show that other dbag how it feels|`|VmuLzz0Waa	Why would you want to be with a man who share's his body with another women even if they are flink's still you don't know what he can bring back to you something like s.t.d I don't think you do if it was a thing where he's not with anybody or you that's alittle diffrent and if you can't stay away  then maybe you shoulded see him for awhile until you can get over him alittle now if it's to strong then you might want to let him know that you have more feeling's for him then he think's  talk now before it's to late good luck girl.|`|bM4zYt44aa	You find a guy that is better than him that will make you realize how much he didn't have to offer and what you're missing out on by being hung up on him.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Tell him to dump the gf|`|sZePlWTQaa	You just have to tell him no. Who cares how it makes him feel. He is doing something wrong.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	This is coming from a guy, so seriously consider my opinion. He's using you. He only goes to you when can't get any. Don't waste your time on this guy, he's not worth it.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	just tell him u guys are just friends while he is going out with this girl|`|ANC7G909aa	well next time he loses a gf and starts talking to you, you should tell him youve got better things to do than hook up with him in between girls.  nd get really mad nd dont talk to him.  hell probly feel bad nd maybe he just relle likes u nd hell actualy date u rather than just hook up|`|E8hYgxN1aa	okay you need to lose him.  move on some how some way.  he is using you.  if you didn't already know that.    he dates other girls and then conveniently after its over he comes back to you.  you have to see how that's wrong.  and him cheating on his gf with you is way worse.  just tell him you don't think its right.  its either you or her.|`|868a31870b2442fda53f092f816a8ef0aa	well i suggested you try your hardest to stop hooking up with hm because it shows that if it was to ever get serious between you two he could or can do the same to you so you shouldn't stay with someone like that . and the good part about it is that you don't have to feel this way and the girl he's with won't get hurt either.|`|wrvCzyAqaa	Do you have boyfriends in the meantime?  If not...FORGET HIM!!!! Change your phone number...don't give him the new number. Don't open the door if he comes to your house.  Deny him 'hook ups'...he'll get it.  It's clear and apparent that you are a luxury to him...no commitment but all the benefits.  And it seems that you either aren't looking for a serious relationship or are having trouble finding one.  Either way, he gets just what he wants...and when he wants it.  And he takes for granted that you will always be there.  Why aren't you good enough for him...relationship wise?|`|gbcN55Draa	If you really want to forget him,just stay away from him and don't let him know your place and don't ever talk to him for a while until you forget each other...find your love..the solution for that is in you.its all in the mind...
ID2AH1EBaa	Yes, most of the women i have gone far with i had no feelings towards. Roll of the dice? Personal Preference? Who knows, all i know is that you can be sexually attracted to someone without any other feelings, just remember when and when not to act on them (such as when you are already in a relationship).|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Yup, she was my gf at the time though so I dunno if that counts still didn't like her though.|`|Shp5riE6aa	No, I've always liked the women I've been with.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	maybe you don't like her cause your insecure and think she will loos interest in you, so instead of her turning you down you want to turn her down first. Its like a a defense mechanism your putting up. WHy not give her a shot and at least see with this relationship leads, she clearly likes you and its obvious your lacking female attention so just at least give her a try.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Sure many a time. Sex is sex if the lady wants it be a gentleman (lol) and oblige.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	dude, I have done so many chicks I don't like I prefer it that way. That way I have no problem telling them to go home when I finish. Don't forget you are assuming that she enjoyed herself and wants more from you.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah i had a 2 minutes with guy and i could not even spell his name    it was African.|`|I07MtJzAaa	no|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Yes, and it makes you sick to the stomach.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Yup all the time.|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	That sucks man. I've been there myself, it's never fun. But luckily for me I didn't work with her so it was easier to deal with.. But best thing you can do is try not to bring it up and act as if nothing like that had happened.. If she brings it up though you just need to explain that you were drunk and it wouldn't had happened otherwise because you just look at her as a friend. She will probably be pretty upset about it but thats better than avoiding her. Good luck man|`|mefxIQP9aa	So what if she has a degree. She screwed you unmercifully. She's a smut.|`|39ixfEIraa	get some more at work my dog!!!   i only do the finest girls my man|`|nG63KSMgaa	If you don't like her, just don't get off with her again. Simple. And stop being such a bleeding drama queen about it.|`|61Fwbi79aa	I have an exwife. I had sex with her. I do not like her. A+B+C=???|`|tFfUMQtyaa	I have had sex with a girl I did not like.|`|aCdya2qkaa	yeah i closed my eyes mate and pictured Pamela Anderson, i thaught to myself I was Tommy lee|`|Vp83Fuakaa	ya my wife|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	7734 yeah!  Who says you have to like her?|`|IG4A4nuDaa	well, in your case I think that you should let her down easy... it isn't fair to her, don't you think?  Or, if you want to live a lie, ask her out and continue the facade until she breaks with yoiu  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|MQCT1FXjaa	she was probably wasted too if it was a party.. so i wouldnt really worry.  its probably going to be awkward.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	I've done it. I was desperate and hadn't been laid in more than a year, so I slept with a neighbor who was roommates with friends of mine.    I ended up ******* around with her for a month or so, but had no romantic interest in her. It was a stupid decision to keep sleeping with her.    The only advise I can give you is to cut it off and make your intentions clear as quickly as possible. It won't be easy, but that is the only way to limit the destruction. There is no "easy" way around it, you just have to do it (no pun intended).|`|gGE5TrFyaa	you are such a loser!!!! sorry to be such a ***** but im speaking the truth.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	I had sex with a LOAD of women I didn't like... hell, I didn't even know their NAMES!.    I just wanted to get laid, carve a notch on the bedpost, send her home, and then go to sleep.    That is what young guys do...     I grew up, found a great woman, got married, and have been monogamous for seven years...|`|AA10155617	you shouldnt have had sex with her. your so wrong!|`|3lVuNfLMaa	ive had sex with a guy i didnt like....more than once|`|ViNFT9RQaa	so you don't like her bc of her background and the fact that you too have different educational levels? maybe you should try to get to know her -- just bc youve already done the deed doesnt mean its too late to take it slow now. who knows, you may have more in common than you think.|`|tUSx6V0Paa	now that uve lead her on theres 2 things u can do    1. ask her out, u might end up being really into her and who knows u might actually fall in love.  or...  2. just tell her u were totally wasted and that u didnt know what u were doing and tell her u only see her as a friend. b really nice tho bcuz ur literally crushing her hopes here!|`|KqxoYgUYaa	well wouldn't it be considered unprofessional to sleep with someone you work with? It could really lead to a whirlwind of things that might happen at work once you let her down, so yeah, that's stressful. But I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle, tough guy. Whatever you do, talk to her face to face. Don't write it on a note, don't leave a voice message, none of that crap that could be used against you later on. Tell her that you made a mistake, and that you wish to keep only a professional relationship, that you are a man, she's a woman, and naturally, when two people are thrown together and there is that sexual drive, things happen sometimes.|`|UvJ9mPlZaa	I think you like her more than you let on and that your just scared.    Be a man and ask her out for a drink, get to know her!|`|7N2YPjkEaa	no i have not.. because i am a woman, who doesnt have sex with other woman... and a virgin :] and u r a filthy man whore....so there:]|`|SJDYBImmaa	Stop bragging and ask a real question.|`|VPYskV8Maa	every week i married her boo hoo|`|KrpdXlEDaa	i am a virgin =)|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	she sounds nice...give her a chance|`|KLJgvCvcaa	i think you should tel her how you feel. I mean, if you don't like her, don't let her think you do. Because, that hurts her in the end to.     Which he whole situation in the end will probably embarrass her because of what happened and that you don't feel the same way|`|RySDawpOaa	i have but i mean dude if shes not ur type theres no reason to bother but u gotta look at it this way if she has a personality it might be worth it but if not think of it this way u still got something good out of it.|`|jCZCRguUaa	do you like her even a little bit even though you wouldn't want to admit it? if you don't then she'll probably be hurt but you should let her know right away because it will crush her even harder if you wait. also, not saying that you will, but even when you don't like someone and you have sex with them alot (i know it was only once but i'm just saying) you can still get attached.  good luck!|`|c2O4Cn7Jaa	Let her know your just not into her it will worsen if you ignore the situation. Give her the old line of i just wanna be friends she should get the hint.|`|e1884e932807e2ae04ca848e7bccb863aa	No I have not.  Are you sure you don't liker her?|`|XkRGEnL4aa	everything happens for a reason  do what you feel is right.  if you avoid it, then she might eventually give up and you wont have to worry about it.    just don't do or say anything to her, wait for her to come talk to you, and if it has to do with your guyses intimacy, then simply tell her that it was a drunk night and it wont happen again and that youre sorry    it could be worse|`|ANC7G909aa	just tell her you were severly intoxicated and werent in  a normal state of mind  emphasize severly and not normal... nd hopefully shell realize that means u wouldnt do her under ny normal circumstances|`|q9lvF6FVaa	If u don't like her.  Put a brown bag over her face and make some more love to her.  Or you can pretend she is a supa model..
Wlh3b2vXaa	well if you used to not have a problem then something caused you to have the problem now. try figuring out what that could be and see if theres a way to fix it. Your answered it yourself pretty much, your nervous, just try to figure out a way to feel more comfertable with them.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	because you are ALWAYS looking at their crotch! I have seen you doing it|`|AA11599430	talk to a therapist it sounds like low self esteem|`|5gANvXyTaa	Thats like the complete opposite of me. I love looking into guys yes, expessially my crushes. but you just prolly freak out haha. idk you answered it yourself pretty well.
cTyeHg1maa	if u want him to be turned on, then wear a low shirt.    if u want him to like you, i suggest you smile a lot and laugh (unless you have an annoying laugh) and just be yourself because that is the best you can do without pretending to be someone your not.
owoQ93WHaa	hes gunna give you 5 kids and ditch|`|GjsrcsZkaa	He wants to have little kids with you ...|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think he just want you to have sex with him! Sorry ):|`|oDnEGXO1aa	Yes|`|qUmZCJ79aa	He is going to tell you whatever you want to hear for his benefit!|`|DCcrLTcZaa	haha he was trying to get on your good side! Man guys always do that when they like someone. hehe but i do it too so i guess its everyone, cuz i hope im not the only one!|`|By1DJAUOaa	yeh!! he wanted to impress you or either he wanted to get in dem jeans|`|WsqV6Cy9aa	i think hes trying to get in your pants to be honest|`|Sga6uU4Zaa	Eh most likely  Dont go for him, hes changing himself to impress you|`|qPfQM0p3aa	yes, i do.  he just has different views of things now!  give it time baby girl!  ;]|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Sounds like he telling you what you want to hear to get what he wants. He doesn't want kids and all of a sudden he does. Please don't fall for it.|`|1rZbmyYfaa	okayyyyyy..... soo?|`|vwGSTzHYaa	I think he wants to impress you, but he is clearly lying when he says he likes kids now.    I think he wants you to have a futur maybe, so hell do anything to make you happy.    Talk to him about it though, get the truth out.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Well from the amount of information you gave it's kinda hard to tell but I'm gonna make some assumptions and give you some examples of proof, okay? Bear with me, I ramble on a lot... I appologize.  So the fact that he originally said he doesn't like little kids and then when you bring up that you do and all of a sudden he likes them too is a good sign because it almost seems that he wants to have the same interests as you, right? I know I've done this with the guy I like. When I found out he was in advanced science I switched, just so we have more things to talk about. I know I'm lame.  So this boy was probably trying to develop some common ground with you so it will be easier to talk to you =)  You could always ask him to hang out one day and see how he reacts ;)|`|fca8fd6808be38ea4251def3feffec19aa	yes he LOVES you|`|MEr99qKraa	when ur older he'll be long gone..don't matter if he likes u..u really don't know what it's like to have a kid..ur a kid urself so's he ..i don't think ne thing
toYfRWDZaa	hahaha..i have the same problem....    well first of all..its NOT EASY!!!!  NOPENOPENOPE!!!  Iv tried millions of times and i still can't do it...  but that's just me. lol XD    If u really want 2 get 2 know him i say when u have a coincidental chance say hi.   Yeah u may blush a bit..or a lot.  But at least that will be one way for him 2 know u exist.   Then maybe next time ask him for his name and say oh my name is....... and finish with an "ill see u  around"    Well....i wish this helps...if it does then i should start taking my own advice...lol|`|a0da3e586ab84fa0f4d47aca26b554c5aa	you can always start off by talking about school/hw/teachers... and then go on from there... talk to him about movies, sports, music, whatever he is interested in. especially if he's like on a team or plays an instrument or is in drama or something, you can ask what its like.

Just Don't Get Freaky.|`|QADhk0nFaa	haha just say yes its not a big deal your only 13 i mean its not like your getting married|`|jgXTrdS6aa	its not too young for dating.. but please, just keep it just a date, no sex please!!|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Ask your parents and let them decide. I think you are way too young.|`|vfj4kyGIaa	it's fine as long as he's not 17 almost 18|`|MQjsspQ6aa	OMG why did you say NO?? Anyways if feel you're too young then you don't have to date you can just hang out go to a movie or something and see where it goes!  Good luck and quickly tell him that you do want to go out with him and that you were just surprised and didn't know if you were ready for dating!
uFJXz1x3aa	just tell him if things go smooth, maybe u guys can be together again.. but keep him to the side, because if u end up leaving him, its almost impossible for you to go back to him =/...u just need to keep talking to him.. and one night, just have a deep conversation with him, and tell him how u feel, and if he wants to go out    im sure he'll say yes|`|IG4A4nuDaa	well, I would think that he misses you, because your first statement is gone.  You have already proved that he like you before, so he can't find you horrendous, so I would go for it, he won't care if you do.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|CA9OFT4Waa	if its awkward then leave it alone for a few days, jumping right back in there to ask for a movie date is a stupid idea. give it time, it will heal everything. and yes its true, very true.
IG4A4nuDaa	yea, I think the friend might like you, and is lying.  Try excavating to find out.  You might be suprisedanswer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|pS9yoeLuaa	She probably thought it was weird because you didn't give it to her yourself, or because she might not know you very well.|`|kERP7zAhaa	well either the girl doesn't like you or her friend likes you.|`|XQbEyVJ1aa	Giving a girl you don't really know a gift is kind of awkward, and you did probably blow your chance.|`|Fd02NWmhaa	did u get the teddy bear back thrown on ur face? if not, u still hab a chance.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Why don't you just talk to this girl you like so much! Yes you have a chance because she took the bear and did not give it back!!!!|`|64AV1tlMaa	to me, u should hav given it to her your self. now the girl probably thinks ur a woos or ur just shy and nervouse. u might hav a chance.    hope so buddy . good luck :)
KJCwUW6Laa	yes|`|dtGInk4Faa	Uhhh dont you feel inda weird admitting your a lesbo to everyone?|`|TMi1GhSHaa	To answer your question no its not wierd that your gf wont let you meet her friends but its wierd that she had a thing for jessica a month ago and is bringing it up as if it happend recently.. i mean why would your current partner need to know about your ex's unless you are involved with them again or "friends".. and if she is friends with jessica chances are she is sneaking around when your not there.. did she ever once say she is not itno her anymore.. and she very well might be embarassed of them, sometimes friends can embarasse you with all these stories and inside jokes that u share.. she will eventually show you her friends on her own time so dont sweat it.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Sorry, but she's either ashamed of you or cheating with one of her friends and don't want you two to meet. Don't trust her.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Yeah, she's screwing around. No reason to hide you from her friends.|`|JduQHocdaa	She is holding out on you for no reason dump her. You deserve a lot better.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it's always a red flag when your partner refuses to introduce you to their friends and family.    In your case, it could be simply that she isn't out to the people you want to meet BUT since you said she was having a fling with one of them, my concern is that she may still be involved with one of them and she's hiding you.    you have to decide for yourself if she's telling you the truth or if she's playing you and you have to decide if this a deal breaker.|`|dPQiMtANaa	Dump her. Sounds like she's got something to hide whether she's hiding something from you or she's hiding you from her friends for a reason. Like Dr. Phil says, "Those who have nothing to hide, hide nothing". Obviously something is up and it's pretty unlikely she'll admit to it so dump her and go for someone who's more open and honest.|`|EQDcq2IEaa	Either she's cheating or holding you back as rebound material. She's hiding something. Dump her.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	thats a little weird in my opinion|`|N0rI6N9baa	she's either embarrased of you or maybe she's hiding something?|`|qWyZ94Iqaa	it sounds to me like your girlfriend isn't very trustworthy.  you need to sit down nd have a serious talk about why she doesn't want you to meet them.|`|AA10155617	shes cheating on you. why else wouldn't she want u to meet her friends?|`|JAwhXqljaa	Yes ..shes embarrased|`|ViNFT9RQaa	sadly, i was guilty of doing this to my boyfriend when we first started dating. he always asked when he could meet them, and i always made up excuses to keep them apart, wouldnt tell him when i was doing things with them so he wouldnt have a chance to come, etc. bottom line is i was ashamed of him, not the other way around... but i told HIM i thought HE wouldnt like THEM so i wouldnt hurt his feelings... i know, sounds horrible, i feel horrible about it now. we ended up breaking up, but i would never do that to another boyfriend after i saw how horrible it made him feel. i think he knew the whole time the real reason :\|`|5PHpi7GGaa	Its not weird at all, shes not cheating|`|mIvVWFdmaa	She should be more open.|`|XgmO8YIkaa	thats weird she should let u met her friends if uve met hers  maybe somethings going on ?!|`|AA10768706	no because her friends a probably sluts and can't be trusted around men i had a friend who i introduced to my boyfriend and they ended up sleeping together i wish i wouldn't have let them meet so no that's not weird that's smart.|`|fLvzhAX8aa	Dr. Phil isnt even a psychologist  i dont get why any one actually trusts him    hes a dum A_$_S_$_S_$_S|`|M1vaxvUZaa	YES|`|GCpnuPNCaa	im sorry but i think she is ceating on you. she needs to respect u as her partner. You should tell her either i meet your friends or im going to think your cheating and its over.|`|MmIYDoGkaa	Ditch her.As the great Doc Phil said."Those who have nothing to hide hide nothing".Shes obviously hiding something behind your back.If you ask her one more time and she acts embaressed DITCH HER.|`|D4RDJmJzaa	hun...maybe she's 2 timing you. if she is always hesitating to let her friends meet you, she's probably seeing one of them. i hate it that this is happening to you but move on to a nicer and hotter girl lol. my best friend, she went through this with a girl and so did i with a guy.|`|gBMZqjJraa	yes that is not right you should of met her friends months ago    maybe you could say if you don't let me meet you friends then i would dump you    but that maybe mean - a threat :(    good luck i hope you get to meet her friends and everything turn out alright|`|RySDawpOaa	ummm no it isnt wierd id say she doesnt want u to meet her cause some people breakup because of bad friends so mabye she just loves you that much?or so|`|nzCxfFNyaa	HAHAHAHA matbe ur a loser nd she dnt wnt to show her u|`|lxJaqQ95aa	relationship means trust, if she felt that you will judge them but you clearly say that u would not, dont you think she should believe you??  she should not hide anything from you, thats my opinion.|`|ublCVXavaa	Maybe you don't KNOW that her friens are totally CHILL with lesbians. Maybe they think they're NASY. (because they are) no offence|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	maybe she is just upset of what her friends might think of you. maybe some of her friends are a little bit jealous of you that your who shes dating now. im sure shes not cheating. im sure she loves you more than to cheat on you. but just take her aside and talk to her alone and simply ask if she is cheating on you and tell her that you know she can tell you any thing and if she says no im not cheating on you believe her. Good luck.
cgHPoUfZaa	definetly no weird I'm 17 and I've never kissed a guy. It's better when the guy asks you but it really doesn't matter.|`|Qna7DnO3aa	No, its not odd, your just getting to the dating age and take your time and enjoy it k, but stop cross dressing k  LOL that was funny
5YEKmHqyaa	She's obviously interested.  If you don't mind that she has a child then just ask her out.|`|UUx74K5Caa	Well, it sounds like she's into you, so what is the problem?  Ask her to the prom ASAP.  Why are you hemming and hawing anyway?  Good luck.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	make a move..she likes u u like her whats the problem?|`|MsSHhX8zaa	ask her to the prom|`|qpkNrn8iaa	ASK HER OUT!!! shes obviously into u and ur into her|`|AA11731307	Maybe you should tell her how you feel.
HnEcgVGiaa	I'd definitely go for being alone until I find "the one". Now, a lot of people may counter this by asking, if you do try, how would you ever know if the person was "the one"? Well... that is difficult, but it gives you a chance to view the other person from the outside. You can observe their behavior. And if you form a friendship with them first, then you can build trust and get to be comfortable around them.    I'm in my 20's and I'm still single, partly because I think "the one" may still be out there. (and partly because I had no choice XD) But I strongly believe she is worth the wait. And if she isn't out there, then I was meant to be single in the first place and had no business being in a relationship.    I re-emphasize my point that forming a friendship first is a favorable step because you get to know them better in the process.     If you are rock collector, would you settle for just pebbles that are lying next to the sidewalk or will you keep on hiking until you find that priceless gem?|`|JDQP0Phraa	I don't really think there is one special person for everyone. If you find someone who makes you happy, go for it. There's no point in being lonely waiting for someone who might not even exist.|`|AKHywxwlaa	a ok relationship but if someone good comes alone i will explain why i have to leave him|`|T55YPfXUaa	i would prefer to be alone waiting for the one because you have nothing to worry about when you meet that one. that's when you can settle with that peron into a relationship.|`|lXVwGgHmaa	if you wanna find someone that makes you happy but dont wanna go to like marriage or something. eventually youll find what your looking for.|`|J8uhpecYaa	The former. There is no one is who 'the one.'|`|71VRvldJaa	I know exactly what I want and expect in a relationship and I absolutely refuse to settle for less than what I know will make me happy!  I'd rather be happy and alone than miserable with someone.  I never could see the sense of being with someone just because you could be!  It's a waste of his time and mine.    There's a lot of people out there though who feel like the world is going to end if they don't have a partner all the time.  Personally, I think that's crazy!|`|L0uZPWEmaa	tricky one!!! could i be in an okay relationship whilst waiting for 'the one' lol|`|4nZb9oqKaa	the one .. dont let anybody use u|`|eu9czRUSaa	i'd settle until something better came along|`|ZVngHOBTaa	be alone waiting for the one    you don't always need to be in a relationship|`|69qn7muFaa	I think i'd choose to be alone waiting for "the one"  I mean.. If i was in an OKAY relationship, i'm just hurting someone else for not fully loving them. I don't love them like i would with "the one" and the one is suppose to be worth every moment of my life right?     I'd rather hurt myself looking for love than hurt someone else.|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	wait for the one it's worht the wait believe me :)|`|St4i1Wlhaa	i would go for settle relationship cause u can work work ur way up so he/she will like u eventually|`|hVX794Lyaa	oooooooooo! good question i that the okay relationships are good becuase you learn things through them but then again you could be letting the one just leave. But i also think that the person that ur meant for doesnt walk around with ur name tattoo to them so your going to have to go through some to see if they are the one or not|`|juK9Xyxzaa	the latter|`|tyjyYx5Saa	Very personal question first off, so I'm guessing you are looking for opinions.   In my mind, I would rather wait. There are so many things to do when you are younger that you really won't be able to do when you are older. Also, if you do enter an "okay relationship," think about how much you or the other person could get hurt from this. I would just stick to your friends until you do find the right one.|`|LXRyN1Dqaa	Well, maybe you think the person you're in an "okay" relationship with IS the one.  Ooh.|`|c1pnGIXxaa	sometimes its good to be in a relationship just to have fun and have a companion. As long as no one is being lead on and you actually like the person. Someone doesn't have to be your perfect mate to be good to date. Also, sometimes you don't even know if someone is "the one" until you date them for a while and get to know them better. If you wait around for the one you might be waiting your whole life, and lets face it, being alone after a while gets lonely.|`|YPHFjw86aa	i would stay out of the relationship because it sets your status as taken so thats probly a big turn off if "the one" finds you. if you kinda like this person maybe you could just go on a couple dates but be sure to let this person know that it is a completley open relationship and he is not your boyfriend.|`|z05MDkRbaa	You should not settle just because you are lonely and afraid to be by yourself. However, it's also good to be realistic in your expectations of what a relationship involves and how to be a couple.  I settled, and am divorced.  It's much better to be aware of those things that your truly need (your nonnegotiables) and then be willing to put the work into being in a relationship with the other person (remembering that he or she will not magically change because of the wonderfulness of your presence).    In other words, I'd rather be alone than settle, but I'm realistic as to what I'm waiting for.|`|uvcqPfuNaa	I would wait for the one. Today I broke up with my girlfriend because I realized in the end we weren't really that similar and I wasn't in love with her. I now have a friend who I realize we have a lot more in common but I will see what happens and if we become more than friends or not although at the moment she likes another guy.|`|no1w7AVJaa	good question im trying to decide that myself right now,do i stay in my ok relationship or move on and wait it out?
AA11542500	You have to tell him you can't afford to go out so much.  Just tell him you like him and like hanging out with him but the things you all do are getting too expensive for you.  Either he offers to pay for you or you find stuff to do that doesn't cost money. It's really that easy.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	Fun doesn't have to cost money. Offer alternatives that don't cost any money like a picnic instead of a restaurant, or watching a DVD instead of going to the movies.    Or drinking Kool-Aid Instead of Alcohol.  OH YEAH!|`|AA10241705	Easy fix. Next time he wants to go out, tell him you can't afford to and suggest you stay home and do something for free (tv, game, whatever). You have to say no if you don't have the money. If he wants to go badly enough, he may offer to pay.|`|dZ3X26EOaa	ask him to pay or just brake up with him|`|lXt26g0gaa	Well darlin, if he cared about you, and had respect for you, he would offer to pay for you.  Any man who can't pay for himself and his girl is no man.  And you have to be honest with him and tell him how you feel.  Otherwise, find someone who is willing to pay for you.|`|sZePlWTQaa	I don't know how old you are, but guys usually pay. It shows they care. After awhile you tend to go back and forth with paying and then it becomes both.    Why not just offer to hang out where it doesn't cost money? When you mention a place, just say in there that its free or u don't need to spend a lot there. Maybe he will get the hint? And hey- if he wants to go somewhere where its costing and you really can't then just tell him no you can't go bc the money right now. After you don't show a few times he will pay or offer to hang elsewhere too.|`|nzCxfFNyaa	dont offer to pay
c2aC15ZFaa	just talk with him|`|Ll0iQG5Naa	get to know him better|`|mHZvOhsDaa	tell him how you feel and your concerns.. say you felt dumped/rejected because you thought you were getting somewhere and then he went and got some1 else.. if you want to give him another chance you just set him straight, tell hiim you love him and want to try to work something out. if he says no, then your gonna have to get over him :/    help with mine?|`|zHwSyDNfaa	talk to him|`|Nj58Vi62aa	just try it again! i know your hurt, but clearly theres still feelings!!|`|jxseTHg7aa	tell him how you feel about the situation|`|3f4jZwLlaa	give him one more chance but if he screws this up then you should tell him that you are not falling for it again and that he has broken your heart way too many times before.|`|4nZb9oqKaa	give him a chance.. life is to short .. he doesnt seem nice but just give it a go see what happens say to him ok lets try talking but if it doesnt work then|`|BoXghyRvaa	he's a jerk and he is going to continue doing hurtful things to you if you do go out seriously this has happened with two of my exes.|`|XkRGEnL4aa	don't let yourself fall for anyone so hard again until you trust them and actually know them better.  it doesn't sound like you know him enough to trust him with your heart yet.  so let it go slowly.  talk to him about it and see how it goes.    if it's meant to be, then you'll end up together|`|f4wDSdyPaa	give him a chance because three strikes and he is out so give him this one last chance and if he does the same thing leave him alone for good and you could even exchange some words with him just to show him how serious you are so go ahead|`|iThrz9P1aa	Well i have been in this situation i am giving the guy i like another chance so mybe u should to.He was totally flirting wit me and then i knew he like me cause he told my best friend.I found out that he got a gf over the weekend i was sooo maden he broke up wit her and now we might go out simple as that.?

2MVxXx1eaa	dont tell them|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It doesn't make sense, if you truly love someone you'll never be at rest until you're proud enough to say it out loud.

Then write a note to him oh and when he reads the note try to see if he is happy like does he get a smile on his face. Look if how he throws or keeps the note. Do not write your name on the note. Tell the guy to meet at a special spot then see if he comes and if he does give him a kiss. Then see his reaction if he slaps you then at least you got a lip kiss but if he dosn't then wow nice.|`|YBxhs597aa	if you love them tell them let them know  cuz if you keep it inside it sucks!    if you don't do this, just avoid them until you stop loving them.  :)  good luck|`|Ddfff5psaa	Simple....

ReH5EoR0aa	I think it is funny but might be a mean thing if you told everyone.     That would be a joke between you two only, unless he tells himself.    My ex husband made us all laugh so much one time when he put on an old lady's girdle and wig and danced around - even his mom - it was funny!   He liked being funny for us and made me like him more for that reason.|`|tfE0i20Daa	Thats horrible to do.|`|9yNkKat5aa	I wouldn't enjoy it, but hey, if it makes the girl happier... :)|`|o1woHm1Uaa	I'm a guy and I would do it.

uNJirnYoaa	geeze what are you a high school freshman?  quit being a drama queen and get over it.  he said he didn't want a gf but he makes his sn about you.  sounds like you both like drama and he can't decide what he wants. but i guarantee you, if JLO walked into his bedroom he'd be givin her more than 5 minutes|`|2ieiGIhTaa	You used so many abbreviations in your question that I have no idea what you are getting at.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Probably not. Girls are suppose to wait on guys to make the move, not try to force it. If a move is never made they are not intereted, you made him make a decision on the spot. Someday if hes interested when you two are older he will make his intentions known. Dont chase, itll feel good someday when someone chases you insted.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	He's not mean.. He's not interested.    You sound young.|`|zHwSyDNfaa	talk to other guys|`|7NJ8lKNEaa	its his choice!move on...hes not a lost.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	when someone you have a romantic interest in rejects you, they aren't being mean. It means they aren't interested in you the same way you are interested in them.  You can't make someone like you. They either do, or don't.  Just like you don't like all the guys who like you.    He's probably keeping distance from you, since he knows you like him more than he likes you, and it makes him feel uncomfortable.    Move on. There are LOADS of nice guys out there, especially at your age. Don't waste your time with someone who isn't interested in you.|`|WvRTxbdoaa	who really cares?  not me|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	well he seems to really like you, but knows he hurt you by rejecting you.. if i were you, i'd wait a while and see how things happen a month or so from now.|`|Ly0VVzU2aa	he doesnt seem that into you.  like maybe hes just keeping you as a backup   if i were you i wouldnt let him know hes getting to you.  you deserve better..Good Luck =)|`|22EVxBYWaa	hes prolly just kind of like, getting used to the fact that you like him. dont be too clingy but also dont let him go. he'll get used to it and u'll both be frans again    answer minee?? go to my profile && click on da latest question ive asked. plz && thank youu(:|`|tMsCXngvaa	move on|`|ANC7G909aa	welll i think that you should consider the possibility htat he might not actually want to date you right now. but like you said, you could end up together in the future. you sound pretty youge, so maybe its forthe better. you can date when your a little older and really aprichiate it and love each other. you should try and get over him for now, but keep him in the back of your mind|`|VF9ocPGWaa	hes trying to show you through his actions that he is not interested. you'll get over it, and this wont be the first and only time in your life where you will be worked up over a boy.Just think the first will be the worst, and the second time around will be easier to deal with, only because you dealt with the feelings before.|`|CNu77YPiaa	he is so lucky to have a girl be interested but he is gay don't listen to ANYONE that says he isn't interested because there is no such thing as a guy who isn't interested. if a guy is not interested it is because he is gay. period.|`|1fjXNY7Waa	no way, grl you best not be taking that. yo dont ned him! fo shizzle    god, I wish some people on here would grow up|`|2qJdFmDFaa	he probably just feels awkward. that happens when someone is rejected or has to rejected someone. he's not mean. he might just not feel comfortable.
goe3y4FPaa	hes always seems to run into u, always looking,smiling, talks to u, acts shy, flirts with u,etc..|`|qfzcSWCnaa	i think it depends on the guy.  some get really shy or nervous, some try and act all cool to impress you, and others act all childish and tease you about stuff. you can also tell if he talks about u a lot with his friends...|`|XCsOfk79aa	well all the guys that i no that like me and the guys that ive dated all did the following    1.Hugged Me  2.Attacked Me When Another Guy Tried To Talk To Me Or Something  3.Stare At Me  4.Stalked Me   5.Walked With Me To Class  6.Wouldnt Stop Talking To Me  7.Act Like They Dont Like You When By Doing That They Do    yea... but not all guys r the same,like once this rlly hot guy   (haha,it okay to not read on anymore but who nos.. a guy might do this to u)  he became friends with me then one day i was leaning against the wall with my back and he walked over and wraped his arms around me and kissed me,it was a big shocker that he did that but it was sooo sweet.Then I broke up with him.. i felt kinda bad but watever wats done is done [:|`|FWUrJuzYaa	nervous|`|tnznR01paa	-He'll look at you a lot  -Talk to you a lot  -Try to make you laugh a lot    Aha, a lot of a lot's. xD|`|YBxhs597aa	if he acts stupid  some guys go out of their way to impress a gal they like  and look dumb    if he tocuhes you  if he's agressive    lots of stupid things|`|lWNlvU50aa	he smiles at you creepy like  he smells you when your nnot looking  he secretly cuts a lock of ur hair off from ur armpits  he accasianally eats your pencil shavings  he offors to give you a foot rub  he licks you  he DOESN'T talk to you  he smells like bull crap just for you  he meets your grandma, and has tea with her  he eats your lunch in the girls bathroom stall/or the urinal  he make you creepy love notes saying he will kill you one day  he buys u a red apple that is poisined  he makes a shirt with u and his face on it in a heart  lastly, he cuts out a section of his underwear, and places thet fabric in your notebook.|`|tXdFfy1Jaa	staring (seriously some guys are pathetic and stair Straight at you)|`|Q3eORl9Yaa	shyness thats how mine was he will avoid you as much as possible ... un less yuor a nerd (0:|`|9tBQJcthaa	they will stare at you (your FACE, not your body) and when you look at them they will look away.    they will smile    act nervous    when you talk to them, they might be really nervous/anxious    just smile at them and say hi and they will go nuts for u|`|16O8Gs4vaa	he would try talking to you as much as he can.    -text  -in person.    would get his friends to talk to you.
Fi8AIi4baa	Maybe a combination of both.  He thinks you're really pretty, at any rate.|`|AA10614910	He can be shy and like you at the same time. Not sure what the question title means...  he might like you, or he might be a socially awkward person. He probably likes you as a t least a friend if he attempted conversation|`|tMsCXngvaa	from what you've said, im pretty sure he likes u but hes obviously shy so YOU are going to have to make the first move =] good luck!|`|kBRbVsdqaa	he was nervous, he just didn't know what to talk about. I have the same problem and the guy I like. he's super loud! but when he sees me he gets shy and nervous. which is adorable! lol. But yeah, he's shy and nervous when he is probably around you. so tal kto him more or sometihng|`|2vS7qaZLaa	agree with first answer|`|1SK6qPA6aa	ok first thing, ALL guys are shy at that age (i.e. my age) lol like i swear to god if Pamela Anderson was my age, walked up to me and just started to  flirt me i would like just act stupid and walk away. but if she kept talking to me later on and we kinda got to know eachother i might actually ask her for her number. it may just be me but i like to get to know girls before i ask them out. i dont know keep talking/flirting with that guy and see where it takes you.
bdDmm5isaa	I would probably date you!?!? LOL. i just checked my answers and you kinda said the same thing!!! LOL!!!
VBtGkOCWaa	because you through money around ,and dumb at the same time|`|y4VWVD94aa	Because they were used to all the same race in their home town? And they like americans better? Idk.|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	brb going to Australia and Europe|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Cos they think we American guys are hott!    Actually, cos its different, and I heard that American guys seem to treat women better than those foreign guys|`|UtYllvFcaa	dude ur ? can mean a lot of different things and i dont get it one bit|`|VJcypcIhaa	People like people that are different than they are used to.    American girls like accents from everywhere else, just like Europeans.    Everyone likes to change things up. :)|`|onXmufvWaa	They want a visa|`|IHzv611caa	Xenophilia happens.
PwOgrFk9aa	You should ask her.  And to show how much you like her, start trying to learn sign language.  She would appreciate it and I think that if you try that, it will definitely work.  Try it.
TLim2pBTaa	I don't think that you should tell him. If there were no feelings involved and it was just a peck you should keep it to yourself. Just try not to put yourself in a situation like that again.|`|jmYl4hEFaa	Well it's hard to say what one should or shouldn't do but in my opinion I think that your boyfriend has a right to know what happened you just need to tell him that it didn't mean anything and explain your point of view and hope that he understands.
VbFEvDL7aa	Your lucky, most times guys just want to use you for sex haha.    (:    Hang in there, Mr. Right will come when you are ready :P|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Jeez, will you RELAX already!    You are barely out of childhood and you see yourself as practically over the hill.    Don't plan on having a relationship of any real significance with any male less than twenty-five.  They just are not mature, nor ready for a woman and responsibility in their lives.    Finish your degree.  By the time you are 21 you can start to look around, but give yourself a chance to grow up!  You have an entire lifetime ahead of you.  Trust me...in a year or two, this will be ancient history.|`|esbs4tPSaa	9 months is pretty long, I suppose that was your vacation! Now to le question, you should find comfort in guys that you like and are your type, or even show interest in the guys that like you and then from there work out the details and experiences in-between.    The thing with guys is that you need to trust each other, and also find a sweet genuine guy that will take care of you and not hurt you deeply. No one likes that.    Don't think about it too much, just go in there and be natural about this, also over thinking this will lead to you wanting to stay single for a lot longer or giving up altogether.    Good luck ^_^|`|qCx0qXdfaa	just remember that what your doing to the guys that like you is exactly what your complaining about with the other guys.    maybe give them a chance, you never know    and you have to stop searching for it.  it will find you.  it found me, and i NEVER expected to fall in love with the guy that i did, but i couldnt resist it.  im a freshman in college and i have more guy friends than girl friends cuz i hate drama, so i was constantly in the push and pull of the friend zone and romantic zone, so i know exaclty what your going through.  good luck!|`|GqTSa85daa	You need to deal with the trust issue.  It probably shows when interacting with these other guys.  What's wrong with just having guy friends until you get to that point where you know what you want in life.|`|S852p6SXaa	yeah im in the friend zone to..=/ but a its good to  have friends =)|`|Y0FBSSxZaa	sounds like you just need a break from guys for a while. if you just relax and live your life not worrying about this stuff then the right guy will come to you.|`|NitvYFhPaa	Don't just "deal with it." Get out there and make a move! And if it fails miserably . . . oh well . . . you've still got 2 other guys, right? =D|`|HWCAr4V2aa	Stop feeling close to the guys. Distance yourself, don't give them an idea that you are "one of the guys".      =)|`|h2JETkkEaa	I know exactly how you feel. I am always stuck in that situation. Like the whole having guys think of you as the friend and the knew that are awesome and like you, you only think of as a friend. People are right when they say the right guy will find you but it's so hard waiting. I have been single for so long and Im so k of waiting but there's not much else to do. Just don't give up.|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Well I think that you go after the guys you know you cant have sub consiously you do like them but your body yearns for want.... Maybe you should go for a guy that you are not interested in and teach your body to go after something you can have and then in the end it will hopefully all work out|`|qvNeo0G8aa	Short answer: Because you want what you can't have and rather than getting out there and meeting loads of guys you are happy to sit in your comfort zone and develop crushes on the guys who just happen to be IN your comfort zone.    DO NOT go looking for a relationship. Granted it may work out, but it is not healthy to pick up a boy because he'd make a great boyfriend. You need that natural attraction - flirtation - etc escalation.    You ever thought about the similarities between you, the guys you like and the guys who like you?  I mean.... YOU are to the FANCY GUYS as the FRIEND GUYS are to YOU (get it?)|`|AuWPMH44aa	I feel where your coming from. Im in that situation too. Girls just seem to see me as a friend. i stay trying to get more out of them but nothing ever happens. patience and time is the only thing. Just keep working at the guys you like and in time they will start liking you more than a friend too. That wat im doing as we speak. You can only give it time though. its been a good year almost that i havent been with a girl. it does kinda bug me but you just got to live life and have fun with it.|`|PkqSKt7Gaa	That the reason you like them, ya must have things in common and similar personalities.You trust your friends and you know them for a long time, the more time that goes passed the more you feel for them, mainly if your a girl with a boy best friend or close to at.I don't know about them not liking you, that you will have to ask them.You should give the guys that like you a chance you never know you might start to really like them.Hope this help's if not sorry!
DN3lPdE0aa	haha i did that on myspace before!!
fMf6CgGWaa	I am sorry to crush you but he is right that is what I always worry about. If you two break up and then never talk and you feel guilt. But you could still go for it just if you think it is not working well just tell him lets go back to being best friends. But That is what I think about all the time I have been friends with this guy to except for 4 and a half years and I like him and he likes me.
FvBpBR1faa	Start by saying hi, how are you? ask her questions about herself but don't ask to many. talk to her more and more everyday. You might become friends and then maybe more. Don't rush off it will take time.|`|LQb06Ugkaa	you could have the friends that ur friends with introduce u guys. or during lunch u could go up to the friends and talk to them, but compliment her or start saying something to her while you are there.
OIYDxK29aa	Guys like blondes with boobs.  Guys LOVE brunettes with brains.|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	Brunette  Brains~ looks don't always last forever...|`|YWdNTZU3aa	brunette/brains|`|TSoYN7hzaa	blonde    brains          & boobs
Ic6YekeWaa	don't worry about what your friends think...  race/ethnicity doesn't matter  as long as you find someone that you have a real connection with, it wouldn't matter if they were purple!!!!|`|0tU4jkS9aa	your friends may be racist.  thats not wierd, it just means....idk|`|2fYdY1fiaa	nah ur just probably not hot to most people   no im kidding man uh no its not weird|`|lf4RDGDAaa	s not wierd im white and hispanic guys always ask me out im starting to thin k hispanics are hot|`|zzpKGLaKaa	Thats not weird at all. :) It's perfectly fine! Race doesn't matter anyways.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Hey that's not true.   I think white girls are beautiful.   Usually their facial features are so clean cut and pure. If you take care of your self that is.   Hispanic/Black girls have the big butt and boobs....but I don't find it THAT attractive.   I am south asian and I get mistaken as hispanic, but I don't think I am like that. But anyway...I really think you are being too hard on yourself.   Nothing is wrong with white chicks.|`|TNNSHdypaa	Don't worry, your symptoms are quite normal.|`|13ZOEakYaa	no way. once you go black you never go back
fV9SawuPaa	I don't know we tend to stare off into space a lot, lol. No if he was looking at you that intently then obviously he thought you were very attractive. Also depends HOW he was staring at you. Was it in a curious, harmful way? Or mouth agape, drool forming, pervy way? Either way, let's just say he probably likes ya.|`|A65C8cmeaa	He most likely thinks your attractive, like us girls girls don't stare at guy we don't like are attractive.
0fcwsv7Vaa	No, and if i did im not going to walk up to her and ask her the name of her perfume.|`|feUMAvgLaa	nope|`|MgiK02Zbaa	wtf is that?
5zjwOSe9aa	You're just torn.    You want to get over your EX, by possibly dating this guy, which you don't totally feel right about. But at the same time you want your EX back, but you know that is over.    Time will clear things up...right now just don't commit to anything else    Answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|6gPTv8lOaa	just ignore it, ull get over this feeliign very soon
Fi8AIi4baa	It's actually probably because he's shy. I think he probably likes you. Even though you're shy, try to strike up a conversation. You never know.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Not really don''t get the point.|`|fIWzTzfFaa	Of course he likes you...no guy would take a pic with a chic if he didn't like her. Now go get him!!!!|`|sipXnwifaa	I would say there is a chance he likes you, but probably more likely that he enjoys flirting with close girl friends, thats what i like to do, and it is just because i am having a fun time with them and it probably isnt the best thing because it is bad to lead them on even when i dont try to...|`|PTXzRjtkaa	he may be interested in you.  nobody can tell what some1's heart is saying ok?   but i think you should keep talking to him.....  too bad my gf didn't like it when i touched her shoulder! haha|`|NEEVRp16aa	It sounds like he is trying to get something started with you.  Take your time and see how it goes.  Don't rush it.  Get to know him first before it goes to far.|`|aheO01Fgaa	Of course! Aha! So sweet! You should date!|`|zCS9KpIWaa	yes|`|kTvn2Nltaa	yes. and for any other of you teenage girls out there that have questions about a guy liking you... PLAY HARD TO GET AND THEY WILL COME RUNNING BACK... good luck|`|1awiFO6paa	ther is a chance  but there might not be if he is a flirt|`|z4yvGNQ0aa	Okay I know how u feel but see, me and this guy were doing the same thing and he's told me he things im hot and every thing and he made me take pix of him then was like "do you like this one if you do put it as you're wallpaper on your phone" then when id take it off he'd tell me to put it back on lol.  but now he has a girl.  i thought we liked eachother but we didnt  be carfull try to get those mixed signals straightend out. like me. :}|`|kxwNLUI1aa	he definatly likes you, dont mention that him stopping by ur locker is akward, just ask him out if u like him, be casual|`|AVs3DHEIaa	gurl! this guy likes you why else would he come to ur locker, and wanta take a pic? but make sure he does, signs: touching, flirting, eye contact. u know all those signs... good luck!  -Cupid

hMZQd7Cpaa	Talk to her easiesttt way to go. If yu just start ignoring shell notice something wrong. Remind her everything yu guys have gone thru for her to jst act like that. & if seh doesnt do anything about it then thats it shes not a real bestfriend shes a fake Bitc*|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Don't be hating take it from old skool it's time to put friends as close as your enemy but watch your back because they will need you before you'll need them|`|njSyZh0Aaa	WOW!! You should talk to her about gettting left behind... I would die if amber ever did that to me she is my BFFL|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	I think what you should do is just find some new friends. Obviously, your friends have decided to move on and you should too.
i0yQ3Xbtaa	I don't know. He probably likes you and is afraid to ask you out. He may be afraid of what people might think of him.|`|KcloaW4vaa	I would prob back off a little and get little nervous but, wut can i do. I would try to stay relaxed i guess. Maybe he does like u but i cant tell.
SweWC8p1aa	girls arent usually suppose to ask guys out.. but if you want to anyways, you should just ask him :P or write him a cute poem. or give him a the candy heart that says WILL U B MY VALENTINE? or a bear with a card that says will u b my valentine.  Good luckkk
71VRvldJaa	I don't necessarily think she's lying to you but I do think she's playing head games with you.  If it's been off and on for about a year, how much longer and you going to be willing to play this roller coaster ride game with her.  She sounds very young and fickle and I'd be letting anything she said to me go in one ear and out the other.  She doesn't know what she wants!  Don't make yourself vulnerable to her my making any more emotional investment in her.  You're just going to get hurt!|`|MEr99qKraa	forget about all that IT'S OVER..ur confusing urself by continuing to pursue her ur not listening to what she said to u take a hint|`|gp1hvwZZaa	My friend you have to move on. The cycle of breaking up and getting back together is only going to continue if you two get back together. You're wasting your time and she already let you know this when she said don't wait for me. You could be spending your time doing other positive things instead of worrying so much about her. In time you will find someone better, it will hurt but at least you are not wasting anymore of your time. Remember she's not the only one for you. If she's talking serious with another guy it just shows you that she knows you're not the only one for her. About her lying to you she doesn't even know what she wants so let her live her own confused life and set your path in a another direction, one where you will no longer be confused.    Now go out there and have some fun you need to be distracted! Too much worrying is no good.
eZQ22qHFaa	ugly girls are desperate the better ones might like you but you have to go after them|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	maybe your acting unavailable or women are afriad to approach you because you seem like u have high standars or maybe the "hot chicks" just arent that into u ..
3sI6AQFgaa	maybe your attracted to personality more than looks. and maybe the gorgeous girls are scared to get at you because youre so attractive and they dont want to get rejected. dont worry youre not gonna settle for someone that your not attracted to, eventually youll find someone.    please answer my question.|`|Ti476VHkaa	Ugly girls need love too  lol|`|j5cotsxzaa	Just be yourself becuase i no i always go for the guys who act them selvies not somone else and i no what you mean (i am not being rude or anything) but i am pretty hot i am a cheerleader and all the guys love me.

I dont ask the guys.Im too scared. Maybe there just scared  good luck|`|KfouRJrDaa	I heard the average ones usually end  up being super hot after highschool or when college starts.|`|1uRUaSblaa	Since you are an attractive guy, why wait for the real gorgeous girls to come to you? Why don't you make  the 1st moves instead? I'm sure you should be pretty successful, from what you wrote here.Maybe also work on having a charming personality. Looks are not everything.|`|PZ9hlsBiaa	maybe they think you're too good for them ;) you try making the first move, most girls like confident guys lol|`|ESpDvx6Daa	you sould go up to the hot chicks|`|NBQijhIfaa	coooooooooooooooonnnnnceited much???|`|3QG6WLXXaa	maybe you need a makeover|`|xlbMRcesaa	LOL you'll find the right girl eventually. Try dating the average girls, they aren't that bad!!|`|KPKv5hwqaa	Have you every thought that maybe girls don't usually ask out the guy. How about YOU ask HER.|`|VC3YXawhaa	Hmmm... You're waiting for hot girls to flock to you? Sounds to me like you're just a wimp......Why don't YOU try to go get the pretty girls...?|`|4GZ8agzjaa	try'n 2 b n a relationship isnt all bout da looks didnt sum1 eva tell u dat|`|pqlhPnexaa	The thing is, it's usually the ugly girls who are more desperate and therefore more obvious about being attracted to you. The hot girls usually have more guys interested in them in general (probably a lot of them have boyfriends, too), so they're not likely to be as desperate to want to get with you (even if you are as attractive as you say).    You could try approaching one of the gorgeous girls, or you could hold your breath and bite your tongue and let yourself date ugly people. Because seriously, some of them are NOT that bad.|`|ZCxwtU3Haa	uh, try going up to them.  most girls don't go up to guys!|`|3lb2sYiZaa	well if your shallow n such then thats why "beautiful women" dont like you|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	don't settle my BROTHER . that's when you'll fall for the ugliest of them all . you seem to be confident but with a little low self esteem (if you know what i mean) . you need to go where the pretty chicks are the mall, church, wal-mart. one other thing you need to know is you will have to spend some money on the pretty ones . but it ain't tricking if you got it. get yo paper up & they will come .|`|ATxbz7IXaa	I think this is quite insulting. If your so-called gorgeous girls aren't attracted to you, you must have some personality problem. First, change your attitude and your thinking. That might probably help your social life.|`|RqqAzFFEaa	Maybe you are not as handsome as you think!! Hahahahaha!!!|`|1XcTZRemaa	I'm sorry, but by saying that you 'know you're attractive' and the 'real gorgeous girls', it makes you sound rather unintelligent. :[ Anyway, it's possible that there have been pretty girls that have liked you but were too shy to make a move. I'd suggest flirting with some of the people YOU'RE attracted to, and see where that takes you. :] Don't lose hope! I'm sure there's someone out there who's perfect for you. Don't settle for anyone but who you love.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	well if your not attracted to them physically or mentally, then why would you be with them? your time will come, ur only seventeen, you've got a long while to figure it out.      plzzzz answer my most recent questioon!|`|MBqoeaEJaa	YOU UGLLLLLLLLLLAY!  don't believe everything your momma tells you :)|`|QrBhekNXaa	hahaha most pretty girls don't go up to hot guys cause they're intimidated i guess. the same thing happens for me though. the only people that actually come up and talk to me are just average. i think that you should put yourself out there in front of the gorgeous girls and start flirting. don't settle for less.|`|aheO01Fgaa	Maybe the pretty girls dont like you because you are shallow...? Idk...good luck with that! But i know that I would hate it if a guy called me ugly....... yeah.|`|UCd6blZgaa	I think you're really shallow and stupid.   no wonder hot girls don't like you.|`|IG4A4nuDaa	its that kind of personality my friend.

xoXkHOVsaa	Guys don't care about homecoming as much as girls.  Most guys either go with their girlfriends or friends who are girls.  So, if you are shy you need to make some guy friends and ask one to be your date.  They aren't going to ask someone they don't know, if they ask anyone at all.|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	no offense but if shy people dont talk to a guy    how can you expect a guy to know a lot about u or maybe they fear rejection or something|`|PXimiZCdaa	Its hard to read the shy girls, and guys usually wont ask a girl out if they expect to get rejected. Try to make it more clear/obvious that you're looking for someone to go with, or try being more friendly.
ptclgKl5aa	You sound a lot like the kind of girl that I'm looking for.  And I'm a pretty attractive, tall, athletic nice guy.

You need to take it nice and slow. Just start out helping a girl that's in one of your classes that you like. Like when she drops something, help her pick it up. If she needs help on a question, help her. Start small talk, but don't try to hang around her so much that she thinks you're stalking her. Just whenever you're around her, start a convo and before you know it, you'll be best friends. Repeat the process once you reach that point, but hang around her a little bit more than usual. Work your way up.|`|fc8OjMaPaa	you should be with someone because you want to not because your "friends" lame you
y0ZSj6ozaa	Well, unfortunately, you can't make him like you, but it sounds like he does. Maybe he is afraid to admit it to you. But since he is very comfortable with you, then act comfortable back and give it some time. Who knows, maybe over time when you get to know each other more, he will start to like you. But it sounds like he does. Just be yourself and follow your heart. And maybe you should sit down him him in person and just you and him talk and tell him it's ok if he doesn't feel the same, but you still want to be friends if he doesn't want anymore than a friendship. Worked for me. Goodluck
rd6eRnzTaa	technically yes because everyone says that once you have sex on ecstasy, it's never the same sober because it was so amazing while on E.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	No- and anyone who says so is lying or just so lousy at sex when they are sober they believe that.|`|eC1dwp2aaa	it will make it so that when you have sex other times it will never be as good. it will **** things up.
4M2QTN8faa	yeah it hapened alot   the same exact thing actually. it old this guy i loved his pants and his sweater and he wears them like ALL the time     it think its so cute what guys would do for our attention|`|lL3BzDslaa	Maybe he feels that he wants to get ur attention and im pretty sure he liked ur comment...  lets just hope he washes those pants|`|65RqEpcraa	hahahahahahaha lol!!!!!!!!! I know who it is!
gw0kP8vTaa	ok there is a huuuuuuge difference. there are however  two stages of love. The 1st is being in love. The second is loving someone. You can love someone, that doesnt mean that your in love with them. Love is accepting all the flaws that come with a person, You may at times think you want to kill that person but that doesnt stop you from loving them. love does not have to be a physical attraction. You can fall in love with someone through there personality. The more you get to know them, the more you find attractive. Obviously physical attraction is important, however lust is not love. Lust is purely a description of a physical attraction. Its the desire to have sexual contact with a particular person, be it kissing a person, sleeping with them.. you get my drift. But giving into the desire will not make that person fall in love with you. For a person to fall in love, they fall in love with your personality.. so it doesnt matter how many times you sleep with them or dont sleep with them etc... its not gonna make abit of difference. yeh you could Lust and love a person at the same time. for example my best friend whos a guy tells me he loves me, it literally tears him up if he knows i've been out with a guy for a drink, and i know he lusts after me. However i know its more than lust from his reactions. So yeah you can probably love and lust aftersome. However Lust is more of longing sexual desire. Not a word I would use if you was talking about two people in a relationship. I would not say they both lust after each other because its not a long awaited sexual desire.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Lust is when you cannot wait to get her into bed, love is when you can.  lol|`|X58gVB7Eaa	Lust is the physical attraction you have of the other person, for example: the way that person looks.   Yes most people feel lust before actually 'falling in love.'  Love has a different definition for everybody. Most definitions include being comfortable with the person where they can ask them or tell them anything. Also being yourself in front of that person could also be a sign of love. Yes people can feel both love and lust about the same person. I have felt the both for someone before.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Lust may turn into love, just as love can turn into lust.    Relationships take time/dedication, and a foundation of friendship & trust.    When all of the ingredients combine- it makes for a FABULOUS romance! =)|`|tgLiEZKTaa	Love is when you take a shower after sex. Lust is when you wipe it on the curtains then go home|`|IlRkozZnaa	lust: sex attraction  love: nothing matters than being 2gether no matter what ppl say or do. Not necessary sex|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Lust is a simple chemical thing.  You want to have sex with them!    Love is something that will last a long long time. It's emotional more than chemical. You can love someone without lusting after them-such as your parents, siblings, friends etc.  You will love them even if they are very sick or lose their legs or whatever.    You can lust after someone you love as well.      I've lusted after people, I've loved people, and yes, I've felt both ways about a person.    The best marriages are those where the people love AND lust for each other.    Sometimes you can lust after someone, then discover you love them as well.    But sometimes you can learn you love someone, before you lust after them.  It doesn't always work that you lust for someone, THEN fall in love.
oa5Xfs4Xaa	They're your parents, I'm sure they will be fine with whoever you have chosen. My ex brought me over when I met her parents and we had thanksgiving together, which was fine by me. It depends on your parents though, her parents were pretty outgoing and funny, and we watched TV while we ate.    I suggest just telling them straight up that you want them to meet your new boyfriend, and if you think they'll act awkward, don't have a dinner. Just have them meet him at the door if you think it would be awkward.    Good luck. =D|`|2hhGgKBZaa	OK relax hun!! It happens to everyone, don't be scared!    Your family should give him a chance, if not purely because you like him and they want you to be happy!    Maybe invite him over for dinner, but beforehand give him an idea of how it goes at your house so he's prepared. Your parents will probably ask him questions, but maybe ask them to try and not ask him anything to make him uncomfortable.     Speak to both your parents and boyfriend and prepare them, it should go smoothly so dont worry! Good luck :)|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Ask your mom if you can bring a guy over to dinner one of these nights. Parents like to see the interests of their children, so it should be okay. Tell your boyfriend to bring flowers. It worked well for me. It can can be kind of awkward at first, but the ice will break, and if he is a nice guy, then they will see that. everything will be fine.|`|zIjoaj3Baa	Honestly, I'd just tell them straight up. Tell them you want them to meet a friend and ask if you can have him over for a nice little dinner. Nothing big, just something so everyone can get acquainted. Don't be nervous, something as simple as dinner with the parents isn't bad at all.|`|TyWPCqEraa	OK so first things first, i would suggest having the meeting at home, your parents will be at ease in their own comfortable environment and  the fact that they have control calms them, second if you have any siblings make sure that they are there to take the pressure off of you and your significant other. Pre-warn him about your parents likes and dislikes before you guys arrive, make sure he wears his best clothes, don't dress him yourself, allow a little of his own personal style come forth through his appearance but be clean cut while doing it.     Make sure he knows to be calm and not rigid your parents will notice the nervousness off the bat and they will be on him like blood hounds. make sure he brings up all of his strong points in conversation but not to Much so he sounds arrogant, and also tell him to make sure he doesn't insult you in front of them at all, even if they are taking a crack at you don't let him say anything other then the chuckle along with theirs, and no reprimanding you at the first meeting, just simple casual conversations.     Ooh and make sure he brings something over, dessert flowers, whatever, just make sure its something appropriate. good luck!    And just because your their daughter doesn't mean they have to accept him, its going to be hard work but as long as he does the right things and he's a good guy he shouldn't have a problem, and PS i would tell your parents you to are dating before the meet just in case anything slips during dinner.
RrzfZP8laa	i think the age is okay.  and you're not sure that she has a bf you just THINK.  just go grab the drink, see happens but just dont expect too much.  HAVE FUN! :]
LhcN7Ygraa	its not really appearance wise but what REALLY turns me off     is when a girl smells like rotten stinky fish :(|`|LkRivHpTaa	turn on eyes    turn off std, acne, nastyness|`|AuWPMH44aa	A turn off is too much make up. alittle isnt bad but too much is a turn off. a turn on is just being yourself, have fun|`|OULT64VJaa	Dislike: Pretty girls who are self center|`|8BVEoMBraa	Be all bitchy to me and wooo im ONNN!! OH AND IF YOU WANNA TURN ME OFF TOUCH MY EAR ewwwy i hate when people do that!|`|mfFh1OAgaa	too much makeup.     guys dont like make -up unless say they have a greasy face.    only say the eye stuff.  also smell nice as well but not too strong.    have nice hair not greasy and not an awful fake tan either natural or not.    please anser mine    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|MLvqdUwLaa	insecurity. plain and simple. any ailment a girl may think she has only becomes annoying when they have to have someone disprove it to make them feel better. be confident and outgoing.
f6GNmjP3aa	Well if you are able to go to a store after school you could get him like a card or a small animal. When I was in grade six I gave a book of all the e-mail that we sent to each other.|`|j2VzMW22aa	candy and a ecard!! :D i wish i had a bf....|`|15Zr5voMaa	i would get him chocolate like reg cause it would be weird if you got him one w/ hearts on it. and omg is oh my gosh not omgsh|`|TwwMtHBxaa	a teddy bear and candy plus that e-card. thats what I did in 6th grade|`|II5ei8MTaa	well guys are hard to shop for. i would say definitely send him an ecard.  why did you mention the braces?  braces work for some kids|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	maybe chocolate and a card?|`|I5wje0J1aa	In my opinion you are too young to have a boyfriend but I'm not you. Go out and have fun. Do a Movie, Picnic, a hike, or whatever. Do chocolates. I know your parents know about him. I would think they would read your body language.|`|sUn45rWwaa	wow!! lol i was in 6th grade last year and i jus got im a card and gave him a hug....lol he didn't get me anythin!!|`|KoSYMa2laa	hummmm....sixth grade....wow I miss those days.  He'll be happy with just a card or maybe a stuffed animal that says happy valentine's day.  Right now just keep it simple.|`|kh29r5Yjaa	Instead of giving him something,  condsider taking away something from him ;)  (AKA virginity)|`|Amnjqfk0aa	just tell your parents first of all. and second get him some chocolates or a little teddy bear thats what i did in grade 6. ecard aswell.   i got the accrynom. :P    just a question what did the braces have to do with it?|`|7dXyTU7Laa	ahahah.  how cute .  Don't get him too much. Maybe just an origami heart with some writing ?  something simple but sentimental (:|`|lo0SpHzNaa	One of those giant hershey kisses.  And why would a 13 year old boy want  a stuffed teddy bear?!
ilyv0UxLaa	You could always make him a batch of his favorite cookies!  If you want to get creative, decorate sugar cookies like his favorite kinds of sports. For example, soccer balls, basket balls, baseballs...etc.  Get creative and have fun!  Good luck girl!|`|35b68CkJaa	Hm,does he like football?  Well get him a real jersey from his favorite team!  There a little pricey,but it's a very nice gift and I got my boyfriend one!    xoxo,?blondie?|`|37U0P66naa	ask him what he would like to have. just say ur just wondering so u can surprise him on valentine's day. get him what he tells you what he wants in general.|`|oDaDcDZpaa	well you said he loves sports so trier to get roses or something and a kiss at the end.|`|LkRivHpTaa	a teddy bear
rN0b4jWHaa	That's cute lol but you like boil water and put it in a bowl and let the steam hit your face, its kinda hard to explain o.O googleing it might help but its good for your pores [:|`|l344RtC8aa	i used to boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and turn the flam off and when the Steam started coming up i would put my face over it and have a towel covering my head and draped over the pot too and the steam would hit my face and it would also be very relaxing but make sure your face isnt too close to the pot to get burned  another way is to but a very DAMP face towel in the microwave for a few secondas and just ley it on yoru facve a repeat    after, make sure you wash your face though:):)  worked for me!
XH2o1MM6aa	.Ask him 2day but make sure first if he's not already seen the movie.@day could be your lucky day
eO4y3m1maa	Im sure he just doesn't know what to do with that information. You should just go up to him and ask him how he is doing! Boys at that age have NO idea whats going on, you could be leaning over in a short skirt looking at him with a big smile...and he would have no idea what you are doing! haha     I talked to a boy I had a crush on in 7th grade, even though I was so obvious about it ..he thought when my friend told him it was a joke...now he feels like an idiot cause he thinks about it now it was SO obvious.|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	maybe he feels awkward around you because he knows you know that he knows that you like him. complicated lol
uFJXz1x3aa	u might not know if hes the right one? or maybe your just scared of getting hurt?..its perfectly normal...unless thats not your question    if you KNOW u love him, maybe your just being shy when u say it? maybe your not attached enough yet|`|SlOU6v3Zaa	drunk dial him.. when drunk you tell everyone you love them.. that will break the ice... then you'll probably have sex. and that's always a plus in my book|`|0CEOMRGbaa	i was the same way. you'll get use to it!    good luck!|`|X58gVB7Eaa	If you feel the same way, just say it. You will be relieved and happy you did.
SNaxiArHaa	They are all like that but then feel like they can confront you but you can't confront them. By boyfriend does the same things and it hurts but I keep trying till he cracks and we can work it out. He will usually say "not now" or "another time ok?" or my favorite one (sarcasm) "Just leave it alone, its nothing". It pisses me off so much
cheXY6NEaa	Have fun|`|TaVsnhkIaa	LMFAO  goodluck(: aha|`|wE2etBzbaa	Get a tranny, so she can say she had threesome with another man, and you can say you had threesome with another woman.    lucky bastard for having 3some with another girl.  even if I knew where to find girls, I won't tell you.|`|sZePlWTQaa	craigslist.com|`|exFsWQy7aa	bang bang    ;)  lol|`|cW7RXq8Qaa	Try Myspace. There are tons of willing girls on there. Especially if you join an online sex group, there are some in every area.|`|vMtsimijaa	Just wanted to say: Bang, bang, bang, skeet, skeet.
xJBJn6dOaa	Yes, my boyfriend all through college started out as a one night stand. Well, we were friends... but hooked up randomly after I broke up with my high school boyfriend and we were at a party together. I ended up going home with him and we had sex.... the next night, the same thing happened. Turns out, we just were really attracted to each other and it was bound to happen. We only broke up so we could explore other options after college.|`|TV3aH15kaa	well i met this girl on a trip to new mexico. we went to my hotel, got tipsy. made out heavily, had sex, and went our separate ways. i kept thinking of her so i called her and then she was my girlfriend it lasted about a month cuz i cant work with long distance relationships|`|f8auCNQvaa	OH ****.. hahaha   Yes I have. We we're at some Memorial 3 Day weekend lock-down at a friend's house where we couldn't leave for 3 days (unless you worked). Well rekindled a friendship and one thing led to another..     He started coming to my work and finally asked me out. We were together for almost 6 months until I went off to college and he as well.   So it just happened. And it was great while it lasted =)
THIvlI4waa	No, because it's normal.   I  personally look at the shoes of a guy, if the shoes are hot, then I'm liking the guy, but if their not, that's a huge turn off. Clothes are good as long as he knows whats suits him.|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	it is a turn off only if it is like everywhere and red and *****, then it is gross...........muscles are a turn on especially arms|`|01wTbVEMaa	Well if it's just 2-3 small zits then whatever, but full on acne, yes.|`|N53oHiwNaa	ok if there all over you face then yeah kinda ...but just in little spot its alright :) ok good hygine is a must i like when they have nice clothes and  nice arms omg are a major turn on ;)|`|tNSkgDMzaa	nah as long as you don't have  freakin hills on your face and your  cute i'll take ya lol    I luv a guy with muscles|`|cMrxyWQ0aa	No, its normal. We all  get it. Big deal.|`|ykPN1GCPaa	for acne to be a turnoff for me it has to be a lot. bad breath, stuff in teeth, B.O., and bad Hygiene are all turnoffs. i like punk/skaters styals, skater shoes, i don't like a lot of muscles.|`|OhqMdODUaa	ick. acne IS a turn-off, im sorry.  but your's doesnt sound too bad ;)    & i admit, im a wierdo ;D  i prefer skinny boys   with great style and pretty hair. lol|`|ma1zKpdpaa	yea mainly its kinda a turn off but sumtimes it cant be helped. its different for everyone (what they find attractive) but a sense of humour, being down to earth, fun, caring and generally a guy guy is pretty good.|`|wD7NtKMnaa	any girl who is going to reject a guy completely because of acne is ridiculous. it should definitely be about personality. looks matter but they arent everything.     if you are confident in yourself thats a big turn on.   guys who constantly need reassured of their masculinity are just annoying. as much as you hate to convince a girl she's pretty when she just won't believe you is just as irritating for us.     just be yourself :]|`|1awiFO6paa	ok  like all over ur face and huge and yuk!! that is kinda nasty  but is ok if u have a few of them, just dont be nervouse is kewl be ur self ..     and if it is like ervrywere and how i described it earlier  it might be a turn off.   and about the atractive part ill have to say the eyes|`|AA10813055	Acne really isn't that big of a deal for me. I mean everyone gets it pretty much. Maybe not as bad as someone others, but yeah...  It's not that much of a turn off. Turn offs for me would be stuff like... Bad hygiene, cocky, perverted, bad hygiene, and greasy hair.  I'm kinda big on the cleanliness.... Normally, the first thing I look at on a guy is his shoes. o_O No idea why, but I just do. If they have good shoes, then they're good to go. Never wear socks and flip flops. xD Strong and muscle-y arms are a big turn on. =]
ot3xCnsZaa	hey just be a good boy to her first be sweet so that he will agree to you and ask her "can i kiss you?just on your face?"say it sweetly|`|aIhiktYhaa	haha well my first kiss was when i was 13 at a festival on a crazy ride all i did was looked up at him and he just suddenly kissed me out of no where now that's something i will remember lol i'm not sure why guys automatically think gurls r gonna slap them lol just go in for it don't stew on it tho otherwise it makes u all nervous and stuff.. best to make it a peck for the first time and gradually work your way up to it.but if u wanna go in for the kill for a pash then remember don't slobber all over her!  oo  and go with the flow lol  Best of Luck!|`|OIcn7keJaa	4 months without kissing.. wow. hahah okay.. uhmmm    just hint at it.. get as close as you can.. and make sure she's comfortable.
qyGrk3BSaa	well of course it's bad. But really funny. Next time you go to the grocery store, have a not ready that says something like, I am really sorry about the damage I caused for you car, It was a complete accident.  And put it on the window and when your dad comes back he will spend hours looking for a dent.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	hahaha|`|iddQq042aa	Why not? It's a free world.
GqhtePhgaa	If she's not interested in your affections, there's no point in bringing Valentine's Day into the picture.  My suggestion at this point is to ignore the holiday and don't open the old wounds.  Not worth the hassle.  It really sounds like it's just time to move on.
qDpFSqn4aa	No, not that I can tell.  I've been fooled too many times in my life (51 years) and I've learned not to judge people by the sound of their voice or anything else.  Even looks can be deceiving.  Don't judge fat people by the sound of their voice or laugh in this case.  If you ever saw the movie "Police Academy" you could see this little chubby black woman on it who has this tiny quiet voice and it sounds nothing like what you'd imagine.    Hope this answers your question.|`|0utZQuyeaa	No. That is ridiculous.|`|q9LxIdJzaa	no?? fat ppl laugh just the same as skinny ppl.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	Usually the laugh is muffled by all the food being stuffed into their mouth...|`|xnVMXi6Gaa	No way|`|nljHInxOaa	hahaha i love yahoo the questions are unbelivable lol, nah dont think ur able to tell if somone is fat by the way they laugh lol, ha this is class lol|`|nzCxfFNyaa	yea lol   8 - ]|`|P3gwELLcaa	She has a heavy undertone to her voice. Not always like an obvious mannish laugh but I find she has the loudest and still i don't know has that deepness to it.  Not always though. I have a heavy friend and she laughs just fine! =D
PO5Q7POuaa	So I am going to attempt to help you and hopefully I do, okay? =)  First of all it all depends on your personality. If you're really outgoing or comfortable talking to him just talk to him in person, and make him laugh and what not =). But if you're shy around him you could always smile at him when you see him or my personal favorite...MSN. On MSN you can talk to him without being a total complete wreck in front of him because he can't see how panicky you might really be, right? =)  Just remember to be yourself, don't try to change yourself to get a boy to like you because what's the point of him liking you if it's not the real you.  Have fun and flirt!|`|es3feuhxaa	talk to him, smile, make eye contact..|`|qyZhzCJTaa	Make eye contact, then give him a big smile!   Little things like, when your sitting beside him, turn your legs a litte towards him & carrying yourself confidently.  Things like that go along way!
69qn7muFaa	Oh my goodness, of course you will.  You're 17, and you have a ton of time before you.   It's okay that you're not a social guy, i mean..  People who aren't very social, still have friends and family who love them right?  You'll find someone who loves you for you and will think you're amazing. Don't worry so much, your time will come. :)
ca6pFETbaa	work out bro..... but 162 for your height is a little on the chubby side if you dont work out.....
oI46t9lVaa	tell him that you love him wrap your arms around him and tell him how much you love him sorry if im repeating myself :) hope he feels better soon|`|qaz2y3NGaa	tell him your the girl in the relationship and you should be crying not him. rub some dirt on it kiddo.
HOQp0gA7aa	If things are not working out with the new boyfriend, then by all means it should be fine to break up with him.  Tell him you don't feel like it's working out the way you want, and that it's not him but it's you and your expectations.      However, dumping your current boyfriend just so you can run off to your ex boyfriend is a silly and stupid mistake in my estimation.  People for some dumb reason keep failing to understand that someone became their ex for a reason.  Unless you somehow enjoy jumping into doomed relationships for some reason: Why in the world would you return to an ex?    I fail to understand what good to you think will come from chasing after your ex again.  I can pretty much guarantee that whatever caused you to break up originally will eventually surface again and cause you both to break up over and over again as long as you two return to each other.  People just can't get the hint on this point for some reason.    So to summarize, if the current relationship is not working feel free to break up with him.  Steer clear of the ex like he was trying to give you AIDS.    I hope this helps.|`|99bOvJ0Zaa	seriously, just be like your a cool guy..tell him alot of commpliments, but then say but i dont think i can like you anymore than i already do..it just wont work out...    be nice about it! and do it over the phone or in person
CA9OFT4Waa	if she plays with her hair, and laughs a lot for no reason|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Just she get silly or shy around you.|`|GmGogzsXaa	smiling blushing eying you and giggling after looking at you|`|aRDXTWIDaa	You'll catch them staring at you.  And if they're the more outgoing type, flirting with you.  But you don't need to wait and see if they like you, sometimes we're scared to show it if we like someone. You just gotta try to ask em out and see what happens.|`|40HpQquSaa	Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot.   Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you.   Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself.   Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name.   Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her.   Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction.   Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you.   Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you.   Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you.   Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it.|`|JWZEuuhTaa	She will flirt with you, smile around you when she looks in your eyes, She will star at you she might blush or laugh.

AG3dYL84aa	You know my answer to this.  Don't tell her you like her.  Show her you like her.  Do simple little things to attract her attention.  Don't be overly doing things until she begins to like you.    But remember you're the guy.  Don't be a door mat.  Be a gentleman but show her you're the guy.  This is simple.  Be confident around her.  Have a plan what to do but also be spontaneous.  Listen to what she says.  Remember girls love to be subtle.  So if she says it's a lovely night, ask her for a walk in a bit.  If she looks like she needs a drink get her a drink.  Things like that.    Then when she's really into you then tell her you like her.  It will make it that much more special for her because you've gottne to know her and not just he superficial her.    There are a thousand ways you can show her you like her.  Don't get too worked up by it.  Just show confidence when you do it.    I think a party is a great time.  But don't flirt with any other girls.  Talk but don't flirt.  Maybe you can see if you can go to another persons party and get her to go first.  Then at your party she already knows you a little bit.  Good luck|`|ZEwAalKPaa	April?  She will have found someone else by then. get a move on.|`|LGkb4xibaa	dont tell her at a party. Or with alcohol. Not a good plan. Just find a time when your already talking, and drop it gently into the conversation that you'd like to go out somewhere with her sometime. Dont make it major- just casual. But make sure she knows you mean as more than just friends.    If your nerves get the better of you, and you find yourself lost for words, just smile and say sorry. I dunno how to word this. And if shes a nice girl she'll understand .     Hope that helps.|`|3f4jZwLlaa	write a secret admirer note to her on valentines day and invite her to your party(but not on the note!)  oh yeah, and make the party sooner, she probably will have moved on by then.|`|byZMQmBcaa	NO! DO NOT DO IT WHEN THERES "drinks", find a time to be with her alone and let her know how you feel.
JDQP0Phraa	If a guy makes me laugh, then I'll probably fall in love with him. It shows that he has confidence, is creative, and has a great sense of humor.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	Exactly what tasha c said  personality is key!!!  believe it or not some grls actually dont really care for looks i dont!!!|`|rtucR0Vhaa	1. What do girls like in boys?-Their personalities and that boys are funny and outgoing    2.What do girls think is hot in boys?- Their looks|`|BZwJeuMGaa	obviously, first impressions are crucial.    and the first thing people notice are looks.  the first thing i look for myself is nice eyes, a nice smile, nice hair.    you NEED to have a good personality. its crucial.|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	I will not go out with a guy unless he can make me laugh. And I look for a nice smile.|`|vLzLk4m0aa	a guy with confidence but that isnt too cocky...  a guy that knows how to make a girl smile until her cheeks hurt...  a guy who can just look at her and be able to talk to her with his eyes  a guy who is CLEAN... but not to the point he worries about his hair more than we do!  a guy who dresses in his way... not the rest of the football team's way :)|`|JswHEJGcaa	the first thing i look for in a guy is hair smile and eyes.  personality is key though.|`|V2rNq3omaa	If your looking for a good girl jus sincerely be a nice guy.

Personally I like boys with piercings and tattoos, but that doesn't necessarily mean that every girl does. You should be yourself and eventually a girl will come along that will like you for you, not someone you are trying to be.|`|7bd97da03ce5561a49ac83c7af2cd7f2aa	Respectfulness, Personality, Style and Swagger, being able to listen, and honesty.|`|MKHd10MYaa	I like:  1. Someone who I can feel protected and secured around  2. Someone who listens to me  3. Someone who cares for me even as a friend  4. Someone who won't pretend they understand me or what I'm going through if they really don't understand.  5. Someone who is extra nice to me.  6. A gentleman.    What do I think is "hot" in boys:  Being a gentleman. Actually treating a girl right. Stuff like that -- you can't find that in guys often anymore.|`|MVmfY6ptaa	got have  -nice hair  -glowin/sparklie eyes  -awesome personality  -nice  -smart  -got have a sense of humor  and got like the girl for her inside & out|`|JWavXCnsaa	girls find guys attractive  - when boys dont backstabb them  - when boys are handsome  -sweet  smart  and makes the girl feel that she is secure and is loved my the most wonderful man in the world|`|bwU0asquaa	A boy who plays sports.  Someone who has confidence, but is not cocky.  Makes the girl feel great and compliments her, but still has that edgy tougher side.  Holds her hand in front of EVERYONE.  Doesn't ever complain when you're with her.  Be that one guy for her.|`|georvDhgaa	they like big dollar billZ|`|B94G0Y7haa	be nice! act like the kindest person in the world and girls will notice. don't be shallow either. i also like eyes and hair:) but i usually do notice if a guy does a bunch of acts of kindness:)|`|WyKaDpCWaa	a girl loves a funny guy thay also love is there strog and we also love  tall guys!!!|`|ayjOCBbZaa	EYES...they are the first thing i notice about a guy. But really important is a personality...you can be the hottest guy on earth but if you don't have a personality you got no chance.|`|u4fs6u6uaa	girls are first attracted to a guy by his looks first...but them his personality...  girls like a lot of different things in guys  some like a guy with a good sense of humor  some like a guy to be sweet  there are a whole lot of different personalities girls like in guys|`|jMA4bxRvaa	First you have to look nice. Buy a new nice outfit for yourself.   Then take her out to a movie and AFTER take her to dinner.   Before you leave give her like jewlery or something like a necklace.  Oh and you should give her roses before you guys go out. Girls just like everything to work out well and they love it to be romantic :)|`|8YcoDbRFaa	Honesty, genuinity, losing with grace, valour, self-esteem|`|3PqAHtUbaa	sounds shallow but no-one can deny that looks are the first thing u notice.  im not saying u have to be totally hot.. but wearing nice clothes and doing your hair shows that you've made an effort.   Smiling, making eye contact, initiating conversation is a good start.  Looking good isn't all thought, personality is what counts. I like a guy who is caring, easy to talk to, funny, inteligent, reliable, and most of all trustworthy and faithful.  Hotness... i like messy hair... a good body... confidence is what makes someone hot.. think chuck bass from gossip girl?:)) God now  he is a babbeee!|`|yvXTIR50aa	we as girls like boys to be gentle, caring, cool is optional, protective but not too protective, understand us, no fake smiles.....|`|hG79j6oNaa	ok the first thing a girl notices in a boy is his hair. (so have nice hair) and when a girl starts knowing the guy, she wants a guy that respects her and is NOT a jerk to her (i have a lot of ex's that have been jerks so don't be a jerk) so be nice and open up to her (not right away but still). valentine's day is comming up so get her a flower or a card. she would fall for u...um... girls think that guys with a 6 pack are hot. just saying. u have to have a nice smile too.|`|GmRMniJSaa	I'm a sucker for a guy that can make me laugh no matter what. Ability to hold a conversation is nice. Physically, I always liked guys with longish hair. Taller. With a nice smile. Some kind of talent is a plus.
IPS3hWweaa	There are a lot of guys who will say just about anything to get a girl to sleep with them. Guys like that do not feel guilty for what they did or said because they feel that whatever it was they did was worth it to get sex. However, since you made your guy cry, it means that he does feel bad that he got you to have sex with him. He probably does love you and hates himself for the lie he told you.|`|ZbmBVpw9aa	You definetly made him feel guilty! You shouldn't have brought it up!!! I feel bad for him|`|3rnMQW3Gaa	I think you made him feel bad. Maybe you should try talking to him again. Tell him that you are sorry for making him feel guilty and that you forgive him. Hope this helps!
THIvlI4waa	Wear something hot, make sure your hair looks good. Apparently in a study they showed that the first things guys look at on a girl, are hair, skin, and boobs lol. So make sure you look fabulus. Things you could talk about are, the friends you have in common, and ask questions about his life and so forth. I say Wear black on your first date, or something bold like red. Those two colours show that your not nervous !
e2HW9iQ5aa	Yes. But, if I had to take a guess as to what turned him off....I'd say it was the "waiting a few weeks" after your date to contact him, and/or the texting instead of calling.  Would YOU be interested in a guy that did this?|`|fyyfPEemaa	ughh , both i think in a way. cuz like if the boy isn't interested then .. he won't like how your acting. but if he's into you then he'll like it. but after a while he'll probably grow frusterated or something. what i'm trying to say is that you need to keep things balanced =] . don't try to be desperate if you feel as if your acting to pushy .. it's probably true. but let him know that your interested but keep it level, so he'll want you too.    ughh, i hope this makes sense... =]|`|8htIwW9Haa	Yes. It makes the guy feel "wanted" or "special"|`|pcIkr0mqaa	AHAH I SURE HOPE SO|`|gv5DsZRZaa	i have the SAME problem.    i think its just something cute to certain guys out there (course, the taken ones!)     and something bad to others..|`|KVd8aKDoaa	Yeah then the guy doesn't have to work for the poontang
e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	Ask him to go to the mixer with you as (friends) tell him that you want to introduce him around,this way you can get to know him better and find out if he is indeed interested in the other girl.This way you have someone to go to the mixer with....find out more about him and enjoy yourself !|`|tFuBT3p8aa	talk 2 him and hang out w him after school if u can. text him and stuff. hint at how u feel.
AA11425983	don't think so...lol.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	You're kidding right?  Geez, You must be like 12 or 13.    DUH! He's talking about something other than candy, You're mom and dad can teach you the rest...
aXOyK3uBaa	NO.  Great question! But no.    Women don't "TRY" to make eye contact.  They only want to know if YOU CAN KEEP IT.    When a girl looks at you -  NEVER look away first.  It's a total "deal breaker".  It's not even "cute".  So don't look away. Just smile.    You want HER to look away first. Then go get her attention.   You have 3 seconds. Its the three - second rule.    You broke the 3 second rule.  You gotta get good at that.    And don't search the whole school looking for her...  that's as "weak" as looking away.    Just wait until you "bump" into her... and go right up and say "hi... I'm going to get a soda... why don't you come along."    It works.    And if she says "no" its because you broke the 3-second rule. Practice it.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	its hard to say if she was just lookin at u for a few seconds.but usually when a girl is into you she will do that.|`|OIcn7keJaa	I make eye contact with random people.... I really don't think eye contact necessarily means she wants you.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	If the girl continously stares at you in the eyes, its a high possibility she wants it.|`|QawQ2usdaa	Well most of the time if I like a guy I look at him. But I keep looking at him when he looks at me. Naybe I am weird though:( I think you should try to be around this girl as much as you can and then ask her out!|`|eVmQGDHQaa	I usually look at a guy when I fancy him and when he looks my way I will hold the stare for a bit and then smile just before I look away. Hopefully this will help you!!!|`|Krrt4E2Maa	To be honest...  Most of us if we like a guy will try not make too much direct eye contact if we dont want to give it away that they like you (;  But yeah we try catch a glimpse when your not looking...|`|Ddfff5psaa	I know that when I see a cute guy I look at him to catch his eye and his attention! I leave it up to them to come talk to me! Everyone is different, she probably got nervous and broke eye contact, for sure go talk to her! How exciting lol.|`|ZLrYOyGyaa	I keep eye contact with everyone, ESPECIALLY the guy I like. But yes, it sounds like she might have a thing for you, I know when I was in school and used to have a crush on a guy that's what I did. Next time, smile or say hello to her, if she smiles back or says hello back....I say go for it!!|`|gmZLGuNtaa	i do make eye contact with a guy i find interesting...    i usually make eye contact with a guy im interested in and lick my lips and then turn away....=)    ummm for the girl....i think she does like you....    because when i was in high school i would do that to guys i sorta liked...    i would make eye contact with them and turn away...      go for her..what do u got to lose...?|`|AA11611849	I only make eye contact with guys i find attractive or im starring at a guy who i think is weird. So i say go for it...search for her
Fi8AIi4baa	Just talk. Imagine he's any one of your other friends, and just talk with him. Conversations go by so much more smoothly when you don't feel all awkward.|`|s4xDhjrVaa	ugh. i hate being shy.    shy girls are better i think. they wont flirt as much|`|k1FenuRLaa	just go up to him and ask him how is he, act confidently. you've done the hard part already just continue and start building ur friendship

Just leave them alone and stop hurting both of them.  You'll find someone else.|`|qyGrk3BSaa	well I'm going to tell you the truth. DAting greg will be really hard because of the long distance. and you wont know if he cheats on you or not. so i  would apologize to jeff and see if he's still interested. it seems like jeff will be your best bet|`|NtD3t87Vaa	As if we can answer this, only your own heart can.   Ask yourself deep inside who you want, if your willing to wait for greg to meet and live closer, or if you just want jeff now.  In my opinion, neither of them your not ready to date by the looks of it, your a jumper.
xJBJn6dOaa	Tell her you want to be exclusive to one another, meaning you're together and not with anyone else. You can even change your facebook status to "in a relationship." :)|`|uCF9YYYCaa	just ask her out.  make it cute and romantic, that always works|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	wow. just get the guts and say do u wanna be my gf?|`|q2H9jgDSaa	ask her out.|`|UccWGjZxaa	Ask her if she would like to be your girlfriend :)    Goodluck!|`|ip9bLTpVaa	Do they mean like why isn't she your girlfriend?

A love story!  You should watch it.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	It is a fun 'chick-flick' I took a couple of ladies to. We all had good laughs and enjoyed it.
JY5Az7X1aa	Talk to her. Try not to make a big thing out of it though. Maybe she does maybe she doesn't. It's hard to tell just by a look.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Yes, there is a chance shes attracted to you, but you should act quickly. Introduce yourself, if you had the same class for a long time say "Hi, I know we had this class for a while, but I wanna introduce myself my name is ______, whats yours?".|`|Ddfff5psaa	Please just talk to her, I can remember times when this happened to me in high school and i kick myself for not talking to those guys!|`|a9qrXBBsaa	talk to her man. at least start by saying hi, then start some kind of conversation. say hi to her in the halls and at lunch. maybe sit with her sometime. just talk to her|`|mNDimov6aa	oh snap! happens to me too at school. and its kinda hard to just talk to her cause when shes outta class shes with people and looks like shes having a deep conversation? i dunno i usually just pull some corny loser *** move just to get them to laugh and then id talk to her|`|zka26204aa	If you want something to happen in life, you will have to take the chance to try to make it happen.  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."      Do something about it, instead of wasting time wondering.  By the time you get around to talking to her, some other guy will have scooped up on her.  You will be left in the cold, kicking yourself for not making a move.|`|UKRdbFWyaa	remember to be yourself. it doesnt hurt to say hi to her. i  mean what have you got to lose right? take a risk. lifes too short|`|mTkv4MWKaa	If you have the flexibility, move seats!  Break that code that says "you sat in this seat, now you must stay in this seat or die!"    Like she said - go talk to her.  If she likes you, she'll thank you for it.  If not, at least you won't kick yourself forever wishing you had at least tried to say something.
ip9bLTpVaa	Just write "I Love You" in it. It's simple and gets the point across. lol. And then put Do you like me check yes or no. That would be cute. A guy did that to me and I thought it was cute.|`|cTqalqv1aa	just make a poem. something that came from your heart. Or find a love song and write down the lyrics with some of your own lyrics? Just make it intentionally sweet
Sdveyg8Jaa	I think you're about an 8!

QgVxJyARaa	you guys should just talk about the relationship you have together to see where it can and won't go so you will have a better understanding of the relationship
C8DOT8Y7aa	You need to start working out.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	There is a good chance you are trying to hard.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	The link doesn't work.|`|M7LlQ2CBaa	The link works if you remove the crap behind it ^^    In any case.. just keep trying... if you do something long enough eventually the shyness (or whatever the case is) will be gone and you will get used to it ^^    There are bigger things to fret about then not having women ^^    And to be honest i find just talking to girls make them like you more than pickuplines :)|`|q3YMpcDgaa	the younger the women are, the more they won't think pick up lines are cheesy.  Here are some I've gotten recently:  "Is there a mirror in your pocket because I can soooo see myself in your pants"  "If I told you you had a nice body would you hold it against me?"    Pretty okay I guess. But if you are looking for a serious relationship, just be bold and strike up a conversation with the lady in the check out line at the grocery store or gas station. Just make sure you think she's single.  Be nice. Dont be a pig like most men. Don't tell a total stranger "You look nice" because thats WEIRD. Your good looking.  Just be like "So have you seen that new movie [insert movie here]?"  "[answers]"    start there. good luck [:|`|3ijLQe5laa	you have to build a personal confidence that will allow you to be comfortable with others|`|CI8gqgyeaa	walk up to a girl and whip your dick out.|`|ao5CeroVaa	be your self!!!!! duh|`|4qSUqhNnaa	make it a point to go out of your way and talk to ppl...anyone  it just builds confidence and people skills for shyness :]  ps. your picture isnt working lol|`|NzvXINyGaa	talk to them, rejection isn't that bad. Believe me I know.|`|EDf8kcNKaa	Just try to act like it's such a huge deal just talking to a girl. Just go up to her and start a conversation. Don't do pick up lines, that's really lame. Just be nice and be yourself.|`|0b2WSgpfaa	lol the link doesn't work. and also JUST BE YOURSELF AROUND GIRLS!!!!!!! lol i'm an 11 year old girl and ur probably thinking "wtf y should i listen 2 her???" well really, it does help! just be yourself and don't try to pretend ur someone else!!! cuz i am like the  1 shyest person in the world. but i just be myself around friends and i have great bffs!!|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	your a good looking guy and you should just try it out. go up and ask..."want to go to the movie? or lunch " or something like that. dont be nervous. youll get some and youll miss some. im shy too and this is what people say to me too.  i need help toooo................ hmmmm but i think this advice is very useful cuz i tried once and it worked :)    Good luck!|`|MKRemZkuaa	honestly grow some balls and talk to them. if you talk to 10 girls and get 1 number then you are further off then someone who didn't even talk to one. just keep your head up and know that rejection is going to happen . there is no way around it. get your butt out there and just try.|`|mIvVWFdmaa	Be honest with them|`|999a56cf1347f99ff9dee6fe42651eefaa	the link doesnt work.        to break the ice..you just need to say heyy to a girl. and just start a general conversation, if the girl is into you, they will flirt, and if their not into you then they wont.. i know this probably isnt the best advice..but i hoped it helped :)|`|WNB4Vojsaa	go for the white women. i hear they like brothers.  :>    his link works once you fix it:    http://s277.photobucket.com/albums/kk69/...|`|Ky99KA8Raa	just run up ... (dont walk ...  run. this is very important) and ask if theyll come back to your van with you|`|WBcQpHieaa	Be yourself and don't lie because girls hate that.                                                Trust Me!|`|32j3VC4qaa	just think to yourself.....W.W.G.B.D. ?....What would george bush do? Good luck, and remember god ol' george will do you right!|`|KC7Q9Vv7aa	Different girls like different pick up lines.   I'm a guy and I could care less what you look like but because I was there and had trouble with shyness. Ill help you. To break your shyness just think of her as one of your friends already. Walk over to her and just have a NORMAL(!) conversation with her. Act cool, and don't say retarded stuff like I did with my first few tries.  Don't use pick up lines because some girls think your doing a booty call.|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	The link doesn't work.  But pick up lines are awesome! Here are a couple of funny ones.    "I lost my phone number...can I have yours?"    "Hey...I'm not Elmo, but you can tickle me anytime. :)"    You: "Do you sleep on your stomach?"  Girl: No.   You: Can I?    Just Google pick up lines for more funny ones. I like shy guys. And you shouldn't have to change yourself just to get a girl. Just wait it out, and she'll come to you! Good luck! :)|`|FfjEih2yaa	Go to school, get a good job and have money one day. Then you'll have no problem with chicks.|`|wscyjkPAaa	to break the shyness you should start by saying "hi" and just smiling big at random women you see.  After a while you will be desensitized and maybe even work up the courage to have an actual conversation.  Most women will say "hi" back to you but some will reject your greeting, but it's ok don't let it bother you.  Pick up lines don't work.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well you are cute. and just be yourself my boyfriend was shy when I first met him and now I can't get him to shut up! ha but no when you find that one special girl she will make you feel better and not be as shy, but the whole pick up like thing...well that doesn't work..at all. I think they are lame. Just be yourself and things will fall right into place. I promise.|`|zjp17TZcaa	just get out there.  the worst thing they can say is "no".  once you get over that you'll be fine.  you will probably get rejected 9 out of 10 times.  maybe more maybe less.  but sitting on the computer wont asking how to pick up ladies on the internet wont help you unless you want to search through the want ads.  If your in High School or College that is the perfect time.  your surrounded by women all the time.  just go up and talk to them..... but make sure you have topics to talk about.  don't go up introduce yourself and stare at her. ha-ha.  find common topics.  don't go for a 10 if your not ready for one.  6 or 7.  good luck|`|YfEuMBAJaa	Dude I'm shy too, but girls usually ask me out. I'm shy to yes or no to some of the not good lokking ones.|`|gJOGeVY6aa	Well Kid. I am looking for a man. This makes me look desperate, but hey, if you can do it I can do it. Email me. [Fabulousandluvnit@yahoo.com]     I will give a you a pic when you email.|`|3F8PgjIlaa	First the link doesn't work,    Second I am a real shy girl myself, so this is probably only MY opinion lol, but I like pick-up lines. They may be cheesy but at least it shows you like the girl. To be less shy try to be more interesting to the person and they will think you're pretty cool and want to talk more. Also you've probably heard this before but think before you say. If you say something stupid then you can't take it back. So think about what you're about to say before you embaress yourself! Make eye contact, too. Show you're interested in what the girl is saying. She will def love a guy who listens to her. Try to make yourself look nice around people, too. If you look nice, you wont be worrying about, "Omg she thinks my hair looks horrible." Or, "Am I sweating? Why is she staring at me like that? Is there something in my teeth?" lol so try that and good luck!!!:)|`|Gm1Hmjj5aa	hit myspace.com and find some females to befriends on there|`|4nOEDc8qaa	No, girls do not like pick up lines.  Try being yourself.|`|TWMXMOLUaa	only REALLY FUNNY pick up lines tht make grls laugh work!!!....just pretend you've known the grl 4 ur whole life!!~~~hope this helps!
k1FenuRLaa	what do u like best about me (you|)|`|iDYuSAynaa	What is your favorite place in the world?
Ku2AIH3Qaa	hun he is just annoying or maybe thats me but if he did that to me we would have a long talk, if that didnt help see ya..|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Cut the dude some slack. He just likes you and wants to talk to you. You could have it actually bad and have a guy not give a crap about you.|`|GlNlcioUaa	break up with him he sounds ugly and retarded anyway  your dumb for going out wit him|`|8htIwW9Haa	he can't stand not being with you!|`|J4hsuTzxaa	he sounds like a cop
COpP9JDqaa	Stop playing games and start getting serious about each other and give the relationship a try.  See where is goes after you both become interested in one another and then let it grow from there.  If the guy is playing games still then you are just a friend to him and nothing of a relationship can happen.  If in your heart you feel serious about him and you want to see what develops then go for it Girl!.    Hope I helped..
Ic6YekeWaa	don't even sweat this guy.  i was recently talking to this guy who decided to get back with his ex and i was sad but then i said to myself...he's getting back into something bad, something that will not work out because it didn't work out the first time. guys are always so0 willing to run back into something they were "comfortable" with no matter how bad it was rather than try something new and exciting. you'll meet a guy that will sweep you off your feet and this guy will be saying to his self, "damn she could have been mine"|`|gF26JyzBaa	wow u liked him for 5 months, never asked him out and you're sad he has a gf??? are you kidding me? you two never even dated! just go ask him out. gosh!
9Oxu5CIoaa	If he isn't asking you out, maybe he isn't sure that you like him. Show some interest in him, maybe even tell his friend that you like him.  If that still doesn't work, then you should ask him out. There is nothing wrong with a girl asking out a guy, not matter what anyone says. Especially if he is shy. Go for it, you have nothing to lose!|`|JtMoUpJIaa	if u think u like him... talk with him or u can start hanging out like friends and a little more xP.. maybe after u go out a few times "alone" he might  tell u something
T3NAVsx1aa	Whoever u like! Who cares if Nikki has a boyfriend?!?! If u see something u like like, go 4 it!!!!!! dont let anything stop u. If Nikki and Raymond were ment 2 be together then they wont break up so easily. If raymond is your friend  then it is TOTALLY inappropriate, u dont wanna steal a buddy's girl. So just follow ur heart. Anyway, i know how guys are. ur probably just gonna chose the cuter 1 or something. So flirt with them, and COMPLIMENT!!! Sometimes say, "those shoes are nice, they would go great w/my shirt" or just say something.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	poochie, dont steal raymond's girlfriend|`|z3D3I3C1aa	whatever you feel is right, either wait for nikki or Go for Poochie, I'd wait, then if nohing happens then date poochie, but if you have an oppurtunit with nikki id take it|`|t7HUMcOCaa	Poochie, definitely. Don't be a homewrecker and break up a happy couple! She might not even know she's flirting with you. Good luck!|`|w0xJFdYDaa	forget nikki and flirt with poochie (p.s. weird name) and ignore her now and then, it drives us girls crazy, but not too much cuz then we get angry wit you. also make them laugh, girls love that, and be sweet to her|`|XasLRQnXaa	you're not supposed to date dogs
SxPERt06aa	I am in love with a man 14 years older than me.  I think it is only a big deal if you make it one. Love comes in many forms, and blossoms between all kinds of people.  If you guys are in love then it doesn't matter about your age!|`|5iIgh2Evaa	14 years is not as bad as 20 years. Although, in today's time with teenagers getting pregnant younger and younger he's practically old enough to be your dad. I'm 19 and my dad's 37, I say as long as he's younger than your dad (not that I would go with an older guy), but your over 21 and your old enough to make your own decision.|`|AA11267703	The age is not the problem really. You are both consenting adults. My Aunt explained it like this she married someone over 10 years older you tend to have different taste in music and other interest. Which can be a conflict in time.     The other issue is that you will be more likely to become his care giver if you get married in an extended relationship. That is not written in stone. At 36 he is still in his prime but let me tell you I am past 40 and after 40 your body does not respond like it used to.     Just some things to consider when thinking about getting involved with someone 10 years your senior.|`|R2BBjtaraa	not at all. yeah ik people are like omg wow thats big but my parents are 9 years apart and i have people in my family who are married and more than 10 years apart so its no big deal. and when youre an adult it probably doesnt even matter as long as you like him and he likes you|`|eqWftUQeaa	Not all, I mean unless it's a minor and an adult of course age matters, but other than that i don't think age is an issue. My parents have like 13 years between them, my sis married a guy like 13 years older than her too. How you feel about that person and how he makes you feel is what's important.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	15 years between me and my fiance - so no, I don't think it's a big deal, lol.|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	Its normal. As long as you two like each other. I know people who are 70 years old and they marry a 30 year old girl. And my moms friend is 35 while the husband is almost 50.    So it's normal. (not to insult him or anything but make sure he just doesn't want you for your young body...)|`|xJBJn6dOaa	if it doesn't matter to you, it doesn't matter. He probably loves the fact that you're only 22... so young and fun. If you can deal with the fact that he's 36.. then it's fine. You're old enough where it's a safe age to date anyone, in my opinion. If you were19, maybe it'd be weird.|`|lLHtM6jvaa	Take the age of the eldest partner, divide by 2 and add 7.  If the age of the younger partner is at least as old as the result then its socially acceptable. 36/2 = 18 +7 = 25. Uh Oh. In that case ignore the above rule 'cause its dumb anyway and tell everyone to shut the hell up.     Peace V

Men are generally thought to have a higher sex drive than women but this is not always true. i have a higher sex drive than my fiance.|`|wj7DuDEzaa	probably because you have not found a man who knows how to sexually satisfied you, and knows how to give you orgasms, who knows how to stimulate your clitoris.i love giving my women multiple orgasms.i play with her for an hour before we have intercourse.i am a sexy good looking man and i have a small penis. from what i have seen in the boys locker room i am tiny com paired to every one else,but i make up for it in the bedroom with my tong and fingers.have you ever instant messenger ed somebody and been able to see them on the web cam.i want to learn how,if you know please help,thanks.|`|yBIZQCN3aa	email me, Brandonflores22@yahoo.com  i can try to help it go away.|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: Take a cold shower :.

Don`t try to put on a front for her.  & FYI. Girls don`t like to be called "hot".  Their not sex objects.  Call her gorgeous, beautiful, ect.  NOT HOT.  |`|fi1YfCstaa	well good luck with that...    just go up to her and "accidentally" bump into her, then smile and say Oh Im sorry...start small talk from that|`|OHCyWKJ7aa	Don't consider her a hot girl. Just go up and start a topic like do you always come here and order that. Or find something cool to talk about. Let me warn you though the hot chicks are dangerous. Even if you get one you will bw worried and be extremely jealous. Just be friends with her and see where it leads. DONT BE A STocker....

(depends if ur like 20 lol!)|`|aQ8EK9hraa	i dont think its something that someone can teach you so to speak  but you have to relax and let it happen. just make sure not to clonk your guys teeth together. haha good luck
d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Yes, it was mean. She supported you, she trusted you to not hurt her, and seeings as she put it out there like that, she probably has a history of being hurt by men. You talked her into believing you wouldnt and then you did. It'll probably take her months to get over that. When an already hurt girl puts what little trust she has left in someone she thinks is nice and different from the others, and that person turns out to be just like every other asshole guy out there, sometimes thats all it takes to push a woman over the edge. She might not be able to ever trust men again now. Way to go.          And yes, It's stupid of you to go back to someone who cheated on you. Once a cheater always a cheater. Remember that when you're heart broken because the girl who promised to never cheat on you does it again.... And when you're laying in bed wondering what you did to deserve that, remember the girl who's heart you broke, and how she must've felt when you basically did the same thing to her.|`|YR9l82vmaa	yes, what you did was heartless. the ex-gf has a substance abuse problem, AND cheated on you. and you're going to go back to her after meeting a really sick girl who is in need and opened up to you of all people. so you're going to break the sick, fragile girl in yet another place, and strengthen the rude, inconsiderate girl who cheated on you and gets drunk all the time. wow. you need to think this over.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	Yes it was mean. I'm sorry, but it's true. No wait, I'm not sorry. I wish I knew the girl so I could give her a hug =(|`|losGznxMaa	tell the sweet one youre sorry.  tell the ex she's not wirth it  get off the drugs  mend your friendship with the classy girl-she's worth your time AND she trusted you.  go out with the classy girl. (v-day is coming up... perfect chance)

I like it when guys flirt with me.  It gets my attention and makes me think of them as someone who would always be there for me.  Well, yeah. My boyfriend started to flirt with me for about 4 weeks before he asked me out. So, you usually have to wait a few weeks.  Good Luck! (wish me luck! our 5 months coming up on the 12!!!)|`|1bHaB8xvaa	You're young to be having a girlie.|`|XUDsWuTQaa	****. I'm 31 and never a BF, feeling good now?|`|0RADJhwBaa	stop focusing on girls and give up on love for awhile. trust me, its for the best. ive gone after guys before and been turned down, i just went into a slight denial mode for a few weeks. it was like every decent guy i saw, id always be like "there goes another guy that i wont be with". i forgot about guys for awhile and gave up on love, knowing that my time will come and things will work out when they want to. your only going to get stressed and depressed, just relax and be patient. no need to get worked up, your only going to get hurt.|`|gyNadSFpaa	smart dan!|`|RZ0lzWJcaa	Your only 14     geez    you've got plenty of time to do that stuff|`|1adf049cd1761d16f5307295ad33c4c5aa	hey slow down, you're just 14 O_O  Have fun and the girl will come !|`|PQifZodNaa	Be yourself and not a fake.     Don't look desperate either.|`|AA11309427	Nothing. That's normal. Guys like you get ALL the girls in college!
zka26204aa	You point out that he is going through a midlife crisis, and that you understand because sometimes you feel uneasy about getting older, yourself.  Let him know that he is not the only one that has ever experienced it, and that you love him and will be there for him.|`|494f917287bcb72589c802dc7322ca19aa	Very patiently.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	no one wants to be old. i'm 25. suffering from all kinds of leg problems from basketball. but i still play i'm 18 years old because i love the game. granted that i'll be walking with a cane in a few years, you can't stop a person from enjoying what makes them happy most
D5bhjlbJaa	Well... okay so if your scared she'll say no, and thats really the worst thing you can think of her doing, just go for man. Dont worry about her not wanting to be friends with you anymore, cuz if you guys have been friends all your lives then i really dought this is gonig to change anything. I mean, hey what if she does like you back? You know that would just be amazing for you wouldn't it, but it doesn't hurt to try. So I say go for it. :) It might be a little akward for a few days after, if she says no, but then everything goes back to normal. ;)  Hope I helped. :D|`|ebd01f2a9ac954de0f1feb8fb05fc0c7aa	Just ask her out damnit!|`|TawYWc4waa	first of all be confident in yourself - meaning dont call yourself pathetic...confidence is the number one turn on. be yourself and when your ready, slowly give suttle hints that youre into her. once your ready tell her exactly how you feel. you might be suprised! if things dont work out, dont act awkward around her. i know it would hurt but if you care about her and your relationship then try to make things ok between you guys. i hope things work out!
M8MlviOFaa	well, maybe you guys should drop the whole shoppong bag thing and talk about how your relationship is going.. Ask him if there is anything wrong becasue your worried about the both of you. im sure all this didnt happen becasue of shopping bags.
Nxx0R02Yaa	i think you should tell him what you just told us|`|oMXlbWu9aa	If he doesn't see you as more than just a friend, there really isn't anything you can do to change that, find someone else.
JC7If6Naaa	dont do any thing right now and wait for them to breack up   and if they didnt   u try breaking them up with out she knowing   and try to show her that u really like her much and dont stop doing that and always be there for her ok always I SAID ALWAYS :)  good luck with u and if u needed help contact me sweetie :)   bye|`|5WB2yZUFaa	what goes around comes around. you spent all that time being a man-wh*** and now you're paying for it. she will never trust you. you'll never have her. my advice is think about this next time you wanna flirt all over the place. actions have consequences.
2JJLYSAKaa	No, it is not awful.  It is actually a coping mechanism.  I use it all the time.  You try to cover up your hurt with laughter.      You said that you crack these jokes to only your closest friend and that's fine.  Be careful.  Make sure she won't repeat your jokes and be misinterpreted by others.  Make sure no one over hears these jokes.  If you truly love this guy, you don't want to hurt him.  How do you think he would feel if he heard something that was misinterpreted or taken out of context?    Try explaining that yes you said it but.....|`|RgbARcJTaa	nopeee its not|`|3jWaexYOaa	nopee|`|9cpcu9mpaa	No, I would not say that is awful. This could just be your way of getting over him. A lot of people use different things to get themselves situations like this. Besides, it's only to your closest friend, it's not letting you making these jokes to anyone and everyone. Good Luck!|`|kh29r5Yjaa	laughter is medicine my friend!|`|f6GNmjP3aa	Well do you feel awful?   If you don't feel awful and you don't really care then he prob wasn't your boyfriend or you've gotten over it.   So, I personally don't think it's awful. I did it once.|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	that's ok. i'm sorry : (
HnEcgVGiaa	Trustworthiness  Understanding  Honesty  Patient  Compatibility / Chemistry    Other traits:  Positive  Supportive  Knows when to be serious and when to have fun  Committed  Smiles    While many guys can list these kinds of things, keep in mind that simple words cannot describe a person. When you do find the person that you like, it's almost impossible to describe them. That special feeling tingling inside you is indescribable. You can put metaphors to such feelings, but only you two can understand what you share between each other.
5KSumfw6aa	ha. i blush ALL the time!    its so anoying!!!    any way im a girl but i clicked here to see cuz im a shy girl!|`|av8SeB3Naa	Mike has it right.  If you're cute and silent, it's a turn on for some guys.  But if she's fat or ugly, we probably won't like it.  It's the sad, ugly truth.  We are way too superficial for our own good.|`|QMYGptJDaa	from ur avatar im guessing u r pretty....but yea as long as theyre cute or pretty|`|uiO590WJaa	1.) if your cute and not large    2.) you know some dirty bed tricks|`|ilyv0UxLaa	If the guy isn't a complete *** hole then he should like you for who you are.  There are so many guys out there and they all have different tastes so it's hard to say. But you'll never regret changing who you are for a guy.  Just be yourself and the perfect one will come along...take it from someone who knows ;)|`|zRTEvp4oaa	guys dont just like innocent quiet girls it depends wot type of girl they like|`|18tnQj6Kaa	yes they do!  They think the more quiet you are the more fun you are!|`|29e9b31fbefb6d2cf0e605edecb63d04aa	because most of the time those are the beautiful, non skanky type of girls, and many guys respect a girl who hasn't slept around with 5 other girls when there like only 16. so the innocent girls always win :)|`|cRen38fZaa	innocent girls are really the bad girls ;]|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Yes.|`|GfYP5Ku2aa	I'm the exact same way as you but I'm a guy, and I'm being honest when I say I really only like girls like that if they are really good looking, because girls like that are harder to notice if they are just average looking. I'm sure many guys like girls that are quiet though! Good luck!|`|MgiK02Zbaa	as long as they still talk...|`|XPzdqiC0aa	As long as you arent so quiet that you literally can't have a conversation with someone...|`|01pY6dW9aa	i am too, its pretty mysterious.|`|Tf19RETiaa	haha thats me, and sure why not? xD|`|V4CpwM55aa	Fa sho    as long as you are cute and not a large one|`|LkRivHpTaa	i make the innocent not innocent
LLgLPEPUaa	I asked this before and here were the results:    slender cut...     Buff but not too buff, and skinny but not to where u can see the bones. I like both   slender. buff is soooo overrated.     not like really macho. just some apparent muscle. hope i helped!     Honestly i end up liking more slender cut guys     How about in between, strong but not like boasting about it, and skinny but not skin and bones.    Slender/cut.     slender/cut is better, but some buff guys are pretty hot. but i think i would actually rather date a slender cut guy.     Slender/cut guy. Slender is better then skinny and alot better then buff.     buff for sure,     slender cut,.|`|OghDfptZaa	I like skinny geeks! lol|`|Ll0iQG5Naa	some muscle, but not too much cuz it looks wrong|`|PPXUgYa6aa	I dont like my men skinny but too much muscle is disgusting.

saG3rgnzaa	First of all, when you said that you've been cheated on by many boys. Maybe you should be more areful whith who you are getting together with next time? Like, so you can be sure that that guy really loves you so he wont be cheating on you later on.    Plus that, there are nice boys that doesn't cheat, maybe you're just been very un-lucky. I believe that some guys do feel really horrible after cheating, some of them really means it when they tell you that they are sorry and asking for a 2nd chance. If you really love him, you should give it to him. But a 3rd chance is just out of question.    It is all up to you to decide if you think that boyfriend of yours is worth keeping or not. Love is blind, so you have to be somewhat critical sometimes. There are bunch of other nice guys out there, so yeah.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Trust me, when someone cheats on you, you should realize that person is not "good" for you and not "ment" to be. You should realize that other should not be in your future. You cant prove it, not possible.

0HFL3vocaa	ok first of all stop calling yourself ugly because thats ugly, my boyfriend once told me that guys think its sexy when a girl is confident even if she doesnt look that good. n more than likley ur not ugly. STOP CALLING YOURSELF UGLY! tyra banks is a damn top model she was a model for victoria secret for crying oyt loud, drop dead gorgeous and when she was a teenager she was always called the ugly duckling but look at her now i bet you every guy that ever called her ugly wishes they could have her, and every girl wishes they culd be her. confidence is everything, some of the most beautiful people in the world, (alot of them being models today) were called ugly but do you think they listened to what people say. kimora lee simmons, same story! every girl is beautiful **** what people have to say, look in the mirror everyday and tell yourself your gorgeous instead of these negative things ma ;)|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	You don't listen to them and keep doing what you're doing. some guy will fall for you.

She doesnt buy it much anymore.     I wont miss it.

dw440Lylaa	Culture.    Cultural expectations have trained guys that fat is bad.  It's unhealthy, models aren't fat, their skinny, everything portrayed on TV or movies that's considered beautiful isn't fat.  (there are exceptions, but they're few and far between.)    I;m sorry for your friend, there's not a thing I know of to shift the cultural expectation.        OK?        Luck|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	pretty fat?    we don't date fat girls not because they're fat. we don't date them because they can't discipline themselves to stay in shape. as long as we live in america where we view fat a a psychological problem, a societal problem, a political problem, fat people will always be viewed as lacking self-discipline. if i find time to do 50 push ups a day, why can' you? instead of eating a super size family bag of doritos why can't you eat a yogurt?    no one like people with problems--i don't see you dating suicidals, or murderers, or schizos.|`|qkblT2hgaa	It comes with age. When you are younger, you have this ideal look for your partner. Almost every magazine out there will display thin girls over fat ones. It is because of this that guys want to date thin girls. It is also due to pier pressure. All guys will bug each other if one of them likes a fat girl. So, there are a few shallow reasons for a preference for a thin girl. There are also guys that like heavier girls. Heavy guys like heavy girls because they won't be embarrassed to be seen with one.    Depending on age, guys that want to settle down and get married and have kids may also be reluctant to date someone who is heavy. This is due to pregnancy. A woman will never get thinner when she is pregnant and it is always harder for a heavier woman to shed the extra weight that pregnancy brings.    If your friend is happy with her body, she should look for a guy that is also happy with it. If she isn't happy with her body, help her get in shape. Take her to a gym, walk with her and help her lose any extra weight.|`|yLTDUZIDaa	I like shirts that say "NO FAT CHICKS"|`|a9qrXBBsaa	Being skinny is just plain more attractive. Simple as that. get her to go on walks or something if you can. silently persuade her.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	it's just not physically attractive to most guys, plain and simple.  men are visual beings and are attracted to visually stimulating female forms.  there are a lot of larger women who have very pretty faces, no doubt.  but at least in my opinion, obese somen are unattractive.|`|f106f574855f6526410e30fbb7976b07aa	Weight is not a show stopper. If she is confident and cheerful with an upbeat and engaging personality she can do well.   There are lots of guys who prefer larger gals, perhaps you are both still rather young and in high school where the fellows who like larger gals might be afraid of getting hassled for asking her out? I bet some fellows have been trying to build up the courage to ask her out. Ask any pervert you know they can tell you there is lots of websites for guys that would not give you a second look and zero right in on friend.   I was a bit put off by my ex-girlfriend's size at first but I got over it since she was perfect in every other way. She's my ex-girlfriend because I married her and made her my wife. My BIG sister-in-law took my advice and started smiling and flirting and next time I saw her I asked her if she was making all her fellows us condoms because she was busy enough to make me worry! I will be loving and supportive if my wife tries to loose weight but love her as she is.  Tell your pal every thing will be fine!  In the absence of peer pressure some chubby chaser is gonna come sneaking round.|`|SalYidbvaa	i would say society and also that guys are more visual when it comes to love, while women are more verbal.|`|51NtvXqqaa	here is the logic  Girl is pretty.Girl is fat.Guys always date girls they like.  so based on these premises the conclusion is Guys dont like fat girls|`|OXcApjPzaa	Every male is different.   Some males like big women. Some like tiny. Some like tall. Some like short. Some like females older than them. Some feel more comfortable dating someone their junior. Some males like white girls. Some prefer other types. Some guys like career women. Some prefer traditional wives. Some males prefer girls who love to party. Some guys prefer non social girls who like to hang at home.     God made somebody for everyone. I dated a girl who was kind of big (about 40 lbs overweight) once. I liked her. If she hadnt been such a feminist we might have worked out.     I dont do laundry. I dont cook. I dont iron. I have no feminine side. I have only a male side and an animal side.|`|mNDimov6aa	uhhhh cause shes fat?! duh! thats gross, it just gives us a bad image. cause skinny usually equates too athletic and active where as fat usually gives off a i like to sit at home on a friday night and eat a tub of chunky monkey while i cry over sex in the city. but then u have the mid category of what i like to call bar star's, they are the girls that go to the bar that had the double d's and arnt all that skinny but at the same time not fat, but they are hot. get ur friend to do some laps slap on a push up bra and get her loser drunk im sure someone will love her by the end of the night|`|y2Uks58paa	not all guys dislike fat girls haha a lot of black dudes like bigger white girls for sum reason lol but hey if shes got a pretty face and a little chub she shouldnt have a problem gettin a guy|`|2by2Ujblaa	most guys just find skinniness more attractive, however there are some guys that like their girls to be bigger. Honestly though I think it's because of culture mainly and the fact that advertising distorts a guys perception of what's pretty.|`|PRrqMINhaa	Fat girls are not attractive.    In my opinion there are three factors I look at to determine if someone is attractive:    1. Cuteness (do you want to hug them like a little teddy bear?)  2. Prettyiness (do their eyes shine?)  3.  Hotness (do you want to bone them?)  (sorry for being so forward)    You pretty much need to be proficient in one category and at least average in the other two to be considered attractive in my book.  It sounds like your friend is failing Number 3, so it doesn't matter how cute or pretty she is.  If she lost a few she probably would be fine.|`|j1yr1S6eaa	Same reason girls don't date fat guys. We, as humans are incredibly shallow and always will be. NOBODY is an exception. NOBODY

4vLt3SqFaa	My answer is no except under certain conditions and you don't meet them.  Namely only divorcing couples in some circumstances find it advantageous to continue having sex together,  They do so because they are emotionally fragile - they need sex and the partner is safe and familiar.  Both people need the comfort of physical sex and affection and having sex with each other helps protect both while they are vulnerable.  Only a small percentage of couples can succeed at this because most have become too hostile before divorce but in a few cases it works for them.  I have know some couples to remain sexual for 2 or more years.    With boyfriends -NEVER!  It only confuses the issues and sex makes you feel more bonded than you are. Neverr, never, sleep with an ex boyfriend.|`|M8MlviOFaa	nope, it really messes things up even more. it makes it worse. whether you truly want to let go fo him or not, it mess things up. be strong.     ive made that mistake and i dug myself a hole deeper than it shouldve been. Dont think for a second it can help things, sex is the last thing that can save things. Its time that will tell the truth mylady.     If he wants you back, youve gotta keep your legs closed until he's truly worthy of coming back, but YOU have to be strong!    But if your totally over him n your just really horny, id still say no for now and get some other man, cuz no matter what it will complicated things.    Im single by the way, just throwing that out there!|`|1uRUaSblaa	He's a ex for reasons.  Unless you settle those problems,  they will arise and make your life more unsettled.  The more you hook up with him,  the more you will be entangled in the relationship.  So examine what you really want from him.  Will there be a future with him?  Are you wasting time on a relationship that can go nowhere?
JiATH6rGaa	Try calmly talking to him. Try not to get emotional (upset or angry). And maybe sit him down with your friend. All you can do is really try... let him know that you care and maybe things will go your way.     If they don't they weren't meant to... I know it sucks. I'm pretty bad of letting go of people even if they should be let go.     Good luck!
O6TC4CgRaa	I don't think there's a certain age that u have to be to have a boyfriend/girlfriend  it's really depend on how mature you are  are you mature enough to handle the feelings?  mature enough to handle problem while dating him or her?  are you ready to face consequences?  It's really depend on each person  Some people have a boyfriend/girlfriend at a very young age, but others might be till they're old.  good luckkkk girl|`|T3NAVsx1aa	Wellllll.

I have a serious boyfriend now and im a junior and 16 years old.  My brother is in 8th grade has his first girlfriend and is unhappy as well. i think you should wait until your in 10th grade to have a relationship but that doesnt mean you cant go on dates. just dont go steady.|`|AA12060908	In between 15 &16|`|wF0B7TsRaa	Hmm................................well I was 8 when I had my first bf but it was by accident because I was 8.

16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	There are tons of guys out there who don't have a problem with dating single moms, some of these guys have told me that it's because they are attracted to strong independant women who can lead a family, or because they want to have family and can see what a good job we're doing, some have said they find single moms more laid-back, easy-going, not into going out partying all the time, some have said that a single mom has her kids as her 1st priority, so she's not as clingy and controlling as a woman who would make him the 1st priority.    As far as your daughter, all I can say is take things slowly with guys, try and keep it completely seperate (relationship and being a mom) until you know it's someone you want to be serious with. So don't introduce her to every guy you go out with, don't allow men to sleep over or hang around your home lots until the relationship is stable.|`|61Fwbi79aa	You just get out there. As a single father, I was given the advice to NOT date women without kids. Turned out that it was great advice. I dated a couple of women with no kids, and at my age (38) it was not pleasant, because I put my kids first. The first dates for me came from the internet. Bad idea. 99% of internet dating people are issue-laden. Divorce care led me to friends who knew single women for me to meet.    My fiance and I met through friends.    Good luck. It's not as bad as it seems

C9z5g6pVaa	heyhun  yeah most guys i have met  love no hair .  but i would suggest wax rather then shave|`|bmoCpcdraa	no way well i dont know i supose it would keep the hair out of mouth|`|bM4zYt44aa	That's what I was going to say.  I've had many girls tell me they wouldn't give me head if I had hair down there......I've also had girls tell me they'd only give me head if I got a penis reduction :(|`|LypbuDLgaa	yes.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	keep something     dont want to look like a 12 year old..|`|uJXxfXSwaa	depends|`|lZMN69keaa	????????|`|kgHWcKKzaa	I agree with "random guy".
4wlwyhvnaa	Don't be so nervous. Just because he loves you doesn't mean you have to have sex with him right now. Seriously..... sex pretty much ruined every relationship that I had til my marriage. Not that the sex wasn't good or anything just the it changes the relationship. You might want to watch a movie while he might want some action. Do it when you are ready to do it and feel comfortable. Read Maxim magazine and Stuff that will help you learn some more so you are comfortable. Hope this helps :o)|`|0GZ7OIVsaa	you'll comfortable eventually.  i had the same problems but after awhile you wont be that nervous anymore.      but if you are, try having sex when its kinda dark.   like close ur blinds and turn of ur lights.|`|0nl3zUBzaa	Well if you feel that nervous you could not have sex.  You say 'the guy', is he not your boyfriend?  I don't know, sex is all about spontaneity and losing yourself in the moment, you really have to trust the person you are having sex with and have good communication for it to be enjoyable. There really is no rules with positions as long as it is physically do able.|`|qBkG8rRPaa	talk to your partner about it,
gmZLGuNtaa	talk to her...and somewhere in the conversation    tell her she is beautiful and would like to go out on a date....|`|ZVfxJacvaa	Stare at her a lot, but not too much, smile, be respectful and kind. Try to be friendly, like hug her, open a door, something like that. Go to a movie and whisper in her ear "I like spending time with you" See how she reacts to that. You sound young so I wouldn't say anything to blunt to start off with, especially since you really like her. Butg the most i portant thing is to be yourself. I hope that helps. Good luck!|`|a9qrXBBsaa	talk to her man. get to know her. laugh with her. be cool. Don't be flashy. girls dont always like flashy cars and stuff. be yourself. when the time comes, ask her out.|`|cWjrtIlKaa	First you got to get her used to physical contact by wrestling than one day you 'accidentally' touch a naughty, than pause and gauge the response. If favorable... continue. Than your golden dude.
GBr9YngTaa	No I can't. I am eighteen and my brother is thirteen. However, he is taller than me (I am only 5'2") and weighs more than me. I always knew that would happen. That's amazing that your sister can do that.    I never need strength with my brother though, tickling him is equivalent.|`|OIcn7keJaa	yeah. I can totally carry my brother.. but he's 2 years younger. a|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Yes, yes I am.      Mostly because my brother is 2 years old.|`|AA11611849	No im not physically stronger than my brother. nor can i lift him or carry him. or even tried. im 21 and my brother is 16 and he is 228 lbs...and im 118 lbs...so i can't do anything.|`|XxFHAT2aaa	yeah...your right that is sad. yeah i can carry my bro but i dont kick
g2cYsy4Caa	One thing all guys need to know about girls is they are very manipulative and they go for evil revenge|`|2JJLYSAKaa	This is very weird.  Who are these girls?  Are they all friends? Why would they hate you?    The only thing that matters is that your girl friend believes you.  As long as you are faithful and honest, she should be able to see the truth in your eyes.|`|a9qrXBBsaa	I know it says girls, but i happened to have clicked on it. They are just evil people. Maybe they want you, or are jealous, or really hate you or your girlfriend, but they are just nasty nasty girls. Make sure you and your girlfriend are strong and REALLY trust each other.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	JEALOUSY MY FRIEND...!!!!!!!|`|Ddfff5psaa	Have you ever seen the movie " John Tucker Must Die"? Yea you probably broke their hearts buddy.....
THbIes2Baa	Those girls do that things because they are jealous. Jealousy is one of the main reasons many girls has when it comes to boys and other friends if they don't get enough attention - not in a bad way, and there is someone else who gets the most of you. Then payback starts and all those mean things, which is not a good thing to do at all. They want to be the centre of your attention and feel a bit 'let down' as it sounds like they all have some kind of feelings for you even though they might not show it in the right way, or there is always the other one where they just might not like you.   Dont listen to what they say and tell your girlfriend the truth about you before she hear anything else that is totally wrong about you and put your relationship at risk. Tell her about those girls and everything.   Good luck!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	because it sounds like you're a player.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Probably becuase they think that if they dont have you know one else can.?|`|PHKSoUTDaa	Maybe it's because you're called Noodles?|`|9WHtStZNaa	They do this because they can. Girls get scorned and then expect that their guy friends will always be there because there boyfriends weren't. Once the guy friends do that one thing its one girl against the whole male race, any girl standing in her way gets destroyed along the way. This sounds like a really bad summary of a manga... Anyways... Once a girl is scorned by a lover and a friend, they scorn all men, forever. They are probably upset that you seem happy without them being the center of your attention. It's hard to explain.|`|AA11885828	there jealous|`|FwWt8oEFaa	They are just jealous. The don't want the best for you.|`|Ddfff5psaa	I already told you! lol same answer they are mad at you and want to destroy you!|`|OoiTYcXVaa	Mabye they r just jellos girls get that way the freinds ya know I'll give u my adress u can go ahaed and send me your wedding invight|`|vvLC5zaaaa	maybe they found someone else or were jealous|`|oTHGgowsaa	They're probably jealous and want you for themselves, so tell your girlfriend what's going on so when they tell her this stuff she'll know it's not true.

0AYPgUQIaa	If you measure love by how much he pays for your presents, I pity you deeply. If I had a girlfriend I would be happy just for her being with me.. To hold her in my arms and hear that she loves me. That is the most important gift.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	someone's superficial|`|wWzO9xARaa	Valentines Day is a BS holiday. The amount of love a person has for you on this day is no different from any other day, and it shouldn't be judged by what they buy you. It's just like any other day only it has a little more red and pink involved. Don't get me wrong getting presents is nice and I love to spend time with my boyfriend but I don't think Valentines day is that important.|`|gAuIixm6aa	oh yeah, no way are you materialistic. what a lucky man.|`|h99Mcg6taa	I suppose it would suck if you give him all that and he only gets you flowers or somethin.  But I would suggest that you maybe leave one thing out, it seems like a bit much for 6mths.  Plus, considering the fact that he has $ issues at the moment, it might make him feel like crap that he wasn't able to get you all that you got him.|`|bG8mEUHhaa	stop right there. if u r expecting sumthing ur setting ur self up 4 a let down. dnt expect anything plus it make more fun when u dnt know wat he getting u so stop expecting. n be grateful. hes gonna surprise you. think positive n u will be in gd hand.|`|da2KJ9fXaa	maybe you should just give him the poem and the card with the candy. that way if he doesn't give you something so great he won't feel awkward because you gave him something pretty great.don't give him the Cologne and the stemmed rose, keep it simple.  be considerate if he's having trouble with money then you shouldn't be so demanding about valentine's day.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	GD!  Stop being so full of yourself!  He'll get you what he wants to get you!  And it's the freaking thought that counts!  You should be happy either way, 'cause he could just dump you on Valentines Day.  Then the jokes on you.|`|fJgt7ZXbaa	next time you see him read a magazine that has something you really like (not expensive)...something you want for VD.    then ask him to come with you shopping to buy that "thing" in the mag. go look for it and say oh this is the one. or just take your time looking at the thing. But wen u want to buy, say that ur not aloud to buy too many things cause u just bought sumthin yesterday....  hopefully should work.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Well, 2 months isn't that long to accrue money, first of all. So if he has bills to pay and such, he probably doesn't have all that much money laying around. Second of all, you shouldn't act like you're not materialistic, because clearly you are. If you are, that's okay - just own up to it. Guys rarely know what to get a new relationship (yes, 6 months is very new still) for Valentines day. He will most likely stick with candy and roses unless you direct him otherwise. Drop hints, let him know you "need" new earrings, or you really love the sunglasses that they sell in Macy's. Just things like that. Also, don't be disappointed. If he goes out of his way to buy you something along the same lines of what you bought him (no candy is worth 50 dollars, so you didn't spend that on him) then you should be happy. Gift giving is just that - it's the giving of a gift. You don't give a gift solely to get (a better) one in return. You give a gift because you like/love the recipient, and you want them to have the gift.     Wow, I just read that he's having financial troubles. Listen - I don't know what world you live in, but in the real world it's HARD to drop $50 on any one thing that's not necessary, let along dropping $50 dollars when you are trying to catch up on bills and other things. I'm telling you, don't expect anything expensive.     Just...wow.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	Be happy with what he gets you. True love sees any gift as great because it comes from a lover. me and my bf are the same age as ya'll and we're in the same situation.we are on our 6th month as well! Cept neither one of us has a job. So all I'm looking forward to is spending an evening with him and no one else at his house and watching a movie with him we've seen together 100 times because all we care about is our time spent together and letting each other know physically and mentally that we really love each other. So for quite a while I've been patient with money problems. Money isn't happieness.|`|Wn9pVR1raa	Lol wtf im sorry but this is pathetically worded and you don't exactly come across as a nice girl :S    It's not about the expense its the thought, and besides you knew he was having money trouble so why the hell did you buy him a expensive present!|`|rtpvWpNJaa	Seriously, if your expecting something you are wrong. If you care, you give from the heart with no strings attached. If your expecting him to give you something and he dosen't, sounds like you'll be ready to X the relationship. The fact that you didnt have to say anything to him and he gave you a box of Branches Candy that cost 1.00 should be appreciated. After 6 months, you should have a slight idea of the type of guy he is, if he's a giving person, then you know he's not going to pass V day without giving you anything, even if its his time. But mentioning that he's in a money crunch for bills??? If you already know that (cause men will never let his girl know that he's broke) it is most likely worst than just that, so don't X him if he dosent reach your 50.00 limit.    Bottom line???? Buy him a gift cause you care about him without expectations. I gaurantee you if you do and he dosen't, he will not forget in the future and if you dont react to his NOT being able to give, he will remember that even more and it will pay off down the line.... Good Luck|`|HCeCpPQfaa	you shoud like a little uh lets think of a word.. jerky. or you  know what i mean with a b. I'm sorry.  You should happy whatever he gets you! !    Gosh people try to be like so spoiled now.  Wow.. you should be ashamed of yourself.
8WSGGgo2aa	I think it would be nice to buy her something small.  Don't go too overboard because you don't want her to get used to getting great things all the time.  Try candy, chocolates, or even one flower (A rose, perhaps?)  Again, nothing too big, just something that says "I really like you, Happy Birthday"  Though  you run the risk of her thinking you're cheap, but only if she's a golddigger :P  Most girls would think it's cute :)  Good luck!|`|9bUFRCkiaa	try to take her out go lunch. Its too early to buy gifts. She might think your putting her up with alot of pressure. A good lunch or dinner is always good. Rather than you giving her something

Put yourself in their place.   Imagine one of the your boyfriends had another girlfriend you did not know about but then found out. How would you feel?

You are not only hurting them, but you are going to end up hurting yourself. You will lose them as boyfriends, and maybe even friends. If you really do care about them then choose the one who seems right for you and break up with the other one. Do you really think that dating both of them is the right thing to do? Think of yourself in their place. If one of them was cheating on you, would you like it?  If you really want to hurt them and yourself, then keep doing what your doing. But if you don't, then do the right thing.

As soon as she speaks I am hooked.|`|hLjjHJIJaa	A nice personality. Not to quiet but not too loud.

ac1a592a254aff116a1f945b83be5e94aa	take her to a concert. then at the right moment (for you to decide) standing behind her, put your arms around her and lock your hands at her waist... if she is into you then you just made the first move|`|31fDBuLjaa	If you live near the beach, take her there, at sunset and after. Take a walk on the pier, if there is one ... get ice cream or hot chocolate ... the pier is the perfect place to make your move.    Warning! If she does deign to make out with you, your perceptions of her will change immediately. Thenceforth you will mysteriously not give one damn about whatever she's talking about. Her texts, which you used to look forward to, will suddenly be annoying.   Be courteous and pretend you still do care, at least for like a week.|`|J8uhpecYaa	Don't make any moves on your partner w/o her consent.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	start by asking her on a date|`|dMknJjY0aa	this is the best way    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1782170 6dzz5z5...|`|ZVfxJacvaa	Well, if she does all that with you that much, I'm pretty sure she likes you. I'd just pick a couple movies. And I wouldn't worry about being bored either, when you really care about someone, you're happy to be with them, even if you're both bored. You can be bored together. Anyways, Yeah I think a movie is good. Maybe sometime when it can just be the two of you alone. Sit close to her and see how she reacts. I'd wait til mid movie though. So if anything would become awkward in anyway the movie would be close to ending. I think she likes you and I wish you luck! Hope I helped.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	aww yeah she likes you  pop in a movie and try to talk a little hold her hand... hard move to do buut she wont stop you, she'll just smile and be happy.    you'll have to tell her that you're going to miss her while she's gone ans maybe give her a kiss if that's want you want to do|`|uoe1VjDoaa	Try to talk to her. Tell her how you feel|`|R1h0bHeMaa	do something exciting! go ice skating! see a good movie! go to dinner! and most of all, just go for it!  put all of your insecurities aside, you seem like a nice kid, just do it!|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	yeah i agree, it's could to be pretty clear about what you want, girls can often get confused about what their intentions with guys are, so you have to set the agenda.    you say hey do you wanna go on a date, not as friends, but as a date.    make sure you are clear about what you want out of it, don't pussyfoot around the issue or you'll get stuck in the "friend-zone" corny but true|`|siRilMZ2aa	yeah i movie would proly be the best|`|DKzCi12xaa	just tell her how you feel. cant go wrong there|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	i think you should just say "hey let's go out, for real this time" and if she doesnt respond the way you want her to,just play it off like it was nothing.  :]|`|ot3xCnsZaa	then start the move! .tell him that you like her that you love her! "tell her that "before you went out for vacation i just would like you to know that i feel some special for you that i love you.............see?|`|n7cetvuUaa	one time if it gets romantic kiss her, and then if she doesnt kiss u back and goes, what the hell? then tell her u have mad feelings for her. take it or leave it. be confident straight away, even if ur nervous, fake it :)|`|r0GZgtexaa	Start by going to the movies with her. Just be comfortable. Soon invite her to your house to hang out and a *hint* for her would be if you put in a romantic comedy. :) Soon just tell her your feelings. Trust me, us girls love a guy who expresses how he feels!|`|3YfovHtoaa	suggest that you might want to explore the activities together with her..  this way, both parties will own up to this activity more...    maybe choose some kind of activity that both of u can interact..eg: archery, bowling, go kart...|`|QNoYhEF8aa	If I were you. I'd go for it. I know that I always prefer it if a guy asked me out first.     1. I'm shy anyway.  2. I'd probably get rejected so can't be bothered with it.  3. I only have one guy ask me out but ain't seen him for like ever!  4. This girl is probably the same. Just ask her!|`|PoTY8CNFaa	You should start watching Billy Madison (an older Adam Sandler movie in case you don't know). Next you offer her gum and hope that she doesn't want any. Next you turn off the lights and play some soft jazz in the background and tickle her dookie shoot.    Your gold from there kid|`|9ZtXU9Nuaa	yes!  ask her out or whatever you call it  maybe do it when she comes back because then she will realize when shes on holidays that she really misses you and that she shouldnt take you for granted  :)  good luck   also be really romantic, that always works|`|UgEYBvh8aa	Don't ask her to your house yet! Start out casual. Ask her out to coffee [Starbucks!!!] and just talk for awhile. Afterwards, you guys can walk around. It will be like a casual friendly outing, but also sort of like a date. If things go well by the end, then ask her if she wants to go out on a REAL date. =]     Trust me. It works.|`|MTkpXsOPaa	It sounds like she likes you if she says she is going to miss you. A movie would be nice ask her her favorite type. Scary movies are always fun because if she gets scared she will cuddle up to you that is if the parents are not around. Good Luck

AA12032273	Tell him frankly tht you don`t wana go out with him..|`|P0WGuq07aa	If he wants to go out as just friends, then there's no need to pick V-Day.     If you find him creepy, why are you even still talking too him?|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	cant you just say "I cant! I have a romantic day planned already!" that way he'll think you have a boyfriend or youre seeing some one.|`|HQWpJhwKaa	just end it and say your not intrested he will get the point and stop...don't lead him on anymore|`|5zjwOSe9aa	Here is an easy one.    Since he sees you as a "friend", one day get all excited, call him or tell him in person and go on a date with him...    But during this date you keep going on and on about this guy you met, and hes driving you crazy but hes not acting interested, and ask what he thinks you should do...    After that "date" he won't be bothering you anymore.  Because after that tease and release, is like the most subtle way of saying, we are sooo just friends...  And if he does keep on buggin you, just say sorry im busy talking to "name of that guy you met"    Good Luck    Answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	That is pretty nice of you for not wanting to hurt his feelings. You are a rare breed lol.   Make sure you are not leading him on in any way. Sometimes girls do this while trying to be nice and don't realize that they are leading guys on. Just try to give him the hint that you are not romantically interested in him.  If he still doesn't take the hint, then either talk to him or just start ignoring him. Don't worry about things being awkward with him at work, you have to worry about yourself first.   Good luck.|`|Uhaye8Bcaa	that sucks|`|cDv5wjMZaa	tell him you would be so happy if you could be just friends becasue have a  realationship at work is awkward and you don't want to ruin any friendship you would have if things didnt work out...ive done it before its not easy but itll work|`|7CPRTQSTaa	Just tell him that you wouldn't feel right going out as just friends on a day such as Valentines Day. Let him know that you value his friendship and that you only look to him as a friend. He should understand that.
m15b1GN2aa	what do guys want with u.....guys who are reluctant to take up responsibilty will tend to stay away from virgins....they just want a fling with no strings attached......and yeah a first time girl should be tenderly loved........    if guys are decent and  u are a virgin ,,,,,,,,,,doesnt matter at all.....in fact we will be gentle and understanding and more loving to a virgin.......than just any girl.....virgins are fragile any decent guy would handle with great care .....and love    in fact in times in china the virginity of a geisha was so highly priced the first sex is considered to be very valuable....    lay to rest ur worries.....ur guy is out there somewhere looking to find u and maybe even getting more and more worthy of u ....    just u wait for him.....     wish u all love and best lover and lovemaking in the world everytime and first time....    take care|`|SrMt01nOaa	No guys don't care!    In fact most guys would prefer a virgin!    To know, the place we're about to enter has not been entered before!|`|ptclgKl5aa	No, hopefully when you go to college or leave home you get to a bigger town where you can find decent guys.  There are decent guys out here, we just have problems finding girls like you.|`|MNXtKnDqaa	actually i think guys like it best when you're a virgin.. they are just all in the stage of their life where they want a fling and stuff. but they will mature and figure out their lives eventually. your virginity is something to hold on to no matter what anyone tries to tell you. good for you.|`|kcaX04z2aa	those guys obviously want a quick hook up or what not...    To be honest, knowing a girl has been with nobody before me is a HUGE turn on.  I think you just have to find the right guy who will be accepting of that.|`|94W9CFKnaa	they don't want to have sex with a virgin because if things don't work out, they are going to be the one with guilt on their hands, in other words they are asses but yeah that's a big part of their mindset
9nYFn53raa	18 year old snowboarder from CALIFORNIA  wow MY completely DREam guy   because im 18, love snowboarding and am in love   with california and think california boys are soo hot!    send me a picture;)!!! or chat|`|qCGorabAaa	well... your the kind of guy i see in a bar that sends shivers up and down my spine. and not in a good way. you are the guy who is only interested in one thing and we can smell it a mile away. chill out and dont be so desperate. if your too horny too fast you will totally scare away any girl    my advice:  find a reeeeeeally drunk chick. at a college bar.     not that difficult i work in a bar and sad mother ******* walk out with choice girls every night much to my disgust/entertainment.    dont do anything more than buy her a drink and shut the **** up. dont immediately proposition her, if you shut up and ask enough questions she will take care of that for you.    drunk, self concious college girls= how to get laid.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Confidence.  I know thats not helpful but thats what it boils down to.  Grow some and put yourself out there a bit more.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Pay a hooker.  Not only will you be relieved, you will also be more relaxed and confident for when you meet a girl you actually like.|`|l8lOsdlHaa	one night just start like flirting with a girl and if shes flirting back then make out with her and you move in by feeling and touching then it will work out trust me haha .
0AYPgUQIaa	Girls always want someone who they can't get(and boys too).  I have tons of friends like her who are longing for "dream" boys and would never look for the ones who are actually there for her.  Move on but not completely. Help her out here and then, there is always a chance that she might introduce you to one of her friends...|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	Agree... you should find someone who thinks of you and you only.
zWqKuIQuaa	If I like a girl I do not worry about stupid things like ruining the friendship.  If you like her in that way then the friendship is bogus anyway.  If she decides to be a weirdo about it after then thats her problem.  You should tell her how you feel.  But you probably wont and chicken out.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	That's a hard one. On the one hand you are dieing to tell your love that you love her and on the other hand it may make your friendship awkward. It may not be a good time to tell her, because she is only broken up for 2 months, now. That's a very short time. She needs to work through all kinds of emotions. How about trying to get closer to her on vacation and see if she is receptive to it. About Valentine's Day, pick a flower and give it to her, give her a hug, and whisper in her ear that she is special. Good luck
0711cf00ce1887a2b0a0fc8858a57469aa	First of all, no offense but you're an idiot. Of course he's not going to respect you if you're only F-Buddies. That's the point, from the man's point of view. He wants to have sex with you, not be your man. He doesn't want the responsibility of treating you like a person, just an object.   I'm sorry that you got yourself into this situation.   No you're not the problem. It's him. He's a jerk. He's an ***.   He's never going to show you respect, because he doesn't think you're worth that. He's already decided you are nothing more than a peice of ***. He will manipulate you, tell you whatever you want to hear, or do whatever he thinks it's going to take to get into your pants.   He's afraid of commitment, and too immature for responsibility.   If you want your respect back, then stay away from the prick, and don't get yourself in that kind of a situation again. Save yourself for someone who's going to treat you with the same respect as you're willing to give.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Thing is, a lot of the times, we choose relationships that reflect what we feel on the inside.    So if we respect ourselves, we don't tolerate with jerks, period.    I personally think the guy did not respect you, because at the heart of it all, he didn't really care. Told you lies, etc. Probably isn't a good person.    There are other guys out there who do care. In fact, they're probably standing in line, waiting, the shy ones. Give them a try, instead? Shy guys have lots for a girl to learn from. Take care.|`|FPLIBcUwaa	heya....okay well guys dont like to show there weakness! he sounds like he was just being such an ediot! when he comes crawling back dont take him back! your better then this! and you should know that! every girl should be treated with respect! be strong and dont go back to him! you can move on! have faith! hope i helped x x x|`|0Qfbjz2Naa	It sounds like this guy is treating u like an object. I would talk to him about it and give him a chance. But if it continues, then just walk away. You DONT want to be in a relationship where ur getting hurt, it would only get worse.     He might feel like hes losing you or his buddies are "talking" to him, he might just be trying to act like a playa or hes trying different things to see what works.     Just sit down and talk to him and ask him what he doing. See if u cant get ur friend back.|`|onAEy5jTaa	I know I'm going to get a million thumbs down, but how the hell do you expect him to respect you when you guys are f**k buddies? You practically just give yourself to him for free, so he doesn't care. You're almost like his S L U T! Gosh, why would anybody have a f**k buddy, when you can have a boyfriend? If he laughs at you behind your back, then I think you should end the stupid f**k relationship and find someone to settle with! Sheesh!

He sounds like a tool. I bet he'd be shocked if he opened the door and saw you standing there with a guy who doesn't treat you like a piece of meat.|`|AA10327722	Answer the door naked, that will definitely shock him.|`|bE6ulnRUaa	other than showing up naked, do something different with your hair? i know be ready to throw a 'peach pie' at him,|`|Dfzs9TThaa	he wants to be your birthday suit....    maybe you can wear something revealing under a coat or something and open it up when he opens the door|`|3GZPbkbQaa	Public masturbator trench coat.|`|cwmcALJyaa	wear a long coat (trench) and wear your "nuthins" undernieth- that will shock him|`|E9ksrxsLaa	Just look cute and adorable.

AA10565336	If you aren't dating someone, do so, and don't make a secret of it.  Any inquiries from your "Best Friend" can be handled on a "Best Friend" basis.    OR:    Go slobber all over yourself and her.  On the knees, begging.    Yours may be the exception but in the case of unmarried breakups I don't see where playing it coy or elusive has done much good.  I recommend either a clean break and let her or you come unglued or else go get her back or at least try.    Good luck, either way you are in for a ride.    BTW, If I were you I would consider walking away...  I sense an issue of trust in both parties.  Once trust is in question it is damn hard to get back to 100%.|`|P9oduCUgaa	hit it one last time bro|`|3Ml7ekHEaa	I think You guys have a very high chance of getting back together. It has happened to me before but in the end everything worked out. It seems like she is just confused at the moment.|`|oI46t9lVaa	well by the sounds of things she still does love you in a way but she has met this new guy and has feelings for him too and she is confused. i think if you sit back and just stay the supportive best friend then yes she will miss you and the relationship you have. if she is iffy about this other guy then maybe she is just trying to get her head round alot at the moment. i mean she just broke up with you so she would be feeling kind of emotional and then she has feelings for this guy but she feels that its not the right thing to do your best bet is to sit back and wait even if they do get together wait cause by the sounds of things they probably wont last and you being the supportive friend will let her see how much she misses you.  hope this helps!!
Tf19RETiaa	yea just ask her out, who cares what those other people say.|`|LEkFdmXiaa	Yes. Ask her out.    --BUT--    Wrap it before you tap it. You never know where she's been, and frankly if you did you probably wouldn't want to use her anymore.
xmWxafHSaa	She is doing it because she wants your attention.  Talk to her and tell her you will spend some time with her once you are done with what you are doing.  Make sure you take some time out of your day for your sister.  Once you move out, you are going to miss her.  It may not seem like that right now but one day you will, so spend a little extra time with her.  It will make the difference.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Aw how old is she? If she's over the age of 7, I would tell her to stop bugging me, it's really annoying. Although that may not work, because little siblings tend to love annoying older siblings. They just want to be like you, you know? So they watch your every move. Hang in there!|`|bE6ulnRUaa	usually good things come to those who wait...get her a b/f,...kick her *** and sit on her telling her to give you space-but sound like you should have done that at an earlier age...get her in trouble....make her pee her bed at night with warm water...pay her off....lol
THIvlI4waa	Okay, this depends on how long you've been speaking with her on msn. I wouldn't recommend you to call her, I say write her an offline msg. Now if you send her an offline msg after 3-4 days saying "my bad for not calling you last week" it sounds like you care too much or Maybe that's just me?     I think you should send her a msg saying something like this:   "Hey, its me, i'm at _____ because of the band.. ive been thinking about u so i thought id catch you online but your not here..i'm coming back..hopefully ill get to talk to you then..
q8vILEpfaa	If she is not interested at the moment, you can't mes up!  Call her and tell her what happened and how bad you feel not getting to talk to her. See where it goes from there.    Good Luck!
zZej4pYuaa	well if you really do like her, it won't matter how old or what grade she is in so if you want to ask her out go ahead, but do what your heart tells you to do. And yes, I think it is fine for a 7th grader to like a 5th grader, after all, she likes you too! :-)|`|Xrvutzmdaa	um well you have to ask her how she would feel about it. if i were her i would probably say yes just for it ask her how she feels about it !!|`|d1MBoAtHaa	if you really care for her than  grade and age should not matter at all  so wat if she is in sixth grade  that should have nothing to do   with having a girlfriend or having a   crush    YOU SHOULD ASK HER OUT !!!!|`|AZZFuLRraa	yes man!|`|UARTf9gPaa	yeah its okay....?  does it really matter?|`|R2BBjtaraa	go for it! ages dont matter.    she'll be flattered.  trust me im in 8th grade and like literally(im not even exaggerating) half the guys have girlfriends in 7th grade and even more of him have girlfriends in 6th grade. thats a TWO year difference.    ok and whats even scarier is most of the GIRLS in my grade have boyfriends in sixth and seventh grade lol.    so as long as you like eachother age doesnt matter.  its perfectly fine!|`|ojwRgCLqaa	yes! It's only 1 year difference. right now it might seem like a lot but when your older it will seem like nothing. go for it! if you like her and she likes you then it's perfect. i think it's especially fine if a older guy goes out with a girl. but to me it's a little weird if an older girl goes with a younger guy. idk though it's just my opinion though.  Good luck :)|`|9qlpqEFKaa	there is no reason why you shouldnt :) go for it|`|MkE2kO1iaa	yes I mean really!|`|t6Ut5voeaa	Yeah, ask her out.|`|H7fUC8ILaa	i thinl you should ask her out since you like her and she likes you  yep i thinl it is ok|`|GQdxDkA9aa	ok girls will always like older guys and it is ok for a 7th grade guy to go ou with a 6th grade girl, i know girls in 8th grade that date guys in 6th theres no problem with it so go for it i dont see a problem hell im in 8th grade and im dating a sophmore|`|uxzLX8fRaa	ya why wouldn't it be okay it's not illegal or anything and who cares what people think|`|gs4fwiaqaa	Of course it is okay. People with more than a 12 age difference get married! And you guys are only one year apart. If you both like her, then go for it! Hope I could help!

Why not ask her? She likes you, too, right? Maybe she would like to go out with you. Just don't force her to go out. :D|`|5iIgh2Evaa	I think it's ok. As long as she's not a whole lot younger than you, it's just one grade. If she were moved up a grade or if you were held back a grade and you were in the same grade together it wouldn't matter right?|`|oztoPKrGaa	go for it:)  grades dont matter ur just prob not going 2 be in any classes together..Hall way dating is kinda fun to! lol|`|YuXbUmtIaa	You should go for it :) There is definitely nothing wrong with a one year age difference. And don't worry if she is taller than you. I bet you'll be taller than her soon.|`|5TN3MXw2aa	definatly. if you like her don't let ne thing get in the way of you asking her out! Just act chill when you do it and do it in person, its cuter:) but if you don't know her that well i suggest double dating like go to the movies with a group of friends and invite her, hang out and just chill:)  hope everything works out:)|`|Xizw226Zaa	When you're in school people are going to criticize everything you do.  The clothes you wear, the music you listen to, and especially the girls you like.  I'm 21 and my girlfriend turns 18 in about a week.  People can have a lot to say about that.  But when you really care about the girl your with, nothing anyone can say makes a difference.  Plus, 1 year isn't that big of a difference anyway ;).
XH2o1MM6aa	.Depends on your ages.Is the girl allowed to be out at Midnight.If so,then go to the movies as planned.Afterwards have a stroll and find a nice quiet eatery.Have a light snack to pass some time.On the stroke of Midnight present her with Small Momento your good wishes and a kiss
7AFLaiYjaa	well im not a guy, but my guy friends hate really skinny girls.|`|5f8f97b596d7b2be44810ceadae63a38aa	my partner is quite skinny and small - but I love her to bits. She is quite ashamed of her body, but I wouldn't change anything about it.|`|Tf19RETiaa	nobody wants to date a stick, i mean come on!
ZlC654Dkaa	It's reproductive biology.  A girl bending over signifies sexual submission, triggering a sexual response in the male.  You're asking a tricky question like - why is a guy attracted to girls?|`|8LzZvPwjaa	I can't answer for what guys see in girls' butts....but as a girl I tell you that shouldn't tolerate this behavior in your boyfriend, I mean sure it's ok that he looks at other girls, it's normal and he can't help it, but when he's with you he shouldn't be looking at other girls' butts, he should at least try not to out of respect for you, and staring until he gets an erection is out of the question, don't put up with anything..and if you don't want to argue then at least stare at other guys too while you're with him and see if he likes it...|`|UbR8EfMxaa	they like to see what kind of pushen or cushen they would have. also we like to imagine them sitting on  our hoo haw.|`|SdYOAb62aa	What Zippey said.  That's why we like doggy style so much. Plus, there's the saying of "more cushion for the pushing."  Guys get turned on by different things on girls, it changes for almost every guy.  For example, I like stomachs, a lot.    The fact that he gets an erection that easily from butts is pretty crazy though.    And snake, I don't think guys have hoo haws...|`|KC7Q9Vv7aa	Guys are attracted by girls butts is because us guys see it as another sexual interaction.  If your boyfriend is looking at other girls and getting a erection in front of you means he only wants to get into your pants. If he was truly in love with you he would have only looked at them for like a second then turned his head away. No hard offense but he only wants to get in your pants.  If I were you I would dumb him.
b10aMPdOaa	Hey, she can't be that bothered about the earings if she lent them out.  You've been open and honest with her.  You've done what you can.  If she's being a ***** about it, then she's not a good friend.  Whatever you can afford, just give it to her and walk away.  Good luck|`|R2BBjtaraa	lol this sounds just like the story "the diamond necklace"  the woman borrows an expensive necklace from a wealthy friend for one night, she loses the necklace, buys a new one thats really expensive and gives it back to her friend, works her whole life to pay it off, then runs into her friend  many years later and finds out the original necklace she borrowed was a fake and only worth a couple bucks.  just tell your friend what happened. seriously im sure she'd understand. tell her you're really sorry and will pay her back.  good luck!|`|q2H9jgDSaa	seriously women over 25 only?  wow you are acting childish. anybody can answer this question. you told her you're sorry and if she doesn't accept it over a pair of earrings then how good of a friend is she? uh not a very good one. :)|`|wz3S190haa	must be nice haha|`|jOpOPtGLaa	If she really is rich, that is selfish of her. Everyone makes mistakes, I am sure she can get over it.|`|5LT6LRUZaa	word of advice, NEVER borrow anything you cannot afford to replace or pay back!    she has a right to be upset with you, she trusted you with her property, she trusted you not to lose them and return them, it doesn't matter that she's wealthy anymore that it matters that you aren't, they weren't yours to lose!  I believe you are sorry you lost it and she's being a bit harsh in the not talking to you department, however, she shouldn't have had to find another pair and contact you to let you know how much they cost, YOU should have already known this so you would at least know what kind of money it was going to take to replace them, you say you "will apply" for a credit card to replace them?  why haven't you already?  were you hoping because she's wealthy that she would just forgive your obligation?  when you say expensive how expensive??? thousands of dollars??? if that is the case you should have NEVER borrowed them knowing that you would not be able to carry the responsibility...and the same can be said for her loaning them to you if she knew financially you couldn't take the responsibility...but she does have a right to be upset with you though I think not talking to you at all is a bit extreme, she does have a right.    I'm not trying to be harsh, but I'm not a wealthy person but I have some nice things, things I've had to replace out of my own pocket because my "good friends" were irresponsible in losing them or breaking them when they borrowed them, friends who "felt horrible" but made a half assed attempt in replacing these items or complaining about themselves being too broke to replace them,  example...I loaned my digital camera to a girlfriend that was having a baby, she wanted to take pictures for the birth, well her husband dropped my camera, it was past it's warranty, it was returned to me in pieces with an explanation and an apology along with this statement "sorry bout that but we can't replace it we don't have the money! we have 3 kids to support" that was 4 years ago...they've received several tax returns since then...no effort to replace it, they both have jobs, no offer to make payments, the cost of this camera has gone down, no effort to purchase a new one, so I called them about it, since they sort of forgot they were friends of mine since it happened, you know what they said? "well it's not like it was brand new when we borrowed it so why should we get you a brand new one?" oh! and..."we still have 3 kids to support!"  NOT MY PROBLEM!  So needless to say I don't loan anything out anymore!    the bottom line is, the responsibility is on YOU to replace these, regardless if she's talking to you or not,  so if that means you have to get a credit card to do so, than you do, if you have to get another job, then you do, she may forgive you, but be prepared for her never to loan you anything again!|`|AaXl5YYkaa	tell her to get over it and that you cant afford it, she should understand that. offer to pay some of the price, as much as you can afford and if she wont take it than is she really such a good friend if she will stay mad over an earring when you really cant afford it?|`|vVCSKvXIaa	you know what i am 15 and i dont see why this is only for girls over 25? thats stupid, anyways my answer.    if she was a real friend and she has alot of money then she shouldnt be that mad at you. she should be mad but not so mad that she doesnt want to be your friend anymore.  if i were you i would give the one earing back though because it could have valuable stones on it that she may want for other stuff. pay her back in parts for the earings that you lost though.  go and see her at work to talk about it,
ugFTy4QZaa	Me and my friend are answering this just to let you know :]]  We think probably but, if she not really talking to you in just in general, maybe not. But u can always take a  chance and ask! We hope this helped :]]|`|qXpxILnRaa	Well, it seems like to me she's a little unsure or too afraid to say no since she doesn't want to hurt your feelings.|`|vHFx2iy6aa	definitely man I say you go for it|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Where has the world gone to?...|`|ZnJ2Y5cAaa	Probably|`|cW7RXq8Qaa	Well she isn't gonna tell your friend what she feels about you. You need to be the one who tells her how you feel and ask how she feels about you. That way she has to give you a straight answer.|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	i think she does but she is hiding it by saying "i dont know" and laughing. you should get "friendlier" (like flirting) with her. i think she does and that you should ask her out some time. but dont lean on my answer to much. i only know through what you told me.    good luck!  :)|`|tPdwmZKzaa	lol probably  but u should ask her yourself  and i dono is probably yes.|`|cEFLCoaHaa	I'm not quite positive but i think she likes you, but its up to you to find out. Don't get too confident that she likes you but don't get down on yourself.|`|58X0Rx5Saa	i think she might so go for it!!
pORmp0tfaa	Obviously something has happened, and either he's very busy dealing with it or he's overwhelmed. Either way he needs his space, so cut him some slack for not being around the past few days, I'm sure he'll talk to you about what's going on when he's ready, but now is not the time to add the extra stress of you being mad at him to his problems.
GqhtePhgaa	It's hard to say.  I'm feeling like maybe he's trying to be responsible because he is trying to be a good step-dad and wants to be a good role model.
ivsKcwwvaa	It's funny to watch the reaction, as long as the guy isn't hurt really bad. You see a boy crying like a baby, in real agony, it's not. But just a a couple minutes it is.|`|GJoxxPBcaa	No reason why it's funny.    Do you laugh when people slip?  Do you laugh when people mess up on something?  Do you laugh when people are stupid?    Same reason.  As human beings, we just love laughing at pain.    And a guy + kicked in the balls = Hysterical!    I personally would never kick someone in the balls, though.  Unless I was really mad. ;)
cW7RXq8Qaa	Do something with your single friends or family. Valentines Day is not only for couples. Its for anyone you like.
CGGm9N9saa	Okay... best thing to do.. is to get comfortable.. obviously you have passed the stage where you two arent fumbling around one another.. there is no set way to do it ... but if you want a step by step guide here it goes.. firstly i would get comfy lying on the bed with eachother.. kissing.. getting more passionate.. start getting a bit more touchy feely.. rubbing your hands up and down his body.. pressing yourself against him... take his top off.. get him to take yours off too.. kiss his chest.. stroke his body.. make him feel relaxed and get him excited.. (obviously by taking your top off too he has something to look at...and wont feel as intimidated..) slowly undo his trousers.. still kissing him and rubbing your hands across his body...at this point either try and pull them down yourself (fairly quickly) or allow him to take them off but dont ruin th moment by fumbling with clothes.. continue to kiss him.. put your hands down into his boxers.. stroke his penis and his balls..be very gentle with him...at this point you can remove his boxers completely.. all the while still kissing him.. ou have to play with him until he is erect... at this point get a little bit of a tighter grip on him.. not too tight though... and start to move his foreskin up and down... look straight into his eyes.. and at random intervals kiss him and also gentle caress his balls.. whilst continuing with the up and down hand motion... allow this to get faster as he gets more excited and respond as he needs.. you could even take him into your mouth at this point.. and suck him off...keep going however.. until he cums( im sure you know what that looks like)... at this point you can lick the semen off him if you want... but afterwards make sure you continue to be passionate with him.. and be very gentle :) ... best advice i can give is to let it flow naturally.. do what you think is best.. every situation is different.. but i hope that give you some guidelines :)|`|edycn5ggaa	Talking about this is a little embarassing but w/e. Go easy, don't like grip it like you're arm-wrestling lol... be gentle. Also don't go down TOO far or it will hurt like hell, skin only pulls back so far in that region. Also, the head is the most sensitive area when he comes, if you touch him there he will jump lol... feels good and it's funny. Good Luck.    Oh and be easy and relaxed. He won't yell at you. Just be gentle, relaxed, and go slow with it lol. No pressure!|`|xqoc4poWaa	im not really expierenced  but ill stiill tell you what i know:)  uhm well just first start making out or kiss and stuff  and when it gets heated move him to the bed (but it doesnt have to be on the bed)   and then when you feel ready just unzip or unbuckle his pants and keep kissing him and  just put you hand on it haha and hold it and slide up and down   you can move your hand at different speeds, it depends on what he likes.   and yeah thats about it! good luck!|`|v9khqFviaa	Try to ask him. I think it would be better if you talk about it yourselves.|`|2EkjYRVBaa	Don't be scared. If you want to satisfy him, do some research on google and there's all kinds of tips. When it comes down to the real thing, just focus on doing your "job" right and that should take a lot of the nervousness out. One thing I will say is, watch how he responds to what you're doing and ASK him if he likes it...and use a lot of 'juice'/spit/lube.
QrUWtvH8aa	Woah! Hold your horses! SLow down - you are only 13, I know it's not what you want to hear and it's insulting when you hear it but: you are too young to be getting into serious relationships like that. YOu may feel certain about this but trust me, it will be the bigest mistake of your life if you get marry him or break up your family over this. And you certainly shouldn't be having sex with him - that's illegal! Sorry - i don't want to preach cos I know you'll just ignore what I have to say but i honestly think you should just listen to your parents. Maybe you can just be friends woth him? tho i don't spose that would really work?|`|UvJHHpHYaa	yah do you realize that in a year it will be illegal?
ID2FjURRaa	JUS TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU C HER NEXT IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT AT LEAST SHE'LL KNO HOW YA FEEL BOUT HER|`|jxseTHg7aa	well you really mess up just move on if you rejected her and now she has someone who cares what make you think she will leave him for you
AA12071655	Not much you can do but talk to her and tell she's better than that and doesn't deserve it. I can say that he's not going to wake up one day and magically be a new person. He'll likely get worse.
30e503c45d1be88262995a7310a905a0aa	gotta talk to her really be honest. we all arnt bad girls you know|`|iXQuSNtqaa	Honesty is key in a relationship.|`|Dq8oLMWFaa	I understand how you feel, so don't feel angry with yourself - you are only reacting to the pain you experienced ... but maybe this is time for a light to frighten your fear out of the shadows & you can lay the past to rest.   You can only be the person you are feeling right now, so you just need to tell her exactly how you feel  If she is a good person, she'll understand & if she cares about you she'll want to help - believe me, it will hurt her more if you just let her go without telling her your issues.    Shes not going to drop you & run just because you are human.   It doesn't mean just because you talk to her that you have to dive into a major relationship overnight ... but its the building bricks for a good relationship. Good luck :)
NEw5dsJlaa	Girls always want all guys' attention. This doesn't indicate that she wants any sort of meaningful relationship from you. She probably just revels in any guy liking her and wants it to continue for her own self esteem. Girls are mean like that.|`|RNLGfM1Waa	If she nows you like her...it just means shes flattered and wants ur attention 2 make her feel speacial :)..Good Luck..xx|`|H3SoAaycaa	she wants ur softness|`|S6RczEhwaa	she does like u but was to shy to say it|`|ZPYYlCvOaa	She just wants you to try harder flirt and compliment more. Another way to get her too like you always act like you are in a great mood even if your not girls always want to be around some1 that is happy and fun.
gNHRfHubaa	you need to apologize to her for being a coward and not sticking up for her when she needed you to. The least you could have done if you didn't want a confrontation with a drunk, was offer to take her some place else. telling her to chill out tells her you don't care. you need to consider just how much she means to you and then crawl - on hands and knees to get her back. Next time be a man.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Don't waste the time, go out on the pull.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	So some guy was being a total ***, she got mad, and you got pissed off with her and didn't stand up for her?    Forget about it. She's not going to talk to you, she's seen your true colors. Apparently it's okay with you if someone treats her like crap.|`|1o3cJoldaa	girls have this thing where they think that their boyfriends will like beat pepole up if they do something to them, or atleast say something to the person who did something to her. when you said chill out, she got mad because you didnt do anything.|`|y4dvOq4eaa	apologise. u should of been havin a go at the guy telling him to chill out not her. u should have defended her if some guy was being nasty to her. u dont sound very gentlemanly. tell her ur sorry|`|tgLiEZKTaa	Even though u did the right thing, i think she's a bit p**sed because she expected you to be a male protecting the female and knock him out.|`|3lVuNfLMaa	Go round to her house and try and sort things out in person, it is better from your part to do so|`|kg0ig2Edaa	Well you handled that badly. You should have asked her if she wanted you to have a word.     Bear in mind not all females want a guy to treat them like useless little creatures who cant take care of themselves.    As has been said go round and apologise in person it means a lot more. Ask her if you could take her for a picnic or something.
bC5XeVEIaa	I think it will be awkward, and possibly detrimental, if you focus on nothing but how hot he is. Yes. If you don't want to be used, I suggest you look for a little more.|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	now days it is not surprising to see a girl date an older guy|`|h3MY4Mtnaa	it shouldnt be akward i went on a date with a girl 6 years older than i am, just be yourself and everything should go fine.|`|CRVQKxPvaa	not so bad.... nothing wrong with that|`|UNGM6Xk7aa	no, this is cool you will have ur friends with you you will be fine
EcCLlRtTaa	Moving on depends on HOW YOU DECIDE to convince yourself to move on. Normally, mourning should only last 1 week after breakup because it's just a matter of ACCEPTANCE-the DECISION to accept the reality that you you two just won't make it anymore.    If you keep on convincing yourself that you can't, then you'll never ever be.    A piece of suggestion though, if you want to recover fast be active in SPORTS.|`|Q0PNQD9paa	It's different for everyone.
CA9OFT4Waa	no one is perfect, dont put yourself down so much. for all you know the reason they broke up is because he found she had way to many flaws, and i bet the only reason he wants her back is because she was on broadway and thats a kinda cool thing to say about your girlfriend but dont let that stop you from getting him, seriously, tell him you have feelings for him, dont let him slip away because you think he rather have her than you, be confident!|`|ronomgTIaa	find another guy. There are better guys out there for you.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	move on, he's not over her|`|3QG6WLXXaa	move on|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	don't waste your time with him|`|H7XOsgRCaa	this mite sound hard but hes not worth your time    but what i don't get is if they still like each other why did they break up in the first place,    but for real move on there's dudes out there that are worth your time|`|AMsK9mdsaa	Find someone else..  dnt try to be perfect.
9nP7c0eZaa	If you're not into women then you aren't a lesbian.  Stop worrying about it.|`|iXQuSNtqaa	If you're not sexually attracted to women, then no you're not a lesbian. It's not hard to believe that lesbians would be attracted to you, after all you are a girl, and lesbians are girl-girl relationships. They're into you just because of who you are, your looks, personality etc. You're a girl, hence them being attracted to you.|`|Asm4AKOOaa	i've had bad experiences with dating as well , you just have to move on from them and not let them bring you down .|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	Sounds like you already answered your own question.  Put it out of your mind and move on.|`|I1bAIFMXaa	If you are not attracted to them then don't worry about it. They were just bored with each other and had nothing better to do, besides they were probably jealous of you and your love.|`|xESvfzQAaa	Not sexually attracted to women = not a lesbian.    However, I do think that you need to talk to a counselor about your issues.  It is quite common that a woman be experiencing the thoughts you have after being in such a relationship.  Talk to a psychologist / counselor and try to work things out.|`|Gnhgfx4naa	Calm down, if your not sexually attracted to women you cant be a lesbian! :-)|`|rrkDfoOKaa	i love lesbians|`|8mr0Yy8Caa	Your NOT lesbian. You were just harassed by lesbian creeps..|`|vHFx2iy6aa	why are you even worrying about lesbians if you aren't lesbians.  forget it and just be with your man|`|cheXY6NEaa	Go see a doctor to help you get through it|`|mHZvOhsDaa	um what?    ok first off.. that sucks that you were abused.. i have sympathy for you, seriously i do, but the lesbian girls.. why not just say get the hell away from me? or shove em away?    i mean ok, only you know that your not gay.. maybe you are, idc i dont judge people. my motto is live and let live. i think you just got abused by it and put thoughts in your head. sometimes people cant tell and other times you just got groped. i mean honestly.. who cares..  only you know what you are and arnt.. if you say your not then your not, go find another guy, form a relationship, start a family do w.e    or if you think your turning into a lesbian go try it.. this question really isnt a question and their is no real way to help sorry :/    maybe talk to some clsoe friends?|`|wE2etBzbaa	your story makes no sense which lead to be to doubt into its authenticity .     but let's assume it is truthful,  you can just tell them to stop harassing you, and if they continue,  call the police and make restraining order against them.     and you are not lesbian just because lesbians interested in you.|`|F32uPjAraa	It sounds like you have had the bad luck to have bumped into some very confused people. Okay, that's not your fault. Remember when you enjoyed sex? Those are the thoughts that you should be focusing on. You have enjoyed sex in the past, you will in the future. It's just like riding a bike, once you learn, you can't unlearn.   Now to the worries about being a lesbian. Your thoughts are your own. You control them, don't you? All of your emotions come from a feeling don't they? And your feelings always come after you have a thought, that's true, isn't it? So what this means is that all of your emotions stem from a thought that YOU have had. Free will means, having the freedom to have your own thoughts, you control them. Probably the only thing in this life that we do truly have control over.  The next time you have these negative confusing thoughts, then make a conscious effort to stop thinking this way. Just say to your self, NO, I am not going to think this way any more.|`|dYChNv3Vaa	They probably targeted you, since people with past traumas are more likely to be targeted. You probably appeared more vulnerable, like an easy target because of your past experience.|`|jrl6d9g7aa	Obviously if ur NOT attracted to women ur NOT lesbian. Seems like a no brainer to me!|`|RqTC18NFaa	You should feel flattered that lesbians are attracted to you!  If you are not attracted to women, then you are not a lesbian-simple as that.  Why over complicate it?
lbX75d1xaa	Hm well they are probably right that she isn't feeling it.      But it could be that she is just kinda mixed up or flaky, or just like a lot of us, doesn't always have the skills to say the right thing at the right time.    Ask her simply and confidently, in light and friendly way.  Not a way that would make her feel any pressure.      Say hey it was fun seeing you again, but I got the feeling that since you brought your friend, that maybe you aren't sure about me, or just want to be friends?     Then see what she says and make sure she takes the next initiative - asking you to do something with her next.  But as soon as she does (if she does), then go along with it and forget the past.|`|Asm4AKOOaa	yeah i agree with your thoughs i don't think this date was good or she giving off a positive vibe of interest into you . its tough to say why she did this but maybe she realised she wasn't that into you , maybe she is the kind of girl who has lots of options in guys and though she could land a date with someone else ? i'm not sure but i don't think she is into you or that there will be a date   3|`|CA9OFT4Waa	no no no no! everyone is different around there friends, she doesnt want to see all into you because her friend will make fun of her, its a girl thing, when a new guy comes into our lives we make it hell for our friends until we figure out that they are serious about liking them and we stop, so no thats not a bad sign, just talk to her, tell her next time you wanna be alone! trust me, good luck!|`|N53oHiwNaa	she might just be shy:)|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Sorry, but it doesn't sound like it.  Furthermore, she was pretty rude to bring a friend with her on the second date - she should have not even made the date with you.  And you were sweet to pay for her AND her friend.  You deserve better treatment than you got from her.|`|3ijLQe5laa	follow the feeling. you may just be right. you know, 3's a crowd and people act different when thier friends are around.|`|MrdGGEj9aa	maybe her frend likes you?|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	MIchael~  You sound like a really sweet guy and this girl just took advantage of that.  She brought her friend and you paid for all of them.  She knew that would happen.  She is a jerk, don't waste your time with her.|`|PrlXK1fEaa	well dude  most times girls are not thierselves when they are with their friends.  Serusly,she might be into you but as long as shes with her friend or friends shes someone else.      well i really dont know wot kinda role shes tryna play by binging a friend with her to the date...thats like a No No.  i think shes tryna show u off OR! shes rili not into ypu so she brought a friend to make mockery of u.|`|MmIYDoGkaa	Two words that are plain and simple "DITCH HER".It was rude selfish of her to bring a girlfriend on a date and not even mention to pay the check, and plus she could at least say a proper good-bye.I think she probally has another relationship going on.But don't jump to conclusions!She probally isn't interested because she has her girlfriend with her.Go for another date soon and see what happens.|`|38l8GnItaa	to be honest wen i would go out with my bf, esp. in the beginning, if i was with my frends i'd act diff. i dunno i guess it was kinda embarassing being nice or luving or flirtatious infront of ur frend, i say u give it another shut but just the 2 of u and see how she acts.  if its the same forget it, but if its diff. it was prolly her changing her behavior around her frend.

Svgru3Tnaa	Getting a piercing or tattoo is your personal choice, dont let anyone tell you it was a mistake or disgusting!! You shouldnt take it out because it needs to heal properly. When you first get it done, it will be very swollen and sore. So try and eat soft foods and and if you can try not to smoke (if you do). you shouldnt drink alochol (if you do) either. Because it will cause you to bleed more. And dont spit a lot (if you do) it causes you mouth to pull blood from the hole and doesnt let your tongue stop bleeding as fast. Use mouthwash as often as possible though out the day. And every time after eating. DO NOT take your tongue ring out for atleast 6 weeks. But in order to do so, simply twist the balls in the opposite directions (hold on tightly, they will be on tight) But dont leave the ring out with out having a fishing line or smaller flat ring in. It might close on you. After eating (in 6 weeks) simply take the ring out and brush it with a tooth brush to clean it and put it back in . Try and scrub it when you brush your teeth at night and in the morning too. Best wishes, and congrats!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Don't take it out.|`|edycn5ggaa	I believe you unscrew it to take it out. Also, you'll probably want to use a lot of hygiene. Lastly, take it out and let the tongue heal till the hole is gone; I'm sorry but tongue piercings are gross and if you're in the Singles & Dating section, you won't find anyone with one. They're AWFUL.|`|QHx95iZDaa	don't take it out for weeks and you can eat soon but not for at least 1 hour and a half.|`|5Ymhi07Xaa	well you should have got something on how to take care of it( i know i did) and i got a packet with all the info you need it it. what to use to clean it,when to clean it,what to eat,how to take it out, that kind of stuff.

AA11542500	There is obviously something wrong with your relationship.  Instead of talking about it like adults, he acts like a little kid and kicks you out?  He gets over it and changes his mind and invites you back...rinse and repeat.  That's not a really healthy relationship and to get kicked out for small stuff?  What happens when there's bigger issues?  It sounds like the way he deals with problems is kicking you out, letting it blow over and not resolving anything.  That is probably why this happens over and over again.  What you really should do is try and reason things out and understand how each of you sees the problem and work towards a solution.  A relationship is a partnership, you can't have one if both people do not put in the same amount of effort.  My advice to you is if you really want this relationship to work, you both have to make the same effort to actually solve the problems, not sweep them under the rug and hope they don't come back.  If either of you can't meet halfway then the relationship is pretty much over and you should move on.  Getting kicked out is pretty serious and it shouldn't be happening to you over and over.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you teach people how to treat you.      you've taught him that he can throw a temper tantrum like a little baby and toss you out on the street whenever he disagrees with you instead of working things out like adults and you'll come crawling back to him.    He would have been history the first time he threw me out.|`|XzLUA7ataa	It is inappropriate for a man to "kick out" his girlfriend in any situation.  The man should be the one to leave if the relationship is ending.  He should have enough concern for your safety to give you a secure place to stay whether he is in it or not.  You need to think again about this  friendship.  It sounds extremely volatile and I doubt it will improve.  Do some reading about what a healthy relationship should be like.  You  both have much to learn about planning for long term living arrangements or possibly a future marriage.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Sorry, I am not going to keep going back to a man that kicks me out every time we have an argument.|`|OCdJ38EQaa	two weeks. make him worry a little so he knows not to let it happen again.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	You should leave for good. He is just manipulating you and bossing you around. You want to feel that you can do something wrong and not be rejected because of it. If he really cared he would accept your imperfections and forgive and not kick you out. How childish of him to throw you out over a mistake. No one is perfect. I'm sure he isn't. You deserve better.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	That isnt the way a loving relationship works. I suggest you find a man who will be a man and not kick you out every time hes mad.|`|RqTC18NFaa	You both sound immature, especially him.  Does this sound like a healthy relationship to you?  Do you want to have this guys kids?  I didn't think so.  Leave.  Now.  For good.  Find someone who will treat you with respect.|`|QD54HVsPaa	Really?  Don't you deserve to be treated better than a yo-yo?    If the two of you are serious about continuing your relationship, consider getting some counseling and learning other ways to deal with your arguments other than him throwing you out.  Is it HIS place that he gets to throw you out?      Don't ever make statements you don't intend to keep.      You don't mention whether there is any physical abuse, but this is certainly emotional abuse.      You need to leave and find someone who values you, but you first need to respect and value yourself.      Good Luck|`|jwhbQLU7aa	Girl, get out of there. Anyone you fight with that often is not someone you should be living with. Leave. If you still like him, try dating him while you live in separate areas and see how that works. Maybe you'll be ready to live together again some day.|`|2KC467tFaa	It doesn't matter who started it. What matters is if it was resolved in the end. Instead of kicking you out or leaving (unless it's just to take a walk and cool down), you two need to communicate. If it's a pattern, there's no point in staying because it will keep happening; nothing will be solved; and you will continue to go in circles. If you were married, it would be a form of abuse if he was to kick you out. Try to get to the real issue so it can be taken care of because this way of fighting does not sound healthy at all.|`|naequcqlaa	The two of you are playing stupid games w/one another.  If this is the way it's going to be from time after time, I don't think you should even live together at all.  You're doing nothing but nit picking over stupid he said she said he did she didn't & on & on it goes.  IF you are truly mature enuf to live w/one another, have an understanding.  Either you are there & there for good, or you're not there at all.  Fighting & kicking you out is like a couple kids playing games.  IF you are mature enuf to be living together, you've got to prove you're mature enuf to settle your problems by "talking them out", not kicking you out.  I honestly would say to get things straightened out once & for all, live like a mature couple instead of like a couple of immature kids.  IF he kicks you out again for whatever reason, I definitely would NOT go back.  Either learn to live together or don't live together at all.  You asked for a mature answer, I have 3 grown children & never did they put up w/anything like you two are doing to one another.  You either do or you don't, it's all up to you...Good luck...:)
eTCgNaAhaa	Love is a choice. That's really important to understand. Its not about feeling a certain way. The definition of love is: to nurture and cherish. Notice how ones feelings are absent from love. You have chemistry with this person. Its up to you if you decide to love them. Conversely, its up to them if they decide to love you in return.    So many people break up because they wake up one morning and realize that that special tingly feeling they've had for over 10 years is gone...Its sad that they equate that with love. That moment is really the time when you first start to love them, for who they are, and what you can do for them to nurture and cherish them. Its not about being around that person so that you feel good.
zY8uu241aa	I'm probably terrible at judging how attractive guys are (I'd actually be kind of scared if I was good at it lol), but I would guess that you would be considered reasonably attractive to the average female person.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	your not ugly but your not drop dead hott but like idk your just not MY type.  it really depends if your outgoing and your personalty for the girlfriend question.  sorry but youll find someone:)|`|txI8rKYdaa	Nice Pic!! You should be able to get a girlfriend!|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I'm not gay or anything, but you're a handsome guy.|`|KZWiRYEwaa	No, You are a guy...... I have no reference On guys.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Yea right, you could easily find a girlfriend. You just need to give it time and look in the right places or just be at the right place. It's not your appearance at all.|`|SG27rfSdaa	so many people asking this -ugg!  ok so on a scale of 1-10 you're an 8,9, or 10.  NO problem!|`|N53oHiwNaa	i think your very good looking :)|`|GQdxDkA9aa	ur kinda hot but too old for me srry|`|tGxP4th7aa	Your a pretty good looking guy in my opinion.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	I'm not going to look at your picture because I'm going to tell you right here, right now, that appearance doesn't matter to girl. I'm not that good looking, but girls I get are generally 8s, 9s, or the occasional 9.5 (9.5's usually lose .5 points because their attitudes suck). I'm probably a 6.    Girls don't care about how a guy looks, they care about how he makes them feel.|`|BZg5TFlqaa	eh ur ok. not like hot but ur not unattractive by no means.|`|0b2WSgpfaa	i swear i am being totally honest:      U LOOK REALLY HOT!|`|04F4149yaa	I don't think it's your appearance because you are rather cute. Do you have a terrible personality?|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	i dont think your appearance is stopping you from getting a girlfriend, but different girls have different things that attract them to people.|`|utWzkp8Gaa	u look fine 2 me|`|Qxg0Vqbeaa	cutee.!  yuh r attractive|`|OhqMdODUaa	^hahaha^     i love it :)|`|2lLhCBJDaa	Personally, I think you're good looking. But if you don't think so, then that's probably what's preventing you from getting a girlfriend.  You've got to have confidence.|`|ZJo3GHAbaa	you're cute, but you should try smiling!|`|fH8unJ3Jaa	it could be that you are not saying the right things to girls cause trust me i look a lot worse then you do and i am going out with one of the hottest girls at my school.|`|siAbtuJyaa	you're cute    i think you should grow your hair out a bit, but thats just my opinion|`|L2RqeYedaa	I think you are pretty good looking. I think perhaps a low self esteem, and low confidence are preventing you from meeting future dates. Don't sweat it, just be yourself. And smile! :D|`|tWFKxDzfaa	i think ur ok lookin not stunning but defintely not ugly ....if u were very funni u wud be a 9 if u are vain you wud be a 2|`|wrvCzyAqaa	You aren't bad...it's not your appearance that's keeping you from finding a girl.  Do you have swag?  How bout a nice pair of shoes? You look pretty clean cut. In my opinion its not an issue with looks.  Hope this helps.|`|XkRGEnL4aa	i saw your picture and it's not your appearence at all.  you're not super hot or anything, but you're certainly not ugly!|`|5gANvXyTaa	uh no way bud...you are pretty cute=]    i would date you..straight up! haha|`|lsDulUMfaa	no your kinda hot but you might be acting like a jerk to girls|`|MmIYDoGkaa	You're a nice guy with a nice face just don't concentrate on your looks.Concentrate on finding a girl.Valentines day is coming up so you have plenty of opportunities to find a girl.And make sure your breath is fresh for every date when you get one. :D|`|So9QnB4maa	Oh. Hello handsome ;D. Kidding. You're actually pretty good looking, I don't really think it was your appearance. I would ask her why and get to the bottom of it|`|1U3kSuhsaa	you look hot! actually you look a lot like justin timberlake|`|IUmw7vNjaa	You look hott but too serious|`|oC3J9mckaa	Nope, its not your appearance cuz your kinda hawt|`|RrzfZP8laa	wow, you're pretty hot   haha i like your hair.  id totally date you by loooks alone but some girls dong judge by looks alone   im hoping you're a nice guy :]|`|yBpEWXUBaa	My name is Diamond. Would you like to be my boyfriend?
sZePlWTQaa	Maybe you are just scared? New man, new life, new everything. Take some time and see how things go. Once you are settled in a little more ask yourself again.    If you aren't in the right place, dont waste your time. Move back home. Its all about you!
mIvVWFdmaa	Just text her and type "It's Over"|`|rA9qaciPaa	it never a good time to faster the better but be sure a girl is like a condom you only use it one's|`|Ypfd2Smfaa	At a couples club, restaurant anywhere populated.|`|iDYuSAynaa	a park-- do it quickly before you cheat on her!
mpGjPV6Xaa	No, you're not a wimp. The girls were probably just messing around with you, they wanted to see what you would say or do if they said something. Trust me, that happened to me plenty of times, just some silly girls playing around. But, sometimes the girl might think you're cute and say something to give you a sign and hoping that you will notice her.     So, once again, you're not a wimp , it's alright bro. I would of done the same thing , kept walking and minding my own business.|`|iXQuSNtqaa	If someone says hi, you would say hi back. As for girls in the window whom apparently you can't see, they're trying to get a reaction out of a random guy by seeing what would happen if they made him feel "special" i guess.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	dude your a wuss  i hope your not gay  u really need to talk to girls  when they approach you  because if u can talk to a guy,  u can talk to a girl too!    just next time a girl looks at you, SMILE    and next time someone calls you,  go to them!|`|JAwhXqljaa	lol..me neither..no ur not a wimp.. sometimes we get into situations where we dont know what to do ..one part of our brain is telling us to do something and the otherpart is saying not to do anything..so yeah..it doesnt really matter..=]|`|KJCwUW6Laa	i think you should have said something|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Yes, Yes you are!|`|1tG4Jo46aa	Go back to them to talk or send them some type of message.|`|fLvzhAX8aa	your an epic fail.|`|mYMjDgdhaa	i would have showed them my weener|`|MmIYDoGkaa	They were probally gossiping about someone of "YOU" and got kinda excited.Scratch that.They were probally trying to make someone feel weird because they didn't see you.All in all say hi and see what's going on.|`|RySDawpOaa	dude if u got chicks staring at you either u have something on ur face or they think u r dreamy|`|gBMZqjJraa	no, i think you did the right thing    but try standing up for your self if men do that to you or bullies of jerks and then they won'tbother you again    good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    but try talking to the girls and talk to more girls to get to know them|`|0UZGHN2taa	Girls like confidence. The innocent act works for some in high school, but later in life, you really need to have that confident attitude. Not to the point where your cocky, but you need to have respect for yourself. Just talk to them. The girls who are really worth going for are the ones who will treat you nicely and who dont judge you. If you talk to a girl and they act like a ***** or give you one of those "im too good for you" looks, they dont matter anyways. Just be yourself and dont be shy. Im not saying you have to go out and hunt for conversation with girls, but if they seem to be attracted to you, or even call from a window as you experienced, dont be afraid to make a move and start a little conversation. The worst thing that a girl can do is say no. BE YOURSELF AND BE CONFIDENT.|`|e5tCkk7Aaa	yes buddy i'm sorry to say you are a wimp but that can be changed i believe that you should say hi anytime. because what is the big deal if they say no you move with your day and but at least she heard you ask and you will no longer wonder if she was asking for you.  there is only good that can come from it. the first couple times you might not know what to say but it all starts with a hello.|`|ublCVXavaa	Just keep ignoring them. They are probably a buch of people who where HIGH|`|CaHyyD08aa	First off, stop looking in girls windows you creepy peeping tom.   Second, what's your social so I can report you to the police.
2vYI7UYhaa	that is totally romantic to any girl. i would like it if someone sang to me this valentines day! i think it's even cuter when they make a good romantic song and then sing it to the girl! she'll totally love it!!!!! :-D|`|RJynYf6aaa	awwwwwwwwwww|`|L2RqeYedaa	If they have a decent voice, sure, its super cute. :)|`|Ev0O3dFtaa	i would fall for any guy that would sing to me.it so sweet:)|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	only if they have a good voice :)
rA9qaciPaa	go for it never know if never try i did the same thing its woth it or he will go away tust me it happened he like you|`|iDYuSAynaa	it's not weird, but i think you should remain friends with him even if you find out that he has feelings for you, because usually, boyfriends come and go, but best friends stay forever. they have a more special place in our hearts than boyfriends even if you don't realize it, it's true. preserve that friendship with self-control, and it'll all pay off|`|x4jZuA9Daa	I think that it is deff. worth taking a chance.. I wouldn't get too serious too fast.  If he's your bff then calmly ask him what he thinks of the idea of you two being together... Im sure if he didnt like the idea you could play it off like you were just curious and nothing more... but the chances are that he probably likes you back and if that's the case then GOOD :-D good luck!!!|`|JctGBbPdaa	do what you think is right
S7DmmIwraa	Don't wast your time. He knows what he's doing by keeping you hanging on. He's just amusing himself.|`|G3Q21MDCaa	Maybe he is just as confused as you are.  Us guys are a little thickheaded sometimes...we miss the subtle signals women give us.  Sometimes you have to hit us over the head with a hammer to get us to realize that you are into us.  I think you can't get him off your mind cause you want more than a friendship. The best way to fix this is talk to him about it.
Fi8AIi4baa	Generally if he stares at you and always seems to try to hang out with you.    If he teases you a lot, too, then he probably likes you.|`|oNDyhaz2aa	If he doesn't talk to you, but goes around you.  When you say something 4 times he doesn't answer.  Like go to school in the morning and say hi to him.  Then same thing after 2 hours  Then again after  hours  Then again after 2 hours|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	You are only in middle school, don't worry about it.|`|H1eshhEIaa	if you cant tell, then maby he don't like you?
AQpt6m0Xaa	yea definitely. She wouldn't have said anything because the answer was obvious. you said "yeah" and so she reacted this way.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	are you mentally retarded?    your supposed to take your girlfriend to prom!        although  if you meant, friend thats a girl...yeahh she probably wants you to ask
q7mActnmaa	Dont do it It is bad.    My ex who cheated on me,  and i ended the relationship  talks to me all the time and wants  to hang out all the time but since we   have broke up he has been with three   other girls and he has cheated on all three of them.  He did actually come to my house one day out of the blue  and it made me miss him terribly and i had to keep telling  myself that he would just break my heart again it was so hard  it was all like three years ago. And he still texts me till this day  even though they are just little random hello's in the middle of the night I get so excited. It really sucks.    You are just setting yourself up to be hurt   if you don't want to be back with him and you  see him it's possible he could just want sex also.    Whew. haha (:  -Cass|`|TMi1GhSHaa	hell to the NO.|`|SuD5CjGraa	i think u should go out with him maybe he wants u back real bad|`|7XbXvsNHaa	yes! you should here are the out comes :  1. he shows no intrest[which you already knew]  2.you guys become friends  3. you realize hes not worht it.  4. he likes you.    either way its win win :]|`|40HpQquSaa	try to think of all the bad times you two had when you see him|`|DfRD02n2aa	I know how you feel, and i think you should go. Because whether now you think it was stupid or not, and even though people are saying you shouldnt go, you still asked him, so somewhere in the back of your mind you really want a second chance. i think you should take that shot! and when it starts to hurt all over again think of it this way: its his fault. he lost someone like you. so this time around, itll be his loss.    best of luck!|`|3l7IkyX4aa	Leave Chikita|`|s4xDhjrVaa	tempting. but know your distance. he aint right for you.|`|sZePlWTQaa	Don't go!!! You are probably just feeling lonely. Make plans with someone else that night so you don't think "Oh, I could have gone out with him" Its really only going to hurt you more if you are not over him yet. Save yourself the pain!|`|FU7tY0nqaa	this sounds a little to much like a booty call.   i think that you should leave your ex's in the past, cause it really doesnt lead to anything but heartbreak.|`|3f4jZwLlaa	don't go to see him! if you broke up and haven't missed him, its so not worth it!|`|ex2KhEfdaa	dont go did it with mine. it only makes the whole thing that much harder.|`|ViNFT9RQaa	i think subconsciously you wanted to get back together with him and knew that was a possibility if you two were to meet back up, so now youre feeling guilty for having these feelings -- and even possibly a little shame bc he was the one who ended it in the first place you may not want to seem that easily won back? just a guess. when my bf and i broke up, i had a breakdown one night about some family issues and called him for a shoulder to lean on. i could have called a friend, but i chose him bc subconsciously i wanted him back... and of course we ended up hooking up that night, tried dating again briefly -- in the end, we broke up again bc of the same reasons in the first place. mistakes of the past will only repeat themselves if you dont learn from them the first time around...     good luck, make the best decision for YOU. dont fall again too quickly! :)|`|L2RqeYedaa	Well... no. I don't think so.|`|125ac6256006f47e13e9c672b81c6328aa	you do not need to bring up the things from your past that hurt you.  ask yourself if it is worth it to go through all of that pain from the break up again...there in you will find what you are looking for.  if it were me i would not.
NG4E7pbuaa	Don't send a forward have it be original, from you.  Forward, to some, is frowned upon as genric.  Something that is thought of by you will be more meaningful.  Beside just by you sending something original should send the message that you where in his thought...that might be just as good as the content of the message!
CA9OFT4Waa	move on, dating twice sucks.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	its just that your used to having a significant other... u need to go out more and let other guys pay attention to you... your mind just wants him back cuz u hav an empty space now    im sure u can fill the space with another more decent guy|`|w4gpEBPPaa	juss have some make up sex and see what happens from there|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	You dumped him for a reason I'm sure he hasn't changed in a short period of time.  I think you want to get back with him just because you don't want to be without a boyfriend.....that's the wrong reason to get back together.  Better to be alone and unhappy than to be in a relationship and unhappy.  While you're wasting time on the wrong one you won't find the right one.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Just follow your heart and listen to what it really want. If you really like him, then it's up to you if you want to take him back or not. My question to you is " Do you think it will be regretful ? " Has he hurt you in the past ? Has he cheated on you with another female ? Has he used you for sex and nothing but sex ? If so, then I'd say just move on, but if it wasn't like that, then I'd say go for another chance.    But, I'm sure you don't want to get hurt, so really think about what you want to do. When I say think , I mean think really hard about making a good decision. Because now a days, when girls break up with their boyfriends and decide to take them back it's not same as before. The boyfriends/husbands become abusive, mean, out of control, etc...    I hope I helped and good luck on making a good decision !!!
L2RqeYedaa	naive. seriously naive.   don't play with fire, you are going to get burned.|`|ca6pFETbaa	.|`|xj4ot5WSaa	haha u were violated, by ur boyfriend...|`|DkmJdQzKaa	You're perverted, you know what he was going to do. I think you're a guy posing as a girl and getting a ***** asking this question.|`|4SHb1kUAaa	finger your vagina
MmIYDoGkaa	You should probally have friends behind you at a distance if it gets crazy.Corner the girl and have her in a good mood (You know what I mean?)Then you should add to your little break up speech "I don't wish to date you anymore because last Friday at the school dance I guess I just asked you out because I had alot of people wanted me too.Please don't take this too hard because I have always considered you a friend and I always will.So please forgive me."You can add whatever you want to that, ok dude?|`|39dc0136161bb58b8ec044a212a6fe8eaa	Make it sarcastic...say "Hiiii Best friend!"|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	cut out her heart and serve it up for everyone to see|`|AA10503158	That Sucks. She's going to be heartbroken & on V-day... but since you don't have feelings for her; you need to tell her. First of all you shouldn't of said yes in the first place. Second, pull her away from her friends it'll probably be easier that way, then after you tell her she can just go to them. Tell her the truth, you just want to be friends with her, and you didn't mean to hurt her. Good Luck.|`|x4jZuA9Daa	Be honest with her .. but kind I've had people obessed with me before.. .and nothings worse than having the guilt that they might try to put on you.. just be honest and having her friends near by might be helpful for you both|`|sZePlWTQaa	Just tell her you rather be friends. I would do it alone. She will find her friends if she needs them.
klcqgST9aa	Have you taken pictures of the two of you that she likes together?    She's not going to put an ugly picture of herself up just because you're both in it.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	I wouldnt be worried more like upset because i mean why take the time to put pictures of "friends" and not include your "boyfriend" i mean supposedly he is suppose to be the second most important thing in your life besides your family. Friends come after that. usually. And 6 months is a pretty long time especially if your in highschool so with that being said i would want one hell of an explanation especially if your like willing to take another "good" pic of the two of you so she can put up..|`|7XbXvsNHaa	stop making mountains outta mole hills.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You sound like the girlfriend to me.    Why don't you worry about something that makes sense?|`|M7r7gHNGaa	No, you shouldn't be worried. You should ask her why there are no pics you you and her on her Facebook site.|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	You must have facebook, to look at someone else's profile....so how do you know she hasn't updated it? Anyway no you shouldn't worried, it's only facebook....if she doesn't want you to meet her friends and family, that's when I'd start to worry. :)|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	i wouldn't be worried if i was you|`|3l7IkyX4aa	No dude.  Unless you see some pictures  of her with a another dude.  Call up  1-800-CHEATERS|`|ca6pFETbaa	facebooks are for people personal profiles..... not couple profiles. i wouldnt want any pictures of me on any girls facebook unless she was my fiance|`|ZVngHOBTaa	check what her relationship is on facebook, if it says single then be worried. but i wouldnt be too worried|`|MiBa1ZILaa	No, not really. Don't get freaked out about it.   If you want to have your picture up on her facebook, take a whole bunch of pictures of you and her, on her camera. =]|`|jChbnuafaa	no you shouldnt be worried sometimes i dont put some of my boyfiend pictues up    maybe she didnt like how she looked or you looked........|`|vchYXsQ0aa	Honestly, don't worry about it. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 4 and a half months now and I don't even have more than a hand-full of pictures of the two of us. I'm a Facebook addict and take a lot of pictures, I just feel a little awkward taking pictures together, and never got around to uploading any of the ones I do have. So really, don't worry about it. She's probably thinking the same way I do. My boyfriend tells me he wants us to take pictures too, but everytime we go to I delete them because I'm not happy with them. Girls are funny like that, take it from me, I am one. lol|`|MJALNawOaa	Personally, being a girl, when I have a bf and we are committed to each other (6 months sounds pretty committed) I like to let people know by putting up pics and such. I find it a little strange that she would not want to do this. I would ask her about where you stand with her. It may be a good time for a DTR (Define The Relationship) talk. She may not feel as committed to your relationship as you do. No matter where she stands, it would be good for you to know.    Good luck!|`|rv7Lh0cuaa	dont be worried|`|tWFKxDzfaa	6 months...bit odd that she hasn't...maybe her m8s don't know yet ? dno this is weird personally if i had a bf n i liked him a lot i'd want the whole world to know lol|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	maybe she wants guys to think she's available....|`|b9816OKRaa	my honey bunny and i have been together for almost 2 years and I have one pic of him on my myspace and he has one of me. I love him more than anything and he loves me more than anything also so I wouldn't be worried. the way i see it is it's the becky page not the becky and john page.i have friends who have a couple page with only pics of them.|`|h6umWbzhaa	first of all, does she have pictures of the two of you?    maybe she likes to keep her personal life personal...?  maybe she doesnt like to brag that she has a boyfriend when other people dont. there are a lot of reasons that dont lead to her hiding something. but if she keeps avoiding the subject when you talk about it then yes there is something to worry about.
2vYI7UYhaa	depends. if it was some cool romantic guy, hot.   if it was a sweet romantic guy, beautiful. but not pretty. that's to ordinary  but mostly beautiful|`|4Vchxp32aa	if you want to have sex with a girl, she better be  hot.  If she isn't hot and you still like her, that makes her beautiful.  Ugh..hot is better than beautiful.  I would never call a girl hot.  I have never done that.  I have called a girl beautiful before, but only one.  HA.|`|Tf19RETiaa	beautiful =)|`|dCmSA6r2aa	beautiful|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Being called "hot" just makes me feel like he's only interested in my body or sex..or both. Being called pretty or beautiful is a lot better because it sounds more genuine and it sounds like the guy is actually smart and nice..not just shallow and only interested in "hot" girls. Girls may laugh and say thank you when you call them hot, but trust me, any girl with class would rather be called beautiful. We love to be called gorgeous most, I bet. :)|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Beautiful , If he says you're hot the it usually means a booty call. so, pretty much call her beautiful unless you plan on getting laid lol.|`|GORu3NJkaa	pretty/beautiful definitely|`|NOnSX0xiaa	Pretty or Beautiful.  i mean we wont be mad if you call us hot but it makes you look like you care more and respect us more if you call us beautiful.|`|WiBOrXUCaa	Beautiful would be the best  :)|`|h9ttFN7Taa	oh please!!!!! i cannot STAND when guys call me "hot". if that guy wanted to impress me, he should call me beautiful. i would love any guy who called me "beautiful" or "pretty".|`|HOl6N45iaa	I would want a guy to call me gorgeous or sexy but not hot because you always hear guys call girls hot but you hardly ever hear them say sexy or especially gorgeous|`|7N2YPjkEaa	hmmmmm..... beautiful!! when a girl gets called hot alot it means nothing.... trust me! beautiful adds a spark of excitement! like ur different, u know...|`|TCjSJdDeaa	beautiful! hot sounds soooo.... high school|`|cb006621a458fb0d8e3e7ae097cb368daa	beautiful. gorgeous. amazing. stunning. cute. i like those better than hot, but occasionally its nice to hear that too. like you guys are going to the club and you get all dressed up. u tried to look hot and he says so and its nice|`|FCkQUIYJaa	beautiful refers to outer and inner beauty, while hot just refers to outer. i'd have to say beautiful. obviously.|`|ySP0sr90aa	i would rather be called pretty or beautiful, because when you tell a girl shes beautiful she feels that your really looking at HER, telling her that shes a good person and that shes pretty and your not just lookin at her boobs and butts as hot usually intends.|`|i4ARGkHQaa	beautiful because any guy can be like yo that chick is hot but beautiful is like respect it shows that a guy would not just say that you are hot but beautiful which is WAY better
XSHWYBcWaa	You could always just text him|`|HLEzho32aa	If you like him, and he likes you, you honestly have nothing to lose. I suggest just calling him up, but if you're really that shy why not message him with IM, email or his online profile if you can contact him by that. Also, try talking to him in person. :] Good luck.  PS. Also, just be your complete self around him, talk to him as if he was one of your most closest friends, things will feel less awkward that way.|`|Bjswl35Eaa	bring up something you both have in common and you know will last long and if that doesn't work be honest on how he makes you feel awkward|`|OkBWnIa5aa	write down some conversation starters then JUST CALL HIM :) if there's a akward silence, then use your list! hope this helps :D
QEqGukjZaa	wow i was in this same situation...    why is always the parents who control who to love?..crazy    you should just do it and follow your heart..    if you two love each other, than just go for it. but you have to be real sure..    if you known each other over a year..than should be no problem..    be honest and if that dont work. than do it yourself.|`|OpduZC3Eaa	Tell the truth. The truth first is always the best way to go because chances are you will get caught the other way around and that is when you would get in some bad trouble. So it's best to just stick with the truth the first time around and save you any trouble later on. ;^)|`|5oUQacwmaa	tell the truth|`|wB6KFpVeaa	YOU CANT LOVE HIM, if you met him online. havent met yet, then hunny you DONT know what love is.   tell your parents the truth, so when you come up missing, bc you are hanging out with a chester molester, theyll have some what of an idea.|`|lOMtWXMjaa	1. never believe anything you hear online  2. its mostly bs to get in your pants  3. if you must meet him tell them(parents) its through a friend  but let your best friend know what your doing just in case something goes wrong and she will know what happened to you and where you were.    good luck|`|iEm4jCFYaa	look u need 2 tell the truth because say this thing with this man works your parents will not trust you or him and just say that this man is not the right guy for u  and it goes wrong u will have your parents to confort you
suoY5vxbaa	You really can't do anything about it. She will do it when she is ready to. Maybe she isn't ready to yet. Give her some (more..lol) time.|`|rk8VogkWaa	just do it. a kiss isnt something you talk about and plan. it is something you just do. wait for the right time. start by saying you love her and see where it goes from there.|`|1SK6qPA6aa	ok im assuming your about 10 seeing as your name is what it is so girls will be girls at that age and visa versa, i dont know try not going out with her at all seeing as it means nothing?
STB7HLZ6aa	she doesn't like you.|`|vAt3Zqj9aa	you must be comfortable in your own skin if you want to be able to fully understand if she is into you or not.  just by being yourself and keeping it real will not only make her feel like your interested but if will make her ask herself, "why shouldn't i be interested in him?"  act aloof as if she doesn't matter as much as she evidently does.  girls don't like needy guys, believe me on this. remember, she must look up to you if you plan on developing further with her, who can respect someone who kisses your ***?  ur the **** bro, don't forget it.  good luck|`|igvu3ifUaa	just be a gentle man open doors for her tell her she looks nice. at the end of the date when you drop her off tell her your really glad that you know her, give a single rose a kiss on the cheek and say goodnight.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	surprise her. tell her you're just going to a movie or something, but have a really nice dinner ready or something.   girls like mushy stuff lol, do something romantic (:|`|Tq8rwL5laa	make a list of interesting things to talk about. memorize it, don't take it with you. think of something romanticish to do..make her supper something excitingg. And make sure to  compliment her looots
c2aC15ZFaa	yes :)|`|2qJdFmDFaa	no.|`|Tf19RETiaa	nope ?|`|gGiLHuqlaa	ya with you HAHAHAHA|`|GORu3NJkaa	i don't know. i don't think so
vHB9zUcCaa	i wish i had the answer 2 that. i think ppl often keep hoping things'll change. hope helps get ppl thru everyday life, which helps them fight life's battles. after some time, u KNOW deep down something yer after won't happen, u just KNOW it but yer not ready 2 accept it.      another thing 2 know is things often DO change EVEN THO u have that feeling. i'd experienced things i NEVER thought would happen; & they DID happen!!! things I thought would happen never did. i'd learned how God has a way of surprising us b/c i'd seen it happen in my life MANY times. God knows our thoughts & C's our hearts.|`|ENspyhzUaa	unrequited love, the most tragic of all situations, but it is inevitable, humans tend to like things they cannot obtain|`|iUucz3JOaa	because u can not help who u like...u r not supposed to|`|VBFwT9nVaa	Because they have this stupid mentality thinking that maybe somehow he'll suddenly change his mind.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	because people like you can't spell what is ppl and plz learn to spell|`|W0WNpLnKaa	thats because once they set there minds they still try to get there goal im that way 2 i like a girl but she dosnt like me but i dont care i would like to acmplish some thing before or after high school. try and see wat there like ask them out. u never know u might turn out to like them after all.
q7mActnmaa	No he didn't want a long term relationship with you.  If he wanted you he wouldn't be on that stupid website.  Get over him he doesn't want you although i am pretty sure  he'd love to Bang you one last time.    Ew.    Be smart.  Come on now.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	If he is your ex, you do not text him/phone him, nothing. Get over him, and move on. Or he'll think your interested in him again. Don't give him that hope, there was a reason your not together now.|`|KzVLLPsOaa	yeah it would be nice|`|YFx8N0wjaa	absolutely not|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	no|`|XCsOfk79aa	its depends,r u guys friends now or not?  if you guys arent friends anymore  dont,he will go to all of his friends  and be like "look who texted me..."  and not in a good way|`|VN8kBnuRaa	Why not?  Your just being nice.  I would.|`|IG4A4nuDaa	I would, just try to be friends|`|tnznR01paa	Yeah, I guess if you guys are friends.|`|207dFmdHaa	no, hes not interested...find somebody who deserves you|`|Nj58Vi62aa	whats LTR? and yeah just say happy birthday! nothing too fancyy|`|bP5zyipXaa	sure go for it|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Seems to me, that he has already gotten over you if he's on the singles website. I mean you can if you want to, it's just being nice anyways right. I don't see nothing wrong with saying Happy Birthday to him, but if he wants you to come over don't do it, because from that point on he's going to think that you're going to give it up to him because it's his birthday and that it's a birthday present from you.    But, yea go ahead and text him happy birthday. Just don't allow yourself to get to close to him again, because he just might break your break and I'm sure you don't want that to happen.    Hope I helped !!!    Joseph D :)|`|FiCl71flaa	The answer to your question depends on the answers to the following questions: 1) Are you over your feelings for him or are you hoping for a reconciliation. 2) Since two month's ago when you broke up, have you guys kept in touch; that is have you continued to talk to each other( it does not matter if you use text messages, phone, cell, in person  etc) 3) Did you contact him when you saw him on the web site;if yes what did he say to you. After you know the answers to these questions  it will become clear what you should do about texting    him on his birthday , if your reasons are as platonic friends or you are looking for more.|`|ZPOGg2FIaa	yeah, it's nice.|`|27HIhqXyaa	if you guys are still friends, then yes|`|59807892f06b904ae7daf2355bf30800aa	yeah. it just seems like a nice thing to do|`|YPHFjw86aa	you're crazy.    let him go and don't talk to him anymore|`|Q3eORl9Yaa	totally make his day  !!! even if he doesnt respond hell know your thinkin of him|`|St4i1Wlhaa	yes bcause u can still b friends|`|c1pnGIXxaa	no, forget him!|`|YBxhs597aa	I have no idea what a LTR is  but if you text him...  well ask yourself  would he do that to you?|`|xfomnGCVaa	well if u think its the rite thing to do. it couldnt hurt. good luck!|`|16O8Gs4vaa	you know,  you should. That way you'll let him know that you still remember who he is, but not in a romantic level.    text like :"Happy birthday(:"|`|VF9ocPGWaa	dont use his birthday as an excuse to contact him again.|`|f326d002ea3b8881539ee0e0c7396b87aa	ofcourse.just because two people go out and break up.doesnt mean that they should both stop socializing.|`|bpuVHhKOaa	definatly... its cute and not clingy at all... my ex and me are best friends after he sent me a new years text.... it works well in strrengthening your friendship, even though its just a text|`|KZMwGA2Qaa	no  hes in ur past for a reason  forget about him|`|AA11788821	Hello- Its called Ex for a reason|`|A0IvDqsGaa	if you guys are friends then yeah. If you guys haven't talked since you broke up, then i probably wouldn't. I think it would be kinda wierd to just get a text from an ex that i haven't talked to in a few months. But thats just me. It wouldn't hurt anything, it would probably make him feel good. But i wouldn't.|`|md2x9OSKaa	text him quail|`|WyKaDpCWaa	NO NEVER DO THAT!!!!!|`|WLQUcaEkaa	he sounds like a douche.    but if you feel like you should,  write it on his facebook wall.    txting is a little more personal whereas facebook is more public.    gooood luck.|`|icdWbdApaa	yea|`|RCe8MyjQaa	yeahhh be like happy birthday  and then when he say thanks  be like oooo you little slut who doesnt want an LTR  i saw you on the singles website|`|lDdjNoEQaa	yes it would be nice|`|oBr6i1hlaa	I would as long as th reason yall broke up was minor and he has forgiven u if it was something big. Its his b-day it should mean a lot 2 him if u did txt him bcuz that shows u remembered...lol...good luck...
pXUFfDvPaa	he likes you, hes just shy    just go talk to him and start flirting with him then he'll starts to like you     he ignores because he thinks your so stunning and you told him you like him so hes thinking about what to do lol    Go flirt with him!!!|`|fhu2VvbKaa	there are two ways of thinkin and that really makes sense.  1- he doesnt like u so he thinks its awkward at the moment. but he will come around.  2- he likes you and he is shy and doesnt know what to do...boys can be weird like that sometimes..
mjVQx1THaa	There are days were I can't eat. Apparently people say when you like someone you don't get hungry  I don't know if it's a rumor but it deffinetly happeneds to me:)
aoyVeq16aa	hey there  :)  well if you can text, text him and say that you are not allowed to talk anymore since you have gone over your mintues on your phone. that usually works. or you can call and tell him.      if it is a one time thing, tell him you fell asleep or you have to study and slowly distance yourself from him !|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	i always say:  my phone got taken away  i was in the shower  i fell asleep    pretty soon even the stupidest guys get the message
R6oh6rlTaa	Make a move...obviously if she;s really flirtacious step it up a level or two...if shes loud don't be like that, from my experience most people don't like that...n especially if he shy...you should be coy and funnny... start talking to him more..about serious stuff too...if he's into you he will surely show interest!|`|PJZRGsc3aa	ask if you can move your seat :-)|`|cq3FtZCuaa	well depends..does he flirt back with the girl? if he does then i say go over there and tell her that he's your man! lolol    if you like him..tell him. he might even like you back. you'll never know if you try!
KvhvPwG4aa	hmm. well first you need to figure out if she flirts with you or try to catch her looking at you one time. start flirting with her, tell her she looks nice one day and talk to her as much as you can. try to become pretty close to her, as much as you can within about a week. after you feel comfortable with her just say something along the lines "we should hang out sometime" and if shes like yeah we shouldd! then just say "can i get your number so i can call you this weekend or something?" if she's showing signs that she isn't really into the hole idea of hanging out, don't ask for her number and dont ask again.|`|qgUHLb6raa	well say it as a joke im also in 7th grade dont look serious when u ask her it will be akward so say it in the middle of a conversation|`|GHnkKwl3aa	I've never understood what's wrong/scary with asking for a number.    Wait until she has her phone out and get yours out and press a few buttons (check your last text) so it looks like you didn't diliberatly plan to ask for her phoen number. Then be like Oh, i don't think I have your number in my phone, what is it?    Viola!|`|Pa70VY1Naa	dont be nervous thats the best thing and simply ask.....its not hard...|`|STB7HLZ6aa	stalk her on facebook|`|tiDdoNJjaa	ask her, and if she gives it to you then she might like you back. if not then she really isn't that into you!|`|99qFzxCxaa	youre in luck buddy...well at least i am...but im in 7th too...had 5 girls ask me my cell phone number at the same time...unfortunately some beeacth interrupted me while i was looking for it(new phone)then another time some girl just ripped it off me and put it in herself.euhh just pull out your phone,act like youre doing something and just ask for it like it's nothing.good luck|`|JswHEJGcaa	just ask her, your young shes not the only girl.  girls come and go in your life.|`|VTw6E9gUaa	Well you can write her a note or ask someone else to give it to you.|`|SlOU6v3Zaa	just ask for it...|`|Rzfn2pSqaa	um... how about the most secret way to get her number without making it obvious, "Umm... yeah. So can I have you're number? A few of us might be hanging out later so I wanna you wanna come too." That's how my sister's bf got her number and they're almost engaged now. lol, although I doubt ur ready for marriage yet.|`|XU6SxUbDaa	ok dude it's not an alien go up to her and make small talk first and then get to know her better then ask her out and for her number|`|6bbtTE4naa	Hey... I'm in 7th grade, too. It depends on what kind of girl she is. If she is shy, ask her out when you two are alone. If she is outgoing, ask her pretty much anywhere. However, no matter what kind of girl she is, make it good and smooth. Dont say "um, erm, i was... Wondering if maybe, uhhhmmm you, like, uuuuhhhmmm would, kinda, uuuuhhhh want erm uuuhhh to go out with me, maybe?" DONT DO THAT!!!!! say something like this "hi, Jessica (Just an example name), I have to tell you something (make surre it is a good time for her, and you!), I really like you, and I was wondering if I could call you sometime, or if you would want to go out?" Something nice and smooth and easy like that works wonders.|`|np3y9CQtaa	just ask...no big deal =]|`|1d3be905c594dfa5842eec70072bbee6aa	Well, my suggestion for you. Is just to be friends with her first, and get to know her better. Before you ask her out!|`|ZhvyzU6saa	jus ask for her phone number..|`|Bc5cFLadaa	just go up to her friend and say can i have her number then start chatting. then ask her out :)|`|EZddmMVCaa	alright im excited about this!  i can't tell you what exactly to do. but be cute and original and make sure she likes you. BE YOURSELF. and she'd be a fool not to like you back!|`|6cytUgPwaa	omg i needed help and im in 7th grade anyway to get there cellphone talk to her a lot especially if the bell is going to ring just start telling her somthing then be like what is your cell phone number ill text you the rest good luck o and girls like to take it slow sometimes so to ask her out do it over aim or note or text and talk alot first|`|KbRCIJOvaa	im a 7th grade girl guys ussually ask my number by talking to me for a few weeks, then if you sense you get along just say''do you have a phone? i have a ___phone , hey i wanna text you''|`|9DBRL6Ttaa	You have to come up and ask her . When she's alone hurry up and ask her. Or just ask her in front of everybody. Walk like you cool. Just say HI, I REALLY LIKE U AND I WANTED TO ASK WE CAN GO OUT. IF SHE SAYS YES. ASK HER FOR HER PHONE NUMBER!|`|9CQc2Kmqaa	Well 1st ask for her      But dont say "Can i have your  "     say "Whats ur  ?"    Then ask her out!
MZWdvdEwaa	Sounds like he isn't into you anymore.  Just leave him be, It will probably bug him more if you keep calling and texting. Guys don't go for constant calling, texting anyways.|`|EVtLlSEwaa	Wait. Maybe in a few days try a text again...maybe. But if you wait and then he does finally call you and wants to hang out right away, he might be the type of guy that only wants to bother with you when he has nothing else to do. Sound mean, but I know people like that. It 's rude.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	maybe you smell? its over, just move on|`|LaL8wRp7aa	dont call him.  let him come too you.  besides it gets anoying when people want to talk to you constantly.  im not sure if its over but then again he could be playing with you.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	don't waste anymore of your time.  find someone else, im sure you can meet someone who appreciates you and doesn't play games.
Ki90Irkcaa	Adrienne, it doesn't matter that it hurts your feelings. What matters is that true friends tell the truth and you are obsessed, and they left one thing out, you are also in denial. If you don't feel that you are obsessed, then maybe you just aren't that intelligent. Think about it, you openly said that he isn't good for you but you just keep going back and you cant help it. Well, google Obsession because that's what is going on here.  The only reason that it is hard to get over this guy is because you don't feel that you deserve better. As long as you settle, you wont get better. Ive seen my friends try and change these guys that are hot and cold, and the truth is you cant change someone and you'd be wasting your time waiting for them to change on their own, chances are there are 20 more girls that will accept him the way he is, so why would he be good just for you? That's where self esteem comes into play and you look at the situation for what it is and you move on. Its not going to be easy, but you just move past it. The best thing to do is not answer the phone calls, text messages, emails, etc. Just let it go. Apologize to your friends for them having to listen to you talk about this unworthy guy and tell them that they are right about him and you're sorry. There is no such thing as a "kind of a player" either he is or he isnt. If this guy is a tool, you could spend another six years wishing, and hoping, and praying. But as previously stated, you'd be wasting your energy and time. Make yourself available for love thats actually mutual.|`|YZzT5rFraa	Here we go.    Go eat some chocolate ice cream + magazine + lovish songs that describe how you feel and say.     o  HE IS MARRIED HE IS MARRIED!|`|0v9YTcwnaa	i think u need to just tell your friends how it makes u feel when they say that and if they keep doing it and keep putting u down i think that they r not a real good friend. as 4 your boy  if u like him that much stay with him or just try your hardest to not go with him any more
hBGZYDKAaa	Not to everyone i guess. I mean some girls will say as long as you have something to work with your good but I personally like them big.|`|STB7HLZ6aa	if you are Chinese or white than you have nothing to worry about|`|ozNXnNQIaa	Every girl has her own opinion. For me, pleasure nor size matter. It's the personality that counts. It's like having a celebrity as a BF and he was a personality of a cranky, selfish old man. So, no size doesn't matter, at least in my dictionary.|`|GQdxDkA9aa	size matters if your tiny but otherwise it doesn't and why were the girls in the locker room anyway?|`|WKzHVRHWaa	wuts ur bits?|`|XiwHlQGIaa	there is such thing as too big. they probably just laughed cause what else are you supposed to say?|`|5LT6LRUZaa	okay what they did was WRONG, not cute, not funny and considered harassment if not assault...but oooookay you want an honest answer to this?  you're gonna get my opinion    size IMO does NOT matter, it's confidence that matters the most, if a man is confident that is very sexy, if he is hung up on his size being too small it will affect a relationship but the same rings true if he's too cocky (sorry for the pun) because he is well endowed, most "larger" men I've known actually think that made them good lovers when in fact they put little effort into my needs because they thought their larger size was enough to satisfy.    first and foremost you have to be comfortable in your own skin, this stunt these girls pulled sounds like they got dared to do it...it may be that they weren't laughing at your size but just at the fact you were naked...maybe those girls have never seen a naked boy before?      don't let what they did influence how you feel about yourself, for me (and MANY women) it's not the size as much as it is the confidence and time spent fulfilling our needs|`|LaL8wRp7aa	well when your young yeah probably just because people always think that its a "good thing" if you are.  eh. it really depends on who you talk to if it does matter.  thats rather embarasing though. lol.|`|6xijgfxDaa	more like 4 gay guys ran in and grabbed your microscopic pimple|`|8e1MgJ82aa	I know this question was directed at girls, but from one guy to another:    First things first, I think there's a bigger issue here. I'm pretty sure what those girls did falls under sexual harassment and if it bothered you, you should probably talk to someone about that.    As far as size goes, keep these things in mind:    1. The average size ranges from about 5.1 - 6.1 inches.    2. When Little Jimmy isn't standing at salute, he is usually an average length of three inches.    3. You were in the shower....need I say more?    4. People lie like rugs when it comes to size.  Guys say they're big (duh!), girls say they want big, but really depends on how good you are in bed.    Hope that helps.
rsph2L10aa	everything in your life is formatted to fit logically (usually) into your dreams. If you have sexual tension, because your girlfriend and you have not been engaged in intercourse recently, then thats the sex part of your dream. Also, if you've had any thoughts about how attractive the female friend is, then thats the reason it was her. If your happy with your girlfriend then you've got nothing to worry about.|`|S253XERKaa	i get those all the time and i been Merrie 30 years|`|7NJ8lKNEaa	forget your dream.|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	tell me more about this...

Sometimes they may involve someone we know and  are attracted to sexually or emotionally in our waking life ; other times they may involve someone we do not have these type of feelings for, or involve someone we do not know but is a composite of the kind of woman we find attractive. There is nothing weird about it; infact a lot of men have sexual dreams in which they are having sexual intercourse and ejaculate( called wet dreams) in real life. They can be embarrassing   but that is about all there is to it.Unless there is something  else you have not mentioned , go about enjoying your current girlfriend and relationship .|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Dreams are random thoughts generated by your brain.  So that means you could dream about ANYTHING you have in your brain.    Dreams don't mean anything, it just doesn't work like that.|`|KDyG2vCoaa	ignore your horny youve been going out 3.5 years you dont need to cheat on her and ruin your relationship, just err wack off|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Dreams are unconscious thoughts. It doesn't mean anything. Don't worry about it.|`|DDWNBc9waa	absolutely normal... you have dreams that you would never expect to happen sometimes... it sounds like a nice dream... thats for dayum sure hahah. dont worry about it too much!|`|HMUff6qOaa	I've been with my partner about 5 years now, but when I have sexual dreams its 99% of the time random people that I've never met before, occasionally friends, or people I work with, etc.    Its normal, harmless, and in some cases quite enjoyable.  Don't lose any sleep over it, that's for sure ;)|`|zjp17TZcaa	YOUR 19!!! break up with her and try a different girl.  that is what your dream is telling you!  there are so many women out there in this world to sitck to one so early.  if it was ment to be with her then a few years down the line you two will get back together. but for know travel the country, travel the world! meet different women.  be James Bond!!!!
hSB2rP9Waa	I would say keep doing friend stuff instead of girlfriend/boyfriend stuff for awhile.  Just try to be yourself as much as you can.    And maybe if you tell her that she takes your breathe away and sometimes you are rendered speechless by how beautiful she is and her great personality and wit... she might think it was sweet.    Sadly though, many girls are stupid and don't like the "nice" guys.  If she's one of those, there is nothing you can do and you can find someone better!|`|XU6SxUbDaa	lol everyone gets nervous sometimes, are you sure its the right girl you like, or maybe its just you, maybe its just nothing, maybe you need to talk about it with her|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Pretend she's just your friend and not your girlfriend.
BeIX5pH1aa	some guy asked me the same question :P  they're trying to see where you are sexually|`|lFkXY6dJaa	its probably for a reason..... some guys find it disturbing if girls do....... others might think its hot... but regardless its probably for a reason... just b honest... its always best... or b like why does it matter? just avoid the question.... but remember that if you avoid the question then 9 times out of 10 people will assume the answer is yes....|`|iXQuSNtqaa	Random or he was trying to figure out if you were in any way into sexual activities. Hey may be interested in you sexually as well.|`|9tmxkDiPaa	wow...|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	he wants something to masturbate to... sooo.. have you... ooo oooo i just jizzed in my pants.. sorry|`|nJ8N5PJMaa	i think he is being random.....|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Curiosity properly. It can be a bit of a turn on. He can also see what kind of girl you are by how you reacted. Hope this helps|`|U5gixzszaa	he is just being stupid|`|XiwHlQGIaa	cause guys think its hot when girls touch themselves. simple as that.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	it could be either, no way for us to know..|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	he just wants to know....some guys think we are a weird specie of human beign who doesn't have that kind of needs LoL...they think we don;t do it...so maybe he just wanted to find out asking a girl|`|CUc2gqzjaa	hes just trying to figure it out. guys think its weird when girls do, so dont tell him you do|`|ZcuMp7CXaa	Random, or he wants to join you...    OR you always seem really horny around him or other guys ;)|`|jChbnuafaa	a lot guys thinks its hot when girls do that  they are always curious about if girls do it or not because they do it all the time     just shake it off|`|v9Vv7qMwaa	well i'd say does he look good to you because he might be checkin you out, if you ever get the chance look around if you see him and you like what you see.. i don't know persue him if your taken well.... i dunno tell him to fudge off|`|ODf41iN4aa	It's not the way to get acquainted or to get close to each other.  It would be better to be close to each other & to share a lot of other stuff before asking such a question, so he's way out of line.  If you talk to him again, tell him it's a personal question & at this point, you're not close enough friends for you to answer such a question.  If he claims that asking & answering such questions is the way to get closer, shine him on & wave him away or walk away.  Phooey!  He might be embarrassed when you do, but rightly so.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	that's more than just random.......he really wanted to know for some wierd reason.|`|3XKUUf1paa	he is being random or he might be taking some survey? Well, you can't really lie because everyone masturbates at least once a day. It's normal. He masturbates as well so you don't need to be embarrass. We all do!!!|`|wCYq386Faa	this could be random or maybe hes just curious. he might be into you and is wondering what kind of girl you are.|`|CpXgvDz7aa	He's trying to see where you're at sexually.  If you have done that before, he may feel his chances of having sex with you are a lot higher than someone who hasn't.|`|wYlJjgr0aa	Be Honest.     Hopefully it's a no.|`|VBtGkOCWaa	did you ask him if he did,it might be his turn on
LLgLPEPUaa	Quit being so stupid about it honestly.    I know guys are getting bras for their GFs as valentines gifts.  (check American Eagle's site for example the valentine gifts section is filled with bras)    It sounds like a stupid gift, but usually they're push up bras to make them look bigger.    Tbh you're being a little bit of a jerk about it, you're causing conflict over nothing, just tell him you don't know if thats true and he'll think of another gift.|`|klcqgST9aa	Ask him why it matters.     Once my boyfriend and I were kissing, and he asked me what color my underpants were. I looked, without him being able to see, just lifted my waistline for a sec, and told him.     His face was just confused. They ask weird questions sometimes. They're boys...and they have thoughts, you know?|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Grow some boobs first.|`|EBS8bjAwaa	well the best thing to do in this situation would be to tell him that it makes you feel awkward talking about personal things like that. it's better than waiting for him to get mad right?|`|BlymuHMbaa	Say why must you know? Can't you see these babies!? ;] haha jk    Ask him what size is his..uh yea u know.    He'll probably keep quiet or lie.    -Livy  8]|`|GQdxDkA9aa	just tell him its not that personal ive told people i never met in person that and im not embarrased any size is normal and i dont see a problem with telling him. to tell you the truth he is probably just horny and wants to know things|`|qZVlDHBTaa	Just tell him rthat you think that the answer to his question is too personal and you would rather not answer that right now.|`|vC57LWaDaa	tell him you would rather not talk about that. he should understand.|`|QfvHoPFMaa	I have nothing to say to you, there is a time and place for everything and yahoo is not the place.  GROW UP!!!    That is what I would say.|`|AA11795191	Tell him "thats none of your business".    Although, he is your boyfriend, so I dont see why it would bother you all that much that he'd know.... maybe he wants to buy you a brassiere?    Oh, or you could tell him something ridiculous like "No, Im a W."|`|lFkXY6dJaa	i would just b honest... or b like... why do you want to kno anyway? is it that big of a deal? he might be wondering so he can buy you a bra or brag to his friends... so just be like honestly thats personal and i would rather not answer it... it hurts that you would ask that because it makes me feel like all you care about is my looks and physical aspect... that should make him feel bad and apologize|`|maTLfzi8aa	You should break up with him because from a guys point of view id say hes looking for a girl with big boobs.no offense though but i think thats wat he wants and he is just wrong.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	I would reply with something like this!! IF your thinking about valantines day,get me a lingerie voucher,so i can pick my own!!Better than getting a $2.95 Bra,from the bargain bin!!Pretty sure lingerie voucher's start around the $20 mark..NO you never ask that question!!Learnt that the hard way,when married,stupidly said to my wife,why you need money for Bras,there be nothing to put in them!!To which she replied,SO what i still buy your underpants,dont i..Never said dumb thing's like that to her again!!Stay well & happy!!
qN4Pt4kUaa	My break-up with my most recent ex was pretty harsh and I couldn't really move on. I didn't like him for what he did to me yet I still found myself thinking of him. I'd see him every day and it'd kill me that'd we walk by each other like we were complete strangers.    I know you won't want to hear this but try not to think of him. If it was meant to happen again it would have happened. Keep him off your mind by keeping yourself occupied. Talk to other boys in even just a friendly way, not necessarily a flirty I-really-want-a-boyfriend-now way. And hey, even talk to him. But before you get to that when you see him in the hall or somewhere smile and then later say hi or wave. Then make casual talk.    For the most part, time will heal it. A broken heart is hard to mend but time is the best medicine. :)|`|0tU4jkS9aa	im really sorry. im sorry you have to hurt everyday. you should let it go, i knoww thats not what you wanted to here. time will fix it, you'll have better things to do than sit around and wish you had him, you'll find someone who will care when ur hurting instead of ignoring it. give it time.       can someone answer my most recent question??|`|NEEVRp16aa	The only cure for a broken/bruised heart is time.  Once both you have time to think about maybe you can see if reuniting is possible.|`|nSUHvlyaaa	hmm it sucks to have to see your ex all the time. just try to make the best of it. Hang with your friends and try to ignore him. And don't let him see that it's bothering you; play it cool, and let him see that you're good without him and it might make him kind of jealous. In any case, he's your ex, so just try to think of him less|`|3ijLQe5laa	do you know how many men their are in the world? forget him> rejection is protection|`|gb1hMPcUaa	well depending on why you guys broke up..if its because he was an a**hole then dont even bother with him. you will get over him eventually BELIEVE ME. but if yall just kinda ended then tell him how you feel...write him a note telling him you still have feelings for him and everything and see how it goes.|`|60NJNjEpaa	you need to talk to him.  you need closure.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	talk to him and let him know how you feel|`|0MJGXOD2aa	omg ! im sorry but i feel lyke i already no u ! the same thing happened 2 me ! how old r u ? ... wat u gota do, ignor all calls and texts, and look very pretty everyday, make him want u =) and if it doesnt turn out good, move on becus there are so many more hot guys out there ! |`|9Oxu5CIoaa	Breakups are always hard, but you HAVE to move on. Give up hope on getting back with him. I know its hard, but once you get over him you will feel amazing and refreshed. In fact, I think everyone should go through a tough breakup once in their lives, because it really makes you so much stronger.   Stop telling yourself that you are still in love with him. It is over, and you have to move on. If you are really having a lot of trouble with this, try getting into a new hobby, or focus on school, start working out, anything to take your mind off of him.  The fact is that you have to move on, so try not to feel sorry about yourself. You will feel the same way about other guys in your lifetime, trust me.  Good Luck!|`|Gc28dnKcaa	If a girl walked up to me, I mean a girl like my ex, and told me that she loved me then i would not know what to do. There is probably a reason why they broke up, and the guy probablyh would get mixed feelings. I would agree to let him know how you feel slowly, and then if he starts to show interest in you, then tell him everything.               Perhaps he might feel the same way, but don't know what you are feeling?|`|7c364d66f9688d88ce8ebb20fae07315aa	Yeah.. it really sucks after a breakup especially if you really loved them. But if its over, you gotta move on.The best thing to do is concentrate on school or work or whatever you do and go out with your friends and have girls nite out.But don't dwell on the past just get on with your life he obviously has.|`|GPYHZiQFaa	________________________________________...|`|z7MIZdaZaa	when i was in high school i went through the same thing. i dated my best friend for almost a year and he broke my heart.     there is no straight up answer, nothing that will make it easier. but just know that everyday it gets a little bit better, a little bit easier to see him in the halls, also know that htere is going to be days where you feel strong and independant and there will be days when you just wann cry and thats okay too : )    The best thing you can do for yourself is have fun! and keep busy! Go to functions at school, hang out with friends as often as you can, catch up on homework, read a book, go to parties! whatever you can do that will keep your mind off of him, and focus your life on you now!    As a young girl, we get so caught up on these boys who are way less mature than us. my daddy always told me that one day i would look back and laugh at time like these, and its true! but i also know that right now it seems like the hardest thing in the world.    just remember, hs boys are hs boys no matter what! they dont know what they want, especially in a relationship. So just be open to the fact that its time to move on and if the friendship is worth fighting for, than it will find a way of working out.    stay busy and focus on you girl! the best thing for you to do is to not cry in front of him or look/act depressed. be flirty and happy to other people and he'll see that your stroing and you dont need him to make you happy. it feels good to get attention and he will notice you, trust me ; ) (it works like a charm if you pretend you dont care and dont text or call him, always act like your too busy)    but thats just a  little secret of mine...works like a charm haha you go girl!|`|NtEIn8N9aa	maybe you should try talking to him and telling him how ya feel and im sure he probably feels the same way if you guys used to be best friends...|`|TwnFt20Zaa	tell him what you feel....|`|JF5PPkqBaa	Why did you break up with him? Are you already dating someone new?     Talk to him, see if you two can make it work again. I knew a couple who had a fight from the end of grade 4 to the start of grade 7 and they look like they've been - and will be - together forever.     If you love him but just have too many fights, maybe you love him but you just can't stand to spend the rest of your life with him? Ask yourself - would you live in the same house as this guy, "Till death do you part"? You can still talk to him about it and decide to be just friends.     If he did something you really didn't like to make you two break up, forget him. The only cure for a broken heart is time. 
HkyOtIeTaa	well if you guys are friends you can ask her if she likes anyone, that's what I do and my guy friends always answer.
JDQP0Phraa	Just tell her you don't want her to feel like she has to say yes, you just think it would be really fun to go with her and you understand if she says no. Ask if she would like to do something less formal, and a little more casual if she says no to prom. Maybe she's just not that kind of girl. If she still has no definite answer after you talk to her, she doesn't really want to go.|`|UZp96Axcaa	u need to confront her. simply say that u wud like an answer because the table requests and payments are due soon.  then if she says yes, make sure the prom goes great and u still want to go out with her...then ask her out after prom.  if she says no to the prom then ask her to go out on a date because u like her. but try not to put out pressuring vibes.  most girls [like me] dont want to b pressured into anything and many times the guy is the one making it awkward.  as 4 knowing if she just doesnt want to hurt ur feelings.... try and read her body language, the way she talks and such.  and from my experience girls hate it when the guy has someone else ask her out 4 him.  many think that the guy has self esteem issues or is just way too chicken.  hope i at least helped a little! XD|`|U2x7WZ4Kaa	i liked a girl liked that, ask a friend to ask her out for you|`|9PfEKygaaa	just go up to her and ask her if she's thought about it any... that should give her a good hint.|`|u5yCeyYSaa	ok what ever you do do  NOT get a friend to ask her out for you she will think you have no balls and your friends will bug you for ever. just go up to her in person start talking if she brings any thing up about the prom just ask her then but id she dose not Say anything just ask her|`|5WB2yZUFaa	i bet she's waiting for someone else to ask her, and she's keeping you as a back up in case he doesn't and she decides to go. if i were you i'd forget it and ask someone else. you shouldn't miss your prom over this girl. she's not into you or she would have said yes right away. she wouldn't have to "think about it". trust me.|`|BiCVTDA2aa	Just talk to her. wait for a time that is right, not when shes rushing anywhere, and talk. If you dont feel comfortable doing that then you could try to talk to her friends, see what she has said to them. Or you could have one of your friends ask her. But if you have a friend talk to her, make sure that the friend doesn't make it awkward, have him/her just bring it up in small talk. If you really do want to go with her, then you should show it. Have fun at prom|`|Lw9yYvS9aa	im telling Mr.Burns that youre cheating on him|`|nm0GFf04aa	You can write her a note, text her, or instant message her or you can do it in person like this:    you:Hey whats up.  her:nothing really.  you:Oh...Not to put any pressure on you or anything but i was wondering if you thought about what i asked you.  her: (she says her answer)    if she says no;  you say: Cool. But we should hang out sometime. and save me a dance a prom night!    if she says yes;  you say:Cool. we should hang out sometime an get to know each other a little better. Theres this new movie or game we should check out sometime at the mall.... (or something along those lines)

3ijLQe5laa	dont date a guy with wandering eyes|`|FbTqb3uUaa	He shouldn't be looking at other girls if you mean anything to him, especially in front of you! I think I've caught my boyfriend a few times and I acted upset but never told why...I think he got the hint. If he wants to look, do it on his own damn time, not when you guys are out together!|`|11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	I wouldn't worry if he's only looking... If you catch him being unfaithful, cheating on you or whatnot, then drop him. If you're really bothered, talk to him about it.|`|AA11146445	i dont understand your question hun?

SsGLm3Xvaa	I've felt that way before, a long time ago... I had a boyfriend and when I'd go visit him, we'd make out like the whole time (you know, teenagers).  And of course I really liked making out with him... but afterwards, I would sometimes get this sad and used feeling.  Not because he was actually using me, just... because.    You have to make things like that very special for her, because if she feels like you came over to have sex (even if you didn't), or if you don't take plenty of time talking/etc beforehand (like just hang out, watch tv, go somewhere, just spend time together), or if you do talk/etc beforehand and she feels like you did all that just to get the sex, then she's going to feel used.    Try making it a more intimate moment, and always make sure she wants to - when you two start kissing and working your way towards having sex, make sure to ask her once or twice in a soft, caring voice, if she's happy and if she's enjoying this.  If she seems hesitant, stop what you're doing and cuddle with her for awhile before trying to be more physical again.    Tell her you love her before, during, and after having sex - especially during, it will make her feel more like you're making love to her than using her for pleasure.    Also, tell her afterwards that you love how close you feel to her when you're making love - not just physically, but emotionally too.  Tell her how beautiful she is.    EDITED TO ADD: Even though you don't see her all the time, you don't have to have sex each time, even though you might like to - sometimes, just go out and do something, or stay in and watch a movie on the couch.  One hour isn't too bad, try to visit her as often as you can, because then when you visit and have sex with her, she won't feel like that's why you came over, because other times you came over, it wasn't even on your mind.  Tell her you love to visit her just because you love to be in her presence.  You love to be around her.|`|AkTw3RQuaa	THIS  IS NOT LOVE.. THIS IS SEX  Spend quality time with the one you love  Simple movies, walk in the park etc  Stay out of bed  Save the best for last  Go to the car show, museums,dinner, then "do her"  Be sweet,,not horny  You rushing it..slow your roll partner|`|ulgvpJcQaa	Maybe she is feeling mentally abused by something you may had said to her or maybe she doesn't feel abused... maybe she feel violated. Sometimes when you are trying to get a girl "in the mood", the way you do it makes them feel violated, impure, or "dirty". A lot of the time girls feel this way because maybe she felt your sexual experience with her that night was out of lust and maybe not so much the love she wanted it to be... talk to her about it and try to get down to the point.|`|tFuBT3p8aa	thts easy. dont hav sex as often and pay mor attention 2 her. i hate when all my bf is any then that has 2 do w sex 2. if u really pay attention 2 her and take her out 2 eat and **** like that things will get betr. promise! good luck.|`|NtEIn8N9aa	well me and my bf have been going out 4 over a yr and we really love eachother but i think at a certian point a guy feels like its ok to not think about the emotions of their gf when it comes to sex and they get carried away but ya have to remember that thats still her body and not yours and she may not come out and tell you how she feels so you have to ask her if its ok even if you dont see her to much and make sex be romantic for her maybe say you love her and kiss her in the middle of it but you should wait until she doesn't feel like that anymore thats wat my bf did wen i started feeling liked that and he proved how much he really loved and cared about me|`|DiSOdCFXaa	sex DOES make girls emotional, but maybe she knows that you love each other and it just came to her what you guys were having sex. maybe she feels that sometimes she should say no.. or maybe she feels that she can't see you enuff|`|fV9SawuPaa	Sex tends to make women very emotional. Maybe when you guys do see eachother it's only sex and sex and sex. Although she acts like she likes it, maybe it bothers her. You don't sound like an a$$ so I don't think that's all you want from her. I suggest the next time you see eachother take her somewhere nice, no sex attached. Maybe she'll see that you do love her more then just for her body.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	agreed with that guy ^|`|RReigeBsaa	Because of the distance, you probably want to "make the most" of it when you finally see her, whether you realize it or not. Go out somewhere and do something cute -- ice skating, ice cream, a trip to the zoo, whatever. Let her know that you really care about her, and enjoy spending time with her outside the bedroom.
11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	I immediately distrust your BobbyJoe friend, since from what you've written, it seems that him and Bob are good friends. AND especially since this Bob has been saying false things to your friend Joe. They could just be conspiring to make you look like a fool. Then again, BobbyJoe could actually like you. I think you need to find another friend who is friends with BobbyJoe that could shed some light on this situation. In the meantime, if you don't like BobbyJoe, just stay friends with him and ignore Bob. He doesn't seem like a very nice person.|`|8DWmKQoJaa	like are you gay or somehthing no offense cuz is you are then maybe bob is just trying to mess with you, if you are straight tell him to bug off and stay away from him...
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	find a hobby or activity that does not remind you of him. Some people throw themselves into their work. Go hang out with some friends or read books. Take a personal growth through creative writing course. there's tons of options.|`|jOy8XVKnaa	Pursue activities that make your self esteem and mind be elevated.   eh:   enjoy a good movie (NOT a love story)  go out with friends (that dont remind you constantly of him)      and.... sometimes... Just thinking about it (the break up) can help you get through it.. A good cry can help but dont beat yourself up...   You'll get through it.
hSB2rP9Waa	Have more action dates then talking dates.  Eventually you will have lots of things to talk about and lots of memories.  Being silent with someone is usually a good sign that you are stopping just trying to impress them.  It means you are growing closer!|`|hMMU02iuaa	How about doing some activities together like going dancing or maybe athletic activities such as bicyling or working out together. You need to get past the shyness on way or another. She is no longer a stranger you want to attract. She is your girlfriend. You can also try reading the daily newspaper or informational magazines so you have something interesting to talk about. Try watching classic movies together and discussing your points of view. Maybe even some good jokes. There are plenty that would make you both laugh.   Find that comfortability within yourself. Shyness is in your head so find an activity that you both like and have fun :)|`|yuwjQjKqaa	YOU NEED TO TRUST EACH OTHER MORE!|`|gF26JyzBaa	it's called confidence. google it. it's very important. very important.    have you hit it yet? you sure won't be nervous after that.|`|9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	best thing i can tell you is GROW SOME BALLS|`|iWg7Z1mDaa	well if u are good for each other then be silly! and funny!  girls like funny guys and laughing. she wont think your stupid.  talk about anything =]|`|AA11641642	quit jacking off to her that helps for me|`|MzanmVtdaa	just talk to her and mess around.  or hang out with more outgoing peoplezz|`|RReigeBsaa	My boyfriend is really shy, and it took a few months for him to really get comfortable with me.

Be open, lay your head on her lap, hold her hand at school, etc. That kind of stuff will make you more comfortable around each other.

She was a graduate student at my school and actually reminded me very much of the girl with whom i first fell in love (probably why I liked her so much!). Well after she taught my class, she had another class in a building near my dorm. I would walk her to class every day, and we would openly flirt with each other. One day her class was canceled so we went to the campus bar. She bought me several drinks (even though she knew I was underage), and we had a great time just talking and drinking for like three or four hours at the bar. This date led to several others but nothing too serious. I got an A in the class though ;)
pcIkr0mqaa	Yeah I know it's scary to aska guy out.Maybe you should confirm if he is interested in you first.But worse case, he says no.There are going to be a lot of times in life when we hear''no''.Just go with your heart, thats the only thing you can trust.You never know,maybe it'll turn out better than you thought|`|fIWzTzfFaa	Ok the first thing you have to do is try and get him to notice you. Guys are visual so hopefully you are pretty, beautiful and/or sexy. If so, try and catch him checking you out and if you do, you have to use that to break the ice by making a little comment but keep it funny. You two will be toasting drinks and staring into each others eyes in no time.|`|0F3MreEaaa	Say hey i no this is sudden but wanna hang out tonight and if he likes you hell kiss you or hug you or even tell you he likes you
rcdPwIkXaa	OMG! that's sooo romantic and adorable! ? i love it, you did such a great job on it and you expressed your feelings! He'll love it!!! (:|`|zY8uu241aa	Aside from the horrible grammar and apparent spontaneity, it's very sweet.  Seems kind of repetitive, but it certainly gets the point across.  (And maybe take out some of the internal rhyme, like "inside" and "bride" or "apart" and "heart"; it gets kind of annoying in my opinion)|`|DiSOdCFXaa	it's good|`|uR8LM6iKaa	i had no idea what it meant.. sorry|`|0F3MreEaaa	im a guy and if i was your bf id say                                           !

It's nice that you are expressing how you feel about him.  Wherever he is, he will def feel better.  Your poem was nice too.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	it's very nice. just make sure you edit it, there are some spelling mistakes.|`|PAm7zqFyaa	depends on how long yall have gone out|`|KfouRJrDaa	It depends on the kind of guy. If you're dating a jerk, he might go "uhhh...yea thanks."    But if your boyfriend actually listens to you, and if he loves you for your looks and personality both. Then he'll probably love you more after reading it.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	adorable, but just dont count on him to return the favor x/|`|LbtU8iWAaa	one word  " sezyliciouse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|`|z7MIZdaZaa	just be careful with poems and letters like this!    i know what im talking about when i tell you this, and im not trying to hurt you in anyway im just saying from experience and knowledge;    1) a man and a woman have different ideas on romance and their emotions are completely different. for example, us women would spend hours writing romantic love letters that we literally spend hours wording just right and making it into somethine of a masterpiece. this will have no effect on him what so ever. he may say its cute and sweet but honestly, it will most likely start a fight. because of the work and heart you put into it you wont feel appreciated or like he cares at all. even though he may love you sooooo much, a guy can read the love letter and be like cool. where as woman are different, if our man wrote us a poem or love letter of this calibur we would melt to the ground with happiness    2) keep it short and sweet not too mushy. a guys emotions are not easy to dig into. they are most effected when you boost his ego. tell him how amazing he is and be sexy and flirty and the romance will follow.    i agree with the guy below me, it may come off as desperate. if you feel like this letter/poem is something you want to give them than heck yeah go for it!     but remember he may not display the reaction you want from him and that could make you feel like he doesnt care, when in fact he does. he may also be turned off by the mooshy-ness or get scared or feel pressured into somehting (cause men are weird) and that may cause him to distance himself from you.    it is important that you do what feels right to you, but dont get your heart broken us woman are emotional and men just arent that way! : )|`|oI46t9lVaa	it is Absolutely romantic good work|`|tegyqU6Raa	good job. just not so many xoxox|`|4ZoMzfSPaa	it is sooo romanic wow i love it!|`|11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	Please... work on your grammar... it's not awful, but... it hurts my eyes.

There are guys outt there who love stuff like this, and those are the guys you should be looking for.  I hope your boyfriend is one of those guys.  And if he isnt ...... He isnt worth your time, and doesnt deserve you.! good luck!|`|Q0I9rkF3aa	Write words out completely. Saying "4-ever" makes you seem uneducated. If I was a boy I would want a more personal letter that, one that you actually took the time to capitalize and punctuate correctly.|`|AA11210899	Umm well I think it is good but you might have gone too far by saying you want to be his bride and calling him babe and hn and all that mussshy stuff. Other wise it is GREAT!|`|2c88J3M7aa	OMGSH  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW... ??? THATS SOOO SWEETTT !

But if that is the one and only occasion, I wouldnt think much of it.|`|AA11309427	I agree with Jose. Get over yourself!|`|eMwgL3VTaa	remember, middle aged men are more successful at marrying people half their age than cougars, milfs and hot moms combined. In fact they are older than their spouses in 92% of all 20+ year gap marraiges. Its because they know how to lay on the charm and I hope to learn from them so when I'm middle aged I'll know how to lay on the charm.      Anyways, anytime a guy compliments you its a good thing because frankly 80% of all females are varying shades of ugly-average.     Take all the compliments you can get but still that is a college enviornment and while indeed 1000s of college teachers have affair with students (proving middle aged men dont have to rich to be a cougar with a girltoy) that really isnt an appropriate time to say something like that. I dont think he was flirting though. I think there are some females in society who take everything as a sexual gesture nomatter how harmless and non sexual.     Its the main reason males dont gold dig as much as females do. If a male chases a rich woman and puts the moves on.... he might end  up in prison or court for harrassment.  A girl chasing rich powerful men faces no such threat.
iLFYj6Qgaa	If you feel like it... go for it!    Just try, don't expect too much, no miracles anyway. Be happy with what you have. Who knows, it might work out very well!  If it doesn't work out, well, than you're an experience richer (I don't know if this is correct English, but you know what I mean, right?).    If you don't try, you don't have anything anyway, and you would always regret that you didn't give it a chance.    Just make sure you are very clear in what you expect from him. Set your boundaries, and like I already said, don't expect too much. I'm sure it will be great!|`|v16ylsl8aa	Go get him.|`|kVNqyCaxaa	we let fear prevent too many things in our lives. Go for it you have nothing to lose. ITs better to tell him how you feel and get rejected than o not say anything and spend the rest of you life wondering what if? Go for it and I wish you all the best. If it doesn't work out then you will be better prepared next time. And who saysits a mistake it may be just what he is waiting for. Good luck!
E2DhXryxaa	it's not weird, it's perfectly normal. and the fact that you acknowledge that it's his personality makes it make even more sense. relax, you're in control and you're experiencing something MANY other high school and junior high school students experience across the world. I mean let's face it, teachers have an impact on our lives, and it's not unheard of to really admire one of them, or maybe an eensy bit more than just that.|`|khxs0ZjPaa	maybe a LITTLE weird, actually A LOTA WEIRD! remember that he could be sent to prison. im sure that there are plenty of really hot, nice, sweet guys with wonderful personalities that are YOUR AGE!! im serious!|`|O6TC4CgRaa	i agreed that u should stay away from those feelings  It's cool that the teacher and you have nice feeling for each other, but you shouldnt go so far  I don't think the teacher would know if u have a crush on them  they'll just think it's just teacher and student bond  try HARD not to go deeeeeeep  good luck girl|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE TOO MUCH OLDER THAN YOU!!     trust me.

tG8matgBaa	i think you should sit down and really talk about it. If you don't pursue the relationship will the friendship fall apart? Maybe you can take it really really slow and keep talking about how both of you feel about it.     She probably needs to be reassured that what you have together isn't going to last for just two weeks.

UiXJLrDWaa	well if he is a flirt with everybody, then  why even bother|`|goP5E0Kxaa	You're the one game that he can't game yet. Of course he is turned on by that, you are a freaking golden angel to him !    He is excited by the challenge, and idea of winning you over .    He admires you for your realism, endurance, but at the same time he wants to prove that he could be your type, that he is good enough for you.    He has a major confidence boost from talking to several women, and dating them, and then there is you...its a question of his full range as a womanizer, and as a human being .    He may like you with some sincerity , but for the rest of it its hard core gaming.|`|nqmGblKlaa	Mehh who cares... if he is flirting with other girls than i am not sure.|`|YEpM2dmdaa	Try to get his number. Act like a different/made up person and ask him questions . He can't keep all his plans in his head. I do this to boys all the time and it works!|`|mZEI42mEaa	omg , this exact thing happened to me .. isn't ironic ?  anyway , i don't think you should date him , there's probably   a little sound coming from the back of your head saying  maybe you do like that guy ... you should just ignore it   his just like any other boy who thinks his the hottest guy out there  if you wanted to flirt a bit you could   just make sure you dont lead him on since you dont   really like him also while your pretending to flirt with him mention to him about your friend that likes him, or if you didn't wanna flirt at all  just ignore him when he starts flirting with you     hope that helps =)

MXMDTZxvaa	im sorry but that is just the way you are and your going to have to accept it. i think its very sweet you want a wife and kids. noone says you cant be dad still.  you can always adopt.  it might take some time to get use to this. again im sorry you have to deal with this dilema.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	U HAVE TO GO TO COUNSELING AND CHURCH  MAKE YOURSELF LIKE GIRLS|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	hmmm.....either you are straight and the guys you know just have the qualities you want and women and the girls you know...well, suck; or you actually are gay. if the latter, just...try to work towards acceptance :/ there's nothing morally wrong with being gay, i think. it's just the way you're wired. the the first one, wait it out. wow...they guys must be awesome at your school. the girls must really suck jk jk i'm sure they're cool.    Good luck my friend!! :)|`|VHRTcR75aa	well  not to burst your bubble, but if you're gay, you're gay.  you say your "gayness" is getting in the way, well, its nothing you can control. like a straight person is always straight and gay people are gay. so its not like you can shed this. however... this cant stop you from having a family...    i have a friend whose mom is a lesbian and his dad is gay, so he has two moms and two dads. and you'd think this is a recipe for disaster, but both sets of parents and step parents talk, and he has a good relationship with both, there's no trouble. Of course his biological parents dont live in the same house, but its still a good situation, and its not like he was missing a father figure (he lives with his moms). So that being said you can have children, and have a normal life as a gay man.    However, if you're gay, you're gay.  I hope this doesn't disappoint you.|`|5gBhIrQSaa	I'm sorry...  Well, you can't do anything about that, it's just part of your nature. If you really want kids, consider adopting? :]|`|FKmXu3eraa	you just gotta accept it    what happens, happens  be a surrogate
AA11201778	Our group of friends is about 30-40 people and we spend a great amount of time together. There are at least 15 girls. I can think of 2 of them that I haven't went out or slept with. I can say the same thing is true for most of the guys in our group. I have perfect friendship with everybody. Two days max, and it's back to normal. Chill out ;)|`|DiSOdCFXaa	you are only making it weird by not talkiing to her. but hey girls can be stingy.|`|uR8LM6iKaa	holy crap!!! i had the same situation around the same time!!!! wow freaky!!!    i didnt think it was awkard after i broke up  with my guy because i didnt know him, my friends forced me to go out with him. After we broke up, he didnt like me and now i like him and he likes some other girl and he hardly ever pays attention to me any more. So what i would do is to talk to her more and more and more about things she like, get to know each other. just pay attention to her and tell her that you want to be friends again.     i really really really hoped i helped!!!!!!!!!!!! i have been through this and it is not easy!!!!!!!!!!|`|G1fDp1PEaa	I don't see why it would be awkward.|`|V780bRMRaa	I don't think it would be akward. My best guy friend asked me out and then the next day we forgot about it and we are still best friends (and he's got a girlfried), and it wasn't akward.|`|PTXzRjtkaa	hey something just like that happened to me. i tried to tallk to her but she never would try to talk to me again. she wouldn't look at me when we pass by.  i dn't get it but it does feel awkward. i think it is normal. if she really wanted to be friends then she would try to talk to you. its life sorry dude.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Just tell her that you miss the friendship you had. Then ask her to go do something you did as friends. Be upfront, and like you suggested state that you agree the relationship didn't work, but you two make much better friends.     Keep in mind though, she may have felt a little disappointed that your relationship didn't work out, thus the silence. So she may need a couple of invitations before she opens up.|`|FXe5Lv9eaa	There isn't any reason why it would be awkward. I've been in your situation before, and I understand where you're coming from.|`|iWg7Z1mDaa	do it =]|`|EHHGa5E2aa	Just talk to her, slowly build up your friendship again.  Good luck. :)|`|jrP98BQbaa	no awkwardness.|`|vWlJ9qLOaa	just talk to her and tell her you still want to be friends|`|TebGjfjXaa	no just treat her normal like someone you know.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Noo, who knows maybe she was waiting for you to ask that all along! A girl usually expects a guy to msg first, I should know because I'm still waiting for this guy to msg me..And I've been waiting since Novemeber.  I know for a fact that if he msged me I would be the happiest person EVER! But I think his way of thinknig is the same as yours that it would be awkwars, so I don't think he even bothers   Point is; MESSAGE HER!?|`|wZMq5jqyaa	you're never going to forget what happened. so just tell her that you want to be friends, and that the relationship you two had proved that. just try starting a conversation with her. it shouldn't be that awkward. bring up some things you two did before you started going out. remind her of how things used to be. good luck.|`|ws9oqfb6aa	in adults world it should work|`|GlNlcioUaa	your a little baby deal with it|`|cPEiVacDaa	just be like i want to be your friend again  throw it out there  then at least she will know  she might catch on she might not|`|g4lOqmeIaa	that should be fine.|`|jeKDwjP0aa	It depends on what kind of girl she is. If u don't think she's dramatic and does not have feelings for u then go for it.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	I fail to see how that's awkward. Just talk to her. It won't be weird, unless you really broke her heart.|`|5uoR7KdSaa	nooooooooooo  TALK 2  HER  TRUST ME I WOULD LOVE THAT IF I WAS HER|`|94W9CFKnaa	noo, i was in this situation before the girl was heart broken even though it was for a short while, when you break up with her you crush her ego and make her feel like **** no matter how far you guys went. the only thing to do is wait for her to talk to you so you can be friends again, but never start contact first.|`|kixERSDDaa	Yes, i 100% agree. The best thing is just to get it out in the open that u don't want it to be awkward between u two.  She probably feels the same way and will be happy to be friends with u.|`|cxTCvqIcaa	talk to her man if you feel you should. most girls say they want to be friends but they stop talking after a few days-weeks. happeneds to me and im sure everybody else. if you truly want to be friends though, talk to her and talk about what happened, and if nothing happened, then it shouldnt be awekward at all|`|5vYlIDRoaa	First of all, seems like you guys should have taken the relationship phase a bit slower. Don't think it should have fallen apart that quickly, if you two really were good friends. But that's water under the bridge.         Hell yes it's awkward. But sometimes these things happen when people of the opposite sex become friends and opt to take things to the next level.         Give it some time, if the friendship is there things will patch back up.|`|5gBhIrQSaa	Should not be awkward.  I'm BEST friends with a guy I used to like...no awkwardness.|`|M4eefVjLaa	yeah. you should just say how you feel.  When people break up, there's always going to be that awkwardness around you for a couple of months.  Then usually someone has to get up enough courage to tell that other person they want to be friends.  So yeah.. do it.  You'll feel much better.|`|Ly0VVzU2aa	it will only be awkward if you make it awkward.  just tell her how you feel dont say anything to mushy.  GOOD LUCK =)|`|UwQPH7eHaa	"Would it be awkward to just be like can we just forget that we ever went out, i relationship was ****."     Saying this accomplishes absolutely nothing, so imo, don't say it.    If you want to be friends with this girl, just try to be friends with her, but I don't recommend you ask her, "can we be friends again?" Instead just try talking to her normally and see how she reacts....    Does she seem comfortable talking to you?     Does she seem happy to talk to you?    If there is some distance between you or you can't be friendly with her like before, I recommend you simply ask her how she feels. "Is everything OK?" "How do you feel?" Listen to what she has to say, do not interrupt her, and try to get in touch with how SHE feels. Forget what you want from her, talk to her about what SHE wants.     What were the circumstances of your break up? Did you dump her? She you? Before you can become friends again you'll have to both be comfortable with how your short dating relationship ended up. Keep this is mind.     You need to talk to this girl, feel out if she is cool with you. Then try to establish a new friendship with her.. don't assume that you can go back to the old way, things will be different now, and it's your goal to make that difference a good thing.     Based on your question it sounds like things between you and her have changed otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question. Keep an open mind and try to talk to her on a level where you are both clear, honest, and comfortable. Good luck|`|XPLS5pXKaa	Yeah it'll be awkward|`|80b643cc0955135d5d5be659f1d670c3aa	you guys should be fine. if you say it outright you will both feel better. go for it bro|`|Hdgl27hDaa	no dude, dont even bring it up  its been so long...  just be normal|`|2Lt3pRF4aa	Just talk to her.  She probably wants to talk to you, too, so be a big kid and do it, yo.|`|K9yt2MHjaa	your fine.. just ask for friendship
MXMDTZxvaa	It doesnt matter about the height it matter about the personality. although it may be slightly embarrassing to date a shorter man you should think about the personality and whcih one you could see yourself with more.     ok since i got all the morally correct answer out... i say 5'4 lol|`|DN3lPdE0aa	yes because im 5'2    & don't like when guys are shorter than me|`|AA11553245	5'3''  because you are still taller than me :)|`|nxyoTyc0aa	It doesn't matter how tall they are. Which one do you see your-self with? Don't go off of what other people think are good candidates, date who you think is the best guy for you to date.
oCErBpWjaa	DO's: (but dont overdo)  -Compliment her  -Make her laugh  -Pay everything  -Be a gentlemen--open doors, pull her chair out  -Listen and don't interrupt  -Watch your manners; burping, farting, sloppy eating, etc.  -Pay attention to her body language if she sits closer to you...    DON'Ts:  -Don't make inappropriate comments/jokes  -Don't make prejudice jokes about babies, parents, religions, etc.  -Don't make a negative joke about her or her appearance; even if its just a joke!  -Don't stare or flirt with other girls such as the waitress  -Don't talk about exes (unless she asks) but briefly  -Don't brag about yourself; dont try to impress her  -Don't be too cool    Most importantly: Be yourself...she's with you on this date because of you so make sure YOU are there.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Moderation . DONT Talk about serious issues on a first date . Don't interrogate her , let their be talk on both ends. LISTEN to what she says and talk about it.     Be kind, be honest , be sincere, don't say anything perverted unless your girl is like that....    Don't go to a movie....|`|klcqgST9aa	Hmm, if you aren't dating, just have fun and be yourself. Don't cuddle with her unless she does with you first. A lot of girls like guys to make the first move, so if you're sitting next to eachother, maybe put your hand or arm really close to hers, like, so close that it touches lightly sometimes. If she likes it, she'll have her arm/hand touch yours. If she doesn't, she'll pull away.    Since you're getting something to eat, make sure you pay for her. If she won't let you, tell her it's no big deal, it's your treat. Don't let her pay unless she gives money to the casheir herself. Some girls are stubborn like that (me) but most will like the traditional.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	hanging out as friends or posibly more?|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	just relax & do you .|`|wRCKf1Mzaa	Hmmm, just be sweet, caring, and funny, act like a gentleman... but don't try too hard.  Don't act like a tough guy either, that's usually a turn off.  And play around with her, make her laugh.  If you're not sure about the way she feels, don't get all touchy, it might freak her out...  Haha, just be yourself (:|`|H0HxTETjaa	Just be the same person you were when you guys first started talking. there must be a reason why she agreed to go out with you.She likes you for you. If you start acting like someone else this will be the last date. Just relax and enjoy this time together. If it was meant to be then it will be good luck|`|5vYlIDRoaa	Man, just go out there be yourself and have fun. If you plot everything out in advance you'll come out awkward and nervous.     Be yourself, try to make her laugh, make the settings as relaxed as possible.     Good luck!|`|QmFSIdiMaa	Hi there sounds like you like this girl allot? Well it is not easy when have never done something b4, er I think you should be yourself, it is normal to make mistakes in anything you do , even if it is your 1st time, that's whats make 2people know each other. So take each sec and enjoy, if going out on a date was as perfect as it seems then no one would get a divorce|`|n4df7r28aa	First of all, use good manners. It will make her feel special if you open and hold the door open for her to enter. If you are eating in a real nice restaurant, pull the chair out for her to be seated. Compliment her on how she looks, but don't overdo it. During conversation, ask her questions about her interests. If you ask the questions and let her do most of the talking, you will come out looking like a great conversationalist. You must have a genuine interest in the questions you ask, or you will come out as a fake. Many women claim that men hear them, but they don't listen, and you are showing her that you're not like other men. Make occasional eye contact, but don't stare. Smile often. If you run into any of your friends, don't treat them more important than you treat her. At the end of the night,tell her what a great time you had and how it would be nice to do it again.|`|1IuZTAW4aa	Well you can just be you're self no matter what. Is the girl a very nice person ? then you can probly be a cool boy and act normal this is a girl who is replying so i know what what you should do. wear a foot ball shirt and cargo pant's that should really bring to you more than friends so keep it cool and wear what i tould you becuase alot girl's that are athletic like sports you'rs only Breezy babbi.|`|Phb7dMFEaa	well don't take her to a sports game unless she wants to, often girl tend to get bored. second, if you are going out to eat, absolutely positively, don't let her pay!  also, girls are often nervous to make the first move, so you do so yourself. lastly, don't force her to do anything, and be kind, and yourself. GOOD LUCK! hope this helps|`|u7ZAQl8Faa	Take her to a romantic or horror movie and be yourself. tell her that she looks nice  Ask normal questions like how was your day and stuff like that.
Nur24xInaa	Talk to him. But I think it is strange if his friend can't tell you that he still likes you or not, because if he did, what's there to hide? Trust me, the less you talk to him, be more close with him, the farther you will be apart from him.|`|B7idbFNVaa	Silence is a sign of hiding something.  Maybe he did something bad and don't want you or his friends to find out.  Right now, he is in the "thinking process" about your relationship.      What to do:   Ask him, what is on his mind and what has troubling him.   Next ask him, does it has to do with me.|`|pJ7icz0taa	How do you love someone for a month?  You don't even know someone in a month.   He is probably not happy with you, so just let it go and move on.  You can't hold him if he isn't happy. Oh and sex won't hold him either.|`|303088a0a08e40ae0537536d9b580d67aa	Get some confidence and just go up to him to ask him what's up|`|QVfoY6WYaa	aww i hate it when guys do that, ya neva know whats going on in there minds! dont let him muck you around,ask him whats wrong|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	first off it has only been a month give it 6 more & see if you feel the same way . besides if he felt the same way about you this wouldn't be a question .|`|1k6UUC8qaa	there is really nothing you can do and if he dumps you oh well his loss remember you've only been with him for a month you'll live.  Just act normal and go about your business. Don't act scared or desperate don't make him feel that important.don't take short relationships like that too seriously there are plenty of fish in the sea|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Give him his space. If you become too persistent, he will get annoyed and dump you for sure.|`|GlNlcioUaa	sounds like hes either cheating ir he dont like you anymore oh well|`|vWlJ9qLOaa	ask him what is wrong|`|hN08l7tLaa	try and talk to him about this. sometimes guys do get bored after a time, and if he does that, he's not a great person to hang out with.|`|UiXJLrDWaa	ok first of all you cant be loving him cause is just been a month, and if he dumps you im quite sure thats should effect you at all sweety think about it  its only been a month ok good luck!|`|8d74IGuTaa	i read this in a book... guys go into holes to think about things that are bothering them... i don't know whats bothering him but don't pester him for it... just give him his space and he will be back to normal in no time!|`|DI4a42xoaa	Go ask him. something is definetley wrong. He is either moving, or has feelings for someone else. Does his family like you? that might also have somthing to do with it. Hurry up and ask him before it is too late. I am curious to know what will happen|`|cxTCvqIcaa	talk to him. see whats on his mind, if hes upset about anything. if theres another girl hes thinking about, if you think you may have done somthing at all. if he said he couldnt tell him, then it could be possible cause if he wasnt, he would have come out and said it. but just talk to him and see what going on|`|Hdgl27hDaa	ask him whats going on, and how you feel about him...  if you break up, sorry  there are other fish in the sea    good luck  i hope everything works out
ebwe0Duzaa	yea your right, you do need to be yourself!  i feel for you cause i was exactly the same way when i had a boyfriend in 8th grade...i have to tell you, i did not get over the awkwardness and shyness for FOREVER!!  we broke up after about 3 months and i always felt like i was boring the crap out of him cause i was shy and didnt know how to act...even after we broke up we stayed friends (sort of)  and it took till i went into 10th grade year to feel comfortable around him and to not be shy....im in 11th grade now...and when i was in 9th grade in april i got with the boy im still with now and i was EXTREMELY shy before we started going out, i mean i dont even know how he could have liked me...anyways, we hit it off really fast (not in a sexual way) and i seriously got over almost all of my shyness within a week or two...and i really really love him...i seriously think we are suppossed to be together...so the dude with you now is probably not the one for you, dont get mad, im just speaking from my experience and others that i know.  you shouldnt feel awkward like that...well at least not for long, but just give it time and try to let your personality show through!  if he doesnt like you the way you are you need to say screw him and move on cause hes not worth it and not the one for you...but seriously you need to just try to act like your talking to a friend when your with him, just relax...i know its hard.  but if things dont change and it stays like that i dont think thats meant at all...|`|FKf67HXaaa	its because you guys are young thats why you dont know what to say just be friends and dont rush things|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	bat your eyes a lot, giggle softly, and look down at your feet demurely|`|SM4Tpv2qaa	If he is your boyfriend, it shouldn't be awkward.  Obviously it will be since you are so young.  You should probably just wait awhile to date if you think it's awkward, because that means you are too young.  If you can't talk to him, what is the point of dating?|`|0gLec1VPaa	Just talk to him like he's your friend. I mean, a boyfriend's just a friend with benefits, right? (laughs) If you're a bit awkward like that, he might take it as a hint that you don't really like him. Loosen up and bit, and think about the times before he was your boyfriend. If you get tongue-tied in a conversation, just talk about what you like to do or something about him. If you do that, he might be a bit cocky, but inside he'll enjoy it. Well, if he's a true boyfriend. If not, then dump him. He's evil. Lol, joking.|`|E7TzD7s2aa	Be sexy but nice. But don't be too sexy... Start a conversation on something hes interested in.     Remember!be sexy but not too much cauz then it will seem that ur  (excuse the term but) *********.y.!! haha    hope i helped !! best of luckk!!!|`|140d2cb6f23e38d9b4af65f92993c60faa	If you don't know what to say around him/you can't find anything to talk about cause there's no common interests, then why are you dating him?    Personally, I think at your age you shouldn't try dating.  You can always grow older and date, but you can never grow younger and act like a kid.|`|cxTCvqIcaa	like nurself
dHK3OWNqaa	please find someone who will appreciate you    leave now|`|RvddYKqjaa	You've grown apart. You had fun, and it was a learning experience. Both of you can move on now. Maybe you shouldn't have moved in together so soon.   Money seems to be a big issue with you. Make it easy on both of you, and just go your separate ways. I don't think you will regret it.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Awwww, I think she might just be using you   I think you should move on, there are other girls out there   Oh wait- but you'll lose so much stuff then you should try and make her want you. Like maybe be flirty and stuff, oh and start slowly paying less for stuff xD|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yeah, she's got the whip hand, and she knows it.  Don't be scared of her.  Be cold to her.  Make her be the one to want to leave.  And don't buy stuff for her.  Be really cheap with the groceries.     Next time please don't move in with someone so quickly. And if you do, make sure that your legal interests and your property is protected.|`|3ijLQe5laa	never put yourself in a vulnuable position. if you feel like your their on mercy then maybe you should start making preparations to move|`|pizsAvupaa	Srry bro. But she useing you. You gotta let her go but it won't be hard as long as you tell yourself that she was useing you for $. No guy deserves 2 deal with a girl like dat,besides am sure u can find sum1 dats better ^_^|`|8htIwW9Haa	Make her want to come and get you.|`|5vYlIDRoaa	Man...don't know what to tell you.     Doesn't sound like you're too happy in this situation. Even if you could work things out, would it be worth it?    Frankly, I'd cut my losses and step out towards greener pastures.|`|HlCi6NBvaa	wow sounds supper hard !!!  mayde she just wants an arm candy she wants someone to get mad at and to boss around!!! i would leave|`|qiYjhM4Gaa	if you want to try and get things back to how they used to be, just give her space and make her wonder whether or not you're interested or not. it'll make her think.     you see how when she treats you like she's not interested in you anymore, it makes you scared and want to try harder and now you're scared to ask her for simple things cuz she has all the control right now.    so take a step back and just do things for you. don't ask for sex for a while and at least one time, if not more, the next time she asks you for sex, say you're too tired and say you were about ready to go out or any other excuse. play hard to get and it might spark something back up again. maybe things have gotten to common with you two, so a change could be good anyway.     just live life for you for a while. do your own thing. things will work out how they're supposed to. best of luck!|`|7Ihzy9lGaa	The situation you are in and how she is treating you is really bad. Obviously the two of you are not happy and no amount of money that's gained or lost is worth staying in the relationship. She could be using you to take most of the load off herself, and if you feel this way, no matter what her intent is, it is best for you to remove yourself from the relationship/situation all together. If you feel like you are unwanted and being used then most likely that is the case.|`|JC7If6Naaa	do somthing to make her feel guilty of what shes doing
nVsWK6CCaa	Ask him to send you a nude pic, that should stump him!|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	How many STD's do you have?  that should get him, lol|`|b3yKxCQxaa	just look around in some of the singles and dating or health sections of yahoo answers, ive seen loads in there.-Good Luck

QN3TaTVNaa	ouch, a common problem. it really depends on you and your friends. if you have a very loyal friend group, then going straight out and asking her is bad    some people could dare eachother and it will work but from what you say, it probably wont work    you could do the very nice friend thing and actually build up his courage to ask her out first. if he chickens out or is rejected, then make your move(if he is rejected use the 2-3 week rule before asking her out cause thats way too harsh and you want her to "forget" his fail). If he gets it, then you will get looked up upon(or he owes you big) for getting him the girl    that worked best for me in the past.     good luck
MpXAZZBvaa	I think he likes you as a friend. MAYBE more than that. You on the other hand like him as a friend if you liked him more than a friend then you most likely would not feel as if you don't like him. That's what I think.|`|KXZj1ZPNaa	Sounds like you like him if you can't stop thinking about him|`|ZZOtscXsaa	You like him and he likes you!     YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN!|`|1593dcb1ac07c226ebcb09eead0d7fc4aa	he wants ur little bummiieeeee|`|Cq2CVuhcaa	you should know if you like him or not. we can't tell you who you like. only your heart knows.
n68rcu9Naa	LOL you're already boyfriend/girlfriend but you guys don't feel the need to make things official and that's normal.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	Just casually ask him why he has not asked you out yet, if you don't feel like asking him out.|`|MEr99qKraa	u in sum sort of rush......u'll be wanting to get married to him next..y wait 4 him u gotta gob use it..all this being silly i like him but he ain't asked me out yet..u wait to long and sum1 else will get him ..u both like each other whats the problem ...carry on with that sort of attitude and u'll never get a b/f and if u do it won't last long due to u ur impatience|`|8htIwW9Haa	Sometimes a guy doens't know how to act w/ a gf. Just pretend you didn't hear what your friend said.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	HES TRYING TO BE COOL|`|cHBcR0Chaa	since u both like each other, but hes to slow to the punch, probably b/c hes to shy, go ask him. it will make his day. plus it will probably help his confidence level out a bit.|`|lLYywqYsaa	either b patient or just ask him!
nqmGblKlaa	Be patient girl....!|`|29d696b2b163821f5d4e2854064c4a2faa	Who said you had to wait until HE asked you? If you are interested enough, you should ask him. It's not out of the ordinary to do that.|`|Zf2n9uSsaa	try asking him out but go with a bunch of friends
PWDrT5c2aa	Does he always stare and flirt?|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Well think why does he like you than you have you answer LOL
O1WxKk7uaa	Maybe she likes you and she talks bad about lucy so you could stop liking her and like your friend|`|IG4A4nuDaa	lay down the line, tell her that you can't disrespect your GF.  She probably will take that as mature and respect you more.  I woudln't let that get to you, just a joke  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	dump her|`|7YTiooX5aa	Just tell her it was funny at first and that you really like (Lucy) and would greatly appreciate it if she would stop with the jokes and leave it be. If she gets mad oh well she will get over it but she needs to know that the fun is over.|`|j3DLtl6Raa	Just talk about what a great friend she is. If she tries to kiss you give her cheeck then say ur my friend. also talk to her about 'lucy'. that'll help a lot.|`|tHnyVzEEaa	honestly... i think shes pissed at u cuz u wont kiss her *** like the other guys... & she prob knows talking about Lucy like that bugs u so she does it try to make u realize that shes  "better".  Just say sumthin like, "bak off Princess"
c2IwvdGsaa	if she doesn't check her email that often she may prefer to speek on the phone so just ask her for her   if you really like her lifes to short to worry bout how long you should wait  good luck|`|LS6zgscQaa	okay first talk to in person way more than emailing, girls just find it really weird to do that. I know because well im a girl.|`|jrP98BQbaa	if you've met her ever just ask.  if she says no say maybe another day.    phone numbers aren't a big deal!|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Ask her for her number. Just do it.|`|5hCatHn2aa	myspace is the new booty call.|`|i2OERsC9aa	it doesn't matter how long~ just ask for it in an e-mail- that way you won't seem desperate- all girls like to get called on! trust me!
jeHTjvbaaa	Won't do it... the smoke burns my eyes being around it and it tastes soooo bad when you kiss... BIG mistake.. =(|`|SJLgRqgSaa	my man would find it fine, he wants me to smoke haha! xx|`|b3yKxCQxaa	I wouldn't be able to do it (just my opinion obviously).|`|i9SZlhI2aa	dump her
XlMqbpW4aa	ok weirdly enough..my best friend is my boyfriends sister..and we are also 3 years apart in age. age doesnt matter, no matter how many people say that. if you really like eachother, youll find a way to make it work..just tell him how you feel. tell him you really like him, and you wnt to work things out and that breaking up over 3 years in age difference is stupid.
nqmGblKlaa	I have the same problem.. :D|`|MiwvA72Aaa	wait...you don't like him, but you want him to stay interested? Are you sure you don't like him even just a little? I mean, texting him back might get him to keep texting you, but it's kinda cruel to lead him on if you have absolutely no intention of getting with him.|`|FKf67HXaaa	if you dont like him why do you care so much|`|Ce8RvIIbaa	Keep up the conversation, whether it's in person or through texting    It sound like you're inadvertently starting to like him back, as you picked up on :]    gl|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think you do like him more than you think maybe you should try to get him to go out with you! Best wishes.|`|NDnnUcP9aa	respond to his texts but dont flirt toooooo much if your not intrested :]|`|hYGSWGYSaa	Ah c'mon don't lead him on you tease.|`|z7MJMlIWaa	You like the chase? lol, make moves on him, compliment his hair or whatever. Say hey, then flip your hair, he'll go nuts! Have fun|`|AcL6nWkdaa	if u dont lyl him let him go if u do ask him out|`|wzkAW8IOaa	just keep on talking to him when you see him  and if he doesn't like you any more than just forget about it, he might say he doesnt like you but he really does, he just wont admit it cause he thinks you dont like him  and ask him if he still likes you every once and a while ..... but not to much then he wont  hope this helps|`|j48cLUiLaa	first of all, how can you not like him if you freak out when he doesn't text you. you obviously like him. you need to talk to him more at school and hang out with him and do stuff fun. theres more to a friendship then just texting. see if he wants to come to your house or y'all go to the park or something

THIvlI4waa	Don't purse it, your ex is your ex for a reason. Your husband is in your life now, and put yourself in your husbands position, if your husband did this to you, would you be happy? First loves are tricky because they never really end. First loves teach you how to love-that's why you don't forget them. And what if you talk to your ex, and things get out of hand, and you may wind up doing something you might regret
iekgFLjuaa	I used to be the same way with my boyfriend. I used to doubt whether he loved me or not, but the question is... do you love him? If you love him, you should trust your sweetie.  My boyfriend and I had a talk.. And he explained how much he loved me. And I explained how much I loved him,  If you love your boyfriend. Trust him. Its the  best thing to do (:    Good luck! Don't stress to much about it... enjoy your relationship!   |`|ZxzOnHLJaa	you would know by the way he treats you and the things he does for you! if he treats you like a queen and makes sure you're happy and safe all the time then he means it!
FZ10x1RTaa	if i like her then i would go with her but if not then fu ck it haha|`|HgRYP3cJaa	It's only a movie and if you're scared...you can cuddle during the scary parts.|`|AUBQUcZFaa	I woud tell her but still watch it. Besides she might be scared too. Like i thought the day the earth stood still was scary and i went to go watch it with my girlfriend but it wasnt that bad. Lolz we laughed at the ending|`|k1FenuRLaa	try and talk her out of it, but its unlikely id be in that position becuz i dont go to the cinema often|`|qUmZCJ79aa	Be honest.  Tell them you don't like scary movies.  Ask them to go see a different one.|`|SO7zRZK9aa	If you're old enough to be dating, you're old enough that a scary movie shouldn't affect you. However, I would agree that the vast majority of scary movies these days "aren't worth seeing".|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	This question caught my eye.  Lol.  My boyfriend's a wimp :)  He shreaked during a non-scary part  I was like "..? why screech?"  and he was like "I just thought about what happened 5 minutes ago in the movie"  lol.  But its some major cuddle time ;)  Just say YAA.  IM A MANNNN. And just hold her HAND LIKE THERES NOOOO TOMORROW!  And I dont bug my BF about it.  I find it adorable :)|`|wfnQNIhCaa	i would go...because i wouldn't be concentrating on the movie...|`|4hJgn2e5aa	i would tell her that im scared of horror movies, and see her response then probly go see another movie or do something else.|`|FXs0yBLEaa	Okay I am deathly afraid of horror movies. I hate them. But if someone I liked asked to see one with me I would try and seem eager at first but trail on to some other movies and see if she wants to see them instead. If, after the conversation, she goes back to the horror movie, then i would say yes. I can't say I would know the story line because I'd have my ears plugged and eyes closed but I would go with her.|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	Whether I like the movie or not, I'd go with the girl anytime. It's just a movie and if I liked the girl then I wouldn't let a movie spoil my chances with her.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I guess I watched every scary movie that was out when I was younger, so personally it is hard to imagine having nightmares.    BUT...  Male pride is a hard thing to get around.  It isn't right, I know, but for guys to look "weak" in front of someone they are interested in is not an easy thing to get over.    I guess if you know he has issues, don't ask him to that type of movie.  It would be easier if everyone was just honest up front.|`|j48cLUiLaa	i'd say yes. i personally do like scary movies but if i didn't i'd still say yes. i love to make and see my girl happy and will do anything for her. so if that means seeing a scary movie knowing i'm going to have nightmares i'd do it.|`|JINK3IHiaa	I'd say yes.|`|sIS9ufwuaa	i would jus watch it.|`|6GEEwjwzaa	i would so go with her to the movies no doubt about it n then maybe after we could go watch another movie that really is worth watching|`|TFW9Dozfaa	id probably go with her just because some one i liked just asked me to the movies.  i would definitely sacrifice it for her.|`|OCNpTC6Uaa	i don't like them and i would go if she really wanted me to go...just depends!|`|aQ1FjD1eaa	I'd say I don't like scary movies and I won't go. If she doesn't want to do anything with me after that obviously she doesn't really care.|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	tell her i don't like that movie|`|jAswXhupaa	I would say yes. A relationship is something that lasts, while a nightmare is just one day. The thing is, if you say no to  a girl, she will probably take it personally. My say-say yes, and live through the nightmare. :-) Good luck!|`|JA9uqxWwaa	i think that you should tell them u cant come because you dont like that movie and then maybe they will suggest a diff movie so u will come i know i would change movies so that the girl would go with me.|`|9bUFRCkiaa	just tell her that you are horrified because of the movie. She will then understand you. Through it, she can tell that you are open and not fake about things. Its always a good impression to be honest.|`|A7WMv1a8aa	yes scary movie is fun cause every time she scream she hugs me and i love it. lol
a1baa0f47b79c3d0b03122037bb673a8aa	You'll probably start likign girls again, unless youre starting to like guys. Then there may be no turning back.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	is it normal for girls to stop liking guys fore a period of time   why not?|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I'd go mad if I always had a crush.  Sheesh!  Thank god for rest periods.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I hope so =?|`|b3yKxCQxaa	yeah (i think) as long as you are still attracted to them, it is normal to just care about other things for awhile, it should pass.
el8XHxBpaa	Well as a guy, I would say If you are interested then show him and this seems to have been going on for a little while now. If i know you look at me and I am interested in you. A smile directly at someone lets them know you are happy to see them. Maybe also try to exchange a little bit of talking. I learned the hard why by being shy and never talking to girls. The best thing to do is say something to them.  Like when you leave just walk by and say see you tomorrow. But be aware he might be taken already and just don't wear a ring because he is working out. I would like to know how it turns out for you, i added you as a contact and have followed the gym/ guy questions you have asked|`|7xfnu8ozaa	Wow. . .    What's the harm in a simple smile?  Go for it.
HKHCuRI8aa	no just ask the person on their time frame when is to late keep mental note and bamb.|`|2gfJUgc3aa	i think anytime before 9 p.m. is okay. when you call just ask and make sure you aren't interrupting anything.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Absolutely not, unless there's a newborn in the house|`|4hJgn2e5aa	at night? no way but you have to know the person and his/her life maybe it is too late.|`|7fa04e30379ac33addf8d2ff7c80ac6baa	Are you 6?
R0YkIVlpaa	well i dont know if you heard that if you leave him or her and they come back it was meant to be for you. well anyways answering your question yes there was the guy i really love but shed happens and you have to try your best and let go. well this was really sad because my ex boyfriend we had a relationship of three years and we had our plans that after i finished high school we were going to get married but then one of my supposobly best friends just came out of the nowhere and they both had sex and shed so my ex best friend ended up pregnant and my ex boyfriend they just got togehter because of the baby but sometimes i look back to what happened and i realzed that i did love him but life continues and you have to go on. but i havent look back keeping my head focuses so i got over him and now continued on to another relationship but i guess my ex boyfriend just could not let go of me because sometimes he comes to my house crying asking me to forgive him but im so over him and he still cant continue his life with my ex best friend.but i have already stopped thinking about him and seriously now i dont feel anything for him i just feel sorry for him because that girl was a player.|`|zCS9KpIWaa	sadly yes ive liked this girl so much and was too late and went in the friend zone so...i went for her bff haha and she was hotter :)    Could ya help me out http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	When I moved from Texas to Florida, I had a crush on this girl. Her name was Beth. Her mom and my mom were best friends, so I saw her all the time. She had no idea I liked her. I never told her I liked her. It was devastating for me the first few days I was in Florida, but then I adjusted to extremely nice house and my smaller room and smaller back yard (The pool takes up most of the yard) and my extremely large front yard. I think about her every now and then. She doesn't cross my mind much. Especially now that's it's been five years.|`|YArN7X6caa	Im still inlove with the guy but the guy actually admitted to lovin the girl to hell and would do anything to stay in hr life and she was the one who kicked him out of her house. And its still hard to swallow is to why he would still love her after that i dont know.|`|PVfymAdgaa	me and him were together for a month....happiest month of my life....he was my first b/f, my first kiss, and my first heartbreak....our one month was our break up day i was talkin to my friend and i was like so have you talked to him since i have she said yes and then she said he said it was over...i cried for weeks....he comes around all the time since he's friends with my brother and he always talks about how he just loves his girlfriend...i hate him because he tells everyone i still like him and i'm always all over him when i'm not....i think about him every once in a while....and then i cry because we were everything i ever wanted....|`|8Q7TAi9Maa	Hey yous is definetly not the only one out there. Lets see...... my most recent thing sucked. I was going out with this guy, and we really really liked each other. Or so I thought. I found out that he was cheating on me and he was in a gang, nothing you could expect out of a little geeky guy. I really really liked him even though he was in a gang it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do. It was so unexpected and that was about a month ago and i'm still healing. Mean while he's had five girlfriends, not including the other one he had while he had me. It hurts, but you know time will heal|`|OozDUc0Yaa	well i fell in love with this gorgeous guy at first sight in school ....seriously. and i didnt even know how he felt about me. we talked but we werent close at all. the more i saw him i was blinded by him. his every movement, and his every conversation with me i kept in my heart and memory. my every dream was with him.... him confessing that he truly loved me.    then after two years of meeting him, he moved. i was torn and broken hearted. i still dont know if he feels the same as i do for him.   but its been about 2 years since hes gone. i rarely think of him though. however sumhow hes always torturing me with his perfect face in my mind from time to time. i still have feelings for him and i cant seem to get over him. i know that he will never come back but i can never let him go out of my heart.    i do miss him but i have to get over him and im working on it.=][=|`|sNQZibsMaa	I had a boyfriend about a year and a half ago...we were together for like, 2-3 months, and his friends started being jerks to me and it wasn't stopping and so we broke up. I didn't kno how sad he was until i saw him at school the next day...i noticed that sadness in his eyes, and with his body motions, i could just tell that something was wrong. We made a lot of eye contact, and just the look in his eyes made me melt and i felt terrible and soon i fell in love with him...and since my friend and him were still friends, i saw them talk a lot and she told me stories about him and it just made me like him more and more... about a month or two later, school was ending and i was hoping i'd get over him over the summer, but that didn't happen! He was soon all i could think about, and then when I did Junior Guards...so did he!! We became friendly with each other and became really good friends and I just loved talking to him and getting to know him better that I really started to love him but he had no idea how much i wanted him back...i fell desperatley in love with him and once school started again i wanted to ask him if he wanted to get back together but i shyed out...i liked him so much that i was too afraid, so afraid i wouldn't even let any of my friends ask him for me...we were still friends, we still talked at school, which didn't help my plan of getting over him, and i wanted him soooo bad!! I never felt that way about a guy before!! And then i heard that he liked someone else, and i didn't even know if that was true, and i was feeling terrible for like the next couple of weeks...i soon didn't believe the idea because he didn't act like he liked her and i didn't know if it was true so i kept telling myself that it wasn't...but then i went to my other friends house one day and we went to a neighborhood on the other side of town, and that's where he lives...and then we saw him...laughing and holding hands with another girl...and then i saw them kiss...i ran away crying and i couldn't believe it! I wanted to die!! So i had to live seeing that at school for the next couple of months and it felt terrible...i couldn't pay attention to anything, i couldn't sleep, i couldn't eat, i was in a bad mood every single day, not much could cheer me up...i practically felt suicidal. They did break up but still, he had another relationship after me and that made me feel really bad...i never thought i would get over it...especially the time that he was dating that other girl. It took me a really long time to get over it, and even though i don't think about him as much as i used to, there's still parts of me that feel like i still want him...it's good to know that i'm not the only one with those kind of problems! If something similar like this is happening to you, i'm very sorry sweetie!! Hope this helped!|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I moved to England to be with my girlfriend.  We were together about two years, and then one day she just said she didn't see future with me.  That was 9 years ago, and I've tried to keep in touch and be friends, but recently lost contact.  So I called her parents who told me she got married three years ago.  She's been lying to me for at least 5 years, and it still hurts like hell.|`|3OPdWcCpaa	yes it feels very bad. but u can get over it|`|zc82Q0KRaa	I have a pretty starfish|`|TebGjfjXaa	yes I gave him up because he got some other girl pregnant.|`|fjm1ag1uaa	No I do stop thinking about them and i hate it cause some times when someone else comes along we end up sitting there talking about me lost loves. it even hurts when you was with them and talked about you future together and they break up with you by giving you the silent treatment and a very cold shoulder.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Thats not good at all, men do that sometimes, they make a space when a pregnancy happens or miscarriage, anyway, there is still time till the end of the month, and u can do lots of things to help him get back normal to u, wear something nice something he likes and talk to him nicely and open yr heart to him and ask him why things r being like that, tell him its yr right to know why, and u need to know why!! its something out of yr hands, and its a bad thing when men use this with girls.     _K_
mFjXMy0Waa	I thought about of a sentence I heard before: If a guy wants to have sex with you,maybe he loves you or not, but if a guy doesn't want to have sex with you, he definitely does not love you.  and about the money thing,I don't want to laught at you but you really a mug!! go forward,there are thousand of decent guys much worth love than him!|`|oOR511mFaa	He is totally using you. Wtf? How can you not see that? Its different when to people are in love, like i would pay for my boyfriend, but he loves me and he would do the same with his money. But in your situation,  If anyone should be paying for everything its him! It should at least be 50/50. It sounds like you love him and he doesn't love you. How can any decent man treat a woman like that? And he definitely is using you if he is not intimate with you. You need to ditch this loser for real.     Ps. What is a mug?    Hey nobody deserves to be treated that way. Seriously. You are being very foolish and i dont mean that to be cruel to you, but you are dude.

It may be different for you, if she REALLY is staring and you aren't mistaken....then the only reason I can think of as why is b/c she likes you...I don't know her though, Good luck just the same.|`|9twWLm0Yaa	Duh she likes u|`|QiBJhGNdaa	I think she likes you and is scared to admit it!Ok you guys have a friendship most men think sex and relationship will make that better, but most wemon think about long term "what if we break up" "what if i am not what he wants"" what if what if blah blah" we over think everything and stress ourselves out! We are very complicated, usually constant starring indicates interest!If i were you i would wait till you two are alone and talk to her about it. My husband and i were friends years before we ever started dating and now we have been together 8 years, so dont worry if it is ment to be it will happen!GOOD LUCK!
FzS3aphWaa	You were supposed to see him tonight but instead you chose to go in to work rather than keep your commitment to see him.      He has chosen to meet with his friends to play basketball instead of seeing you.  He may be paying you back for choosing to go to work.  He does not get very many free evenings so is enjoying what he is doing.  He is having a good time with his friends, which he does not see very often due to his other commitments.      Why are you frustrated?  You made the original choice to not see him.  Understand why you made the choice you did and then you will be able to apologize to him and explain why going to work was more important to you|`|I0g24Jmkaa	what kind of basketball!? haha|`|y154F5bpaa	that is the title of a movie  LOVE AND BASKETBALL
NitvYFhPaa	Love is different to every person.|`|yKcZC9Dhaa	when you care about them more than yourself, and when you are sad, they are the only one you want there, and when just lying with them makes you smile. and you never get sick of eachother, their opinon matters to you. and most importantly, they feel the same way about you.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	There's always a lot of doubt for a long time, but if we're still together after a year or two, and we still feel the same, it's probably love.|`|VT7T4m8Saa	naw man.
BL4OBp0eaa	being seduced.|`|UwrVK72aaa	Guys actually feel really put on the spot when it comes to valentines day. Typically they are worried that you are going to put so much into it and you will be disappoointed when they don't return the same thing.  I would try and make it as laid back as possible. But romantic in your own way. Maybe rent a cheesy movie and order some carry-out.  I wouldn't get them any presents. At most get them a silly card. Until you know that they truly plan on doing something for you.  Guys hate to feel stupid|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I'd just be happy if some pretty girl gave me a flower.|`|85tAhnM9aa	Pure Debauchery.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	I agree with that other person: sex.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Give him the Hershey highway.|`|FKf67HXaaa	me and my bf have been together for 3 yrs and are expecting a baby in may. im probably going to give him a sexy little dance and things like that even though im huge right now. it depends on what he likes and no matter what you do he will like it|`|R65Owmebaa	Most men hate flowers/ chocolate....make them a dinner or take them out to a nice dinner guys love a good place to eat ....and perhaps take them out to a movie they would enjoy...maybe a massage later or something .... a card .....A note expressing your love / feelings|`|qpkNrn8iaa	what r they into sports?? what ever theyre in to lke xbox get em an xbox game they have been wanting.... thats how i wuld pick a gift|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	The same thing guys like any other day...|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Cute ideas?  IDK about that.  As a guy myself, I really love me some baked goods.   Really Valentines Day is a ridiculous holiday.  But it's the thought that counts.  Just spend time with him, and somehow involve food, or something else that he likes.   It's a sure hit.|`|0dIsO2Icaa	The same thing Ive wanted for my Bday/Valentines/Xmas Day present... to be woken with a BJ....Is it just me or are all men this into sexual pleasure? Thats another question all together.|`|1Dt0dW4Eaa	I would say get together and have a threesome with each others boyfriend.|`|ouC97Jz1aa	You know its definitely what the guy likes but it has to be about you too. Do something that he will like and also you enjoy. My husband gets more pleasure out of seeing\making me happy! But then again I have a really good man, who definitely enjoys sex but is not all about it! He is not romantic at all but loves when I do little things for him.   This year, I am doing a little get together for just him and the guys...with all the trimmings, food, drinks, and hockey! A night just for him! But not on valentines day of course :)  Good Luck|`|q0rUl3ckaa	********!|`|gaihXB5Iaa	Seeing you in a new sexy teddy and sex after wards..    That is all a guy could hope for on Valentines Day.|`|l4vTrHHyaa	do a cos play on that day maybe wear something like a jap school girl and be his slave in bed, i would like that
GGC9iXstaa	Lol it means for a person to give another person oral sex. Fun! :D|`|eZQ22qHFaa	it means to have sex|`|R0YkIVlpaa	well it means that if you want to have oral sex...|`|6c6785164ea96d97863d16bfbe2becb1aa	oral sex|`|Jk9jPNeLaa	you silly, silly people. it just means to jump off a building and land on the person!|`|xq6dnRuhaa	LOL what dave s wrote made me laugh hard!!  Oh well, I guess it is about time that you have a conversation about sex in general with mom and dad or 1 of them. Ask them what oral sex is. It is their duty to tell you these things rather than you hearing it or reading it from other people that won't be as sensitive when talking about this because you are unrelated to them. So, yes they won't be able to tell you this term you ask here in particular because it is made up, but everything sex related (i.e. oral sex) they should talk to you about that, even more if you ask them. Such a question itself is a sign that you are growing and you are not a child anymore so ask if you are curious to someone who is an adult and 100% trustworthy (parents of course!).|`|qYQc8jeDaa	tie his shoes lol
qFtql4Xfaa	I remember a year ago I was caught up in the same situation as you. Sex is very meaningful and intimate, and its sad when it isn't. Mine of course went horribly wrong and he had sex with another woman. So I ended it immediately. Im not saying yours will end sadly, though friends with benefits doesnt always end as you want it to. I just hope if you see signs of him moving away, that you keep your distance so your not too hurt if it does end.  I hope he sees that you could be a perfect girlfriend, and doesnt lose his chance with you.|`|3YfovHtoaa	r u sure he is not manipulating u? think twice before u do anythin..|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	this guy is very confusing and you need to break free of him. he is sending you mixed signals. first he says you two shouldnt do anything sexual and on the other hand he says it's okay? that is ridiculous!|`|bG8mEUHhaa	leave dat *****. u dnt need him. he jus using u. he has no respect for you leave him. u can do better. oooooo n u r dumb for letting ur self get stuck in dat situation|`|O0jUUkTCaa	hes using u  get as far away as possible|`|iKJycf6Zaa	He is just using you for his benefits. And you are waiting for him to feel something for you.|`|xwcpfSEdaa	prolly just saying those stuff to keep you around|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	I'll go ahead and let you in on a little guy secret right here.  Frankly, guys will tell you exactly what you want to hear, deffffff if there is sex involved.  He is just using you 110%.  Don't think much of it, and don't beat yourself up over it, just don't give him anymore and he'll regret it later.|`|mNDimov6aa	uhhhhh hes just using ur vagina sorry girl|`|9ZtXU9Nuaa	back off  this guy sounds like a jerk
AA11909552	This doesn't sound right. I'm guy and don't really know, but I think you should consider going to a gynecologist and get a check uP. These symptoms do not sound very healthy.
I0EpYn8Faa	i wouldnt say ur the rebound..but more of a homewrecker.  -but if hes gonna go flirt with some other girl while he has a gf; hes probably gonna do tht to u if he even asks u out.|`|hN08l7tLaa	no ur not the rebound, but the spare.

esbs4tPSaa	Wow.. that sux. Well, maybe your bf was going through a small crisis in his life and he needed some time to think and re-plan somethings, but then you guys broke up and he still has feeling for you of course.    Plus he saved the e-mail and also you felt like it was the worst breakup since you really do care about him. I don't think you should move on just yet since you two can have another go at the relationship thing.    Send an e-mail to me if you have anymore questions I will respond as soon as I can, good luck to ya.|`|n3n4ze4Daa	well ur confused!!!!|`|OK3WueETaa	hmm|`|74AyoIk0aa	just don't get your hopes up.I would let him come in contact with you.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	thats a hard one...give it alil time..but hes acting like a child....he better grow up....or else you should leave it be....    it sux when the communication goes...thats what keeps ppl together..  so yea|`|tLNb8L8Vaa	well does he usually get drunk? if so then no. you dont want it to happen again... if he doesnt then i think you should work it out. and dont go through his emails he needs space... also my friend went through something like this heres the story,    so her mom dad uncle and aunt live together. Her mom got drunk one day and kissed the uncle. so they are living seperatly but not divorsed      i dont think you should do that. talk to your parents and his parents if you really do love "rick"
3F6brF2xaa	hehehe no not for me. i wana big man i mean chubby hehehe so he can easily carry me or throught me out...... mwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah|`|9GDBpl8Faa	But some girls like a guy with a nice personality. Just try to be yourself and you'll find a girl who likes you for what you are on the inside, not what you look like on the outside.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	No they also like rich guys with big d!cks|`|jfEOIeSIaa	YES>I LOVE THEM. and if that girl doesn't like it there are plenty of prople who do.|`|esbs4tPSaa	Well do not freight my good man! Most girls like guys for their personality and being super muscular or having less then 5 percent body fat doesn't mean more girls will like you.    So, yeah don't worry and keep doing what you are doing at the gym :)|`|Qa0s3HAeaa	No! At my school, the muscular guys are the guys with no girls -jerks. Personally, I like nerds (well smart cute guys which at my school are the nerds) who are smart, funny, cute and friendly. Just be yourself and everything will work out for the better! Good luck!|`|rw1rvYIFaa	no they like muture and sweet guys|`|ciQjwtTcaa	They dont ... you just have to find that one girl who is compatible with you.  this is coming from a skinny guy. =]|`|9z5NASypaa	errr i dont like guys to be too muscular, I like a soccer players body, slender with really nice muscly legs mmmm like david beckham you know.

Happy mediums are fine, as well as thin. I think personality is the winner in this situation. Just be confident in yourself and you should have nothing to worry about. So, no, I do not only like muscular guys.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Dont believe the media when you see girls all around muscular guys/models. I would love to be with a guy who is talented in a subject and funny. And DONT ever believe that your girl deserves better than you! Low self-esteem right there!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIFAoRU1v...    Best of luck!!:)|`|I0EpYn8Faa	thts not true. i dont x] i kinda see muscles to be..a bit unattractive? bumps &dents in ur body...ew xD but then again; extra flab is not so hawt either.   its nice to be toned &fit but dont over do it. &i believe that personality overcomes looks. so just show her waht i nice guy you are &i bet she wont mind(=|`|AA10653329	....|`|J14tPA9Eaa	from my experience they like moderately muscular|`|duLdw1csaa	No we don't only like muscular guys, confidence is sexy too!|`|xLPNpHLRaa	sux 4 u fat boi    hehee|`|rKsgGHKkaa	lyk my dad always say....different strokes for different folks.  there r girls who lyk there guys to have more meat.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	If you are a little big its not that bad at all. I have dated a guy a bit big.    And if you feel that you want to lose weight, then do it. After you lose the weight you'll be muscular too.    Plus, if the girl actually likes you, she most likely wont care if you have a bit of fat on you.|`|Fe5i7UCxaa	Relax ur fine and it's great that u work out. It sounds strange but i'm actually attracted to fat guys, way fatter than how u describe urself. I know, it's weird but i can't do anything about it and u'll be surprised how many other girls r like me :P|`|dOkNRJCJaa	Of corse not. I mosly like a guy thats smart, funny, and good at sports, but they dont have to be all musculer|`|MsSHhX8zaa	NOOOOO! Some girls are shallow and will only consider guys that fit the "perfect" image that they want. Other girls look to other things like personality as well as physical appearance. My boyfriend has a little something extra lol...but it fits him, he'd look funny skinny. It's great though because he's so nice to cuddle with, he calls himself my teddy bear =]|`|i2OERsC9aa	appearance doesen't matter to a truly deep girl!|`|PO5Q7POuaa	So believe it or not.... but not all girls base their attraction to a boy on looks =O. I know it's incredibly shocking... but us girls also do care about personality...What a shocker =O. Okay anyways, not all girls are into the macho muscular guys, every girl likes something different. Just like everyone likes different flavors of ice cream =). Don't worry too much about if this girl finds you attractive or not, if she's basing her attraction to you only on looks then she's definatley not worth your time|`|ebL3eyBYaa	dude chill just treat her like a lady. yea all girls like muscular guys just like guys like girls with a nice behind, but girls like it when you know how to treat her. jus show her that your a nice guy and thats really all a girl wants|`|108e74378ce116f1a1ab7712a41679a6aa	Truly, fit guys kind of scare me. Personally, I go for the emo ones with snakebites and black hair. Just hang out with her more and let her see the real you. As for the deserving better, I don't know how to answer that. Sorry. BTW: Good job on going to the gym and working out to try to get the girl and be the best you can be for her. If you guys start dating, show her or tell her how hard you've worked for her. That might show how much you care for her.|`|NuJako4gaa	Most girls like attractive guys, blonde, and brunette guys who are skinny, and tall im attracted to. Sorry but that is the truth and it hurts|`|TVJvbpf5aa	i am a girl and i like guys who are moderately muscular but have skinny legs.i just dont klnow why.it turns me on especially when i see them putting on skinny jeans.but thts just my opinion.but hey..relax bro.dont worry too much.if she loves you,she will accept you for the way you are.why should you think that she deserves someone better when you know you have good qualities in yourself?|`|jj92lPF0aa	I don't like muscly guys at all!!!  But I do love my boyfriend because he is funny and he has cute voice although some people don't like it, we are the opposite of each other because he likes rock or screamo whatever and i like baby songs and random songs.  He likes wearing black and red all the time, and i dress colorfully bright but then now he wears somewhat bright clothes to match me!!!  Even his shoes, lol!!!  But I don't like it when those girls look at him and want his attention for so long...hmph!!!  He listens to some of my songs now too and most funny part...he works out because he wants to make those muscley-guy-poses!!!  But to tell the truth...I don't like it...but I love him!!!    \/(^.^)\/|`|JvHelUz3aa	no! if women only went out with muscular guys there would be a huge decrease in obese people|`|YPkY7yWHaa	Some do but not all. My EX like'd weakling's and it used to make me mad but then it was over but hey. Everyone is different.|`|WJWW7NXaaa	I don't like really muscly men. Most of the women I know prefer men a bit meatier, more of him to cuddle that way.    x|`|cSjaJnUUaa	no!! okay look girls like guys that are sweet and nice. plenty of girls like funny guy, music guys, u just have to have confidence thats what a girl is really attracted to|`|kfg42Kftaa	lol you said ur funny 2 times|`|OK3WueETaa	no|`|bbb27cdfa4d31a5dc4086e1215fa4577aa	No.  My husband is skinny and he has toned arms and I think he looks better than men who are all buff.  That's just my opinion.|`|tLNb8L8Vaa	well it depends, girls like guys that are muscular,skinnyish, and funny! if you have muscels then focus on the loosing the weight part. ask her out after and it will be a new you! if your not that fat then go after her!|`|74AyoIk0aa	Every girl is different,some like muscular,some don't care,but if a person is basing looks upon their decision to date,they're obviously too mature to be dating and shouldn't be dating and that isn't the girl you want to be with.If she doesn't like you because of your body,i suggest finding a less shallow,superficial girl|`|oOuLNhOPaa	well speaking from a girl herself we do like guys in shape but its ok if ur a little fat but dont get so muscular that its kinda freakie. we like guys to be strong yet not strong like hulk or the guys you see on the exercising comercials|`|kVc0e6RZaa	It depends. It can be nice, but I also like skinny awkward guys with glasses and braces or chubby boys with big blue eyes and soft curls (NOT obese). So there are a lot of diifferent types|`|l195kTc6aa	no it's not, if you have a good personality you can get a girl, just be yourself....some girl will see the good looking side of your heart...not just your body.|`|5SJV1AFxaa	i dont like muscular guys, i dont no why    i dont find it attractive, soo u have big lumps in ur arms, so what?      my point of view :-)      and my bf isn't fat or skinny he reg, i love that, no still dont no why...    because he's warm?  maybe idk :-)|`|cujGlwKyaa	no all girls are different and I guess she doesnt like you..im sorry|`|Tj516LdGaa	it's definitely a bonus but it's the personality i'm most interested in  if you don't waddle when you walk then you are fine|`|pT2ZKo4haa	some girls do only like muscular guys but i for one do not care about how they look i care about there personality so you do not want to date anyone who only cares about how you look but about your sense of humor and your ability to draw but if you want to work out and become muscular then that is fine but do not just do it for looks|`|X2qtvu4daa	haha muscular muscles. you're cute. personally, i'm not going to lie, muscles can be hot. BUT, for girls that are a little overweight themselves, they don't want to look fat next to their boyfriend. and a lot of thin girls like a little extra too. guys aren't supposed to be skinny, and while muscles are fun to look at, a lot of buff guys tend to be conceited. so i say, go for it. as long as you're nice and maybe a little romantic, you probably have a shot. just ask her out in a really cute way.     good luck. =]|`|ebwe0Duzaa	chubby isnt bad, if thats what your saying...and no the guy doesnt have to be muscular!  my boyfriend is skin and bone, i know thats not chubby but its not muscular, though he is alot stronger than he looks...dont let anyone put you down!  your probably really cool!  if the girl doesnt like you then move on cause theres someone out there that will love you just the way you are!|`|PJyrWmdfaa	They only think that's hot but what they really want is what is in the inside. Its cliche but true. If you think the girls you are with deserve better, think again. There was a reason why they got with you in the first place and that is your personality.|`|GGC9iXstaa	When judging only by looks, my favorite body type for a guy is around the 6'0", 150-160 lbs. =P However, I can also find very muscular guys attractive.    Some girls actually prefer guys who have a little chub; it makes them feel like the guy is more comfortable to snuggle with (literally), and they like how much bigger the guy is because it makes them feel safer.|`|Vqhy1LI8aa	not all girls like muscular boys,and  stop thinking the girl deserve better than you.if she like you,she will obviously like you the way you are.Stop think that she deseve better than you because it will just reuin her impression of you,just talk to her and she were it goes from there...  everybody have their own ference on what they fin attractive,gained some confident =]|`|NitvYFhPaa	I'm a girl and I can rightly say that girls do NOT only like muscular guys. And if the girl was really right for you, she'd go for your personality and not your physical appearance.|`|qvNeo0G8aa	Ok first off dude, don't listen to ANY of the girls here. They don't know WHAT they want (I can prove this with rigourous scientific evidence, but that would take days).    ANY girl can feel attraction towards ANY guy. Period.    Ok looking good HELPS this, but it ain't the source.    The source is strong mental muscles.    To you I bequeathe this: www.realsocialdynamics.com    Go get Game.|`|VbfQyRytaa	absolutely not.  just because a guy is muscular doesn't mean he's a good guy.  girls care about personality and especially confidence.  you said that "I am very funny and talented."  thats ten thousand times better than a guy who just has muscles.    just stop thinking that your girlfriend would deserve better.  know that your a great guy. confidence is sexy (;|`|qsPyi6Mhaa	Hell to the NO!! .I think they look like meat heads!!  My boyfriend is not muscular..He is actually a little round in the belly area! hahaha. But I love it. And he is a creative genius. THAT is what is sexy.     Talent and charm go along way kiddo. Work on your confidence. You can be the fattest kid in school, but with confidence, all that doesn't matter.|`|3zg7oBA5aa	NO.    The love of my life is as skinny as skinny can get.. he has NO MUSCLE what-so-ever.    I love him because of his personality, his actions, and his kindness.|`|cmi9lKuAaa	:|    Personality is what matters the most.    Before you shape up your outer appearance make sure if she's attracted to your inner appearance.    And to answer your question..    It depends on the girl.    I don't like super muscular guys.    Some girls like very boney guys.    It's really up to the person.|`|QiBJhGNdaa	Most shallow girls just like muscles.Mature wemon like men with a personality and men who are ready to commit! Do not think she deserves better than you! Looks are important to most people dont get me wrong but what is inside matters way more!|`|ArjXzdL6aa	Nooooo, muscles aren't everything, but i'm not going to lie to your there are alot of girls that prefer the six pack.....then there are those girls that are looking for a guy that is honest because honest guys are an endangered species, and funny guys that treat them with respect not every girl is the same thats what you have to realize different girls have different taste but i will tell u now girls dnt just like muscular guys becuz if they did there would be alot of single men in the world...dnt u agree?|`|ebF8NjVraa	Well I can relate to your answer. My boyfriend is muscular in the arms, legs and back but not so much in his stomach area. Some girls fancy guys who show just abs and want to have the 6-pack look but truthfully a girl would have to find mister charm one to get that look. Don't feel bad if you aren't model looking, it's ok, if you are yourself than that's what girls out there like.|`|7l3gvv8Gaa	NO,  SOME GIRL'S R LOOKIN' 4/ WHAT THAT CAN'T GET OF U, MAYBE IT'S TRUE? SOME GIRL R REAL LOOKIN' 4/  FINE SOME ONE TO LOVE THEM 4/ THEM & SOME WAY ABOUT GUY'S TO, IT GO'S BOTH WAY'S....|`|ub47AiuVaa	Oh heck no.. I lean toward kinda bigger guys, like a lil chubby, but the guy i am engaged to is so skronny.. lloll I could break him. But my first love was REALLY deep love, and he was chubby, but I loveh him so much, he was perfect to me.he still is, I never thought that saying you'll never stop loving your first love was true but it is..|`|O5LItEFRaa	if the girl was good enough, she wouldn't mind that your were a little fat. and girls don't always like fit and muscular boys, but it is more of a turn on [: sometimes we like our men with a little pudge though hah :D|`|CCNVti7eaa	no ofcourse not!! i have dated many hot muscular guys but they all have broke mmy heart! so now i dont care for apperances! i think the most important qualities about a guy is for them to them loyal and not a player! and have true feelings!! u should talk to that girl like! give it a chance!!
AA11909552	The absolute best thing you could do is to forget about him. That might be tough to do, but it can be done. I suggest you focus your attention to something else. Or someone else. This has happened to me countless times and it is always a drag. The best thing to do is find someone else to like and get him before someone else does. Do not hesitate. Those who hesitate always finish last.  But if you really-really want this guy, you could swipe him out from under her. But that is another question for another answer.
BZg5TFlqaa	yes and its is me :) ill let u have him after im done with him.|`|lWobDwmnaa	i don't think so but you know you won't get a chance ahah|`|UMX7yy5Zaa	yes its this violin artist named toykio masi,she really pretty,and they have every thing in common.
1RWYzZeFaa	It would be better if you ask him and tell him that that you do trust him.   But if he keeps staring at you or looks at you that means he wants you back.|`|naequcqlaa	In all honesty, it wouldn't surprise me if he just did what he said.  In time he may chg, his mind, but I don't think it w/be for awhile.  Just let things cool down for awhile & see what he does.  He's making all the calls at the moment,  He's liable to chge, in time...Best to you...:)|`|g3otccOLaa	Well you told him you had trouble believing him..  That sounds like you have a hard time trusting him then.  & if that`s the way you feel,why are you wasting your time with him.?  
HPqCRBq8aa	Don't ever let anyone disrespect you like that again. Especially in front of your girl. You should have came over and stated that this is yours and he better curb his behavior. If it has to go to blows, then so be it. Your girl will think worse of you if you do nothing, than fighting to protect her honor. I had to knock out my best friend 1 time, because he cross that line. It hurts more when its someone you know. She could have and should have pressed charges.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	tell him that if he touches ur girl again u will be forced to beat the crap out of him. and if he does it again do it. a girl needs to know that she is safe with her man.so make her proud.|`|igkbUflbaa	You should of asked him to leave. Its much more civilized than kicking his ***, and much less messy.|`|PXimiZCdaa	Dont put up with that, no guy has the right to do that, even as a joke. talk to him, and if he still does it, knock his lights out.|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	I would have left (with my girl).  It doesn't sound like the two of you were having much fun.  And you need to drop this so-called "friend" like a bad habit...|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Your "friend" is a jerk and your girlfriend did all the right things. You tell him that the next time he goes near your girlfriend you will beat the crap out of him. Your girlfriend can kick him in the ba s if he tries anything again.|`|8dbfb63772d364bd83640bbe06e40607aa	talk to this friend of yours.  if your friend continues with this BS then dont call him your friend.|`|6GEEwjwzaa	make him go kidless a.k.a. kick his bal*s off|`|C44Ux50paa	you should have kicked his ***! trying to take off her bikini? thats a real violation of her!|`|sIS9ufwuaa	u should hve effing nialed him in the as@|`|z8XxA8gGaa	I would tell your friend that he was out of line, and that your girlfriend did nothing/send signs that she wanted the guests at the party to take off her bikini. And if he gets an attitude when you talk to him, kick his ***, and maybe then he'll get the message.
PMb7Db8Raa	Age definitely matters, just from my own experiences. Secondly, that's illegal.
8oRGz4Anaa	Dress really nice and look good for him. Drop little hints that you like him, but don't seem too clingy and into him. Don't talk to your enemy because then she will think you are just trying to get with him because you want to make her mad. Smile at him and flirt with him and pay no attention to his girlfriend, don't even talk to him about her.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	well, you cant just steal him away. Imagine if your "enemy" did that to your bf! sucks right!?     Anyways, just act like you arent jealous of that girl when your around him or her. They cant be together forever, right? they'll have to breakup one day, sooner or later. So dont be upset and think that you cant have him, when its possible you can.     Flirt when your with him, but dont over do it. See what qualities that girl has, and find out why he likes her so much. imitate a little, and see where it goes. the next thing you know, he's fallen for you!|`|0hyytT8Eaa	well all is fair in love and war. talk to him, flirt with him.|`|ArjXzdL6aa	Well you can flirt and make a move but u must be prepared to battle this girl for him you must do whatever it takes because this girl might not let him go so easily.
8RKf9vjRaa	you can put a box of chocolates, or a valentine's day card something like that. :)
8juUgSK2aa	Just be honest with him and ask him out. This is the 21st century after all. not everything should be left up to girly hints and clues which most of us guys are not even 'evolved' to decipher. Be honest. I can't tell you how flattered I'd be if a girl moved a mountain to be with me, even if I had to turn her down in the end.     Sure you may get rejected, sure he may be scared by your advance, but that's his problem not yours. Guys who freak out when women make the first move are losers anyways.    You have nothing to lose except him (to another girl) if you don't step up and be adult about it.    Go for what you want in life girl!    Good luck|`|et39TGIsaa	Not at all.    Just be up front and direct about it.  Start off with something like, "You know, I really like you.  What do you think about me?"    If he says he likes you back, then go ahead and ask him out!|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	definatly    i 100% recomend u to tell him, after all, whats the worst could happen    if u do feel insecure about telling him in person then have one of your friends tell him if it makes you feel better    better to get it out there and see if he reacts positivly|`|frzYOfC2aa	yes...dududer|`|xP5Kw9Eyaa	just flash him and see if he likes the goods|`|4UuiDJ7Laa	do it valentines coming up and all u can use that day to show ur effections to him if thats to late jsut tell him straight up|`|nN9y3BtTaa	yes if hes shy he wont be very mean about it if he rejects you|`|v2ngNP0Caa	if thats how you feel i would tell him for sure!   but me, i would be to scared  i admire you =]|`|eagNE2Cjaa	Just say, " well i like you so do you like me cuz if not id like to move on"|`|oa5Xfs4Xaa	Tell him, it's the best way. You have no way of knowing unless you confront him, if he's shy. If he doesn't, move on. If he does, great! But as long as you tell him, you'll know the answer.    Good luck.|`|8ntmY1qsaa	If he is shy around u.. that means he cares about u..    hay.. is he too shy..    that is a issue..    well do go ahed.. normaly if he is single he will never say no..    trust me on this.. truth of boys.. i have seen it..    b on ur love gaurd.. shure u love him.. good luck.. 6|`|gptsLYNRaa	Well if you don't want to beat around the bush, ask him..|`|wDgNaedzaa	Your last line says it all. Just ask him.|`|i22lvJYsaa	GO FOR IT.  :]    It really is the best way; and he just might like you back.|`|Gsq05hXCaa	Ask him. The worst he could say is no. You won't be physically wounded for life. You'll just be a little sad for a while, but it goes away. I love how I give this advice to people but I cnt even use it on myself, because I don;t like anyone. I really want to like someone tho, but idk who|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	yeah just do it, the worst he can say is that he doesnt like you back.
RuJhWnS5aa	You don't need us to give you an answer, because you already know.      Just ask her out already!|`|xQGkWlSKaa	She has already given you all of the signs that she likes you. You need to ask her to be your girlfriend because most girls are to shy and feel like it is the guy's job to do the asking. Don't worry, if what you wrote is true, she won't say no.|`|M9YcTtZPaa	Dude, everything you just said in your description is the only sign you need. Look at it this way... Why do you keep staring at her? Because you have feelings for her... So why do you think she stares at you and turns red? It's pretty much a no brainer. Just go for it man! In my opinion ask her out before or at the prom. She'll say yes man.
TcpxenaZaa	you should find a way to talk to him at least  a little in person..  either get each other on myspace  or text or call each other  never talking or seeing each other isn't good...  so if you like him you gotta put out some effort!!  :)|`|vhv4GBTVaa	what i would suggest, is. if you have an msn email.. ask him for his, or simply give him yours, so then whenever you're not around eachother and want to get in touch you can talk and get to know eachother, and just have fun :)|`|cZiBEOrXaa	go up to him start talkin then see what he says about you.|`|TkajpZ02aa	go to the park or something or just walk.and then talk...becuz he doesn't know the real you.that's what he is trying to find
HPqCRBq8aa	His ego is hurt. Maybe even his heart. Once you are lovers it will never go back to the way it was. The best way for guys with broken hearts to deal with a person who presumably broke it, is to keep your distance. He can't do that, so he does the next best thing. Shut down when you are around.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	The deal is, he is a little pout. And pouts always have a little drama going on. It ain't you.
7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	It's difficult to convince someone not to do something that they've already decided they want to.  If you want to keep her as a girlfriend, you can point out all the possible negative consequences that would result from doing this (she gets a stalker, people disapprove of her and discriminate against her subtly, etc.).  Ultimately though, it's her life, so if you *really* want to keep her, and think it's only a phase, you can agree with it... and it's entirely possible she will decide against doing it all by herself.    However, if the two of you still can't come to an agreement, I'd suggest that you find a different girlfriend, who has similar monogamous desires.  There should be plenty to choose from...|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	just tell her you dont want her to do it.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	You sound totally p.ussy whipped.  She has no respect for you and wants some black c.ock and all you are worried about is sounding like a racist.  Grow some balls and tell that hoe this isnt acceptable in a relationship.|`|8juUgSK2aa	maybe deeping your swinging ideas. or ask for open relationships and set guidelines. It works for me as a woman. good luck. Explain your feelings honestly. maybe she will and maybe not. Next time mention that at begining of relationship. I also told my husband when we got together if he was thinking of cheating dont. I said tell me you want to sleep with another and have fun dont hide it. I promised i would do same thing|`|A2u06IS1aa	so literally, you dont want her seeing another person. Its not racist or anything its common sense. You havta say that if she did you'd have to break up with her because you wouldnt be able to stand the pain knowing that she slept with a different person.     Literally she's asking if she can cheat on you. Say no!|`|S01zIagOaa	The bigger issue is that your GF wants to experiment with another man while she's in a relationship with you. The color of this mans skin is irrelevant to you but that it is relevant to her speaks of racial issues and attitudes on her part.    As you are uncomfortable with her being with another man while in a relationship with you, then you have no choice but to tell her your feelings. If she still wants to go through with it, then dump her and move on. Stop being afraid of her leaving you because the pain and anguish you will go through by constantly letting her disrespect you will pale in comparison.|`|dKyUhbYOaa	You can't really stop someone from what they want to do if they're serious about to be brutally honest even though it's a shame...    Remember self-respect though. If you don't like it, tell her you don't like it. If she says "too bad" or something, then you might to have some rethinking to do about her.|`|T9VFEZVEaa	Dude, who's wearing the pants in this relationship?  You're being a wimp.  "... i have given her everything she has wanted..."    Apparently not.  She wants someone else.  Why?  What is she lacking with you?  If you could answer that, maybe you could satisfy her (well maybe - there psycho problems that you can't help).    Anyway, maybe she sees the "black man" as a stronger leader?  Someone who sets the pace?      If she's a psycho, dump her.  If she just wants a "real man" maybe you should take a good look in the mirror.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Been there and didn't let it happen. My ex and I had a big fight and it was over him wanting a threesome " just once " he kept saying, Well I just couldn't do it and refused simply because well morally it is wrong and also because I really loved him and didn't want to share him and I even explained this to him and he still insisted. Well needless to say that was 20 years ago and I thought I'd never get over him but in time I did. If you split up over something like this then the love was never true and you don't need the hurt. Besides if you go through with it how do you know when the two of you are making love that she is really thinking of you? Good luck to you hope this has helped some|`|c2IwvdGsaa	that's painful man. im sorry for what your going through. ask her if shes happy with you. if she says yes, tell her if your happy with me then why would you want to get with some one else? im sorry sweety but if she wants to get with a black man just because they "sexy" whats to stop her from wanting to *uck some random dude  just because  hes hot? she sounds like shes putting your heart through allot of hurt so she may not be worth it trust me if she wants this enough to break it off with you then this is WAY WAY WAY enough to break it off with her shes yours that should be enough  good luck & god bless papi|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	WTF? Is sleeping with black people considered a fetish or some kind of weird sexual act? It shouldn't matter what color the guy is, she is talking about cheating on you..to your face! wow. Maybe she already has this "experimental sexy black man" already picked out???!!! You should ask her if you could "experiment" with another woman....like one of those weird pasty pale ones with yellow hair. o__O!|`|AA11108018	If it where me I would tell her to forget doing the black or we are done.  If she want to be this stupid now leave before you marry her and she wants to do that than.  I could never again touch my g/f if she did that
l0Uh1uCeaa	have one of your friends introduce you to a girl. If you have lots of friends that have girlfriends, then all of those girlfriends should have girlfriends, and out of all of those girlfriends' girlfriends, there has to be someone that you would like to go out with, and chances are one of your friends can probably hook you two up. If not, then start talking to that girl who smiled at you. If you really think she likes you, then when approaching her, just keep in mind that she likes you, and that even if she doesn't like you this is what people do everyday, all the time, people everywhere talk to people that might not necessarily like them on the assumption that they might. But from the way you're describing it, I'd say there's a good chance she does like you. And don't worry, you're not a loser for never having kissed a girl. I kissed my first girl at fifteen, and didn't make out until sixteen. and I know plenty of guys, some of them friends of mine and sixteen, that have never had a girlfriend, let alone kissed a girl. Just look at yourself in the mirror and look at all of the great features you have. Think about how many girls you've liked that never knew you liked them. Then reverse that: how many girls like, or have liked you, without you ever knowing about them? It works both ways, buddy, believe it or not. Girls are just more apprehensive. they're waiting for you, go out there and get em'!  Hope this helps  ~Heath|`|ubj2hZWZaa	no you are normal. I use to be Ultra shy to talk to girls.

Unfortunately with media and all the other pressures of the world, people are growing up way too fast and are expecting way too much from the youth of today. Plus, once youve crossed the "kissing line" you'll rush into everything else too and wont enjoy it. Dont ever do what you dont want to do!

i6WVPncnaa	You should go for the real kiss.  She is ready, and your ready.  Try practicing kissing your hand, and if you still don't know how, you should copy what she does.  Good luck.
XAw4cJmjaa	Does she like chocolate? If so, then get her the chocolate roses. They're wrapped to look just like real red roses. That would be a cute thing to give someone that you like. It's not as personal as giving flowers, but it's still sweet enough to say "hey, I like you."|`|zKrK8zWWaa	I think that you should start by telling her how you feel about her and your fealings|`|pnpIP7vKaa	ask her out on valentines day and give he flowers and nice candy
3wa0YpYpaa	yes it is normal for you to be more nervous around the person that you like. just be yourself and keep talking. once you get the awkward first couple of times talking to him over with, the conversations should start to flow easier. and if you are at a loss of what to talk about and want to get to know him better, just ask him a bunch of questions, but don't bombard him with your questions

I know you're scared dead...but thats an inch of difference between the Whiners n the ladykillers    do it urself(EVEN IF YOU"RE SCARED)    trust me, then you have her|`|rurfFLDkaa	Hahahha you ask her yourself. Just go up to her in class and say somethin like, "so when are you gonna give me your number?". Or start a quick conversation with her before the tardy bell rings and when it does and you have to go sit in ur seat just say somethin like "Well **** you should let me hit you up sometime". That second quote is money, guaranteed you get her number with that line. Works everytime.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i agree with the second answer. if you keep asking other people to get the number for you she might get freaked out by it and think you are stalking her OR she might just think you are a pansy for not having the guts to do it yourself. if you think shes cute ask her OUT on a date. see where it goes from there or just talk to her first see where THAT goes.....getting a number takes steps you cant skip them without making some girls uncomfortable.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	just start a conversation with this girl. make her laugh and say u guys should hangout sometime if shes interested she will give u her number.|`|31fDBuLjaa	Approach the primary target politely and then (with a straight face) ask her if she thinks your close friend could get her number for you.    She'll think you're strange, but also cool and clever. Assuming you can pull it off smoothly. Which you probably can't.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	why dont u talk to her. ur the one who likes her.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Write out a simple note that has your number, email and IM address. Mention briefly that you would like to get to know her better.     That is it...she will get the hint...if she likes you she will select the method she is best at. Don't write it on a card or make it fancy. See what happens.    That way you are not depending on someone else and they can't mess it up for you. But, you don't have to be brave, either.    I prefer that you hand her the note, but popping it on her books or in her locker are possibilities...leave out the middle man plan...too many variables.    Good luck!|`|eBKWte2aaa	Asking someone else to get her number for you makes you seem like kind of a stalker.  Trust me, girls like guys who are upfront, so if you like her, go talk to her and maybe you'll get her number all on your own.|`|WJUxHXsAaa	ask 4 it|`|dMknJjY0aa	facebook it, that always works for me. Here are some other tips    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1782170 6dzz5z5...|`|dGeyvUahaa	Grow some balls and ask her yourself man! but first, get to know her better, cuz if you don't know her that well it'd be very weird to just out of the blue ask someone that doesn't know you for their number. But get to know them for a little while, play little games to get to know each other. like the question game: ask each other questions about each other that you both answer.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Punch yourself, stop being a pansy and ask her yourself!      But no seriously, you only live once dude.  Start talking to her, AT SCHOOL!   I know it's a hard thing to to but take chances, it will help build your confidence and what not.  And if she denys you, don't take it too harshly, just move on.  You don't want to grow older and wonder what could have been do you? NO, you don't!|`|78yvmiZ0aa	Your question is riddled with bad grammar and general idiocy.  I'd consider upping your masturbation level and a life of obesity.|`|bG8mEUHhaa	really asking sum one else to get a number 4 u. jus shows u hav no confident in ur self. just ask her for her number n tell why u really want it. be for real n faith in ur self. if u dnt get it den she is nt interested.|`|che6yXYNaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1780845 6dzz5z5... this will tell you how|`|EbWWII65aa	"I am," I said To no one there   And no one heard at all Not even the chair.|`|GNhnWkqLaa	if you want to get her number you should ask her yourself.  She'll like it much better if she hears it directly.  I would suggest getting to know her a little before you try getting her number though.|`|AA11611849	You should ask her yourself...girls respect that.|`|tq58kZ95aa	Go with a cheesy line. So cheesy that she laughs. it works like almost 60% of the time|`|oX9DEqTOaa	You could always ask yourself.  I don't think getting someone to get this girls number for you would impress her at all.|`|cWjrtIlKaa	Quit being baby and ask her yourself|`|0ff5fc1050fef44fd64ce153d56856dfaa	Could try it from another approach. If you have a digital camera or better yet a cell phone with a camera take her picture for whatever innocent reason. Could be just a group thing happening. Then ask how to send her the picture via email or phone.    Try being her friend first which means talking in person.|`|4fd1257f52760c8d2e834efa85d9803baa	just ask her.  you can say your nervous but just do it|`|Agad3Oc4aa	well I think you should be direct with her.  However, ask for her number with a purpose.  For example, if she likes amusement parks tell her you would love to take her to the fair that's coming or some other gig that's happening in town.  Then ask for her number so that you guys could hang out.  Girls don't usually like to turn down anything they do not have to pay for unless the guy is totally weird or a geek.|`|J2myCXE5aa	NO!    you ask for it.    worst thing she can say is no.    good luck.|`|AA11494685	I suggest you get to know her first and then if you really like her and she likes you, ask her for her number and she will be pleased that you asked her rather than getting the number from someone else where she may resent it.|`|pDyifiE4aa	First of all be a man and ask it for yourself. You don't have to just ask her straight up for it either. Start talking to her for one and see how thats going and when a good time comes by ask if you can get her number so you can chat or hangout some time. Don't use other people to do the dirty work like asking someone you like for their number. It comes with liking someone and manning up to it.     Let me guess your in High school still right?|`|Krrt4E2Maa	Well if you got her number of someone else &nd then texted her, thats gonna leave her wondering where you got it &nd then she may think there was a reason why you found her number... ;) But it's best just to get it yourself &nd be straight forward about it ^_^
rMq9D06Faa	I am not really sure but it DOES drive me crazy!!!    Maybe because the scent is soothing and also reminds us of food.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	smell vanilla everyday and you'll be nauseous|`|jVIbzqYkaa	lol maybe it makes them horny?  I have no idea :|  i geuss it's better then sweaty pits thou, everyone likes to smell good :)|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Vanilla and cinnamon are my favorites !|`|qkblT2hgaa	Guys like this smell because it reminds us of food. Have you ever been not hungry and walk past a bakery or pizza store? Try this sometime and you will see that your brain will automatically tell you that something smells good and we should eat it.|`|1tJ25HPZaa	Because, it's an aphrodisiac.-An agent that excites sexual desire.|`|OXcApjPzaa	that was vanilla?  I thought it was a pheromone.|`|FHiZ0a6Uaa	Makes them think of vanilla ice cream & we all know what they do with it . . . .
52otNiElaa	Its kind of cheap. Not classy enough.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	nothing more than american commercialism trying to bank a buck off you by telling you you'll be sexy hot if you wear their perfume/colonge|`|yKgbptfjaa	idk what that stuff is. but i'll tell ya what drives me Absolutely crazy.  I think it's called "Butterfly's" perfume one of my exe's used to where it and it would drive me wild. i cant even explain why it did, but something about it still has me smelling a hat she left very now and then. and the funny thing is, is that the smell gives you butterfly's.......or at least it used to. id try that stuff.|`|6qDoUZUAaa	Sometimes girls need to know that they just need like some bodycology stuff and a guy goes wild because your pores absorb it while you wash with it, you don't need perfume, but it helps and i like the smell if only a hint is applied  http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1785549 6dzz5z5...
5Yh8WN1Oaa	They have a surprise planned, are embarassed about who they're talking to, or they're cheating.|`|y1TDricRaa	well it is close to valentines so maybe it's a surprise. or they could be cheating on you.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	they dont want them to know who they are talking to. they feel guilty about who they are talking to.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Well there Mr. Chuck S.  You have got to remember that "Bitches be crazy".   Confronting her about it could give you the answer, but at the same time it could make you look like a total douche.   If you honestly don't trust her, I don't think she is the one man.  Kick her to the curb and take your losses and learn from them.  Never forget that there are plenty of other fish out there.|`|D6pfv64maa	the only thing that i can think of is that its from someone they shouldn't be talkin to ask them if they give u a hard time don't stand for it and leave they are prob cheatin|`|xwcpfSEdaa	it's called privacy! it doesn't necessarily mean they're trying to hide something|`|0ff5fc1050fef44fd64ce153d56856dfaa	Check their text and call history. Might not like what you find.|`|J2myCXE5aa	it could possibly be that they are cheating.
jVIbzqYkaa	That's bull, teens can be in love  Love is when you don't care, you just want to be with that person and you feel butterflies and super happy.
UCQ2yr5Vaa	What you're saying to him in guy language:    I'll drop my panties for you anytime !
Agad3Oc4aa	I think you could get her a friendship valentines card.  This will show how much you value her friendship and that you are thinking about her on valentine's day without crossing the line.  And of course her favorite flower.  But just one.  This way you don't over do it because you are not in a relationship.  If you guys get in a relationship and are together next year then you can play on this year buy buying her the whole bouquet.  Woman like thoughtful stuff like that.|`|uO8sFIuCaa	Friendship with chemistry?    Buy her a nice (but not huge) bunch of flowers that don't scream "I LOOOOVVVEEE YOOOUUUU!!!", so ditch the blood red roses, and go for something like orchids or tulips or something she likes.    I buy flowers for my friends quite a bit as do many people, so this is a gesture that doesn't seem awkward among friends.    Also get her a card to let her know you are thinking of her on that day.    If she hates flowers, go for a nice box of chocolates... from my own opinion, I could not tell you a sane woman that doesn't like chocolate!|`|DZh2F6y2aa	get her a nice card and a candle that smells/ reminds you of her|`|AA11611849	Get her something for valentine's day...but don't go too big or too small. Get her a small teddy bear or a nice card to show her that you were thinking of her and you would like to go to the next level with her. If you want to keep her as a friend...maybe treat her to coffee and talk it over with a sweet nice friendly card. But again, you don't want to scare her.|`|Uq97jrHfaa	go with the chocolates and flowers thing  girls think its adorable! trust me!  i would stay away from jewelry though...since you arent going out or anything...|`|GLQL2IEaaa	get her something simple. since it's friendship with chemistry, i'd get her a nice teddy bear (not large, medium) with a balloon and maybe some roses. something simple that says where good friends with something going on, but i don't wanna scare you away. lol.|`|UKRdbFWyaa	so you both have been friends for quite awhile right? well that means you probably know alot about her personality and what she likes or dislikes. if you're thinking about getting her something for valentines day, lots of girls love receiving a bouquet of flowers, box of chocolates, stuffed animals, or cards with sweuet poems. but if you have time on your hands, you can also get creative. write her a poem or a song on your feelings for her. maybe if you have pictures together, make a collage or buy a cute frame to put one in. hope it all works out :)|`|AA12371982	Instead of buying her something how about you invite her to your place and cook for her. If things are going well then give her a full body massage and then send her on her way, without making any major moves. She will be impressed and most likely want you more cause her mind will be intrigued.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	Jewelery...(no ROSES...) buy something simple and sweet. ( you don't need to buy much) and take her to dinner...if you've been 'discussing' then you should know what she likes.|`|eTxk4lSxaa	something inexpensive but will make her smile. I f you go the flowers option, something like daisies. If there is any sort of in joke shared between you then a little gift that reflects that. My sis & her hubby laughingly call each other "a piece of poo" after Mr hanky on South Park which they adore. One valentine's, she got a teeny gold turd keyring which she treasures.   Try not to go over ten bucks - this is one case where the thought really does count|`|ZVfxJacvaa	Mmm, that's hard. I'd just plan a long movie nihgt with snacks. Like maybe her favorite treats? Maybe get her a few flowers, not ross though. Even if you're not together together, flowers shouldn't ruin anything. Good luck. I hope I helped.|`|a9xITT0Aaa	Make The Move. :]    Get Her A Teddy Bear.  Maybe Some Roses.  Or Both! That'd Be Cute.
NEH7JWNMaa	Ask hm if he'd likt to 3 way with your cousin Sadie Hawkins.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	first of all i think it's called sadie hawkens day after a cartoon character in lil' abner comics. just ask him the way you want to be asked the other 364 days of the year|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	How about "Will you go to the dance with me". Short, simple, and too the point.|`|a9qrXBBsaa	take them around a scavanger hunt around town, leaving notes at random places, like on a movie at blockbuster, then just lead them back out to their trunk. be creative! Then while they are out and about, decorate their room or something and put up a sign asking them to the dance!|`|39bCq7ncaa	Walk up to him and ask "Can you help me with something" then lead him to the dance floor,  or just walk up to him and grab his arm and lead him|`|evCu7Ckvaa	- Does he play a sport? You can tie it into that. You can write on the ball (basketball, soccer, golf, etc) a message or spell out the message with them. It'd help if you knew the guys on his team also.    - Make cupcakes to spell out "Turn-about?" and make a cute-looking note that says "It would be such a sweet treat if you went to Turn-about with me." Or get even a cookie pie/cake and write the message on it with icing.    - Find a stuffed frog and attach a note that says "Out of all the froggies in the lake, you are the Prince I'd like to take."    - Get a plain white t-shirt and on the front write "Turn-about?" Then on the back write a bunch of girls' names (probably ones that go to your school and that he knows of) with washable marker and write yours with permanent marker. Leave the t-shirt wherever he can find it with instructions telling him to run it through the washing machine to find out who his date will be. All the other names will wash off and yours will be left for him to see.    Hope that helps and good luck =]|`|IrahyL2Qaa	just ask.....most guys will be very happy you chose them, if they say no who cares and ask another guy
UKRdbFWyaa	sometimes couples fight and tend to get into arguments quite often. theres always one or the other who will be stubborn and wont want to apologize for awhile. she is probably trying to make you chase her instead, which is why she is checking up on you on and off. she obviously still has feelings for you and didnt mean what she said about her "being done with you." i think she is probably trying to look like she wants to feel stronger and is hoping you will beg for her to get back together. yeah its frustrating for her to act like nothing has happened. but maybe she thinks that "why stay mad for a long time? its not good to hold grudges." remember its better to smile than to frown. hopefully she comes to her senses and apologizes. if you really loved her and she loves you back, you guys will talk it out. if not, life isnt over.|`|2KDvohPDaa	Tell you what dude...this one's a *****..    you know i assume you dint seem Largely heartbroken infront of her, pleaded her to come back or any of that stuff..    she wants you to do that....she wants you to be crazy for her..    My advice: You're doing a great job being okay wid the break-up, show her that you're doing great and have a great life...then she'll be sorry..    BUT...BUT DONT EVER GO BACK.....EVER|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	probably she feels alone or thinks that ull be there whenever she wants so make her miss u and want u more. dont let her see u need her as much as u do, u can tell her u still like her but shes gonna have to win u back.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	Dont respond.. move on to greener pastures. Insincerity can turn a relationship which is grounded in truth into a mockery.|`|cWjrtIlKaa	The best thing you could do is actually get over her. There are plenty of fish in the sea dude.|`|9RXS67Mmaa	Yes, it sounds like mixed signals from what you say.    Do you have time for the mind games? If you are truly okay with being apart from her, then leave it alone. She said she was done with you.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	I want this answer to be the memorial of the millionth time I have said this...."Man, bitches be crazy!".  And that's the truth man.   She's your ex for a reason, forget her.    It's that simple.  And it's only as hard as you make it, so don't make it hard, in fact, make it easy.|`|h99Mcg6taa	You acting like you're cool w/ everything might've hurt her feelings, so she tried to hurt you back by saying "I only dated you for closure, blah, blah, blah...".   She's clearly not over you.  And like many other comments have already mentioned, she wants you to go after her and make her feel wanted.|`|6qDoUZUAaa	Hey dude flirt with her man, and then she might see that you know and after a while ask her to a movie  http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1785549 6dzz5z5...|`|hj1qszQtaa	She has a serious ego problem.  She doesn't want you, but she doesn't want anyone else to have you either.  Make her suffer.  Don't give in to her crap.  Go on with your life.  You don't have to play second fiddle to anyone.|`|3bcbc8b9c682810a2f5f771d643ffef8aa	Why do you want her back? She already left you twice. She only wants you when she can't have you. I would not respond to her and move on with your life. Find someone that actually values you.|`|gVter3nkaa	people want what they cant have.. when she realized that you were okay with not being with her, she didnt like that, so she tries to keep her in your mind by sending u random messages, asking if your okay. just say ya! thanks.|`|U4eANrfKaa	what richard said
jp5lfmzTaa	Do not get carried away by the TV soap operas and the Hindi movies.    Sex is sex and love is love.    Love and sex can be interspersed also.    Do not try to hair spit. Enjoy.|`|2qADM1g5aa	okaaay....  that is a major mistake.......  i mean, u dont just love a girl or boy  u love ur frnds, and family  and that is in NO way connected to s**|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	In this generation, people use the phrase "I love you" to have sex with the companion faster. Ya, passion for someone does increase the effects of the sex.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	no just because you say you love someone means that you want to have sex  not having sex after actually saying the words would actually prove that you love the person|`|zIk639t5aa	no it is not loving means love only not sex  but it depends on person's thinking wat he/she wants|`|HoKOAN7oaa	no!! it could lead to that later in relation.if both wants it,but love can be pure too. so i love you does not mean i want to have sex with you.|`|yJHu9Mdlaa	well that depends..... if one is saying to you like in 3rd or 5th time u meet and is urging u then   he/she is generaly a TROL TROL TROLL TROLL..  but if he/she says it and then just leave it as it is and is ready to wait for your answer for ever, then may be not............    although i hv to say sex is very important part of llove life. u cant get away with it if u r in love.|`|vx0u07ljaa	It depends ............ if a person really loves you then .... it doesn't mean .. 'wana have sex' ........ however there is a possibility that he/she is saying this just to have sex.    if u love a person u would love to have sex with him/her.  But the important thing is ........whether u really understand what love is as per u.|`|G5Xf3vm5aa	no but if someone loves you, it is very likely you will have sex soon becuase you love him, he loves you. you think he the one. soon,you are having sex.
1yFKCtRgaa	Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are an extreme example. I bet a one year difference will not be quite as harsh to your mom.  If I were you, I would just hang out with him a lot and after a while your mom will kind of see that you're hanging out with him more than just friends would, and if you're officially dating him and she asks, just say yeah, we're dating.  But if your mom's the kind of mom that sets dating rules and age limits and things, then I'd just have a heart-to-heart with her. Mothers looove being came to for advice. She'll feel useful and like she's your friend, and like she can trust you to fill her in on your life. Just tell her what you're thinking, ask for her advice, tell her that you think your maturity levels match despite the age difference and you like him a lot...if she says it's off limits to date him, then just ask her if it'd be as bad to just spend time with him?|`|fMEypXDYaa	I'd go for it anyway, she will see that it isn't the same thing as what they are doing.|`|mY4m47WTaa	There is a big difference between Demi and Ashton (what, 16 years?) and you and the guy... what, 1 year at most? You mom would probably be ok with it. Even accounting for the fact that an age difference at your age is more mentally than physically (1 year in teenage years can be like 5 when you are an adult). Go for it.|`|uO8sFIuCaa	The age difference between Ashton Kutcher and Demi moore is well over ten years! He was 27 and she was 42 when they married... so 15 years!    The age difference between you and this guy is probably one year. Hardly a difference at all! If you said nothing to your mum about his age or what grade he was in, I bet she'd never be able to tell he was younger!    (I'm not suggesting lying to her about his age, but it's really that close that she wouldn't be able to tell!) and the older you get, one year age difference in partnerships seems like no time at all!    If she freaks out, tell her that it is barely a year difference. Hardly in the realm of Ashton and Demi, who coincidentally, both seem very happy!|`|XhzFcN7Kaa	here's a huge difference between those two & you & the guy you like. I think your mom would understand =]  It's only what 1 years difference   But yeah I'd tell her, if you don't shell find out from someone else & probably be mad   Good luck with the convo   =]
bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	Are you sure that's what she's trying or that's something you want to see?

2KDvohPDaa	Yep shes into You..    You lucky son of a *****...have fun|`|GLQL2IEaaa	maybe she just wants to get to know you more.    lol, honestly though, when i had a crush on a dude i did the same thing. so yeah, maybe it's a sign. but don't get to excited. it may just be a friendly approach.     talk to her and see whussup!|`|gmZLGuNtaa	it could very well be a sign...    although dont get your hopes up....    she could just feel lonely and have no one to talk to on the phone...    so she gave u her number....    but it could be a sign and it very well not be a sign....    who knows...maybe text her a friendly fwd message or something to get closer to her if you really want something with her....|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	you have her interests, now don't give up!|`|Q27cXlGbaa	well she obviously wants you to have her number. start talking to her more in class and at lunch and youll find out for sure.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yeah she could like you  why dont you get to know her better then  you can ask her if she likes you|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Don't you like your friends?|`|eTxk4lSxaa	I see it as pretty good that she took the chance and gave it to you. Reckon she wants you to call. I have never given my number without that expectation - it's not a case of you better have it, rather a way of seeing if you like them and follow up with a call sometime|`|cHBcR0Chaa	she gave you her number, clearly she wants you to have it. def start talking to her more and hell, call her|`|a9qrXBBsaa	yeah man. she digs you|`|2uXNtCUlaa	yes i think she saw your posting as an opportunity, take your chance and start talking to her more, and getting to know her. You may find out how much the two of you have in common.|`|iaVwgiL9aa	no lol. Thats srsly way to much to assume just cause she gave u her number she likes u.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	She is just replying to your bulletin. Follow your gut feeling. I think you talk to her enough to have her number. Or may be she likes you.|`|IrahyL2Qaa	it mightr and might not, go for her.....to tell you the truth even if she is your best friend in the world, when she finds out she likes you and doesnt like you back, it wont change anything between you like 99% of the time.|`|xwcpfSEdaa	well if you had it on your old phone then there is nothing to get excited about, she is just doing what you asked for    if not, then she might like you and thought of taking advantage of the situation so you'd notice her :)|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Dude, "Bitches be crazy".  That's really all I should say.   But text her man, talk to her during class, something.   Find out if she likes you.  Do you even like her?   Go for it man, take some chances, live a little.   What do you have to lose?
GCw0QZ7Saa	What comes around, goes around.  What if everything goes good, he dumps is girlfriend for you, and you don't loose your job, everything is dandy, but what if a new c/o comes in, and he ditches you for her? How would you feel then?|`|nMcjBv4saa	ummmm i say go for it ,see where it goes if it seems like its gonna go too far ,stop it and tell him u cant be 'that girl' so he will eather back of or dump his mrs for u so use can get to know eachother.. no one needs to know ,its ur life no one elses|`|ZZJKTV8laa	id ask him about it, just the situation with his gf and if she knows about him hanging with you. i dont mind if my bf has girls as friends but not if hes always hanging with them when im not around. i wouldnt care if your coworkers look down on you for that cause chances are they wont, but i dont think you can get fired unless you/ him is a boss? not sure on those guidelines but you HAVE to ask him about her or even talk to her because if hes sneaking around with you then that shows you cant trust him so youd be wasting your time dating him.    theres plenty of fish in the sea|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Don't be "that girl". You know it's wrong to be anything but friends with him right now, so don't cross the line. Does his girlfriend know he's taking another girl out for her birthday? I doubt it.    If and until he and his girlfriend break up, keep your boundaries.|`|0nl3zUBzaa	no no no no no no no don't do it it will all end in tears.|`|4wlwyhvnaa	Hit it and quit it! jk Go have fun if there is no other girl anymore go for it if there still is another girl just enjoy the night and don't do anything regrettable. :o)|`|Ddfff5psaa	Well there is some things you must find out about this "buddy".  First of all how serious is his intentions with you? Maybe this weekend together can help you with that.  Second, how serious is he about his girlfriend?  Ask him about it! It's all about communication.  If he is serious about her you need to ask yourself if you can just have fun with this, or not.  If not explain to him your intentions and suggest a close friendship until he can give you what YOU want!

I'm sure you'll come up w/ somethin'.  Or, you can go and meet a guy there =)|`|RNWSAItbaa	Just tell them what you said to us, just tell them you don't want to ruin all of there fun, because you will feel left out without a boyfriend.    But, it shouldn't really matter, you should still go and have fun with your friends, and anyway it's friends before guys.. so your friends should conisder your feelings aswell, and if they don't they're not that good friends, then are they?|`|D6pfv64maa	its always best to tell the truth.  but sometimes even friends can be really hard on u and rude.  this is what i would do like the day before the dance act like ur gettin sick like u don't feel good that way they don't think that its cause of the dance keep of the sick act till the night of the dance and tell them that u really can't go and they will already know that u haven't been feeling well just make sure that u are acting sick around all ur friends hope this helps normally i wouldn't help on something like this but i know how friends can be good luck|`|n1y67ZNuaa	just say u dont wanna be the third wheel,  no need to lie bout it|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Wouldn't that suck if your friends read this!?  Lol  that would really put a damper on things.  Punch your friends in the face and tell them no because you don't want to be the third wheel and look like a tard with nobody to dance with.  Plus everyone should know that you are already too damn cool for those stupid winter formals, especially the ones in Feb.|`|vpvZ6Dwcaa	...just say u don't wana go|`|0rM3oZYjaa	they will probably assume its because you don't have a boyfriend.  maybe you can ask a male friend to go who also doesnt have a date?    you can say that you're not into formals and you hate the atmosphere and prefer more artsy places|`|d8bdfs7faa	just tell them that your sick or that your family is going to a family thing or something .but i mean my opinion is that you go and have a good time and find yourself a guy lol|`|g2cYsy4Caa	Just say you dont want to go you dont have to give anyone a reason|`|xwcpfSEdaa	you got some studying to do? or you've promised to help someone with something?|`|J2myCXE5aa	no need to lie just say you don't wanna go.|`|WX2S8eUxaa	your busy, got better things to do.|`|jfndnJbqaa	Tell them the truth maybe they know someone for you to go with...but whatever you do don't lie about it....it'll always come back on you.|`|PRrqMINhaa	Say this:    "Look, guys.  I know you guys all want me to go, but I don't have a date and I don't want to spend the money."    Alternatively, you could get a date.|`|a41LFiGVaa	What Missy Said. Tell em you don't wanna go.
