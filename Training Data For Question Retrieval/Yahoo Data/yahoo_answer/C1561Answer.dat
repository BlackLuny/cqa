tXNfNTg2aa	I didn't write down the quantity of  stuff you should pack because I don't know how long you're going, but you should be just fine without the quantity! Lol!      -Snow boots(Those are a MUST)  -Snow pants(They look dorky, but you'll be warm!!)  -A thin fleece(Like North face, Columbia...)  -A BIG thick, winter jacket(To wear over your fleece jacket!)  -A hat!!!(Wool is best, but hey!)  -Mittens  -Gloves  -Sweat pants  -Jeans(It really doesn't matter, whatever you feel like wearing!)  -Sweatshirts or sweaters (MUST need this!)  -T shirts  -Long sleeve shirts  -Short shorts(They're great for PJ's, or just lodging!)  -Pajamas!  -Underwear..DUH   -A LOT of pairs of socks(You really want more socks than you want to bring!)  -Swim suit( If you are planning to swim, I am at my camp..)  -Towels  -Shampoo&Conditioner  -Soap  -Toothbrush  -Hair brush  -Sandals(Some camps have really nasty shower floors so beware!)  Optional items----  -Water(Make sure to sneak it though, most camps don't allow you to bring your own drinks, but most camp water tastes like eggs and blood so..)  -Candy(Most camp food isn't so good either..)    But yeah those are your basic needs..
xHYDNX2Paa	She doesn't need your credit card to check in.  For speedy check in service when you first walk in, she may use a debit card or any other credit card bearing her name just to prove who she is.  But this is usually only necessary when using those automated machines.  If she checks in with a customer service agent, they will not require her to use one, let alone your card.|`|AA10925759	If the ticket is in her name all she needs is her ID. It matters not who paid for it. It is as simple as that.|`|OJBZJA2Yaa	No, she does not need your credit card to check in.  She should be able to just provide her ID and name and they can look her up with that.  If she is concerned about it, she can call Continental to confirm.  I just did this myself on United and had absolutely no issues checking in.  I simply gave them my name, showed them my ID, and voila they gave me my boarding pass.  If she has the airline record locator, then she can probably use the kiosk at the airport to check-in.
IVSqQQzlaa	Firstly, in Canada it's "centres", not centers. :)    Secondly, I had no idea there were any centres of economic power in Quebec?  I guess maybe Montreal?    To fill in the blank beside southern, I assume the answer is Ontario, in particular, Toronto.|`|azypqsphaa	Iqaluit|`|XfjAwH7Haa	Ontario|`|BbzFR8eCaa	I would say Ontario|`|64IEjXOBaa	Ontario for sure. Before the economic recession Southern Ontario was the biggest manufacturing sector in Canada.

6Gfz125Paa	Oh, that's easy.  Walk to the Hollywood/Highland subway station, take the red line subway to Union Station, and then either Amtrak or Metrolink.  Get off at Anaheim.  From there you could walk to Disneyland or take the ART shuttle.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Here is my advice.    Get a Cab from your hotel to Union Station which is in Downtown Los Angeles.    From there catch the Metro Link to Anaheim.  http://www.metrolinktrains.com/    Not sure how long it is to walk to Disneyland, 5 minutes maybe.|`|S8YGWHJlaa	bus? train?|`|AA11740099	Check this out. TripAdvisor has a whole explanation on it. So, take the Red Line to Union Station first. The rest is listed on the page.    Here's the link:    http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g32655...|`|WB1UPoCIaa	It is kinda far it will take you a while especially on public transport. It takes about an hour by car probably a bit longer on a bus or whatever.|`|uwzfTIKxaa	Hours if you don't leave extremely early. Why? One word for you. Traffic. Besides, don't go to Disneyland. It's boring. Go to Knotts Berry Farm. It's close to Disneyland. It's cheaper, more fun, educational, and has better rides. Go there instead.|`|oDswBDyAaa	fly|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	You take the 5 freeway south about 50 miles
NS9yqfT6aa	Gameworks is fun.  If you are staying for more then 5 days, then the $35 all day pass is great.  If you're staying a short amount of time, I wouldn't waste a whole day at gameworks.  The pass does cover all the games and rides there, but with so much else to do, I'm sure you'll regret the day you spent just at Gameworks.  RENT A CAR!  Two weeks ago I was in vegas, I rented a midsize car for $124 and I'm only 24!  If you have a car... you can drive up to mount charleston (maybe an hour or so drive)... eat at the lodge up there or go hiking.  you could drive to red rock canyon (45min-hour), if you're into rock climbing, you should be able to have some fun.  A nice couple hour drive brings you to Hoover Dam, which is something everyone should see at one point and just down the road from that is Lake Mead.  There are places to swim and a marina where you can rent a boat/jetski and fish/waterski/scuba... whatever you feel like doing.  And if you go to the marina, make sure you buy popcorn to feed the fish.  As far as not having a car, there are plenty of other things to do.  Shopping malls-- Fashion Show, across from Wynn.  The caesars forum shops, the mall in Planet Hollywood is also very big.  And just south of the strip is an outlet mall with quite a few large name stores.  And you don't have to be limited to shopping and video games.  There are various shows that go on for underagers at the hotels, you should take a couple hours and do some searches for something that might interest you.
eD7qRBKHaa	Well, not knowing where you are already going, it's hard to tell.  Here's a link to all the menus: http://allears.net/menu/menus.htm    How about Garden Grill in Epcot or Liberty Tree Tavern in Magic Kingdom?  They both have really good food and they do a family-style, where you get big bowls of everything and you pass it around.|`|q6CWdCQGaa	Trying to please that many people may be a difficult task, especially when you do have picky eaters in your group. I am a very picky eater and I don't eat a lot of meat and my children are very picky. We were in Disney in September so I'll give you my opinions.    I would stick to buffets~ Everyone will find something they want and it's less time consuming so you can enjoy your time in the parks. These are all character dining also!    Magic Kingdom~ Crystal Palace, (We loved the breakfast in the Castle too, but it's hard to get reservations and it was very expensive)    Epcot~ Akershus Royal Banquet Hall    Animal Kingdom~ Tusker House    Hollywood Studios~ Hollywood & Vine    We ate at all of these buffets and the only one that I had a little trouble with was the Epcot one. But it's half buffet and half menu. You pick your main course from a menu of about 10 items. Then the buffet is salad with cold sandwiches and fruit with a few other items.    If you are not buffet people and you want a nice sit down dinner then I would suggest~    Animal Kingdom~ Rainforest Cafe- The menu is large and the restaurant is themed and they could accomidate a large group. You can eat here without entering Animal Kingdom also.    Hollywood~ Mama Melrose- You can't go wrong with Italian food, everyone loves pizza and pasta!    Epcot~ San Angel Inn- Mexican food!    Magic Kingdom~ Liberty tree tavern, American comfort food    You can go to allear.net and they list all the menus for all meals at each park and disney hotel. I did this because I'm very picky too. I would suggest having reservations and write down the confirmation number to keep with you, just in case of any problems! Have fun!!!|`|BbT3DCHvaa	If you are really into an exotic an animal environment I would check out the Animal Kingdom Lodge.  They have a restaurant there that has that type of style.  Also, you can walk out back afterward and see some African animals wandering.  The inside of the lodge is beautiful too.
bLahP9Ivaa	Yes there is.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	Yes there is a McDonalds in Morocco ;)|`|f1NBiKDGaa	There isn't A mcdonalds, there ARE mcdonalds and for some reason it tastes better than the ones in america, although i've stopped eating all fastfood in america lol|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	You can find  McDonald's in the larger cities.  I went to one (of a few) in Rabat.|`|bn0oXqDcaa	Duuuude, McDonalds has made its mark everywhere on earth.|`|xQikpqX3aa	Only in the large cities  you can see them by your own eyes :  http://www.flickr.com/photos/mckroes/set...|`|NWv9hOFYaa	yes. why would u want to eat at mc donalds in Morocco. Unless u plan on living there!
wcUhuNPVaa	Yes he will, Because the liberal guy is even worse than him.|`|4faS3dh8aa	I like Mike Rann, but he does seem to only pop up when the publicity is positive.    When I was little (about Year 1 or 2) he was the MP for our suburb and he came to our school and was telling us about how he had a turtle when he was growing up, it's always just stuck in my head.|`|rKUtOWp5aa	My wishful thinking...  No    I don't think he has done nearly enough for our state in order to be granted another term.    The sad thing is that people are willing enough to give him another chance and to overlook the severe lack of effort he has put into our state.    I think you've got it right, the only thing he is interested in is the media!|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Hopefully.  Don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of the Rann.  But does anyone really want Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton-Smith as Premier?  I expect Labor to win, although with a reduced majority.  Best case scenario would be that Labor win but Rann loses his seat, although that's pretty unlikely.|`|BMuzICNVaa	Not a chance in Hell.....   He's taken away peoples rights. He is clueless.   http://www.freeaustralia.net.au/|`|fe1f10099c8b001c60cc7493a5e641cbaa	I hope not. Cant stand the man. So far up himself he's nearly disappeared (I wish). Trouble is, who WILL it be.

Al4xzacyaa	Whoa Jenny you are my kind of people.  Look at my Profile, I am the Globtrotter. Yes it is worth it and has broadended my mind, gave me tollerence, took away all my biases about other ethnic groups and made me very docile towards all, however there are certain places I will not set foot in.  To prepare you must develop a geographical knowleddge of where countries, continents and ethnical populations are located.  Go to the libraries and start reading. . . .paging through National Geographics or any description of cultures and regions.  Take a world map and study it for the same above information.  Read books and watch Public Television travel programs on different locations.  Start saving money and plan your first adventure, use 'Lonely Planet' guide books which one can check out of a library.  Become a 'budget traveler' as described in 'Lonely Planet' giving you all the available options.  If you live in USA start thinking about exploring the regions of the MAYA  culture, become familiar with their ancient domain etc., later go there and see the temlples and cities they built 500AD.  later expand your travel to other regions of interest.    I personally prefer to follow ancient trade routes such as the Silk Road from China to the Medditeranian and see all the cities and ancient cultures along the way.  I have also followed the Incense and Spice route through Yemen. . .one of my most rewarding trips(1999).  Not too long ago I followed the ancient slave and salt trading routes through Mali Central Africa while following the Niger river, hiking into the hills alone with a twenty your old African guy/guide to see the Dogon culture, five day hike sleeping in villiages and eating local food. . . .however at that stage I was so prepared to face anything.  This April I am off to Botswana to see the annual flooding of the Okavango Delta and to Victoria falls and herds of thousands of animals congregating there. . .and the Cholora epidemic in Zimbabwe.  Happy trails kid, maybe one day we will run into one another.    If it is in your blood to be an adventurer, you will always look for new experiences and new horizons.|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	I took a round the world trip last year after i graduated college.  it was amazing and made me become a more independent and resourceful person. I went to Korea and Japan first, teaching English on the side to make money (which i highly recommend), then i went down to the beaches in Thailand and the Philippines, then flew to Egypt and Israel and up into Italy, France, and Ireland and back into the US.    I recommend when you take a trip like this that you save save save money and learn how to spend it wisely so you can travel longer.  Stay in hostels and make friends so you can split the bills.|`|FvmrSeqRaa	Hi! I am just about your age, and I love telling people about my experiences. To begin, I'll tell you a little bit about me. As you may know, I love to travel, and I am also Albanian. I love everything about traveling, I mean everything, it is my life (but I am still 14, haha)    I have been to: America (27 States), Mexico, Canada, England, France, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Yugoslavia, Serbia, The new Republic of Kosovo, Turkey, Australia, Tahiti, and a few that I always forget, haha.     Traveling is an amazing experience. One you will never forget. You have no clue how much it teaches you about the world, and reality. It was DEFINITELY worth it, and it's not over yet, I hope to travel EVERY country in the world, and heck, and 14, people say I'm doing pretty good so far.     There are many things you have to do to prepare.    What I usually do is recognize the area I am going to. (Is it safe, beautiful, worth the money?) You know what I mean?    I ALWAYS research the area to be prepared for the unexpected, just in case.    One more piece of advice, traveling the world is not cheap, and it is hard work to get all the money I have gotten and managed all those trips I did. So always, always, save money!     I really hoped I helped and I hope you enjoy all your future word journeys, maybe I will see you one day :)|`|1e165f3a3901f4bdf9d5be40690ba607aa	I was fifteen when I had my first out of the country (U.S.) experience. I went to Israel for three weeks on a guided tour. Everything was totally different culturally, lingusitically, archetecturally, and religiously from the U.S. Then I went to Turkey when I was 16 (and again at 17) on another tour and fell in love with the country. The food was awesome, the scenery was beautiful and the people were extremely nice. I wouldn't exchange my travel experiences for anything.     I LOVE traveling and have the traveling bug bad. To prepare for traveling, realize that you probably will experience culture shock. You will experience euphoria regarding the country at first, but after a few days or weeks you will miss home or find things that are "wrong" about the country you are in. I would suggest that when you experience your culture shock, realize what is happening, and try to find what you like about the country. Read on everything you can about the country before you visit, and buy a Lonely Planet phrasebook of the main language that you will be visiting so you can talk to the people you meet. Also, BRING A CAMERA. Period. You will want to photograph everything you see the first time you travel, and they will be the main vehicles for your memory when your trip is over. And don't forget to start a journal, start it the day before you leave, and include what you expect to experience and end it the day after you come back from your travel.      So get out there and see the world!

MCkNzrmQaa	If you come from October thru March I would definitively recomend going to Mancora for it's surfing season in northern Peru. If you rent a car I would also recomend taking off from Lima at 5:00 am because it could take more than an hour just to get out of the city.     If you take along your breakfast and only stop to get gas you should arrive at Trujillo for lunch easily (around 1:00 pm). then head north and you'll get to Mancora around 7:00 pm    In Trujillo You have 3 good surf spots:   HUANCHACO BEACH (great food and lodging)  CHICAMA (cheap lodging, the longest left in the world, but don't trust the locals it's better to hang out with people from Lima or foreigners)  POEMAPE an abandoned town 45 minutes north from Chicama, you can make it in 15 minutes on a low tide otherwise you have to go to the panamerican highway. You can take great picture shots for it breaks in front of a elevated shore    A bit further to the north you have Chiclayo, there you can surf EL FARO after that the highway goes inland thru the desert of Sechura and doesn't get to the ocean until you get to Talara just before reaching Mancora.    Places to surf around Mancora: CABO BLANCO, PANIC POINT, ORGANOS and MANCORA|`|qmpoGK5Gaa	just like unity said, watch the accidents, my bf was killed in northern peru.|`|58EydBwwaa	Mancora has great surf and is full of locals who love to party. Huanchaco has the best food though, in my opinion. Amaazing ceviche.     Oh and don't listen to Unity. I found the buses to be extremely clean and safe. Airline tickets are expensive!|`|zLoxdKcXaa	The trip from Lima to Mancora is very very long...about 18 hrs by bus...but the road (the famous Panamericana) is in good condition and the panorama is amazing, in the Noth of Per you can find some of the best place to surf...as Chicama for example, and many others, you can see all in the link below    http://www.perusurfguides.com/peru_surfi...    bye   and good surf!|`|d94a49bf6464ba3694e60140ff94dd8aaa	I would not recommend driving or taking a bus.

d19d6d11466a952bf245413b8442de9eaa	Check on this website's hotel engine http://www.easydestination.net This website has plenty on Motels listed in Hotel Engine.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	You should probably be more specific.      There is a strip of motels North of ~4000 N. Lincoln that would be fun for an adult couple to spend the night since many of them offer complimentary Adult movies and mirrors on the ceiling.  They are relatively safe, since there does seem to be a strong police presence.  The sheets and rooms are clean and they are usually nicely priced.    If your motel stay is intended for a family outing, I would strongly suggest making sure the motel you choose does not offer (or shuts off) the complimentary movies.

mQZDizMVaa	Depending on where you are in Manhattan-    You'd take a New Jersey Transit train out of Penn Station to the Secaucus Transfer, then switch to the Main/Bergen line (aka the Port Jervis Line) to the last stop - Port Jervis, NY (Otisville's the stop before Port); from there you'd have to take a cab; or there's Shortline bus that goes to Monticello; again, cab needed from Mont. to your place (Shortline looks like the shorter distance from Mont.)    Or take PATH to Hoboken from the World Trade Center, then take the Main/Bergen line (aka Port Jervis Line) as above.|`|ABwnRvfAaa	I'm fairly certain that there are no trains into Monticello or the surrounding area.

dp2Rocjraa	not particularly a better person then them , but a better person in general :) .|`|kgNkuNOJaa	Who ever forgives...is a better person and...if anyone wronged me ha has wronged himself by doing a sin.|`|vO2ZmWAcaa	No. You could be a criminal, and forgive your parents for abuse. That still wouldn't make you a good or better person. A good person has to act like it the majority of the time, and not just improve by one action.   Forgiveness is really for yourself; you don't do it, though, to feel like a "better" person.|`|UhnvXXxjaa	depends on how did they wrong me =/  Edit:  Mark: its time to grow up my dear =)|`|54pPOC5Caa	hamad banadol law nakak when you were young?

However, another who was not involved in the situation would most likely be unable to draw conclusions about your morality through hearing about that situation alone. Forgiveness is always a good thing. Rewards of any sort are a bonus.|`|WIEH455laa	No, but it might give you peace in your heart.|`|wTeJulT5aa	No, but I think forgiving is important for yourself.  You can't get past things if you cannot forgive.  You know you truly forgive someone when you can say "Thank you for giving me that experience."|`|AA12350023	yes, its more for yourself.. also depends on the situation..  A lot of answers seemed more towards the criminal minds etc..  I as a mother forgive my little ones when they do something I dont like..  Someone told me.. Always think about others actions and why they do what they do.. maybe they have had a bad day, or ill, or some other underlying reason why they are in that mood that day.. You'd be surprised.. It helps me forgive a lot easier when i step out of my own mind set/box and think about the other person.. They dont look so bad at that point or their actions might have a reason then..
yAvOmQrkaa	Yep, I-495 is the parking lot everyone says it is.     You can take East-West Highway (Route 410) to Bethesda. Bear right when it ends in Bethesda, and it will turn into Old Georgetown Road (Route 187). You can take Old Georgetown to I-270 North. That's probably your best bet using the streets.|`|1f88iwfMaa	Unfortunately, no. There is no good way to accomplish this. If there were, nobody would be sitting on the Beltway. However, your commute will be slightly better than average because you'll be going against traffic during rush hour.    All the "back roads" are slow and have multiple stoplights. If you were really in a jam (like, if the traffic report said that 495 was totally stopped), you could take Georgia Avenue to Randolph Road through Rockville to 270.|`|WbYXKmFVaa	Well there is a small shortcut, but it doesn't add up to much. You can take Route 29 to 495 which will bring you to about Exit 30 on I-495. You can also take Randolph Road to 355. The problem is that neither of these is much better then I-495. They all have stop lights every few hundred feet and are just as bad as taking I-495. If you can I would seriously consider finding a new job. If I didn't love my job so much I would have changed jobs years ago.

ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	I ran the IP address through RIPE.NET and, indeed, it does suggest Yoshkar ola. Make of it what you will but please understand that someone who is actually being honest about their location is not necessarily being honest about anything else.  To avoid being scammed, look for the following:  1. requests for money, even a little amount  2. requests for a visa to your country  3. propositions of marriage - even though you've never met face to face and don't know each other (sorry but Internet relationships are a joke)    If any of the above occur and you resist the first time, be prepared to hear more and more desperate stories. They're all attempts to get you to send money over there...money you will never see again.    These kinds of scams are old and have been circulating through the Internet since the Earth cooled. Judging by your question, you already suspect there is something wrong. You'd be very wise to trust your instincts there.|`|z4Yrn96Paa	Whether or not she writes from an Internet cafe has nothing to do with the price of tea in China.

Trace your IP address and see where it thinks you live. Personally I think you shouldn't be looking to get a woman on-line.|`|6a7c2f7356f1dbadf90f001beb576671aa	Todd,    As someone who married a Russian, let me tell you that you are not advised to trust a girl until you meet her face to face, especially from Yoshkar Ola.  I did not meet her on the internet though.  That said, don't assume she's lying for no reason or your paranoia will keep you from ever making it work.     If she wants you to come meet her, she's probably not a scammer, otherwise "she" is wasting your time and energy.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	You can only get scammed if you send money. That's your choice.|`|WT7Gub0Xaa	Firstly Todd ask yourself some questions.  Like  How did you meet her? if one of the marriage agencies, then you are very likely to be scammed, you probably already have if you paid any money to it.  if you just met her in an internet chat room, then the chances are she may well be genuine.  Have you tried talking to her on the telephone? If she is genuine she should be able to speak english reasonably and not be frightened to talk to you.if she needs a Translator then beware.  What is her cell phone number? ( I have yet to meet anyone from russia or Ukraine who does not have a mobile phone ) so sms messages can tell you answers to some questions.  has she a regular job?  Ask her to send some photos of her in her office or workplace.  There are many indicators, and there are many really nice genuine people in Russia.Unfortunately like anywhere else there are bad eggs in every basket..  Obviously if she EVER  asks for money etc , then its just a case of DOS VIDANYA !!!!!.|`|oEkxuIW9aa	Checking for an IP address, is kind of unnecessary. You chose whether or not you want to trust the woman's word. 50 miles from where she said she was from, is not a big deal. I used to live in a city called "Issaquah" but the closest major city was Seattle, Washington, USA, therefore I tell everybody I moved here from Seattle. I rarely ever went into Seattle but that is what I expect people to know. I would get many puzzled looks if I said I was from "Issaquah" Maybe she was just trying to give you an idea of where she is from. It doesn't sound like a scam just from that bit of information, only you are to judge though.

HEf129Hvaa	Sibbi is right and wrong.  It really depends on the city you are visiting and the hotel owner.  I live in Italy, and work in the hotel industry.  When I worked in Modena, you could have guests in your room but not for more than a few hours.  They had to leave an id at the reception.  If the police came by to "check things out" and saw that there was someone in the hotel (room not lobby) that was not registered, the hotel got fined.  Now, this never happened when I was there (thank God because my boss would have kicked my a.s.s), but it did happen.  I recall reading in the newspaper that a hotel got shut down for a few months because they would let people come and go, and didn't register anyone.  I live and work in Livigno now, and things here are a lot easier.  I don't ask the clients guests to leave me ids or anything.  Heck, I don't even register everyone who is staying in the hotel.  In Modena, this was impossibile to do.  So, as you can see it depends on the city.  If you don't want to risk it just have your friends leave their ids or passports at the counter.  Then when they leave, just tell them to ask for them back again.      Oh, if you go to an international calling center or internet-point/bar, they will ask you for an id or passport.  This is for the Italian anti-terrorism law.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	You should have no problems with having friends over in your hotel, they can just not stay the night.

They realize that peaceful co-existence and basic human rights for all people are the only way to achieve a lasting peace.    Also they do not want to humiliate another people in their territory.  Yet I am quite sure that they would defend their country from real enemies.  I am sure that they love their country and do not make this decision very lightly or quickly.    Please check out this link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA2PsnNGG...    This will show you that it is not just young 18 year old Israelis refusing to serve in the army in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.  This shows that some of the elite and experienced older Israeli soldiers who are in the military who also are exercising their conscience.  They are known as the refusniks    This goes to show that there are many people in Israel who have a conscience and a heart to not mistreat another people yet they still love their country and would be willing to defend it from an enemy invasion but the occupation is not leading to peace.............

They were much younger when I was in the "thick" of it during the suicide bombings from 2001-2004.  When you live through something like this everyday, you want it to end no matter how.  At the time I proabably wouldn't of cared if innocents were killed in Gaza.  But since I live the "easy" life in America now, I can take the humane road.  Their opinions are very popular now (especially after the Gaza and Lebanon debacles), and everyone wants to be popular.  They might regret their words later when they find out that they can't get a job or an education due to their unwillingness to serve.      At the beginning of this Intifada (2001), there were 6 Israeli pilots who also became objectors.  They all went to jail.
y96i0vfUaa	Dude, you'll be fine. They'll be tons of people there. No one's going to mess with you. It's not that bad anyway.|`|G2h8g2g1aa	It's okay around there.  I wouldn't have a problem walking around the main streets or anything, and after the show there should be lots of people so you'll be fine.    On a normal night though, I would have a little problem if my wife wanted to drive there alone and park on a sidestreet or something.|`|pqraAVnUaa	Uh, I used to live over there and there are a lot of weird people... but it's not THAT bad. If you're not by yourself then it should be fine.
5MNjr5Q4aa	They do predict it to rain and snow on Friday.

vgNELAQIaa	I note that OzNana said there are already parts of Australia too hot to inhabit....     Not true, or if there are... where?    I remember the highest official temperature recorded in Australia was at Marble Bar in the 1960's, and by memory, it hit 63 celcius.  I am aware that in 1989 at Old Andado Station 250 kilometres south east of Alice Springs had recorded 5 days in a row that were over 63 celcius, but it is not an official weather station. Highest was 67.  Recording those temperatures was Molly Clark who lived there alone and aged around 70 years of age at the time.    People live in both locations even during that heat and you just need to know how to survive in it.    I personally have worked in the Simpson desert at temperatures over 50 celcius back in the 1980's. Hottest I worked in was 56 before I downed tools. I used to regularly work outdoors in Alice Springs with temperatures in the mid to high 40's. As a comparison, European tourists have dropped dead within 30 minutes of stepping of a Bus at Ayers Rock in temperatures in the low 40's.    Humans just need to know how to survive in heat, both physically and engineering wise. The train line that cuts through here in the NT is laminated and joint-less. It expands across, not along so it won't buckle in extreme temperatures be they hot or cold.  In desert heat, you drink around 5 to 10 litres of water each hour, while people in cooler climates possibly would not know how quickly you can dehydrate.    I just had a look on the net and see some claim that a temperature of 69.3 was supposedly recorded in Queensland in 2003 and 70.7 in Iran in that same year.    http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/vi...    Given that, there is no part of Australia too hot to inhabit nor likely to inhabit. It's a matter of adapting.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Its been snowing in england which do you prefer ? ; )|`|zYkf4J49aa	Those temperatures are normal for the South of Australia, but only for the odd day normally.  The current run of a few days is the worst for a hundred years, so not something that they experience too often.    But, if it does get too bad for them, they can always move North to Queendland :)  But the problem here is too much water!  A lot of Queensland is flooded...    But that is Australia, you just have to find the best spot.....    The Highest temperature in my location in SE QLD is:    37.5C Highest temp in Redlands QLD This was in 2004  and the  Highest temp in United Kingdom was 385C in 2003    But we don't get Ice and snow at the other extreme :)|`|vPYcoJ0yaa	It's not so much the heat that makes parts of Australia currently uninhabitable, it is our lack of water that is the major problem. Our deserts don't have oases like you see in movies, so hot is one thing, but no water is the concern.    You will find that most of the people who died during Adelaide's current heatwave were the elderly, usually pensioners, who were reluctant to turn on air-conditioners due to the cost of running them 24 hours a day.|`|IIuafPfIaa	Not until 100-200 years time.|`|MJdUkar5aa	There are parts of Australia that are already too hot to inhabit.
pMrdTbCXaa	As said, clothes tend to be difficult if you are a large or bigger.  If you are a medium male, I wouldn't worry so much.  The Gap tends to have larger sizes, and so do many major chains.  The worst case is that you go to a big and tall shop.  The only problem I find is buying shoes.  Being a size 12 in American size (30cm in Japanese), I find it impossible to buy nice shoes.  I can only find the cheap looking ones that are "all purpose".  Outlet shops tend to be better, but not great for selection either.    Deodorant/Antiperspirant is also very hard to find, if at all.  Buy enough of your favourite to last a while.  If you like mint waxed floss, that's also hard to find, if not expensive.  Having one large one tends to be enough for me for a year.  As said, most American style toothbrushes aren't sold in Japan, and the sizes are generally much smaller.  They can sometimes look like they are for kids only.    I have also heard that oatmeal is nearly impossible to buy in Japan.  This is from a friend who had to get some sent to him.      While most items are available in Japan, don't expect the same variety, nor things that are the same as they are in America.  It is also generally more expensive.|`|ehfe97Zcaa	I've gotta be honest with you, if you can't deal with going without American things while you're in Japan then you really shouldn't be there in the first place.    I live in Japan right now and have been here for the last two years. In that two years, the ONLY things I have had sent over because I desperately needed them were new tooth brushes and tooth paste, because the brushes are tiny and soft and the paste doesn't have fluoride.     The whole point of coming here is to experience something different. It's more fun if you don't take your whole life with you, trust me.      Just a quick edit to say: I'm a big guy (think: rugby player all my life) and I can buy clothes here. I know some girls with big *ahem*... and they have managed to find bras to fit as well. The clothes issue isn't as dire as some people will have you believe.|`|3ljf1xLlaa	Jealousy, low education system, racism, sexism, barbaric american dogs, high crime rate, george bush elected two times, white nationalists.

Clothes and underwears are also sold limited sizes only(like petite sizes). There's no Victoria's Secret and/or famous American fashion brands stores.    Daily general goods like toiletries are also very Japanized and some of them are really not good for conservative Americans because of the ingredients and usage.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	High crime...250 pound women..high level of HIV..|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	Clothes above size XS...no joke, when I went to asia for 6 months, i had a horrible time buying clothes that fit my US size medium body.  also if you're a woman buy some bras before you leave because they only sell A cup lol|`|AA10318076	The only thing you need from America is Anti Perspirant deodorant because they don't sell it over here.  Other than that you can find almost everything at one store or another.  They have Costco over here so no need to panic.  Ah 2 other things they don't have.  Miracle Whip and Cool Ranch Doritos. They are hard to come by.  2 years ago I found Cool Ranch, but they stopped selling it again. Sucked.  Like I said though they have almost everything at one shop or another.  Here are some shops to check out for American products.  1.  Costco    2.  Sony Plaza  3.  Kaldi Coffee Farm  4.  Mycal supermarket.  5.

But it's banned inside buildings now and such. People still smoke in outdoor/open air cafs though, and it can drift inside. They smoke less than they used to, but it's still a big part of French culture. Especially the older people love their cigs. One of my French professors is from a Paris suburb and he smokes ALL the time even here in the US. I do find that French cigarettes don't smell as bad as American ones for some reason, no idea why. But if you are allergic to any kind of smoke, you'll have to be pretty vigilant.|`|6Af0Gv6eaa	I have been living in France for a year and a half (before and after the nationwide public smoking ban) and I have definitely noticed a decrease in the amount of smokers I run into each day.  Not everyone smokes in France, but it is more socially acceptable to do it.  I live with two French girls now and they both smoke off and on.  Voila!|`|AA11937736	According to the World Health Organization  27% of French adults smoke.    Getting any kind of factual information from a TV show isn't the best way to acquire knowledge.    NB: Smoking is not banned in all public places but only indoors. If you're one of the .01% of the population who is actually allergic to smoke (as opposed to the 50% who SAY they're allergic to smoke) then you may have a problem.

So yes, I am very serious and just hope that in some way I can give hands on assistance as well as continuing to support the material and medical aid program set up by the expat community here in Luxor.   Since Sept 2007 out contacts have managed to get much needed medical and other supplies through on a weekly basis~ no questions asked~ as you know money speaks in all languages and even overrides politics.

Etihad will fly to another state in UAE, Abu Dhabi so will will need a connection to dubai but do not land at the  international airport, instead the domectic airport called Dubai Teminal.

Or you could take a taxi or rent a car to Dubai. About 2 hours or less depending on where your final destination is.  In addition there is a Delta flight from Newark , NJ . Don't know if that one is still in service. You can buy the Emirates tickets from United.

zYkf4J49aa	Companies do employ people on working holiday visa's, but it may depend on what type of work you are looking for, and the vacancies available from employers.    An employer who wants a full time permanent person will not employ a temporary worker, unless there are no other options.    An employer who only wants someone for a short time however, will be amenable to employing people on short visa's.    The Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 417) allows you to stay in Australia for 12 months from the date you first enter the country    But only allows you to work with the "same" employer for up to six months.    With the current economic downturn, and increasing unemployment, things may not be as easy for woking holiday visa holders as they were a short time ago.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	a working holiday visa is not really designed for what you want, most people just pick up casual jobs as they travel around    you can only work for any 1 employer for 6 months then you must find another position,    but that will probably be the only visa you qualify for|`|e9555bec7535b22de2db20580ac7d03baa	The 417, "Young person's working holiday visa's" are designed for "young persons", up to the age of 30 I believe, to come to Australia and have an extended holiday whist financing them selves by short-term working. The type of work that you will get on this basis is very usually in areas such as hospitality (bar work, hotel dishwahers etc) maybe a bit of labouring, or, if you want to get an extension on your stay, rural work such as fruit picking. If you have clerical skills & experience, you could get some temp office work.   Also, why would you want to sign a year-long lease on an apartment as soon as you get here? The whole idea of these visa's if for you to come and explore the country - its not a career move. Most backpackers will cover both sides of the country and all points inbetween. Stay in backpacker hostels, or, if you find somewhere that you really want to stay a bit longer, get a 3 month short term rental.

My comment for your additional details:    I read the answer of "Nowhere Man".   imagine no disease, no death, no sufferings etc., etc.,     this planet will soon be filled with human every Sq. Ft of land land spread. then you have to stay in in standing position only as there will not be space for lying down. no space for cultivation. food for living cannot rain from heaven. all will starve.     i leave the further complications to your thinking.      so the present GOD who ever he is, is highly intellectual. only out of ignorance he says he will try God in his court and you also appreciated Nowhere Man.    Edit:    i forgot to explain why would be that ??  because, hundreds of dreams crossed my deep sleep.   the most fearful was my fall in a steep valley due to the support on which i stand given way.  the most enjoyable was my swimming in the air.    thanks for your reply.    a man with head ache will feel it is highly terrible than cold & cough and man with cold & cough will feel vice versa.     so when dieing is certain cancer or HIV or heart attack will thrust same magnitude of pain and inconvenience.    i heard  that twins, in the mothers womb live together happily. since mother will deliver one by one, the second one in the womb used to think the first one already released is died in its perception out of ignorance. similarly we may transform to something else which we feel the death!!!|`|SHnIO5kfaa	A Mermaid or an Invisible person "jus a soul" ....

Fb519XJgaa	If the Messiah is coming today who will he save the Palestinians whose lands was taken by force and living in a Refugee Camps for the last 50 years. Or the Israelis forces, which took the Palestinian, homes and land and cities?   The Messiah is fare and justice and love and peace how can he stand on the occupation side.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	there is noting more then every single Israeli leader has wanted is peace , no one wants any wars and fighting.Israel has secures her citizens and country.  Its the militant terrorists that are always the ones wanting to destroy Israel and kill all of her citizens.  Israel is not occupying any place or country, Israel belongs to the Jewish people., it has belonged to them for more then 3000 years.  Israel does not belong to any Arabs or Palestinians, Palestinian Arab nationalism is largely a post-World War I phenomenon that did not become a significant political movement until after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's capture of the West Bank.|`|0e7Vv2JDaa	Because Israel had already brainwashed all its citizens by the "falsified Biblical" verse that says "from the river to the sea" Which means their thirst for the Palestinians blood won't be satisfied until they manage to occupy more and more arab lands from the Mediterranean sea to river Nile, Believe it or not?? But this is the truth that ppl in Israel talk openly about. So the answer to your question is because "such a peace loving president won't be elected in the first place if he/she would come up with the agenda of making peace with the arabs) cos again peace is not an Israeli objective, at least not before they manage to achieve their goal.|`|uyfFGeMsaa	It's a complete fallacy that there would be peace if only Israel ended the occupation.  The day before the occupation started, in June 1967, Arab armies massed on Israel's borders and Nasser declared his intention to massacre the Jews.  What was the problem then?  Not the occupation.  The problem was Israel's existence, which the Arabs tried to end since the moment of its birth.  And even before that, Arabs attacked Jews as early as 1920, when they started settling on land that they bought from Arabs (sometimes the same ones that sold it to them).    "Itbah al-Yahud" (slaughter the Jews) has been a favorite chant of Arabs for ages.  If they owned up to it and accepted responsibility for its contribution to the conflict, that would be a huge step towards peace.  I'm not holding my breath.  Middle East cultures are not known for introspection.  It's more a matter of grievance accumulation as a way of shifting the blame for one's failures to someone else.  And who else to blame but the Jews?    Anyway that's why the Israelis are well advised to elect someone who knows how to use the military when necessary.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	If the Arabs would stop electing terrorist groups for a government Israel wouldn't need to have military leaders in their government.     Israel is not occupying Arab land, Arabs are occupying Israeli land. They need to go back to their Arab countries and leave Israel alone.     This whole concept of "give the Arabs everything they demand" got old centuries ago. The Arabs need to grow up and get with the program. They have no need or right to hold the entire Middle East. They have no right to the Holy Land of other people and they especially have no right to rule over people who do not want to be ruled over. They kicked them all out of Arab countries, and they can't have Israel.     End of story!|`|YSK2PbAEaa	Do you really think it is possible to make peace with Islamist terrorists?  It would be a gross understatment to say that they are anti-Semites par excellence.    "Jews are the enemies of Allah," and therefore by definition are the enemies of all Muslims. This opinion is expressed by Dr. Walid Al-Rashudi, head of the Department of Islamic Studies at Saud University in Saudi Arabia, in a speech broadcast earlier tis month on Hamas TV.     The religious scholar also prays for the extermination of all Jews: "Kill them one by one and don't leave even one." Hamas leaders have expressed on numerous occasions the belief that all Jews should be exterminated.     What is needed is unconditional surrender by these terrorists.      .|`|1b47d266c534a22e56fed1ec2c0bf117aa	If Israel elect a peaceful and  loving non military man who knows nothing of war, Israel will be no more.|`|OBn0eZikaa	Because when you are surrounded by hostile countries that want you gone, you either learn to fight and teach your kids how to fight or you die.

IMO, the best way to improve oral skills in any language is by listening to the audio of the particular language, be it tv, radio, audiobooks, podcasts and a workbook accompanied by a dictionary. remembering terms is made easy by the means of flash cards. reading an article out loud on a daily basis can improve one's pronunciation, vocabulary and confidence. in terms of grammar, one has to familiarise the situation given, and by listening and reading more, the similarities are evident naturally.  don't be afraid to speak, when a person corrects u, be thankful and do learn from it...|`|981sC2J0aa	parents should start to teach english to their children since they are still young.  watch more english movies, listen to english songs, use english in daily conversation|`|wDAQHh9naa	watch more PCK Pte Ltd and x-movies...|`|8Oc4fBWwaa	Mix around with other races and speak english!|`|KVlRYoidaa	by having sex with foreigners who speaks English.|`|AA10139601	by speaking English at home since young
1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	In Chicago the ban has been negotiated.  Some hotels have agreed to 25% smoking according to the following site.  It also has hotel names near the bottom of the page:    http://gochicago.about.com/b/2008/01/25/...      The best way to know for sure is to call the hotel and ask.|`|LyeQnKX6aa	I live right next to IL and on occasion go to a riverboat casino there. The smoking ban is for ALL buildings. The casino, since its on a boat and in the water, is able to let patrons smoke on the outdoor decks, but I think part of that is due to the fact that they are in water and not on land.    The smoking ban in IL is terrible. If you're waiting in the drive thru of a fast food place, you can't even smoke in your car, even if you're several cars back, let alone at the pick-up window.    There may be some motels that have balconies that might be able to offer "smoking" rooms, so long as you smoke on the balcony, or they might have an outdoor "smoking area" that you'd have to leave your room to use, but the ban was state-wide and affected every business and building.     That's my understanding of it anyways.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	some of the hotels and motels has soom rooms for smokers   because the last time rented a room they asked if i wanted a smoking room or not  it just depends on the chain

1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	The Israeli Arabs have equal right with one exception, The sole legal distinction between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel is that the latter are not required to serve in the Israeli army. This is to spare Arab citizens the need to take up arms against their brethren. Nevertheless, Bedouins have served in paratroop units and other Arabs have volunteered for military duty. Compulsory military service is applied to the Druze and Circassian communities at their own request.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	There are no Palestinian men in Israel.

AH9KNpZwaa	Admire may not be the correct word...  The Japanese exhibit traits of intense idolization when it comes to white people, and western blacks.  There is a word in Japanese that best describes this "Akogare" In fact if you have not already noticed there are white or westerners on t.v. talk shows, commercials, on magazines etc.  Many would say this is merely a reflection of pop culture...but this is not the case with the Japanese.  Japanese mix English in their songs and in their expressions and daily language...in short the Japanese exhibit characteristics of a society that has been colonized.  I am not saying that the U.S. or west or white people colonized them...but it is the best way to describe the way the Japanese idolize white people or western blacks.  In fact you may get really lucky in Japan because there is now a pervasive shift in the Japanese sexual preference.  White and Black are sexually desired while Asians are less.  This is evidenced by the many eye surgeries in Japan.  They cut the skin near the nose to make their eyes bigger...more round.  The same can be said for the guys.  Western women are considered more sexually desirable, and offspring of white and japanese are considered exceptionally attractive.    I am not sure if you are in Japan for recreation, or business.  But look around and take note of the western influence.    There is|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Because they are unusual stranger for Japanese.   It is natural instinct. Why do Japanese have to like srange alien?  Curiosity. 6' tall. Why not?    It is not because they are white, but because they are alien.|`|VyJC1MNiaa	No it means they admire you from head to toe. LOL. most japanese people have seen American movies, so anytime they see a white person, they think of them as a Hollywood movie star. ok...so maybe now "always", but mostly. Basically, they like you. =)|`|OTnSwNwZaa	People stare at what stands out. I'm Black and I got stares from some people too. Sometimes it means that people hate you, sometimes they admire you, and most of the time it's sheer curiosity.    They do admire whites and hate Blacks, actually (generally speaking, of course).    Snowman makes some good points, but:  1) They don't all worship "westerners"  2) Japanese do not like Black People at all.|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	its just curiosity, for the most part.  white people stand out in a crowd of hundreds of asians so it mostly just them being interested in something different. however occasionally you will get some older folks who are hostile to foreigners.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	It's just not "white people". It will be anyone not Japanese. Japan is still about 98% Japanese. It's just curiosity...Some will like you, some might not. Just be polite and show respect to strangers.|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	You seem to have answered your own question. I would say definitely the height was the attraction.And then the fact you are clearly not Japanese. Many Japanese like to try and talk to English speaking people, and they are generally friendly.    As in any place..anyone that looks different in some way attracts attention.|`|AA10318076	I've been living here 8 and half years and I'm still not sure of the reason, but I think it's because we stand out.  It's like if we were back in America and a dude with pink hair and mini skirt on walked by.  We would stare too.  The Japanese people are just not used to white people yet because we only make up about 1 or 2% of the population over here.  So they stare.  I don't think they mean anything by it, but they just can't help it.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	It means that you're not Japanese (and most people in Japan ARE Japanese). Any further anaylsis will depend on other factors (who they are, what you are doing, what they are doing, situation, what kind of stare, etc.) Not every stare is the same stare.|`|7K3RcnNcaa	I would think that Japanese people are quite used to western people by now.  Likely it's your height that is causing the stares.  Let's face it--we'd stare at someone 7 ft tall!    Do you have a tattoo?  Only gangsters in Japan have them.      Do you dress differently from Japanese people?  Many people dress very conservatively compared to us.|`|XhAHdUaVaa	Try the fact they grew up in a place where everyone is the same and then you came along and you're different.    You don't have black hair, you don't have almond eyes, you are nothing like a Japanese.  So, they just look at you.      Think of when you were a kid and you first saw an Asian, you looked hard at them, too.    Height has nothing to do with it, a lot of Japanese guys are over 6 feet now|`|3ljf1xLlaa	White people get stared at in a lot of asian countries. It is because they are used to seeing Japanese only and white people look different to them. However, white people enjoy a imaginary la la land when they are there. They don't respect cultures, and act like animals. They create chaos. Same goes for any type of foreigner.|`|IAF53pG9aa	1. Because you aren't Japanese  2. No, they have nothing against you  3. Yes, it's curiosity  4. No, there are Japanese men who are six feet tall    It depends on where in Japan you go, if you go to Ginza, Harajuku, or any other tourist spots, then it's unlikely that people would give you a second look.  But if you visit the countryside, then it's only natural that you would get stared at because you are obviously a foreigner.  I visited a small town in the Midwest in the US, and I got plenty of stares and I am Asian American.|`|AA11465253	It's simple, it because a lot of people have no manners.   I have asked Japanese people if staring is rude, and apparently it is, so the only explanation is that a lot of them are rude.    I like staring back at them until they look away in embarrassment.|`|KvOByW8naa	Your height may have something to do with it, but i think it's more that your White, and speak english that makes them admire you.    There isn't a lot of variation of the citizens there besides tourists, so yeah your like a model over there.|`|suPEpuItaa	Your height has something to do with it.  Hell, I'm 5'2-3/4" (not that I'm picky about it or anything)  and I might stare at you too.  :)|`|avqAowHkaa	Not sure about Japan but in Hong Kong they often belittle foreigners..

f55f047934182c2d6e633d01e2bbbe1daa	Can I Bring Liquor On Board?      A liquor and beverage consumption policy was created in order for Carnival to be able to control the liquor consumption of minors and the quantities consumed that lead to the disruptive behavior of others on board.    Liquor and Beverage Policy    Bringing Alcohol On Board - Embarkation    Guests are prohibited from bringing alcoholic beverages onboard. However, guests 21 years of age and older only may bring one bottle (750ml) of wine or champagne, per person, on board only during embarkation at the beginning of the cruise. A $10 corkage fee per bottle will be charged should you wish to consume this wine in the main dining room; $14 corkage fee per bottle in the Supper Club. Guests may bring a small quantity of non-alcoholic beverages. All prohibited alcohol, additional quantities of wine/champagne or excessive quantities of non-alcoholic beverages will be confiscated and discarded without compensation.    Large cooler restrictions:    Carnival Cruise Lines does not allow guests to bring large coolers on board its ships. However for purposes of housing small, personal-sized coolers no larger than 12 x 12 x 12 for the purpose of housing small quantities of non-alcoholic beverages and/or medications are permitted as carry-on luggage. Screening and movement of large coolers through embarkation is an impediment to the boarding and security screening process. Therefore, large coolers are not permitted as carry-on or checked luggage.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	Don't use the giant Listerine bottle - for one thing, your alcohol will taste like mint, for another thing, the cruise lines are onto this because how much mouthwash do you really need for a 7 day cruise?    Go online and get these things called rumrunners.  They're totally plastic collapsible flasks that are not easily detected.  Often, it's the metal cap that gives away alcohol on the x-ray machine.  I used 3 rum runners last year on Norwegian (which is a really strict line) and no problems.     If you wear cargo pants or something with big pockets when you're getting on the ship, just shove them in your pockets.  They don't set off the metal detector, and they don't pat you down or search your pockets - just make sure you don't have an obvious bulge.    If you like beer, get a 12 pack of Coke or whatever, open it by lifting the end flaps and take out all the coke cans.  Put in beer cans, except for the two cans you can see through the hole in the top - put 2 coke cans there.  Glue the flaps closed, slap a cabin sticker on it and hand it over to the porters.|`|zvUV8sfwaa	A lot of cruiselines actually allow you to take a small quantity of alcohol on board without any problem.  For instance, you may be able to bring wine on board for consumption in your room.  If you are going to bring the wine to the dining room, you would have to pay a corkage fee.  You should check with Carnival to find out whether it is actually allowed and then you wouldn't have to worry about being caught.|`|1yqucDzaaa	You are not allowed to bring alcholic beverages on board the ship- they want to make sure you have to purchase it from the ship. It is possible to sneak it on board. My dad actually snuck about 10 beers on his cruise in his suitcase- but I wouldn't recommend it! I wouldn't want to get in trouble over that.|`|w3NbWUpAaa	Yes! It is possible-- Liquor is annoyingly expensive on cruises.  NO it's not LEGAL- but that's not the question you're asking is it :)    What we did was buy the tinted gatorade sport bottles (the six pack of the little ones), poured the gatorade out, and filled them with vodka & wine, respectively.  I then put each bottle individually in a ziploc baggie, and then folded them into my clothes in my suitcase.    I will tell you that I was very paranoid-- BUT all of our bags arrived to our room, and all the bottles were where I left them :)    definitley put the bottles in baggies... you don't want to accidently get any liquor on your clothes :)    You'll be fine.. So many people do it.  I asked a similar question on here before I went on my cruise and I'm so happy I ignored all the people who told me "not" to bring it. :)|`|gXJdryRNaa	You can't, not without getting caught.  If they catch you with alcohol in your luggage they will take it from you and hold until the end of the cruise.      Alcohol is where the cruise ships make most of their on-board money.  They aren't about to start letting people bring their own on board.|`|xylufS7Yaa	I doubt you can... why would u, they prob sell it on board.|`|YiYvENkhaa	you are not allowed to bring it on with you. however this never stopped me and my friends we use lsiterine bottles and shampoo bottles. never fails
Mxr6AIkiaa	By "protection" I take it you mean you want a refundable ticket. Sorry, those generally cost more - a lot more.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	If you are referring to travel insurance, it only covers specific reasons such as illness or death. It typically does not cover you if you decide that you don't want to travel or you cannot get time off from work.    The only "protection" that you can buy is to purchase a refundable ticket and that will be very expensive.    The best protection of all is to get your boss to approve the time off before you buy the ticket.|`|n9N8SFAYaa	It can be covered in most cases by your airline, you should be able to buy it for about $15 per person. When you get online to pourchace your flight. (At least w/ NWA) - (northwesr airlines)
IVSqQQzlaa	Canada for sure!  I admit that the US has a lot to offer as well and I have lots of wonderful American friends, but the high crime rate; lack of gun control (check Canadian stats for gun crime vs. US stats - mind boggling!); lack of health care; discrimination/intolerance in some areas; congestion/polution; the fact that most states commit legal murder; and because George Bush totally screwed up so much that will take years to recover from makes me think that Canada is a far better choice!|`|MIqdsUdnaa	I'm Canadian and I'd choose Canada every time, but I want to clear a couple of things up.

The other thing is, while I don't have moose running around all over my place, I do have deer, foxes, elk, coyotes, skunks, weasels, hares and an incredible assortment of birds going through my yard.

KS2OHXCRaa	While I love travelling to Italy for holidays, I haven't travel them as often as I do Paris to actually have a selection of favourite that I go to regularly. Well, at least try to go whenever I visit.    I have developped some eating strategies in Italy. People may or may not agree with how I do it, but I find they serve me very well. Afterall I only have limited number of days during the holidays and therefore limited number of meals that I can eat while I was there.    1) If a menu is translated into other languages (or horror of horror, into 3/4/5 different languages) I have only 3 words - don't eat there!     2) Dare to venture off the main streets/tourist attraction areas (while staying alert of course, of your environment - safety is important). You don't have to go far, just a couple of streets off. You'll be surprised at what you can find. One of the loveliest restaurants I've ate in in Florence was tucked in between a whole row of houses. Unfortunately I can't remember the name right now and it has been a while since I was in Florence. (I should go back and find that place again)    3) Look into the restaurants. Are there mainly foreigners eating in, or are they filled with mainly locals? If they are mainly locals and the menu they posted by the door is in Italian, with prices within your budget, I'd say, try it. Of course, this works best if you're adventurous with your food and you are ok with accidentally ordering something else from what you thought you did, and willing to try what could be unusual for foreign taste buds. (I love trying what's new and what's different, so I like exploring for new food this way)    4) Have ice cream/gelati. At any time. Regardless of the season. It's worth it. Whenever I go to Italy, I buy gelati everyday. Even in the middle of winter ;)    In Rome, the best ice cream places are San Crispino (Via della Panetteri, 42 - near Trevi fountain) and Giolitti (Via degli Uffici di Vicario, 40 - near Pantheon). I remember these because I was in and out of them so often!    5) The wonderful Italian coffee/espresso. A couple of places that any coffee lover must make a pilgrimage to in Rome are Tazza d'Oro (Via degli Orfani, 84) and Sant'Eustachio (Piazza Sant'Eustachio 82).     6) When all else fail, try to look for Brek. It's an Italian chain restaurant, and the food in general is quite good and more importantly the prices reasonable with the meal deals that they offer. They operate on self-service basis and have a wide selection of food to choose from.      Other quirks and some things to try that are local specialties in the different cities:    In general - sitting down at table will incur a cover or "bread and water" charge known as "il coperto" for every occupant at the table. That's why it's common to see people eating standing at the bar - there's no cover charge! But if you want to eat comfortably without rushing etc, well, the cover charge is only a couple of euro per person so it's not all too bad. Especially if you've been walking lots around the cities. If a service charge has been included to your bill, there is no need to leave a tip but if there is no service charge (this is separate from the cover charge) then about 10% would be appropriate.    Rome - in a huge city like this, options are plenty. It also means it gets tricky when it comes to searching for good eats. (I was eating a lot at my friend's so I didn't eat out as much either.) Some of the specialties to try include suppli di riso (fried rice croquettes stuffed with mozzarella), gnocchi alla Romana (potato dumplings), spaghetti alla Carbonara (spaghetti with bacon, eggs and Parmesan), saltimbocca alla Romana (veal with ham and sage) and carciofi alla giudia (batter-fried artichoke).    Florence - in general, the closer you are to the historic centre, the more expensive are the grubs. Try selections of cured meats, crostini (toasted bread with toppings), tortelloni (larger version of tortellini, stuffed with meat or cheese - the most unusual and delicious that I've tried was with asparagus, pear and blue cheese!), cannelloni (stuffed pasta tubes and baked covered in tomato and bechamel sauce) and bistecca alla Fiorentina (seasoned and grilled steak). If there are dishes with some wild mushrooms such as porcini, they're worth trying too.     Venice - it's not easy to find good eat nor cheap eat in Venice. Some of the specialties are risotto alle Seppie (risotto with cuttleink sauce), polenta, and Fegato alla Veneziana (calf's liver with onions). When I was in Venice I'm more inclined to eat tapas, Venetian style, known as "chicetti" at bacaro around the city. Most bacaro will not have seating so you eat standing or by the bar, and to get a selection of bite size food with wine is a very pleasurable way to eat. Moreover, the prices would be much more manageable.     I hope this is helpful. Enjoy Italy!|`|leKeIi4yaa	Make sure to order gellato, its Europe's version of ice cream and its really, really good!|`|tvWm1e4naa	mc donalds.|`|uv3JDruHaa	you are going to think i'm out of my mind but there's a great chinese restaurant off the beaten path (but not too far off) in florence. if i remember correctly, it's somewhere between the Duomo(sp) and the train station.

From Narita Airport, Tokyo to Sydney, departing Feb 23rd return :    Jetstar US$1528 but extra if you want to be fed. Less if you don't have luggage.    From Narita Airport, Tokyo to Perth, departing Feb 23rd return :    Cathay Pacific US$1550 return  Malaysian Airlines US$1591 return  Singapore Airlines US$1654 return  Qantas US$2224    Singapore Airlines is much better than Malaysian and you can get a subsidised stopover in Singapore.
47eca288b7cf9a8664fc08a02872370eaa	I'm not going to look them up, the question itself gives the answer because you'd expect a place so far north as Nome to be much colder than a place 14 miles from the Equator.    But (here's the answer):  Nome has very long days in the summer, about 22 hours in late June.  Quito has essentially 12 hours of daylight year round.    And, the bigger part:  Quito is at 9,252  feet (2850m) elevation.  Temperatures drop about 3.5F for every 1000 feet of elevation so there's a rise of 32F right there.  The temperatures down at sea level on the Equator would be 32F warmer than in Quito.
PkyeSN9daa	My guess would be 100%.  If your question is what percent of the population of Togo lives in Lome, I could make a calculated guess.  The population of Togo is listed as 5,858,673.  65% of the population are in agriculture, 5% in industry and 30% in "services" according to 1998 estimates.  That means no more than 2,050,535 are in non-agriculture.  Divide that number in four and you get just over 512,000 as the population of Lome.  Why divide by four?  Sounds like a good number.
LCAzlHhEaa	We didn't do a cruise of every island we just went to one island; Oahu and it was wonderful.  We did do a sunset dinner cruise one evening and that was great.  On our flight home there were several people who did the cruise and they had to be off the ship by like 9 am and then they had to carry their luggage all day with them until our flight.  What was great about our hotel we had to check out at 10 am but our hotel kept our luggage for us so we could go do some more sightseeing and did not have to worry about our luggage in our rental car.  When we were ready to head to the airport we went and got our luggage and headed to the airport.|`|Ib5XecOiaa	It was worth it but the only thing I didn't like was that we were very rushed.

An open air prison. The villas that stood here have been plowed down to construct ugly brown brick apartment buildings that sprout everywhere like weeds and stretch on for miles and miles. Often people move into them before they're even painted. I used to work in a business tower on the top floor, and everywhere I looked it was like a bird's eye view of Kabul. Many of the estates that remain have been converted to libraries or cultural centers or even private schools, which was obviously not their intended use and which they are too small for. The streets are absolutely choked with pollution and congestion, and you can regularly see cars parked in double or triple rows, even on the sidewalks, forcing motorists to drive single file even in the wider streets. The music that blares from coffeehouses and motorcycles is horrible - like a hyena caught in a trap with drums. The adan that seems to come from ten thousand mosques in every neighborhood can be deafening too. There are heaps of garbage everywhere, especially where there are a lot of people at once. There is also tremendous poverty. Word of advice - never go to El Marg station.
7G7lnSiUaa	It is highly unlikely, fresh out of college you will be able to afford to live in the best areas ( Belgarvia, Knightsbridge, Mayfair etc)   A lot of advertising and design companies are based in Soho, Clekenwell & Shoreditch. So check areas in easy reach of there.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	South East London: Elephant&Castle, Camberwell.....those are cheap places in south London....elephant and castel has bus access tube.....etc...you can cycle around there aswell and is a bus journey away frm the city...without living in the city.

Those places are lovely (I usually stay in Belgravia when visiting London), but extremely expensive.    Thanks to the tube, nothing is really that far away, especially by American standards.  Notting Hill is nice, but getting very expensive.  Shepard's Bush is getting better all the time.  Avoid Brixton unless you are totally hardcore.  Hammersmith is now pretty nice.  I like Camden Town, but it's not for everyone.|`|AA11631965	Australia -  London is not nice|`|TPVvddHWaa	Chelsea is a nice area with that sort of thing|`|J1tcVvCGaa	For design jobs, London is the best place to get it. You could either live in central london if you can afford it. Nicest areas are Chelsea, Nottinghill, zone 1s. If you want cheaper, renting out a flat or just commute everyday to work is also a good idea.

First of all, Brixton ISN'T a 'no go' area.  Yeah, it has it fair share of violence, but so does Peckham and Croydon.  Brixton is known for having a great culture vibe.  There's gonna be violence wherever you go.  Sure, Brixton (Lambeth), Peckham (Southwark) and Croydon have worse violence, but it doesn't make it a bad place.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	In the United States, persons sitting next to an exit must meet certain criteria that ensure that they will be able and willing to assist in evacuating the aircraft in the event of an accident.  People who don't meet these criteria are not allowed to sit in those seats.  No reservation or supplemental payment system can override this.  The criteria are set by Federal air regulations, not the airlines. Any airline crew that seats unsuitable passengers in these seats is breaking Federal law and recklessly endangering its passengers.    Nevertheless, since some crews and some airlines may care more about public relations or money than about safety, they occasionally break the rules.  As long as no accident occurs, they are likely to get away with it.  If an accident occurred, they could risk being sued and penalized out of existence, but since accidents are so rare, apparently some airlines prefer to take their chances.    Having medical experience is not one of the criteria for being seated in these seats.  Essentially you have to be able to assist others (and thus must be able-bodied yourself), you must be strong enough to open doors, you must be willing to assist, you must be not be a child, you must be able to understand English, and a few other qualifications.|`|p8UAIAisaa	There really isn't a way to clear or reserve emergency row seats as they are deemed preferred because of the little extra leg room. You would have to be a premier member in their frequent flyer clubs to actually reserve them in advance or pay a full fare ticket.  You can check within 24 hours the flight map and see if they are available and maybe have an agent see if they can do it for you. Usually it is done at the airport as they want to make sure that there is no children and that you are capable of assisting, how strict they are is another story. You can get to the airport early and check in to see as a lot of airlines do not even release them until day of departure|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	"Exit row seats I heard are for people who work in medical field..."    No. I suppose there could be an airline somewhere with that practice but I can't imagine why nor have I even flown with them.

7b1Wp6FWaa	You know, you should really do your research yourself. ;P    Here's a few to get you started (not in chronological order).    1) Singapore's independence/separation from Malaysia (1965)   2) World War 2 (1942-1945)  3) Racial riots (1964 &1969)  4) Founding of Singapore (1819)  .  .  .  .  .  .|`|855408f5752344edfbe4d13162f70ee8aa	My suggestions are (1) Who are the real founders of Singapore?                                 (2) How did Singapore develop from a small fishing village to a developed city.    Try www.slideshare.net/mrsirvinglong, the slides u need will be there. :)|`|XXm2yCHiaa	1. 1942 - Fall of Singapore (World War 2)  2. 1965 - Separation from Malaysia.|`|Ioc0owmfaa	2 important events that are very significant to Singapore would be:    1. The separation from Malaysia & our independence in 1965    2. The building up of Singapore from scratch.....

23b69e7f8073aa893274935eee6f43ceaa	Yes... I would print out the email confirmation before you leave for the airport.  You don't even need that really, but bring it just to be safe.  When you check in at the ticket kiosk, the computer should be able to look up your reservation if you swipe your credit card or you can type in your confirmation number.  Then it will print your boarding pass.  Same procedure for your return flight.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	The previous answers are technically correct, but there is a much easier way to check in. Go to Northwest's website (www.nwa.com) the day before your flight. You can check-in online and print your boarding pass within 24 hours of departure.     If you have checked luggage, you can check it with a skycap or at the check-in counter depending on whichever line is shorter. If you only have a carry-on bag, you can skip the lines at the counter and go straight to the security check.    I always do this and have avoided standing in some very long airport lines.    If you have access to a computer at your destination, you can do the same thing for your return flight. If you don't have computer access, then check in at the airport kiosk.|`|AA12234654	Yes, it is the fastest way to get through the airport, they have a Kiosk inside the airport, usually next to the security desk, punch in your   confirmation number and your name will come up, it is fast and easy, no standing in lines, your name will be in the data base computer at Kiosk, same thing coming back, just make sure your keep your e ticket information.  The next time you fly you can even choose your seat by using e tickets, I always purchase my tickets on line and and print a copy of the information that is all you need.

But you can drink for free and play for hours for very little if you play slow.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Craps and the quarter slots max bet. These have higher odds.|`|NS9yqfT6aa	Well, $200 can last an entire trip, but just make sure you have a full list of other things to do... My problems is when we go, we have "downtime" at the hotel room... which is usually the time I go and blow the rest of the money I came with and I end up wandering over the the nearest ATM.     Anyways, sounds like with $200, you're just going to look for entertainment, not going to win big.  I would stay away from tables, if you don't know what you're doing.  If you've gotten the basic strategy of blackjack down, I would play that. If not, you're stuck on the machines.  In order to stretch your dollar the farthest.. from my experience, play a penny or nickel machine... when you approach the machine take a look at the number of lines they advertise.  If they have 90 lines, that over a dollar a spin (considering you won't play 1 cent per line).  A smaller machine will allow you to gamble less, yet still stay aggressive.  $20 can go fast in any machine, so a lot of it has to do with luck.  Just watch you bet and pick the right machines.    One side note.  Go with the notion that the $200 is for entertainment purposes.  If you win, that's a plus, if you lose... well, at least you got the entertainment.  Don't be disappointed when you lose your money... The odds say you will.  Just Have Fun!!|`|JLA2Wncfaa	The best bet you could have is go to Casino Royal where they have $5 100x odds craps tables, make one bet of $5 on the don't pass line, if point is made put all the rest behind the line thus giving you an even money $5 bet and all the rest behind the line on whatever odds point is. If point is not made then do the same until point is made, if point is made then repeat. The bet behind the line is the only bet where the casino does not have an edge so you have true odds on this bet and the $5 on the don't pass gives the house an edge of only about 1.36%    Whilst this may not be the way to have the most fun it is mathematically the best way to utilise your money.    For me $200 split down the middle slots (probably quarter) and $5 BJ at least this way I would be getting a few free drinks.

You should only try taking sealed bottles, and even then, only in your checked luggage.  Also, if I were you, I'd let the airline know about it.  You wouldn't want them to think that you were trying to get away with something or smuggle something that might be considered dangerous.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	You can put some types of alcohol in in your checked luggage. The Transportation Security Administration bans alcohol that is over 140 proof as a hazardous substance. You are restricted to five liters if it is between 48-140 proof. Under 48 proof is okay.    Be sure to pack it carefully in a waterproof container so that it doesn't come open in transit and leak all over your clothes.
CyP7VMHHaa	Not legally. It is illegal to possess alcohol if you are under 21.    If you are 21 or over, you can carry alcohol in your checked luggage if it is less than 140 proof.

pMrdTbCXaa	The best answer to this question is YES and NO.    Yes, US movies are released in Japanese theatres.  Blockbuster movies such as the Dark Knight, 007, and the like are generally released a few months after the US release date.  Contrary to many studies claiming a worldwide simultaneous release, it doesn't always happen in Japan.  A true blockbuster movie is generally delayed up to 6 months in Japan.  Mama Mia was recently released in theatres.    Comedies tend to be the worst movies to be released in Japanese theatres.  Japanese comedy and American comedy is very different.  Unless it's a cartoon, it doesn't sell.  40 Year Old Virgin was released simultaneously on video and in theatres a year after the US release.  The theatrical release was also limited to a handful of theatres in Tokyo.  Teen comedies tend to be even harder to sell and tend to be direct to video release only.    Animation from Pixar and the like tend to follow the blockbuster trend.  Wall-e was released last December.    In general, unless it's cute or easy to market, it's hard to sell a US movie in Japan.  The few exceptions are anything by Johnny Depp.  They are fast tracked because women just love him.|`|Yjs2x29taa	Sometimes; depending on the popularity of the movie around the world.    I live in Japan, and I recently saw "The Dark Knight" in Tokyo. (Although it took a while for it to come out here.)    P.S.

They are often released a few months later though, and typically only blockbusters or big movies go over there in the theaters (lesser-known films can be bought on DVD though).    It's similar to how only the "good" anime is shown on TV.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes, a lot. Some are dubbed in Japanese. Some have Japanese sub-titles.

hG8FMFUeaa	if you are in a neighborhood like a good subdivision where houses run that much you should be OK. i personally would live in an outskirt instead of the city. close enough for technological advantages but far enough away where there isn't a lot of room for slummy areas. you honestly are going to have to find a couple places down there and take a look then drive around the neighborhood and for about a mile around the home to make sure you are not close to bad areas. i have lived in many parts of Florida for years and have been fooled by what seemed to be a good area just to find out that 10 blocks away was a ghetto. i have found that living just outside the city limits in a good subdivision was the safest bet.

It is part of Egypt but they don't want it either.|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	No...TEHNICALLY Israel belongs to the Palestinians|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Legally speaking, there is no one who has sovereignty over Gaza.    The last sovereign power there was Turkey, and the Turks have no interest in that piece of land.    No sane individual advocates giving Hamas sovereignty over Gaza because of  Hamas War crimes  - Shooting rockets and grenades purposely on civilian targets in Israel.   - Shooting these rockets from within Palestinian civilian compounds such as schools or in proximity to hospitals or residential buildings.   - Storing weapons and ammunition in schools, mosques, public offices and buildings.   - Regularly using their own civilians as human shields; particularly children, often forced to be in the most dangerous spots.   - During fighting with the Israeli forces the Hamas fighters, who wore uniforms at the beginning, changed to civilian clothing or IDF uniforms and continued to fight.   - Hamas fighters have routinely hid among civilians in hospitals       /      .|`|OBn0eZikaa	No. they left and gave it to the Palestinians in hope to stop the terrorist attacks on Israel and its citizens.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	Yes and they will take it back too, All of Israel belongs to the Jewish people. God gave them this land, and God is against anyone separating his nation. Gaza is Israels. God said about Israel "I will bless those bless you and I will curse those who curse you" Jesus is coming back to rule the world from Jerusalem.

mtmgMDMsaa	Well the teenagers are quite friendly and easy to get along with and I gareentee you'll make friends on the 1st day at your school! it was actualy my 1st day for the year back today and i've already made friends with a new student and a exchnage student from Germany.  Anyways you should spend a semester in Auckland i reckon, it's big with alot on offer and things to do. Bunch of touristy things to do plus just casual things you can do, it haS certainly the best shopping in NZ from my point of veiw and for hitting great spots for hitting the beach in your weekends. If you want touristy things you can go whale watching, go to the aquarium, go up the sky tower and even jump or walk along it, auckland zoo and my favourite... Go to Rainbows End theme park. - it's so fun! and some activities like quad biking, horse trekking, the luge, canoeing, etc etc..  Also the weather in summer gets usualy up to 30 max, occasionaly goes over 30 in some places usualy it stays in the 20s and late 10s in general but may differ by location. It can get pretty chilly in winter in the lower south island and they get temps below 10. Great spot if you want to go skiing though. But in general NZ gets temps around 10-15 in north island and maybe even under 10. And Auckland i reckon has annoying weather at times coz one minute it'd be sunny the next it's pouring with rain -.-  Other places you could stay are the other main citys Christchurch or Wellington good spots if you're not fussed so much on going out and doing things but just getting the culture and life of NZ.  If you came to Wellington, you should totally spend the term at my school.|`|q7frgtB6aa	i dont know but i heard that they have lots of land|`|TDszW6Yfaa	its a great place if you like inbreds that like to have sex with there uncles and there sheep.|`|KXztKjAaaa	its ok... depends what part ur going to.    theres a real "gangster" mentality over here with lots of young people, gangs etc.     just go to aussie
G2h8g2g1aa	If you're looking to save a little money by staying near an airport, Midway is WAAAAAY closer to the United Center.  Midway is only about 9 miles from the UC, O'Hare is closer to 20 miles to the UC...which could add up to at least an extra half hour in Chicago traffic.    Here are your two options...    1. Fly into Midway & stay at the Midway Hotels and use cab it to & from the United Center.    2. Fly into Midway or O'Hare, stay downtown (use the elevated trains to get downtown, it's easy and you don't need a car) and cab it to & from the United Center or save some more money and take the bus.      Personally I would go with "option 2."  Get a cheap flight to MDW or ORD and stay downtown.  If you stay near an airport, you don't want to take public transportation to the UC...mostly because you'll go through some rough neighborhoods.  So the extra cab fare will probably equal out to the extra cost of staying at a hotel downtown.|`|q7frgtB6aa	united center|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	There are 3 that are close to the United Center...a very short cab ride:      Marriott Chicago Medical District from $142.00   625 South Ashland Avenue  Chicago, IL 60607 US       Crowne Plaza Metro from $171.00   733 West Madison  Chicago, IL 60661 US       Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites Downtown from $98.95   506 West Harrison  Chicago, IL 60607 US|`|AA11728500	Yeap, definitely stay close to midway where hotels are less expensive and order a cab or limo for your concert.

AA10240904	Do not move here.  The job market is awful.  Casinos are laying off, including upper management.  Businesses are closing.  State, county, and cities have frozen hirings and looking at layoffs.      Bad is not the best description.  It is the worst in the history of Nevada|`|AA11536773	In one word: sucky. Unemployment is over 9% currently and they expect it to be over 10% this year. Every industry is laying off - and tourism got hit the worst, since they're the biggest. I was watching the news a month or so ago, and they were interviewing a restaurant owner who says she gets Culinary trained CHEFS applying for her dishwasher positions - just to have a job.  The state is trying to push thru a 6% pay cut so they don't have to do massive layoffs. City and county jobs are on a wage and hiring freeze. Two years ago, the help-wanted section of the classifieds was like a small book, now it's barely a brochure-size.   If you have a job where you are - wait it out a bit and bank some cash to have a cushion for when you do move.|`|urHPuzMsaa	Bad and getting worse. The casinos are still laying off and even if things pick up come April they probably will try to get by on the staff they have or hire just part timers. Unless you have police experience there isn't much else going on here. For every single job opening there are 100 applicants and those applicants have years of experience.

In Scotland we get worse than that each year, but we have the maturity (unlike the arrogant English) not to run around like headless chickens, in uncontrollable panic.    How do you arrogant English think the rest of Europe copes each year?     More snow! You haven't seen a proper snowfall yet.|`|doLyOac0aa	Do you mean all of the UK?

01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	Everything is so expensive here so buy what you can before you arrive....Because it all will be much more expensive here.....I guarantee it!  Especially over there by UCLA area...that area aint cheap by any means    1. Watch out for the bullets and the Paparazzi ...lol    No, seriously...    2. There is no such thing as a free ride here...so be prepared to pay your way here.    3. Use these SO CAL sites to help you find things here in LA    www.laweekly.com  www.latimes.com  www.recycler.com  www.caljobs.ca.gov    4. Make sure you have extra cash in a Savings, or a 401 (K) or IRA saved up just in case to porotect yourself from unneccesary expenses that pop up......this is LA and anything can happen here. This is a very crazy city and you better be prepared.     5. If you want to see the Celebs...  go to Santa Monica, Hollywood & Venice Beach, etc.  www.tmz.com     6. Be prepared for all the earthquakes, fires & mudslides. You are guaranteed to experience one of them while you are here.    7. It's really hot over here in the Summer. So this is normal for us.    8.  Be prepared to exprience all the diverse cultures here in Los Angleles    9. Good luck|`|uwzfTIKxaa	Drive. Do yourself a favor-  take the advice of someone who knows California well. Trust no one until you know them well. Many people who seem nice aren't. Also, ignoring the beeps-preppy girls- doesn't work. Neither does retaliation. Every thing is expensive. Congratulations on getting in! I hope you do well. Good luck!|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The first thing you must do is be certain that you have been accepted to UCLA. With California's budget problems the Board of Regents is restricting the number of new students it will accept to cut costs. For the same reason the state has suspended Cal grant tuition assistance to students for the time being. If accepted you will pay out of state tuition for the first year and a day. That's about 2 1/2 times more than a California resident (or illegal alien) pays.    If you pass all those hurdles you will need your car. Los Angeles is spread out and the public transportation system is not the best. It won't be fun lugging 6 bags of groceries on a city bus.     Also understand that the recession has hit California harder than most other states. If you need to find a job to help with expenses that may be extremely difficult to do. Jobs are almost nonexistent here.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	No one walks in LA since it is spread out over 40 sq miles. I took my car and everything in a truck since you will need transportation. I wouldn't buy a car here because of the taxes. Registration is about $150 for your existing car plus $40 for a smog test and you will have to take the written test again.    Since it is harder to get a loan and you are not familiar with the area, I would just keep your current car. We drove in from Austin in less than 2 days.

zvUV8sfwaa	I have sailed with four different cruise lines and there have been different things I have liked on different lines.  I just got back from a Royal Caribbean cruise and the great thing about them was that the hot tubs and pools were open 24 hours per day, which is not the case on any other cruiseline I have been on where they close around 9 or 10 pm.  It is such a treat to go into the hot tub at midnight, 1am or 2am!  The buffets were also superior on Royal Caribbean, with so much choice (a carved meat, make-your-own pasta, Mongolian grill, chinese food, make-your-own pizza, sushi, etc.).  If you are adventurous and athletic, Royal Caribbean has all sorts of things that you'll love:  a rock climbing wall, ice skating rink, inline skating track, jogging/walking track, mini golf, basketball court, etc.  I think the brand new ship also has the surf boarding pool.  As for Princess, I found them to be the best for customer service.  The room stewards and dining room staff all went the extra mile to ensure that everything was to your liking.  I did not find the service as good on Royal Caribbean or Carnival.  Costa had great service though!  The dining room food (in the sit-down dining room, as opposed to buffet) was best on Princess, in terms of quality and choice.  Royal Caribbean and Costa were also good in the dining room, with Carnival being the least good for food quality.|`|K5plVKsPaa	Carnival is great, but I think it's more directed towards kids. I mean most of the time when people talk about carnival all I hear about is the water slide!    Royal Caribbean is no doubt, in my opinion, the best cruise line:) it's family oriented, there are PLENTY of things for you and your family to do. And as the person on here mentioned, they are building the Oasis of the Seas which is going to be one of the newest & most innovative ships around. Royal is always working on new things to make their line better.|`|ZbNaD2uIaa	carnival cruise line because it has some of the most biggest and best ships|`|fhn5EOgqaa	ROYAL CARRIBEAN because ive gone on 12 of there ships. they all hav rock climbing walls, and with carnival maybe they hav a waterslide on about 6 of there ships, but who cares. one of royal caribbeans ships has flow rider and a shopping center, and rock climbing wall. They are currently building one of there largest ships which will probably be the largest cruise liner, so forget carnival. this ship that royal caribean is building, oasis of the sea, will hav a zip line on board going over the entire deck that u can use any time, and a rock climbing wall, two flow riders, a merry go round, several shopping areas, a central park area with all of your plants, two story state rooms, balconies that face the ocean, and that face the deck where there will be an outdoor theatre at the back of the ship, and several varieties of camps for kids to go to, like art, science drama, and ect. They hav teen camps and now for the first time ever they will hav a nursery for all of the new borns, no matter how old they are. Unfortunately this ship comes out in december, but i bet its worth it, my family and i are going in june or july of 2010. it will be great. but trust me royal carribean cruise lines has some of the best ships ever to set sail at see for every reason you can think of.    PS: Hope i answered your question. LOL. Got excited. :D|`|gXJdryRNaa	We are going on our 3rd cruise, this time to Alaska.  We have only sailed with Norwegian and have thoroughly enjoyed each trip.      We became Latitudes members which when staying in a suite (mini suite and up) allows us priority boarding at embarkation and at all ports and priority debarkation at trips' end.     We tend to think outside the box.  Everyone going to the 2 main dining rooms?  We go to one of the other venues for dinner.  Or we go at an "off" time.  Most tend to go at 5:30 or 6:00.  We wait until 8:00 p.m. or go to a different restaurant.      On cruises, regardless of which cruise line, you tend to get what you pay for.

Check them out.|`|EkeoyYKraa	I have neva been on royal carribbean, but i hear it's nice.  I have taken 2 cruises with carnival and is planning a third.  I love carnival and would 100 percent recommend it.  with economy being like it is, carnvial is the best value for your money.  carnival stafff really give you the star treatment even if their cruises tend to cost you less money, which works for me.|`|74fcba335ab8343face51727b09bb14daa	Kids or no kids~~ Disney Cruise Line!|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	I have been on four different cruise lines and l think Royal Caribbean is the best.  Very large ships, passengers of all ages and most passengers speak English.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I will answer and say it depends on your age group.  For my wife and I we prefer Celebrity Cruises.  The food and entertainment is far better for us, We are in our late 50's, like smaller ships and not too many children on board.|`|oz1hZ3wNaa	I have only been on one cruise, but it was with Carnival and we enjoyed it very much.  I would recommend them.  We are planning another cruise for next year with Carnival!|`|q1GnMRxxaa	I have only cruised with Princess (9 cruises), because I like them very much. I call Carnival the wall mart of cruise lines, great for the price. A lot depends on what you like. Since I'm not a kid or a teen, then rock climbing walls don't interest me where as movie under the stars is right up my alley(a princess specialty_. Princess also offers what is called the chefs dinner and that is spectacular. No other cruise company offers anything like it ( I'm a foodie). So this appeals to me. So the bottom line is what do you like to do? how much money do you have to spend? What kind of ship activities do you want. That is why I like Princess.|`|S0uCKptBaa	I've cruised with carnival and royal caribbean and think royal is the best. Their ships are very innovative. They have things on a ship that you wouldn't expect like an ice skating rink, rock climbing wall, and they continue to come up with new things like a park, boardwalk and a zip line. They are very creative. I also like that they don't charge you extra for these things. They offer a lot of activities and make sure you don't have a moment to get bored. Also the ships are well maintained and the service is excellent.

07376ca2a10e899bd389c134d283000daa	Hi There.  I am an Australian who has recently moved here from the UK, I was in the UK for 3 years with my boyfriend, both with plenty of work.  We moved to the Gold Coast (near Brisbane) and as soon as the recession hit, unemployment shot up! The papers have absoloutely NO tradework at all. My boyf is a bricklayer by trade and he has called over one thousand companies and small business's over NSW & QLD and all of them give him the same answer, NO-ONE is building right now, therefore no jobs, not even labouring..  I am a medical receptionist therefore working in a safe industry, everyone still gets sick..  You will find with all the bar jobs, alot of tradesman are getting them as they all have no where else to look.. As long as your boyfriend is GUARANTEED employment at your uncle's workplace then go for it. If you show alot of determination and join all of the job agencies, go to them everyday so they know your very keen, they will help you alot to find a job.  You should be ok to find casual restuarant work, your boyf may find it harder, especially if he doesnt have a trade. My advice is still to come out here, I'm sure things will fall into place for you!|`|ozGz5Rx0aa	These people are visa mad !    A little bit of authority and bloated egos over what ?

1FPpglMpaa	the biggest difference is that in Manhattan all you have to do is walk around and you'll come across places to shop.  There are shopping districts that have bigger name stores  but the city as a whole has shopping on almost every street.   In LA, you have to drive to get to the shopping districts such as Melrose or Rodeo drive or to Santa Monica etc.  You can walk around in the areas but you have to drive to get to each of them.|`|cg5Ka4g2aa	new york is better.. by far.
50zbKv0jaa	The romans were makes of law, however they ruled through local rulers. Unless the person was a Roman citizen in which case they could appeal their case to Rome ( some of Jesus' disciples were roman citizens).    Modern law in case of a crime you would go to the police and the state would take action. Under Roman law you would have to find a Patrician (normally your patron) to sue the other person. In the case of Jesus and the Priests, both were not citizens, so the Roman Governor has a bowl of water bought to him where he washed his hands, indicating he was tired of it and didn't care. Subsequently Jesus was crucified.  What I am trying to show is that the concept of law was different in Roman times. As Jesus wasn't a roman citizen and it didn't interfere With roman rule and especially tax Collecting the romans would not care if anyone was stoned to death. Now the ability to legally put ay one to death is reserved exclusively by he state ,n Roman times a roman head of the House hold had the power of life and death over any of his household|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	many times over|`|Jc8rbyHXaa	Good question; but I am somewhat confused about this.  We know that there are laws in the old Testament for stoning people who committed sin, especially adultery but I am not sure just what happened during the period when Rome ruled the Jews.  Maybe the Romans allowed the Jews to practice their religious executions.  I hope some Jewish scholar here  will tell us the truth.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	I was about to give you the same answer that baadmf gave u..abt the woman that was caught in the act of adultery     anyway, I've done some search and I found the following:-      Deuteronomy:    "If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; (13:6)    But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. (13:9)    And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. (13:10) "    Mishna, Sanhedrin 6.4 on modalities of stoning:  The place of stoning was the height of two men. One of the witnesses knocked (the convict) down on his back "loins". If he turned over on his chest "heart", the witness turned him on his back. If he died right away, that was enough; but if not, the second (witness) took a stone and dropped it on his chest. If he died right away, that was enough; but if not he was stoned by all Israelites (present)|`|tQsxsuNPaa	yes, it was.  It was lawful for a father to have his son stoned for being disrespectful, for a husband or wife to have the spouse stoned for adultery, etc., etc.      And Baadmf...we should all report him for his gross name...has no clue...no.  Jesus was NOT King of the Jews.  That was a taunt mockery title given him by the Romans.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	Death by stoning was usually done for violations of Jewish religious law.    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia..."The Torah of the Jews, which is contained in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible and as such serves as a common religious reference, prescribes death by stoning for a long series of offenses, namely:        * Touching Mount Sinai while God was giving Moses the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19:13)      * An ox that gores someone to death should be stoned (Exodus 21:28)      * Breaking the Shabbat (Numbers 15:32-36)      * Giving one's "seed" (presumably one's offspring) "to Molech" (Leviticus 20:2-5)      * Having a "familiar spirit" (or being a necromancer) or being a "wizard" (Lev. 20:27)      * Cursing God (Lev. 24:10-16)      * Engaging in idolatry (Deuteronomy 17:2-7) or seducing others to do so (Deut. 13:7-12)      * "Rebellion" against parents (Deut. 21,21)      * Getting married as though a virgin, when not a virgin (Deut. 22:13-21)      * Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man (both should be stoned, Deut. 22:23-24)    The Mishna gives the following list of persons who should be stoned (Sanhedrin Chapter 7, p. 53a [1])        * A man who has sexual intercourse with one of the following (see Lev. 20, which however does not specify the form of execution):            his mother          his father's wife          his daughter-in-law          another man          an animal ("bestiality")        * A woman who allows an animal to have sexual intercourse with her      * A blasphemer      * An idolater      * One who gives his seed to Molech      * A necromancer or wizard      * One who desecrates the sabbath      * One who curses his father and mother      * One who has sexual intercourse with a betrothed maiden      * One who incites or instigates (toward idolatry)      * A sorcerer      * A wayward and rebellious son"|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	Obviously someone wants peace!

8Hxyp9fRaa	Well, yeah, your 15. I'm 15 too, and I live in SF, and have my whole life. Overall, California is, to me, uber alles (like the song). Not literally meaning that it's superior, but that it's the best place in the world (to me), but I've been living here my whole life.    I don't really think you're ready to make the move. You said yourself that you have great friends, and that you love school, and, yeah, your best friend. It looks like you've got it pretty good right now, and that it's not the right time to move. Sure, California's great, and it would be a good experience for you to experiment with a new location, but California's not going anywhere. If you leave your hometown so early, it will be easier for you to forget where you came from. I think that the best thing for you to do is wait. Wait until you are ready to leave your best friend, your other friends, your school, and everything you're used to because if you make the move now, then chances are you have no idea what you are in for. The changes and differences between CA and Ohio will end up being more overwhelming then you expected, and you can't just turn the plane around.    If you do decide to move to California (whether that's now or later), I suggest San Francisco. Although the San Diego beaches are far better than the SF beaches, SF is my hometown and I gotta support. If you need any more help with this feel free to contact me.|`|8idhxYHaaa	um its really expensive. only if you have a lot of cash. wait until you're older hun. dont do it just cuz youre mom wants to. stay where you are. youve got people that love you there. maybe go to college in CA or something. stay with youre family and friends. you dont want to move and know no one except youre mom. it would be like starting over. and thats not fun. :(|`|6GcDA7zLaa	Hi,  I moved to San Francisco about 15 years ago from NY.  I love it here.  The weather is fantastic and there are lots of things to do.  Both San Francisco and San Diego are fairly safe cities compared to others in the US but there are dangerous areas anywhere you go.  What everyone says about it being expensive is very true.  Most people who move here have a difficult time buying a house and the houses are a lot closer together than they are back east.  People are friendly and helpful.  If you and your mom are serious about moving here, I suggest checking out the cost of rents and looking at some of the activities.  By the way, I think you would find the area  a lot more culturally diverse than Ohio.  If you are still interested after all of this, I would recommend a visit before moving.  the other question is whether your mom would be able to find a job as the job market is tight now.  Good luck|`|C6d4ndMOaa	You have no idea what you're getting in to. EVERYTHING is expensive in California, especially in SoCal. San Francisco is also expensive, I lived in the SF Bay Area till I was 22.    It's a wonderful place to live, there is all kinds of stuff to do, especially if you like the outdoors.

P8CBDLiKaa	SF gets small earthquakes now and then, as does San Diego.  The last major one was the Loma Prieta quake in 1989, but there can be another one tomorrow or 30 years from now.    The weather tends to be pretty mellow in the greater bay area with cooler temps and fog in SF proper during the summer.  Daytime temp ranges in the bay area go from the 50s-60s near the coast to 60s-70s in SF proper and 70s to 90s inland during the summers.  Winters tend to be pretty uniform with daytime highs in the 50 to 60 range and overnights dropping into the 30s to low 40s.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	yes we have a lot of earthquakes    ahhhhh!!! theres a earthquake right now|`|rnlE1sY0aa	it depends which part of cali u go 2 what part were u thinking of??|`|742i5ZLgaa	san francisco usually have an earthquake at least once a year. you can feel it, ubt its not fatal. its just a little shake|`|m2QSWdnraa	yeah come to California work is plentiful!!!|`|DLxh9CANaa	San Francisco is famous for its fog, and for the fact that during the summer months, it's the coldest, dampest place in the whole state of California. In the wintertime, it's mild, but wet- winter is California's rainy season. This is a state in which most areas have only two defined seasons, the rainy season and the dry season, instead of the usual four which are found elsewhere in the country. As for the earthquakes, yes SF has quite a few of them, and so does San Diego. Both cities are built near and over major fault lines, and the whole state of California is geographically unstable. Major earthquakes are relatively rare ( the last one was 20 years ago this summer, the Loma Prieta quake which destroyed Highway 880, among other things) but minor temblors are common, and some happen almost daily, in fact.     The other thing to keep in mind about the weather in SF is that it can change quickly, especially during the winter months when the storms come through off the Pacific Ocean. These storms, which are what provide the state with most of its moisture and rainwater, originate up north, in the Gulf of Alaska, and then come down the coastline from there. Storm season generally starts around the first of November and ends in April, and during that time, the San Francisco hills and mountains will go from brown to the most beautiful shades of green you've ever seen. Temperatures can vary widely, depending on where you are in the state- and if you are up in the Sierras at all, be advised that they have a winter season which rivals that of any New England state. SF is generally mild, though. Temps in the 60's during the day are common in the winter, because the Bay acts as a heat sink and protects the city against extremes.

7Rkt5VsLaa	It started in the USA first, and it started in 1913 when the Federal Reserve bank got through congress on chrismas eve, when nobody was there to oppose it.  Since 1913  The money supplies of the world started to rest on what would become a mostly  fiat currency system known as the US dollar. Now finally, the American consumer is tapped out on debt completely.  This US dollar currency is the world reserve currency and is just as fiat as the african currencies.  the US dollar is sooo.. fiat, which means it is not redeemable for gold or silver  from the government, as was originally outlined in the constitution of the united states. ever since the gold standard in the USA was abandoned, we have had the 'economic clock' of boom and busts, which were created by the willful expansion and contraction of the money supply for  banking profits and title confiscation,  and as a bi-product also a steady devaluation of the dollar( to about 3% of its original value over all these years. )  Because gold is real money, and printed fiat currency  is fake money, it causes massive dislocations of recources in the world.  ie the country which can print the most currency and re-direct recources in a fashion which does so in a manner which is corrupt or does not not reflect real economy needs, but rather the needs of speculators and power players in politics, -these economies end up with massive areas of growth in sectors that are not really needed and other chaos is created, but for the needs of the speculators in london, washington and new york. For example, analytically,  the war in Iraq is simply a wish of the US policymakers not a real demand in the world economy.   The united states, australia and other G7 nations are debtor nations are the 'hit ones' , because they are importing more stuff than they are exporting , and they do not control their money own supply at all. Rather the governments have given the right to print money to the 'Federal Reserve' which is a banking cartel owned by the following private owners:    Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin   Lazard Brothers Bank of Paris   Israel Moses Sieff Banks of Italy   Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam   Lehman Brothers Bank of New York   Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York   Chase Manhattan Bank of New York   Goldman Sachs Bank of New York.     I would encourage anyone wondering what really happened to their retirement funds to fully investigate all the symbology printed on the US dollar.  I will give you a hint.  In latin 'order out of chaos ' appears on the dollar, as does in latin, 'our enterprise is complete.'  Let me ask you what in the H**L are these things doing on the currency? what do they mean, and who put them there ?    I think China is wise to all this stuff about fiat currency, and so will not Join G7.  they are getting the drift that the american consumer is all tapped out and are now starting to question holding US dollar derivatives, even if they come from the US treasury direct.   Watch for the price of gold and silver to go through the roof, although the guys on wall street are printing  un-backed short positions like it going out of fashion. Whether the gold price goes throught the roof depends on how well the guys in New York can continue to suppress the price of gold and silver with derivatives.    Now for my opinion, as what appears above is historical fact.  I fear that the because the america is fully broke, they will need to start a war to further manipulate the people of america, and keep them busy so the government and the power structure will not be questioned about what they have done to the world economy..  America and England  will attack Iran under the pretense of either a black flag  operation (google it) or will just create a bunch of 'evidence' or propaganda  to say they have weapons of mass destruction on route or similar,  and they need to be stopped. WMD's will be ramed down our thoats until we are all brainwashed, like we were about Sadam .  Also,  I think that the entire derivative market will need to collapse before the public finally  works out that the price of gold and silver has been manipulated for a long-long time.  If you reseach enough you will find also that Prescott Bush, the grandfather of G. Bush, did in fact provide funding to both sides of ww2 .  there is an agenda here by those at the top, and it goes way beyond what you are  told in the media.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It began in 2005.

There is a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in Ghana than many other nations, but the AIDS rate is considered low in Ghana compared to other African nations. The countries that have the highest HIV prevalences are towards the South. You have a higher chance of contracting Malaria if you choose to visit some of the Rural Areas, so you should bring bug repellant and get a shot (i believe there is a Malaria shot)
TcgUVcYwaa	http://www.interrail.net/    A 2nd class Youth Global pass is 399 EUR, an Adult 2nd class global pass is 599 EUR.    I personally find this is a fair deal, considering that for some longer distances in Germany, France, Spain or Scandinavia you have to pay 200 EUR return already.     TThe price of the interrail pass is fixed in EUR, the only thing that varies is the exchange rate of the pound against the EUR. If the pound falls against the EUR you need more pounds to pay for the Interrail pass.

3fHZOobiaa	Vatican City is very beautiful as the person above me have said, but in my opinion without the background of Rome, it would be almost nothing... So in my opinion, Rome ( that would be wonderful also without the Vatican) makes the Vatican beautiful and see-worthy...    Your question is something like: Los Angeles or Hollywood?

It's impossible to answer to your question... both are wonderful!  The Vatican is in Rome, surrounded by walls and it's its own country, the smallest in the world. The Vatican Museums offer more than 2000 rooms in which are displayed Roman and Greek statues, ancient mosaics, Roman frescoes, paintings (from 1200 to 1800), collections of contemporary art and then there are the Sistine Chapel (Michelangelo's "Genesis" and "Last Judgment" and Perugino, Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Rosselli, Signorelli, Pinturicchio frescoes) and the Raphael's Rooms... Let's say all the Italian art history!  Rome offer the same things, all the Italian art history but in a wider area (the Vatican is 1 acre or half squared kilometer!).  That's why this answer is difficult!  Anyway for both I suggest to hire a private tour guide (a full day for Rome and half day for the Vatican is enough for the highlights).  Hope I was helpful

The cost of taxi was astronomical and I could not believe my eyes on looking on the board after arriving at the sea port.Something that fascinate me was the mode of transportation...motorcycles.  They were zipping up and down the place all the time.  The women that catch them sat down with their feet out at the side. We caught one with three wheels and sat in the back.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	No, it is not a cathedral but a huge gothic building that was the residence of popes in Avignon in medieval times.     In the history of the Roman Catholic Church, the Avignon Papacy was the period from 1309 to 1377 during which seven popes, all French, resided in Avignon, France:  In 1376, Gregory XI moved the papal residence back to Rome and died there in 1378. Due to a dispute over the subsequent election, a faction of cardinals set up an antipope back in Avignon: there were two from 1378 to 1403 when the last one was expelled.     This is what the palace looks like:   http://www.palais-des-papes.com/pages/pd...

A tourist site, but empty of any furniture or anything on the inside (just big grand rooms with nothing in them).     Interesting though.     It was the residence of the pope when they moved from Rome. . . to Avignon!

UF8qU5cGaa	It's quite obvious there's no easy answer, the question is too complex or at least the subject is. In fact how can you answer it objectively?     The EU is a work in progress, a huge political project, controversial and opposed at every step by different groups for various reasons. There in lies the problem.    Lack of direction and power is the central issue for the EU. The individual nations are unwilling to surrender sovereignty and power to a "federal" government! And the people(s) are skeptical of any government!    Effectiveness can be measured in many ways, but what are your parameters? I would say the EU is very effective in creating and enforcing the laws it creates.     There's a huge bureacracy with rather low efficiency considering the incredible number of levels of government, people, nations, groups and not least languages!      And politically it can certainly be described as ineffective because it is unable to form a consensus on most issues [due to it's lacking authority].     From agreeing on what stance to take at trade negotiations to what actions to take on foreign issues (see: Georgia/Russia and Israel/Palestine).     The EU is not only hindered by it's size and structures but by it's own members. The people of Ireland managed to stop the creation of a new Constitution, and without it the EU is on "hold".

PnMtlZ0Yaa	Rent before you buy in Arizona. Buckeye is the extreme west valley in the middle of nowhere. Every community has it's own personality and you would be better off exploring to see which area suits you instead of buying into a poor neighborhood where you will not be comfortable. It took me renting in a slum (which looked great when I moved in) for 18 months here before I bought a house in an area I love. I looked at over 50 houses and I contacted every lender I could find while reading and researching a lot to be sure I was getting exactly what I wanted. Even a forclosure that needs a lot of work in an established nice neighborhood is a better investment than a poorly constructed newer home in the middle of nowhere. Also, go through a full summer in AZ before you decide to stay. four months of daily 100-115F heat chases a lot of people away.     Equally, (or more importantly) spend a lot of time researching all the home financing options- There are so many hidden finance opportunities and you could lose a hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage by not doing your homework.    There are over 100 Walgreens stores in the Phoenix metro area, so don't limit your area to be near a certain store.|`|AA10067514	Hi-    I live in Buckeye, AZ.  I moved here from San Diego 2 years ago.  I agree with the other folks who have answered your question.  RENT FIRST.  Most of Buckeye is zip code 85326.  The more upscale community in Buckeye is named Verrado.  The zip there is 85396.    I live in a community called Sundance.  Renting a 4 bedroom house with a two car garage about 2000 square feet with a decent sized back yard and totally fenced with a 6' high block wall. Rent is $950/mo.    Buckeye is a huge town.  The town is 8 times the size of New York City, but only has about 45,000 residents.  Buckeye was an old Arizona town like you would see in a western movie.  Starting around 2000 the town began to redevelop with modern housing and shopping centers.  So yes there is an old part and a new part of the town.  I personally like the new side of Buckeye. The old and new are miles apart geographically.    Use the zip codes I gave you to research real estate ads.  Also, they are building a new Walgreen's on Miller Road in Buckeye, so if you lived the the newer part of Buckeye you would have less than a 15 minute drive to work.    As far as the weather goes it is not 115 degrees for 4 months.  It averages around 107 in the summer  and will jump to 112-115 for about 10 days.  Compared to WI, it never gets that cold here and remember......YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOVEL HEAT!    Check out the video I shot last summer. (I was standing right next to the A/C when I shot it so pardon the noise.)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAGE2szMa...    If you play golf you will love AZ....Hope this helped you.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	You should really take a good look around before you purchase. Right now, Arizona, like the rest of the country is dealing with the real estate crunch.    During recent times, there was a lot of new construction and now that has slowed. There are foreclosures as well as, brand new homes still unoccupied, available for sale.    Location, location, location still  holds true but you want to check out your school districts as well as, community association fees. Some areas have them, some don't.    You can do well out there now but, DO YOUR HOMEWORK first !|`|5HYabirzaa	Like somebody else said "rent before you buy". Get to know the valley, what you want, and what you want around you. It's a huge city, so you have many options. Buckeye is way way West and it was booming once, but not enough to get a whole lot of stuff out there. Areas like Avondale, Surprise and Buckeye were booming, but now have a huge foreclosure rate. So if you decide to buy there, make sure you know you'll be in that house for a long time. The foreclosures hurt the value of your home, so be cautious!    For the West Valley, I prefer the North Glendale/Peoria area. There's a lot of entertainment and restaraunts in the Arrowhead area. It's a nice, clean and safe area with easy access to the 101 freeway....remember! you get what you pay for!

qq5nceCXaa	Like all places the highest paying jobs are the bosses of the big companies.    As an average the best paying business is Oil and gas with an average monthly income of 50 076 Kr/month in 2007, that's around the $100,000 mark, depending on the exchange rates.  As the majority of these jobs are engineering that has a knock on impact on all engineering jobs.    The spread is low though with the lowest paying sector only being half of that.  Manual work without too much education still pays well.    An average doctor makes 57 331 kr/month, the average technical professional in oil and gas makes 55 761 kr/month.  Management in oil and gas of course make more.

In contrary to the US executives in Norway do NOT earn anywhere near as much as other European or American CEOs. It's both a tradition and a political issue. Most executives earn well, but the majority does not earn millions of dollars.    The highest paying jobs in Norway are (on average):  - CEOs (>20.000.000 NOK)  - Brokers (10.000.000 NOK with bonuses)  - Lawyers (up to 8.000.000 NOK)    - Doctors (max 2.000.000 NOK)  - Economists (800.000 NOK)  - Engineers (700.000 NOK)    Professors earn very little because almost all schools and colleges are public. Fishermen can earn a lot of money, but not like CEOs. Actors are paid nothing in Norway! Ski instructors are not well paid.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	You have to remember that due to the way taxes work here, that when you earn more, you pay a lot more taxes. Most skilled professionals earn within a certain range. In order to pass the tax barrier on wages, you have to have a very well-paying job. The key for most people is finding the best paying job within a tax range.    The richest man in Norway on Forbes' billionaire list is in shipping. The 2nd is in supermarkets, the 3rd in real estate. So the highest paying job would be executive of a successful company.    My friend that studied law and economics says that it takes something like 15 years for a doctor to make up lost wages from years of schooling, compared to that of a construction worker here (who starts working at a younger age).    Incidentally, he works as a university professor, and only makes about 450.000/year, which is good but not great.    Offshore work pays fantastically (or onshore if you do shift work), the best money going to engineer project managers and planners.    Commercial pilots earn a lot, too.    A pizza cook here earns 2.5x the wage of one in the UK, so the lowest paying jobs are still possible to live comfortably on.

If it is late or early or a weekend, you could take the 10 east to the 101 north, and exit Western. It would be faster. But midweek, just stick to the first plan.

Friends who were "frequent flyers" couldn't understand what I was nervous about. They would travel on planes as often as I travelled on the bus. I wanted to travel too and wondered if I would ever be able to.   But then I finally did. I travelled with my mother. It was a 2hr flight. I was nervous the whole way. On the way back, the pilot tilted the plane so that we could get a better view of Brisbane as we flew past - that freaked me out.    Although I have now flown within Australia and the USA, and internationally between Australia, New Zealand and USA, I never sit in a window seat. I prefer to sit in an aisle seat (I don't want to look out the window). I also watched a documentary about plane crashes...most people survive the impact but are unable to get out and are overcome by smoke. If you sit within 7 rows of an exit row then you are more likely to "get out alive".   Take notice of the safety talk at the beginning. Look under your seat and see where the life jacket is. Read the safety card. Count the rows of seats between you and the exit row (this helps if you need to get out of a smoky plane). I have found that knowing where things are located, and having an escape strategy has helped me. One of the most important things though, is to fly with an airline with an impeccable safety record! Fly with an airline you can trust.   The strangest thing, is that I now prefer to fly alone.   There are probably prescription medications you could take (for anxiety, stress etc). Talk to your doctor.

As many dynasties in Chinese history built, rebuilt or extended the Great Wall. The latest construction took place in Ming Dynasty and the length built was over 6,000 kilometers. This is the one often referred to when we talk about the Great Wall. However, if including all the walls built in different dynasties around China, the total length will exceed 50,000 kilometers.         The Great Wall is not just a wall. Other defensive works such as forts, passes and beacon towers were built along the Wall to house auxiliary soldiers, store grain and weapons, and transmit military information. As a product of the clashes between agricultural and nomadic economies, the Great Wall provided protection to the economic development and cultural progress, safeguarded the trading routes such as the Silk Road, and secured transmission of information and transportation. Today the world has completely changed. No wall can withhold the progress that modern science has brought about in our life. The Great Wall has lost its former function. But does this mean that anyone has the right to use the Wall's stones to build their own houses? It happened to Hadrian's Wall, it is still happening to our Great Wall. How to promote the national awareness of the archaeological value of the Great Wall? That is a challenge we are facing. And for that purpose, everyone is welcome to join us to better understand the Great Wall, and to better protect the precious remains for generations to come.

ABZfW82eaa	The original plans and funding for construction of the Trans-Siberian railway to connect the capital, St. Petersburg, with the Pacific Ocean port of Vladivostok, were approved by the Czar Alexander II in St. Petersburg. His son, the Czar Alexander III supervised the construction; the Czar personally appointed Sergei Witte Director of Railway Affairs in 1889. The Imperial State Budget spent 1.455 billion rubles from 1891 to 1913 on the railway construction, an expenditure record which was surpassed only by the military budget in World War I.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siber...  http://www.trans-siberian.co.uk/site/|`|z4Yrn96Paa	The only thing I'd add to Dmity's very excellent answer is to link you to this modern day marvel.

xHYDNX2Paa	The problem with purchasing alcohol in port is that when you actually make the purchase, you can't bring it on.  Usually the merchant you purchase it from has it delivered to the ship with your information on it.  Kind of like pizza delivery.  Then you don't even get to keep it.  It's kept in storage and not given to you until you disembark.    If you happen to purchase alcohol and they don't automatically deliver it to the ship and they give it to you to hand carry on, you will be surprised when you leave port only to stand in line, and go thru the x-ray machines (similar to the ones at the airport) and metal detectors.  They x-ray your belongings, so nothing gets past them.  It is then they will confiscate it and hold it, until you disembark.    FYI, if you buy alcohol from one of the duty free shops, they don't even let you take it back to your room.  they hold it too.  they do this for a couple reasons. 1, they want you to blow your money on the ship in the bars. 2. they want to know you aren't providing alcohol to minors.     I'm sorry, it's not good news. Enjoy your cruise.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Yeah and take a good look at Mexican jails

x5Bj1q8Caa	In case you are mailing off to renew your passport and meet all four requirements, you can just simply attach one photo into the designated square by stapling the photo in the marked locations indicated on the application itself. Place your second photo on the application in the upper left hand using a paperclip.    Any questions about renewing a passport or about your application can be answered by contacting the National Passport Information Center (NPIC) tollfree at 18774872778 (TDD: 18888747793)  or by email at NPIC@state.gov.|`|cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	When I applied for mine at the post office, the lady who processed it did all the stapling for me.

IstwJtBraa	Sosua just had the hours changed to 4am on the weekends 3am during the week.    If you want gals there is NO OTHER choice than Sosua.  Do NOT stay in an all inclusive because you cant bring them back without paying full stay prices for them which will be close to 100 US a day.    Hotels I suggest in Sosua are Europa Hotel and Casa Cayena.    Best deal for 2 people is El Neptuno Residential Condos.  2b /2 ba lux condos in the best location.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Sosua is the best for young guys wanting to meet local girls.  It is a small town and there are discos and bars every ten feet.   Just be careful about how much cash you take out with you at night since esp in the discos you have to be careful of pickpockets.  If I were you, I'd go to Caberete which is just  a few miles from Sosua and has a great beach.  It's not much of a town but you can do kite-boarding and lots of other stuff on the beach there that you can't do in Sosua.   Just know that with girls you are looking at a "pay to play" situation unless you are fluent in Spanish.  Lots of young European girls working in bars in Caberete if you like surfers!      Puna Cana is for families from what I hear and Puerta Plata is a city.  Sosua is very safe at night.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Sosua does have a bad reputation for prostitution and drugs but I guess that depends on what your looking for.|`|lypweSx6aa	And please leave a short list of resorts in each place please..

muU0iUsAaa	My advice is go to your local court house. The court house can handle the passport documents and it is much quicker then going through the post office. You have to give an oath that you won't misuse your passport and it only took me about 15 minutes, but they had to check about parent permission for mine because I'm under 18. Best of luck in your travels!|`|eulMjLtPaa	Under an hour to fill out the application.  You'll also need to factor in the time to get your passport photo.|`|cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	It took me less than 10 mins. It could have been shorter had the lady not been so chatty. There was a family ahead of me so I had to wait, but when it was my turn, it was a breeze. Before arriving to the post office, if you can, just fill out the passport application form online and print it out, but remember NOT TO SIGN IT, bring a checkbook with you to pay, make sure you have all the necessary IDs and paperwork, and stop by your local rite aid or cvs and get your passport photos taken there. Just a bit of extra preparation before arrival will make it a breeze.    BTW, I applied for my passport less than 2 weeks ago, un-expedited, and I got it yesterday!|`|pTbGI4sZaa	If you fill out everything there, it can take a while.  An easier way is to visit http://www.travel.state.gov and download the forms.  You can print them out at home (along with the instructions), fill them out, and bring the completed forms to the post office with you.  That way you can take your time and make sure you have all the documents you need.  If you fill out the forms at home, you can be in and out in as little as 15 minutes; if you did the forms there, plan on at least half an hour or 45 minutes.|`|2d869MTgaa	Not very long at all, as long as you have everything ready (not signed). You can fill out the forms online and print them to take them with you. Make sure you make an appointment.
l9c2Uw5baa	School is never cheap, but it pays off in the end as you gain skills for employment.    You can apply to Seneca, Centennial, Humber or George Brown and they do have mature student programs.  You might also qualify for financial assistance - depending on your situation and income.|`|ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	I'm afraid "college" and "cheap" do not exist in the same sentence. Foreign students also wind up paying a lot more for tuition because tuition is subsidized for Canadian citizens only.    A small point, but it's "mature student" not "matured student".    Another responder mentioned that it depends on the college you apply to whether you would be taken in as a mature student. For some places, you have to be 21 while other places you can be 19. For some other schools you need to have been out of school for a certain period of time.    You would have to apply to whatever college you select first before you can do anything else. When you receive a letter of acceptance, you will have to present that to Canadian immigration officials so that you can apply for a student visa.    You will have to satisfy immigration officials that you can pay for all your living expenses while you are studying in Canada (ie food, accommodation, tuition, books and lab fees, for instance). You would also have to purchase your own health care insurance as you would not qualify for the health care coverage that citizens receive. You would also not qualify for any student loans as those are for Canadian students and not foreigners.    As for what schools to suggest, I would suggest you type in something like "community colleges in Toronto" and see for yourself. It really is up to you what you want to study and where you study.    Finally, it should be emphasized that once you have completed your studies in Canada, you will have to return home. You would not be able to remain here just because you studied here. If you wanted to eventually immigrate here (something I would not recommend until the economy improves) then you would have to do that from inside your home country.    Hope that helps|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I think the minimum age for mature students varies from school to school.  You should check the websites for the colleges you are considering.

pcHp7Dgkaa	You can come on a 12 month Work and Holiday visa which allows you to work at any kind of job for up to 6 months with any given employer. It only costs AUD$195 and is very easy and fast to get so whatever BUNAC charges on top of that should be looked at very carefully to determine if it's good value. I very much doubt if it is.    The W&H visa that is available to people from the USA is for 12 months only and can't be extended under any circumstances.  http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	from what i hear bunac is expensive, you can get a work and holiday visa at this link no need to use a company you can do it all yourself very easily  http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...    follow the links right through ,it will give you lots of info about working etc|`|e9555bec7535b22de2db20580ac7d03baa	Your best bet would be to come on a "young person's working holiday visa"  These give the the right of entry and unrestricted work (up to 6 months with any one employer) for ,I believe, 13 months but can be extended if you undertake seasonal rural work such as fruit picking.

wg0hmrvWaa	People going to Garnier tend to dress a little bit more than at Bastille, where you see no real difference with going to the movies...    Unless you're going at a gala night, in which case it's long dress for ladies and black tie for gentlemen (dinner jacket for the British, and we call it "smoking" in... French), you really can do what you want.     At Garnier, you'll probably fit better, as a man with a jacket (with or without tie), And as woman, a skirt is nice but not compulsory, avoid going in jeans, put a nice scarf and that will do it. Like someone else said, the French around you will come straight from work (opera starts early in the evening, 7:30 - the French tend to start and end work later than in the US) and most people will be in business suits and female equivalent of that.    The worse is to overdress in a non gala-night : this is not Austria, I'm afraid (and it cries "US tourist" out loud)...    (if its a gala night, you would know, it says so on the ticket and it's more expensive and usually not directly open to the public anyway).    ...;;;;;;;  Oups, on the 22nd of march is it a "matine" (2:30 in the afternoon) so people won't come from work, and I would expect it to be even more casual... skip the tie !|`|KS2OHXCRaa	"Casual" for most people would usually means t-shirt and jeans or something like that. But there are some (major) opera houses that requires "formal" or "black tie" which means men in dark suits and women in gowns - very extravagant.    So casual dressy (or sometimes known as smart casual) would be somewhere in between. But no sneakers/runners please, and try to avoid jeans (even if a good pair of jeans matched with a beautiful blouse and some lovely accessories is very much acceptable in many places, but it's Paris, so why not dress it up a little beyond jeans?).     For guys, it's relatively simple - shirt and tailored pants/slacks with proper shoes would be suitable. For girls, they can also do something similar by wearing lovely top/blouse with tailored pants or to wear a dress, matched to boots or some other lovely shoes.     I don't know how to reference this to a link, since the information above is based on experience. Perhaps this one? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code_... )

Both also have beautiful scenery, especially St. Thomas. I really liked Dominica for beautiful, lush green rainforest surroundings.  If you go to Dominica, you must go to the sulpher hot springs, which are these pools that are heated by the volcanic activity underground.  Antigua has some nice beaches too.  If you go to Grand Turk, there is really nothing much to see, except to go swimming in the ocean and spend the day at Magarittaville at the pool and swim-up bar.  Do not bother with the "downtown" of Grand Turk - honestly, there is nothing there, not even souvenirs.  I am not a huge fan of the duty free shopping in St. Thomas, which is always hyped on the cruiseship by the shopping expert.  Unless you have big money to spend on jewelry, the shopping is not for you.  I would not go to Barbados on a Sunday, as there is nothing open.|`|K5plVKsPaa	I think it just depends a little on what you do at each port.

You mainly have to figure out how to deal with your clothing, esp slacks and panties. I bunch them together at my knees. As weird as it sounds, you can practice this at home by squatting on your toilet seat (put your feet on the seat and squat, careful not to fall off!)  Food -- only eat well-cooked food, no street food and be careful with ice and iced drinks because you should only drink boiled and filtered water, with ice made from that.  You do need to like Chinese food, at least a little, or you won't be very happy though you can get McD's Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried all over the place. Being really anxious can make your sensitive stomach worse, so you can also pack or buy stuff like crackers and snacks that you can eat.|`|NUDjFfLxaa	I guess you will be just fine, since Beijing is the capital, the infrastructure is good and the variety of food is just amazing.

uj53UFAcaa	It can be divided further as urban dance (cities, nightlife, clubs) and traditional (rural, festivals, time honored. It can be described as energetic and athletic.  You could put individual country names into youtube and try to find videos that way. It will be difficult to see a summary on West African dance because west africa consist of several countries.  Try searching for each country (Malian dance, Senegalese dance, Ivory Coast Ghana, etc.) or group of people (Dogon, Mande, Ashanti, Igbo, BoBo, etc) and find similarities in each.    youtube.com    ghanaweb.com
ZGUkizjYaa	Weather is fairly similar.  In the summer, its about 80 every day with a decent level of humidity.  In the winter, the average day tops out between 25-30.  Snowfall is heavier here than it is in westchester, but in terms of temperature, I think you'll find it very similar.

MCkNzrmQaa	I have to say that the web page Ashelyp mentions is outstanding and I would give you some advise when I detail some surf spots.    Our winter time gives you a lot of choices plus you don't have the crowds you get from December-March.    45 km south from Lima you got Punta Hermosa and it's surroundings. It's Peru's Surf mecca, it has everything, lodging, pubs, discoteques, restaurants and surfers!. From north to south you got:    ARICA (left), PULPOS (mostly right), El SILENCIO (right), CABALLEROS (right), SE?ORITAS (left), PICO ALTO (Peruvian Waimea, right), PLAYA NORTE (right), LA ISLA (right), PUNTA ROCAS (Peruvian Sunset, right), SANTA ROSA (a huge left, it only breaks on big swells).    61 Km south you got a left shore break next to an exclusive beach resort, PUERTO VIEJO (left), sandy bottom and best from the afternoon to sunset.    Km 122 you got a challenging left called LA PLAYITA, not recommended for beginners    Km 132 a typical fisherman town with a sandy bottom shore break CERRO AZUL (left) also on occations has a right peak breaking next to the pier.    Km 231 you got an other coastal town (Pisco) next to an exclusive beach resort (Paracas), from there you can rent a boat to the island of SAN GALLAN (right), this wave needs a big swell and is the only wave that brakes towards the west and has a lot of off shore wind. The swell has to be big and it hits the peninsula of Paracas and bounces backwards towards the island:  http://www.nazcamystery.com/images/parac...    Beyond San Gallan there is nothing else worth surfing.    To the NORTH:    The first surf spot you find to the north is PASAMAYO. 60 Km north but in the old panamerican highway that is available only for heavy load trucks. You have to either leave your car on the edge between the highway and the 70 sandy slope 150 yards above the break point, or park the car in front of a god forsaken restaurant-grocery store a 1/4 of a mile from there. Going down is easy but the walk up takes 50 minutes (without stopping your pace). This is a perfect peak that breaks to both sides but the right side is perfect (only good if the swell is medium size) there in no wind in that spot.|`|W5y7xlHGaa	I have, go to Mancora, Piura and in Lima you can go to many beaches depending on your own skill level.    Go to this websites www.wannasurf.com and click on Peru and then Lima and you can see pictures and forums and get informed on beaches for perros (beginners), medium and advance surfers and the ones for the "poseros" who only buy a board to sit on the beach and meet the ladies XD    I am medium skill so I like to go to Mancora in Piura and in Lima I go to San Bartolo, Punta Hermosa and the best is CERRO AZUL and some beaches from the Costa Verde.     Now, if you are advance, you can go to Punta Rocas and Punta Hermosa (the advanced area)  or El Silencio or maybe the HERRADURA     If i ever go to Punta Rocas I would either drown or get a heart attack. I am the small wave chica type who like to do tricks with my body board and run away from huge waves but it all depends of what you like. Most chicos are locos and they like huge waves so maybe you will like Punta Rocas or maybe Herradura (good luck)|`|oc8bIG41aa	i havent but i want 2   i am going 2 try to surf when i go again  i heard that the waves r very good over there  the beachs are nice over there    if u want a low key surfing place i think u should surf in the north  side, kind of away from lima   umm here is a link so you can see which is best  http://www.perusurfguides.com/peru_surfi...    well have fun on the waves dudee :]      ohhh you should try sandsurfing

tQsxsuNPaa	MMmmm!  cocido madrile?o!  I haven't had that in YEARS!  Pepe used to make the best!  (or was it his wife, Pepi?  I don't remember if he ever did the cooking!)     Anyway...go to a little plazuela called Puerta Cerrada.  Find a little locals place called El Rey del Pimiento...mam Alicia will take good care of you!  Just point to something that sounds good on the menu.    They make a nice Patatas Bravas. Actually, everything is good.  Just find something...try it.       Pulpo a la gallega is good.  And Calamar.  Paella.  Tell me you've never tried paella!?  Don't bother eating it IN the Plaza Mayor...they just make it out of a box.  Find a place that tells you that they make it "casera" (in the house).    There's a tapas row just down on the lower outiside of the Plaza Mayor, and they all have really good reputations. (this, not far from El Rey, and about a couple of minutes from the stadium by metro).    Oh!  At Puerta del Sol, go to the pastry shop called La Mallorquina...it's across from the To Pepe sign...really good sweets!
ABdZDjjcaa	miami is the best|`|vl6OtBfWaa	There are no dedicated resorts for twenty something travelers you will always get a mix of age groups in Varadero.   The party scene is what you make of it.  There are plenty on clubs and bars and with all inclusive alcohol almost everyone is in a party mood.    Go to trip adviser and in Cuba forums what a lot of people do is say in a post (they call it roll call) going to Varadero on 00  00 2009 anyone going single or partyer or what is happening resort that time of year you will get a good response|`|RhkKGsipaa	My suggestion in Varadero  would be Oasis del Caribe.  I stayed there three  or four years ago and there is always  tons of stuff going on which would appeal to your age group.  It's 4 star and offers  a disco , several other bars plus a  very active animation gang who were always into high jinks around the pool and on the beach.  You can check the reviews below.  Friends of mine just returned, it was their fourth straight year at that resort which tells a lot.  have a wonderful time.  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserRevie...
SwKPJRNvaa	Halisi could not be more wrong. By the scramble for Africa (1880s), slavery had been abolished for 70 years.  Sick though it sounded, part of the mission was a 'civilising' one. It was called 'the White Man's burden', and they thought it their christian duty to bring the 'savages; into Christendom.    European rivalry was another main one. In the case of Uganda, Britain had Kenya and did not really want it, but claimed it to stop the French laying claim to it.  Greed was a major reason too, but not as great a one as thought. There were, for each colony, only a few white administrators who acted through existing heirarchies, and they did not have as much influence as many think.    Empires were different then, and every civilisation throughout history has had an empire- from Babylon, to Rome, to Russia, then Europe. Our technology by that point made it possible to administer far larger colonies than ever before|`|RILZcr6Daa	Europeans colonized Africa due to its natural resources and for Cheap labour back to their home countries(Slaves) to help them become industrialized.|`|fYUgURZmaa	Because, due to the industrial revolution, European countries were in great need of materials.    So, under the pretense of civilisation or anti-slavery, they put their hands on the resources available, like wood, copper ore, gold, etc.    At the beginning of the 20th century, with the advent of automobiles, they encouraged rubber production.

Be sure in PR you will not get ripped of like in Mex and more people speak English and have less macho attitude and no drug cartel battles.|`|S0uCKptBaa	Both are great places with lots of history and sights to see. I've been to Puerto Rico multiple times and love it. I love visiting Old San Juan and walking around the forts, visiting the craft markets, and hanging out in the local restaurants and bars. They also have a rain forest and a couple of bioluminescent bay. You can also take a tour of the capital various churches and museums. Mexico also is great. I visited Cozumel on a cruise and loved it. Everyone was very friendly and they had great affordable shopping. I'm actually planning a trip back to Mexico so I can visit Tulum.|`|iN27E3WCaa	I would say Puerto Rico.  I've never been to Mexico but I went to PR last summer and it was great.

Plus, you won't need passports to get there.|`|zRLyKDCOaa	PR, i have been a few times, love the beaches their!|`|RLCnQ6Ihaa	Since I don't know where you are travelling from, where I live, in Canada, you do need a passport to go to either of those places.    Mexico is beautiful.  Puerto Rico is also beautiful.  Where there is a beach, you usually have the same activities, which can be something fun for the whole family.    You say your family is planning, so I am sure it will be a memorable vacation.|`|vcWuPlOyaa	I would go to Puerto Rico, Its very warm their in this time of year.

LU6vfqRzaa	The postal service goes by the physical address and zip code.    It should arrive at the destination that you put.      :-)|`|J4lfOSPiaa	The USPS is concerned with the "physical address" unless you tell them in writing to forward your personal mail to a different location.    I had a brother who lived with me temporarily for 1 year and received his mail at my home because he directed in writing that he was to receive his mail at my home.  When he left and returned to Florida he once again had to give written instructions to USPS to change his "mailing address" again.    Here is further proof that they go by physical address - my neighbors often get our mail and vice versa because the house address was written in wrong.  For example if we are 2040 China lane and the neighbor is 2042 China lane even if my name is on the mail for 2042 China lane they will get my mail.  This happens a lot so we simply swap back mail. They are schooled to recognize the physical street, apartment  , PO Box, City, State, and Zip code.  In this day and age so many people come and go that they have to rely on an accurate physical legitimate address. This is why when you place an order from any company your order form address is real important to the company so that they make sure about getting the physical address correct! Yes, they like the name correct but they will ask you to double check the "mailing address"!    Hope this helps, kiddo.
AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....    1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.    2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.    3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.  Or answer the right question on the air.  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out  in a drawing.

Dont know what comfy to you means but whatever it says on the temp that is what it feels like unless its really windy or something.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Looking at accuweather.com, most days will be 77.  A couple will be 72.  Personally when its 77 I am in Capri's and tee's and flip flops, but the cold weather that we are having right now are not that bad to me either.  Tonight it is supposed to be 27 with windchill in the teens. More than likely you will be fine in jeans and a tee.  But be prepared and bring shorts too. You might find its better than you thought it would be.
BWxSSADaaa	Are you thinking of joining the mafia?  I'd re-think.  That's dangerous.    I'm no mafia expert, but this is what I think.  Probably, ethnicity is less important than a feeling of trust and understanding.  If they think a person has the same goals as they do (a mutual understanding) and they trust the person to be competent, not be a police informer, etc., then I'm sure such a person would be allowed into the mafia under the same initiation conditions that anyone experiences.    But, a lot of trust comes from identifying with a person.  It's likely that for this condition to exist, the person of different ethnicity in question would have to speak Russian, and would have had to come from a similar background (growing up under similar conditions and such).  And, given the fact that in this case, the employers can kill you for any offense, I'd say that an extremely detailed understanding of the culture is necessary.    Given all that, I think that this "someone of any ethnicity" would have to be Russian, not ethnically, but at least culturally, linguistically, etc.  They would probably have to be from Russia or a country/community with close historical/geographic ties.|`|0yTM98Odaa	why would you want to be in a mafia?|`|z4Yrn96Paa	Most mafia leaders started in Russian prisons.  So at the beginning one had to be Russian to be in a Russian prison generally.  Today, you wouldn't be trusted to be in the mafia if you weren't Russian.|`|6a7c2f7356f1dbadf90f001beb576671aa	many of them are not Russian at all.  have you even been to Russia?|`|ovqIDT9Laa	Yes.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	they will eat you for breakfast.....|`|5dBp23y1aa	In Russia ethnic mafia,economy crime-georgians,murders of politics and bussinesmen chechens,drugs-gypsy vs armenians...But you says like its in Italy,here to be in Mafia you need to be big man in criminal world,if you didn't stole millions or didn't kill Politkovskaya you would never join in  their clans.

It will be approx. 14 hours maybe less to travel that.      Just stop along the way to take a rest several times.    :-)|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Greyhound bus of course, but they are always crowded|`|E1MYgOJvaa	Probably taking a car.

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I now fly a lot with my three children.    It can be tricky transporting and using whole milk on such a long flight, even UHT. See if she'll take powdered toddler formula at least until you return from your trip.    I really recommend using the bottles with plastic liners instead of disposables, which take up a lot of room. Traditional bottles are too difficult to wash onboard because of the kind of sinks on airplanes. I premeasured the powder and rolled up the liners, placed the rolls in a zip lock bag. Then I threw the liners away as I used them and only have the ring and nipple to clean.     This worked better than buying formula in individual packets, which still need to be opened and emptied on the plane. I would sit down a few days before leaving and just fill a whole bunch of these liners at one time (while watching T.V.) I even did this when I returned to work so that my husband and the caregiver didn't have to measure any formula while I was so far away. You can fit a lot of rolled up liners with powder in one zip lock!    I used to pop in the liner, fill the bottle halfway, close, shake and then open and fill to the rim. If any powder gets into the nipple, press it down while shaking.    There are disposable sippy cups and I've seen them both in the U.S. and in Europe. One brand is "Take and Toss" (although this name is probably changed if sold in the U.K. due to an unfortunate sexual connotation). They are sold in stacks in two pieces. They really do work and they go in the dishwasher, hence the name. You can either wash them or throw them away.     I actually used just regular sippy cups. They weren't that difficult to wash on the aircraft. I'd do whichever you think your daughter would prefer. You can even bring both! (good idea, in case the sippy cup is lost).     If you use bottled water, be sure to give yourself enough time to buy some once you're past security. It's supposed to be allowed through, if the water is meant for the baby but don't count on this. Make sure you have enough! The water on the aircraft is filtered tap so decide if you're comfortable using that for your baby. Bottled water runs out fast on flights and we never had any extra for baby bottles.     Be sure your daughter does not need the bottle warmed. Get her used to a room-temperature bottle before leaving. This is unnecessary health-wise and a real pain to do while travelling. I warmed many bottles on my flights but I wasn't there in the check-in line, the security line or the waiting area! Babies do great with room-temperature bottles, especially at a year old.     As far as special meals are concerned, you have to contact the airline. I worked for two companies and the children's meal always had meat in it. Some parents complained that it was too "greasy" so when I fly, since we don't eat pork, I order Kosher. There are other options available, usually including *several* vegetarian choices.    Be aware that once you order a special meal, that's your meal. You can't change your mind and eat a regular meal since it's slotted for another passenger.     But bring snacks for her. Don't depend entirely on airplane food. Don't get too strict about diet unless she's one for strict medical reasons (in which case, you'd discuss this with her doctor). Try to avoid really messy foods (like chocolate covered whatevers) but bring what she likes. I watch the salt too, since airplanes are drying.     Security is more concerned with liquids than food and in the unlikely case you'd have something not allowed, it's simply taken away. I've never had that happen in all the flights I've done with my children.      About 8 years ago, I wrote an article on flying with children for an expat newsletter. I later put it on a blog so that parents had access to non-commercial information from someone with both practical and professional experience on the web. Over the years I've expanded it, adding tips from parents around the world.    Feel free to visit;  http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com    An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website last month;  http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...

Q3RqWHFsaa	Were you denied to apply visa to enter Japan even though you have your family and the guarantor in Japan?    What kind of visa did you apply?     There are variety of visas to enter Japan. Working visa is not so easy but the visa for temporary stay or sightseeing are not so difficult if you have certain guarantor and all procedures are correct.

4vLt3SqFaa	What is this your foot fetish?  Flight attendants are almost always FAR too busy to consider their comfort.  They are lucky to be able to consider their own safety and make it into their jump seats when they need to.  Most flight attendants are so tired that they finish their run and fall asleep - not a conducive condition for passenger bounding.    Fraternization is  forbidden between passengers and crews aboard aircraft.  I am not saying it doesn't happen but your odds of finding some one willing to so it are about he same as dying in a airplane crash, might happen but it is rare.  Further the only private place big enough for two people to do anything in real privacy is the crew bathroom and I have never known "anyone" to take someone in there for a "foot" rub.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	I doubt if any flight attendant would risk loosing her  job over a foot massage. $30-40 K salary vs foot massage does not work.|`|14c163bca78a23e5ddb7f3b04ddea278aa	I Highly doubt it.

I didn't know if I could ever get on a plane. But I have. In just over 3 years I have flown almost 30 times, and it gets better with time. At first, every noise, every slight jolt is something to panic about. But with more experience you learn that each noise has a purpose and has a perfectly good explanation. I have flown both domestically (within Australia and USA) and also internationally (between Australia, New Zealand and USA). I much prefer a long-haul flight (international) as it is much smoother.   I think it is very important for you to choose an airline with an excellent safety record (which could help you feel more comfortable).   Good luck!

Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination in SoCal.  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies.     Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings.     Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.    Places to Stay:  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.    Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|nIG0j9wUaa	Rodeo drive  malibu beach|`|yYi9w8yRaa	Go to the beach...Hermosa, Huntington.

The sights are so spread out that you will not see a lot if you depend on public transport.    And the part of LA close to the walk of fame is called "Hollywood"    But remember that you can "do" the Hollywood area in 4-5 hours. And then take the subway to Universal Studios for a whole day there.    Other than those 2 days, everything is 2-4 hours away from that area by bus.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Everything in LA is so spread out that you'll only be walking distance to one thing.

Then you can walk to the fun places on the strip and if you're down for a pretty long walk, you could still walk to Hollywood Blvd and see Mann's Chinese, Walk of Fame, Frederick's of Hollywood, etc.|`|d19d6d11466a952bf245413b8442de9eaa	The best you can do is search for hotel in http://www.easydestination.net Website shows nearest tourist site with each hotel.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination in SoCal.  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies.     Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings.     Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.    Places to Stay:  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.    Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles
AA11512541	Postodoro is a very good Italian restaurant in the centro. I ate there twice during my stay in Xalapa.    They have a wide selection of wine.

9NpXU7D2aa	NO WAY!  the beginning of the year is one of the least busy times.   late jan early feb is a GREAT time to go.     the most crowded times of the year are:  -easter  -summer break (june, july, august)  -and from dec 21st to jan 1st (the absolute busiest time of year)    average daytime highs are about 72 for that time of year. (of course some days will be warmer and some could be A LOT colder) but for the most part temps should be right around 72.   and night time lows are usually around 51 but obviously are subject to be colder as well.     you should pack:  -shorts  -jeans  -t-shirts  -sweatshirt  -light jacket.|`|yfPu5pcZaa	We're going to have so much fun.

Hope I helped.     The way you asked this question made it seem like you've never been to Florida lmao|`|qPnwqDqeaa	Absolutely not.  I was there from Dec. 28 - Jan. 9 and it was busy at the theme parks until around Jan. 4th.  The crows are very lite now till easter.   And the weather was great when I was there.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	After New Year's, everybody goes back home.  It's a great time to go to Disney!  Actually, I have been at all times of the year, and January is my favorite.  Check the weather right before you go, because there could be a cold or a hot spell.  I have been there when it is 80 degrees all week, and I have been there when we were lucky to get to 50 degrees.  Usually, you need clothes that you can layer and a jacket for evenings, but you might need more.|`|rSq790ksaa	Yes and no. Around New Years the parks are very busy but they're also very busy during Christmas break, Thanksgiving break and Easter vacation aka spring break. Basically anytime people are off from school and work.|`|x4zs37ZRaa	no the beginning of the year is not the busiest time to go to disney its best if you go in a couple of days before january ends but it also depends if there is a big event going on or if there's something special.I would recommend packing something that doesn't give a lot of warmth or if you're going to be cold so pack a sweater and some jeans.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	No, that is a great time to go.  Usually, around Spring Break time and Christmas it is the busiest.  Bring some warm clothes, but also pack one or two sweatshirts because it can get chilly.
Z4PArYfTaa	there is a sign at nsw/qld border forbidding mossies from crossing over    if you read/listen to the news properly you will see it is in far north QLD that has the problem it, is nothing new just a little worse/more cases this year|`|j9rdmYxsaa	no, they don't have a driver's license, passport, birth certificate or anything how can they cross this border?    i am kidding, nothing will stop them, so we will probably all die|`|V7ZMPAcSaa	Short answer? Nothing is deterring them in this hot weather.    The only reason they stay up north is the hot tropical climate.|`|pAih5juAaa	The mosquitos that spread Dengue Fever are up north, and thus far have not come below Gladstone.

Xoooc2K1aa	Perhaps you should check what your tax deductions are.....that's usually what directly affects what they take out of your check more than anything else.    But then again, at $28/hour, you're making WAY more than the average person does in Hawaii so you're more than likely in a different tax bracket (which means you pay more taxes in the end too) and should be planning accordingly for when you'll have to file your tax returns.    As for our tax rates, Honolulu's tax rate is 4.712% while the other islands are 4.167%.  The rest of the taxes you pay are federal taxes such as federal income, social security, medicare, etc.  If you have a question about your tax rate, you should check with your HR department for the detailed breakdown.    Hope that helps you.....|`|877d6b95dea06d73a08b9f3551cd7766aa	How come Fatima cant answer?(Just wondering)  Well, Hawaii buys most things from Somewhere else, We Import more than export, when you import more, you lose more money. Hawaii usually depend on other places, since hawaii doesent have whatever you need to make.|`|yAvOmQrkaa	Hawaii has tax brackets, just like the federal government does. You're probably in the highest tax bracket, 8.25%, for people who earn more than $40,000 per year.    Have you ever considered moving? There are a few states that don't have any income taxes on wages: Alaska, Nevada, Texas, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Florida, South Dakota. Any of those sound good to you? They still have property taxes and sales taxes though, and pretty high ones to make up for no income taxes.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	wow|`|7PMpJqiiaa	It is high all over the US, but certainly seems higher in Hawaii.  Here is what I read why (I forget where):    There is a certain minimum cost to basic infrastructure for a city to run that has to be built and maintained.  In other metro city areas on the mainland, there are more people (a higher tax base) to draw money from, so each person has to pay slightly less.  For instance, if you are in a big highrise (like I am) with a bzillion units, each unit has to pay less for guards and ground maintenance because there are more people to pay into the fund.  A smaller high-rise still has basic costs regardless of property size for guards and ground maintenance so each unit pays more.    As an example, for this reason it has been difficult to get better public transportation (a metro system) approved here on Oahu, because there has not been enough people on Oahu to pay enough taxes to pay for a system.    That is why I believe Oahu absolutely requires federal government assistance to help build infrastructure here.  That should be better now, GO OBAMA!!!    Marlon is right that Hawaii also has to import more things to pay for infastructure and maintenance (concrete, pavement, energy, tar, pipes, wires, etc.).    If the military was not on the island to help with infrastructure costs, it would even be higher!

bVROvLNSaa	You need training - childcare, medical and cross-cultural.    You need transportation - air-fare and bus-fare.    You need accommodation - housing.    You need to eat while you are there - food.    You need several injections before going over and will need to be on malaria prophylaxis while you are there.    Who is going to pay for all of this - if not you?|`|uj53UFAcaa	Its great that you want to work with children.  However, a lot of credible, legit agencies do require a fee to volunteer because of cost associated with hosting a volunteer.  Searching for the right agency or organization will be a long process.     www.idealist.org--Has a lot of information of international volunteer work and how to choose the best organization to fit your needs, also list openings around the world    www.peacecorps.gov-Sponsered by the American government, its volunteer for free organization that works around the world, two year commitment, long application process    http://www.theroadtothehorizon.org/2006/... by an aide worker with helpful information    These are only three of several sites that offer good information.  Try reaching out to some of the NGO's in your area.  They usually have some staff members who are well traveled and have volunteered abroad before.|`|8VotkEXHaa	most of it is because some of the money is going toward the cause also.  For example, this summer I am going to Kenya to help build a school and the cost is $5000 for 3 months.  That's all inclusive plus building materials, a donation to the community etc.  Personally, I don't mind paying extra if it is to go towards helping people so much worse off.  Plus, a major bonus is that it is really easy to fundraise for.  I have raised over $3000 to go towards my trip so far!! :D  So that's what I would suggest.  Go with a company that has a good reputation and fundraise for the trip cost!  Good luck!

It may be pricey because you have to pay for admission. There is also Adventuredome inside Circus Circus, and there is admission to worry about as well. There are many free attractions outside by the strip, there is the free fountain show by the Bellagio. And there is also the free volcano eruption show by the Mirage.

Regards,  Dan|`|wR0U1Lqraa	I am not exactly sure. You would have to call the airport and ask them about it. What I do know is that you have to pay extra to put your pet in the hold. Maybe 200 or 300 dollars. You may or may not be able, if it is a small animal, to take as a carry-on. You would still have to pay extra and it would be very rude to people who are allergic.

Chaparral  http://chs.tvusd.k12.ca.us/  http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/brow...    They do have a typical mall (A&F, Am Eagle, Anchor Blue, Hollister, PacSun, Reference/F21, etc), not too large, but it has movie theaters.

urHPuzMsaa	You and your kids would love the Tournament of Kings at the Exaclibur. They serve dinner as if in medeavel times, no utensils. You have to eat your meal with your fingers. The show is fantastic. They encourage you to scream and shout and bang your hands on the table to root for your king. There is so much energy and excitement the kids will love it and us adults love it too. Watch this promo video and you will see what I mean.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvWlAumjy...    The show is dark on Tuesdays.    So far as Hoover Dam. I don't think kids enjoy it. To them it is just something that is there. They can't appreciate all that goes into the building and operations. Kids find it boring because there is nothing to do there. Lots of standing in line and walking. More for adults than kids your age. I am not saying to not go. Just after that long drive the kids might like some excitement to let off that kid's energy.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	There are many free attractions in Las Vegas, even if its a one day visit.

Hope this helps  :]]]]]]]]]]]]]]|`|EapVGOgYaa	Drive right through, Vegas isn't for kids, trust me.  There really aren't a lot attractions for kids.  Excalibur does have a Jousting dinner show and Circus Circus is supposedly for kids.  Both Excalibur and Circus have floors devoted to video and arcade games.  There is an aquarium at Mandalay Bay.  It is a tough place for kids otherwise.  The 18 year old (boy?)may enjoy some of the local attractions a little more than the 8 year old.  A visit to Hoover Dam would be interesting for everyone...be sure to take the tour to the bottom.  There are also boat rides on Lake Mead right near the dam.  Both are not a bad ride by car from LV. Good luck.

I lived in NYC for 13 years and was mugged 3 times - all the first year I lived there. I lived/worked in Detroit for even more and never been mugged.     It a matter of chance and being smart.

Not as many as NYC, but ask anyone who lives in NYC how many museums have they actually been to?  Same thing for restaurants.

Q3RqWHFsaa	Japanese female M size is close to between Amertican S and  XS.|`|emvIYyufaa	I agree. It's either a small or extra small. Japanese clothes are usually cut a lot straighter. So if the person in question is cut very straight up and down, chances are, you'll just have to go up one size to get the japanese size. However, if the woman in question has curves, her waist may fall into the medium catagory but her curves will fit into another catagory, forcing her to have to get a larger size. I know I fit into a JP medium in the waist but would be a 2X in my curves (If a 2X existed.) According to one Japanese store, but that store only went up to JP XL.  It's always best to check the sizing chart if they have one. If I didn't, i would have bought the medium and ended up with a too-tight shirt!|`|c7da44bc85987393a834f86511b1c87eaa	S or XS.

zvQ1lfuXaa	If you are in weight gaining program then you need to rest your muscles every other day. Three times a week is ideal. And taking food supplement like Whey protein will help increase weight and build up muscles faster. One hour and a half is the recommended time to spend in working out. Do not over worked-out. Actually, you'll be given like a program by your fitness instructor the types of machines you need to use in working out those specific body muscles. Just follow that program and be watchful with your diet. Avoid too fatty, carbo and salty foods.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Train 3 or 4 times a week.  Protein will help build the muscle fibre - take lots.  Lifting weights will build the muscle.  Break betweens sets 3-4 minutes so that the muscle has time to recover before the next set.  Try and train one body part per week - i.e. chest monday; back tuesday, legs wednesday, shoulders and arms thursday.  Lift 70-85% of weight with 6-8 reps and break 3-4 minutes in between sets.  Vary your routine to give your body a change.  Do some hire reps 10-12 with less weight (60-70%).|`|pyhglHaSaa	It's not the frequency of your workout nor the dosage of your protein intake that would give you the muscles you want.  It's the consistency of your regimen and the discipline to eat right that would give you good results.  3x a week workout is great!   Keep it up.|`|hy3q2iWaaa	3 times a week is fine. Right diet too.

7X1xO1yjaa	From what I see of Moroccans who live in Britain. I do feel that moroccan youths are becoming corrupted. I have noticed that moroccans become "westernized".   Not saying being western is a bad thing. Its just that its not how Moroccans are meant to be.  Many Moroccans which live in European countries dont talk their language anymore. I hear many talkin french, or spanish or wherever theyr from whilst on holiday in Summer. OK.   We understand you dont live in morocco but still. Morocco is their original country so they should be talking its language whilst there at least. I talk moroccan arabic and i understand it perfectly.I for one do not act western although Ive lived in Britain all my life.   Well the moroccans living in Europe have quite a little excuse for becoming quite western but whats the ones that are living in Morocco's excuse?!?!  They should be most proud of what they are. They shouldnt become westernized from what they see through the T.V, internet etc.    Religion is of great priority in Morocco so i expect moroccans to be religious, although there are a few which arent. I respect my religion so I dont do things which are against it just because Im not living in a arab, muslim country.     Moroccan people should wake up to their roots and carry on holding their moroccan pride. because i would hate to see Morocco become totally western. Somethings just have to change around the world but still. They should stick to their status quo just a little at the least.    I too find it a total shame of how Moroccans are becoming.    Overall, I think YES. Moroccan people are becoming corrupted.   Corruption meaning to me:    Forgetting their roots, their cultures, moroccan traditions.  Living like westerners  And so on..    I might not have focused much on answering the question but  Hope you get my drift..|`|AA12365543	LOL Moroccans have always been corrupt. How do you think we got stuck with a king and beg every embassy in Morocco to give us a visa out?    I don't even consider the ones in Europe to be Moroccan. They are traitors who abandoned there country to live off welfare, government housing and basically make Moroccans look bad to the host country.|`|VEwpTOROaa	i feel that i am hungry and i am going to get a bite  i really don t care if it s corrupted or not|`|AA10958359	By "corrupted", do you mean by sitting in front of a computer all day and asking people around the world questions about the corruption of youth ?    For Pete's sake, go outside and get some fresh air, wait, your in Morroco, sorry.|`|928c581787e386f9a97222d287f3ef49aa	No, but I feel that Moroccan girls like to play with a mutha fukka's heart like mine.  Next time I'm told to convert, hell will break lose!|`|CoIDVbnxaa	i am one of the lucky ones, my parents who are proper practicign muslims guided me through my youth. and mashallah i made it out un corrupted. but teh moroccan community in the UK i live with their kids have turned out really bad, drugs, sex, alchol, everything but good. its such a shame and a waste i feel.    but i agree, and the moroccans back in morocco copy them and are getting worse. its such a shame but the arab world is no longer something to be proud of. its embarssing. :(          to the dude below. i live in the UK, i know how to use a fone iv had one sinc ei was 15, i have TV i have internet etc etc. but i have not become detached from my culture or my religion. modesty and respect is what arabs are meant to be about. what moroccans are meant to be. i havnt lost that but some have... becuase they are under pressure from peers i know becuase the same happened to me. some people are strong but majority are weak and follow like sheep.     just becuase you have technology doesnt mean you cant be a good person with manners and values and religion.  Like i said before Moulay Idiss and his son established islam in morocco and if they could see the state of it now they would be shaking their heads with shame. i feel the same. moroccans are resorting abck to barbaric times, pre islamic times. no respect for women, nothing no morals. its just wastful and so embarssing. :(  i want to bring my kids up as my parents did, the muslim way with no culture involvment. that leads to confusion.|`|700457e8d2da52e8f1b050a0ce16db12aa	They definitely are in Marrakech. What happened to that city?  10 years ago it was so friendly and colourful and special... now it looks as if the whole youth of the country is in Marrakech to harass tourist.     Those I know in Belgium are rather nice and ethical.|`|RKFrkgCGaa	It depends on what "corruption" means to you.  In that they are becoming more westernized?  This is likely and is due in part to the ability of communication to spread so easily now (the Internet, television, phones, etc.) so that everyone is so homogenized anymore.  People are losing their own cultures.  But it all depends on what you mean by corruption.|`|pv8RjqzOaa	If you dont like it go back to Africa. Moroccans are corrupting Europe. You know its true.    Shut up yourself. You are not welcome and its good for you to receive the message once in a while.|`|30dX1vFTaa	I know you are particularly interested in the opinions of Europeans, so I don't know if you care to consider my response since I'm American.  But I lived in Europe for a while and tend to have a more Euro mindset.  I have also traveled extensively through Morocco and feel qualified to answer this question intelligently.  So here goes:  I wouldn't say they're being corrupted, but it also depends on your viewpoint.  Meaning what cultural perspective are you taking?  To some people from other predominantly Islamic nations, there could be a view of corruption within the Moroccan youth population.  This is because Moroccan citizens appear (to a great extent) to be more open-minded than those from some other Islamic nations and therefore do not readily accept every little thing in the Qur'an exactly as it's written.  So, for instance, females may or may not wear a "voile", dating happens before marriage, and there are other examples.  On the other hand, from a Western perspective, most of these behaviors are considered commonplace.  In a country where internet, television, and/or Western movies are easy to access, it's not surprising that Moroccan youth are adopting behaviors that are typically viewed as more Western.

Visit clubs (if your family likes stuff like that), Museums, shows like wicked or stuff like that. Here's a link hope I helped a bit.|`|osGBTU2caa	One special place is The Cloisters in Washington Heights. You can get there on a Hop On Hop Off bus tour. This link may help http://www.inetours.com/New_York/Pages/C...  Enjoy your trip.
ZtPdNnIZaa	flights depart fr Shanghai hv frequent delay. so u better play safe & arv HK either at 540pm or 645pm to catch ur next flight to Thai 840pm. the 1 arriving HK 735pm is 2 risky. u cannot make it. n transit in HK is convenience & quick. W1 should be at the same zone. if u hv spare time wandering in the HK airport. no worry! we hv many shops there duty free + many restaurants. u can even do a foot massage or sthg there.|`|gts7VpU6aa	HK International Airport minimum connecting time is 1 hour. You should have enough time if you take the 8:40 flight.    Arriving into HK, you will have to go to the transit desk (the arrival level) to check-in for your flight to Bangkok and get your boarding pass. After that, from arrival hall to departure hall (one floor above), there's a security check point where you have to get your bags (hand-carry) x-rayed.    Bon voyage.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	I've connected at least two dozen times on the same connecting flights through HKIA (not the ones you're taking) with 50 minutes between flights and never missed my connection. However, I never had to obtain a boarding pass for my connecting flight and never had to change terminals. Thai Airways has relocated to Terminal 2 which makes your 7:35 arrival and 8:40 departure even more difficult. You might consider an earlier flight even though you might make the later flight. Since you've been to HKIA before, you probably know that it's not a bad airport to have to spend a couple of hours laying over in.  http://www.thaiairways.com.hk/thaiair/ti...
3K1QW7Oeaa	Crowded.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	We hate it but we use it because it is the place you have to go for long haul flights. Airports are an evil necessity.|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	i think it has airplanes!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uwzfTIKxaa	Loud and lots of traffic. I flew home to there once. It took us many hours to go an hour and a half away. Blech|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Same thing I think of my auto mechanic. I don't want to go there, but when I do, I want to get in and out as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Nothing against either one, but they both are just tools to get me where I really want to be.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Navigating the streets around LAX is a nightmare at some hours of the day. Too many drivers not paying attention, and too many shuttles and buses trying to squeeze through. Once you're actually in the terminal/parking area, it's not too bad to navigate. The terminals themselves are laid out well and have become a lot nicer over the years. More amenities are available for those waiting. But, it's not someplace I ever want to be if I don't need to go there.|`|mUGIMvSXaa	i don't like it i left from there today and i had to do 2 security checks cuz i had to go to a different terminal and i am now at home and my bags are still in LA soo yea that sucks..|`|72f802b5a9052f334cc57c6950295e3caa	It's excellent horseshoe shape is very easy to find your way around in....They all should be laid out like that..It would be good if they built an inside security moving side walk to avoid multiple security checks for the very high percentage of peeps changing planes, but it was built before they invented security stuff...|`|ZCLtuEiNaa	It sucks, its huge and the security is terrible. Fly in/out of Burbank airport, its much better and is just in another part of LA.|`|aa1212d2112ebf6374db523da2b22064aa	It is a busy pain in the ***.  But I love it.  It means I am going some place fun or coming back after a log trip.
L4HURUQraa	There's a shop that looks like this in the row of shops running to exit 11 of People's Square metro station.
HimBbU6caa	If he has a nice sized boat I guess it could. A puppy Magellan lol.    Literally laughing out loud at Bendizzle.|`|PHY2vd6baa	and then a giant puppy  hawk snatches it away....never to be seen again|`|GYORmM4Taa	i dont see why not...|`|30dX1vFTaa	yes, but he has to have a canine passport and you'll probably have to have him quarantined upon arrival for a time.
Z4PArYfTaa	you want to travel for 2 days each way to spend 1 day in australia?  For cost look at airline websites to see   that is a waste of time & money if you are going to visit here you need at least 2 weeks to even have a quick look(6 to 12 months would be better)  for warm to hot weather the northern part of Australia is best all year around temps very a lot depending on time of year let us know when you want to be here & you will get a better answer as to the weather then  at the moment we have flooding up north bushfire's down south & drought in between|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	australia is as big as mainland america so it will depend where you go and what type of accommodation and food you want plus around 1600 dollars each for airfares    personally i say 5 days is a waste of your time and money as you will see very little|`|KNXRyBfCaa	Your are probably looking at about $2000 (Australian) dollars per person for flights. Plus depending on what you do, it will cost about $400 a day for accommodation, meals and getting around depending on your preferences. Add a bit more if   So all up about $7000+ australian dollars.  If you travel in about March/April or September/October you will still get warm weather but not too many crowds.
9ZV1QGTAaa	Your best bet is one downtown.... it the Riverside Clarion.    http://www.clarionhotel.com/hotel-roches...    There is nothing right at the stadium....and if there were you wouldn't want to stay there..the stadium is in the hood.     Downtown is just a few min. drive to the stadium.    If you want to go out for a drink...go to St. Paul Street...or Pane Vino on Water Street.    If you are a female or your daughter is coming...go check out the Sue B. Anthony House.   Also the Eastman house is pretty cool.  If you are coming with children the Strong Childrens Museum is a MUST!!!
