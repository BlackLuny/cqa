ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.|`|En0r0UQ3aa	Check with hotels.com for recommendations of where to stay that's close to activities and affordable.

I've included both relevant acts below.

xFn2vOIKaa	You have gotten some good advice and some bad advice.    Good advice - Be careful of East Austin.  When people say that, they mean east of I-35    Bad advice - People telling you to go to North Austin/Pflugerville/Round Rock.    Given you want to be near cool stuff, you want to be near downtown, but it will be very difficult to find a place there in your price range.    If you go north of downtown, you quickly end up near campus and start paying high prices for the space you get and you are around college students.  If you go so far north you pass campus you aren't really that close to all the goings on.    If you go south of downtown you can still be pretty close and find something in your price range.  Heck, South Congress has a lot of cool things going on in its own right.    This site has a map of apartments in town.  It is color coded by rent so you can see what you have to pay to live around downtown.      http://everythingaustinapartments.com/    I don't know enough to recommend specific places, but I don't think you will have any problem finding something in South Austin in your price range.|`|O71xlcG3aa	I like the areas around Manchaca and Lakeline (up and down 183).  Manchaca is further south but only about 15 minutes to downtown.  North around Lakeline is a little farther away but there are also a lot of great places for people your age around there.  Or Parmer, McNeil, Harris Branch, and places near to those are also cool areas.  Try to stay away from east Austin and Rundberg areas, I think they are a little scarier!  Austin 360 is a cool website that can give you a good idea about where everything is!

LZJPMl8raa	You travelled already in June? I asumed it was 2008.

Also bear in mind uni holidays are pretty long so plenty of travelling opportunities there (again, assuming you can afford not to work in the holidays.....)

If I had decided to leave it till after I'd graduated, I probably wouldn't have got round to doing it|`|BpChBQBQaa	I would say the most (socially) appropriate time is when your young.  And before Uni.  At a young age a lot of young peoples minds arn't entirely made up in choosing what they want to do.  Going travelling and broadening your horizons definately helps mature our thinking and gives us clarity of thought for choosing what we want in this life.    I say get out there and travel.  Explore things.  Make mistakes, learn things that only this sort of stuff can give.  Uni can come anytime but rest assured you will have more strength of mind in knowing what you want.    I went travelling at 23 for two and half years.  I realised that I was quite transient and was therefore rather annoyed with myself for not doing it sooner.  Since then I've been in the outdoor industry and do lots of expeditions.      ....but only you can decide.  One things for certain, because of the way things are in society you will find it increasingly harder to break away and travel the older and more into your "career" you get.

There aren't just taxis around to be haled, and when you do get one, they aren't cheap.  You often have to call ahead to have one when you need it.  People in Los Angeles also drive very fast and offensively compared to the rest of the country.|`|YJevRzoMaa	Our taxi drivers and horrible.  Last time I had to use one before I would even get in I made sure he could understand English and told him if he went over 60 miles an hour on the freeway I would not pay him.

Here is what the sticker looks like and more information about LA taxi cabs.  http://www.socalthemeparks.com/southern-...|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Hmm. We're really talking apples and oranges here. LA is not Boston.    Sure, you are going to find "foreign immigrants" (isn't that redundant?) driving taxis in LA. The few times I have taken a taxi, the drivers have been good drivers.    My question is, why would you take a taxi? Maybe in NY or Boston, you can do that because it's a small geographic area. In LA, the city proper is 500 square miles, and the greater metro area is about 10,000 squre miles. A taxi ride from Universal Studios to Disneyland will cost about $100. We just don't do that here because of the distances involved. This is a car town by necessity. Better to rent a car.|`|lzEuuseJaa	LA taxi drivers probably would be similar to Boston's in your eyes. I take taxis to the airport a lot from the westside and eastside and downtown LA, and yes, they drive fast, in part that's because what most of their passengers seem to want. Many are middle easterners, but they do speak English, and really aren't too bad even if they don't seem all that friendly at first. When I had on a cast for awhile, I had to take taxis on short local rides and even though it probably annoyed the drivers, they were nice.     One thing I've learned is it's best to keep the taxi door open until you're buckled in. And don't expect great air conditioning. Also, they do know the best / quickest / least expensive way to get places and they will use it, in my experience. Taking a taxi is generally expensive in LA because it's so spread out. Public transport isn't as good as in Boston, so a car is the way to go in LA.|`|MyP6wDizaa	I have never ever met a person who lived or visited L.A. take a taxi. Why can't you rent a car? It's cheaper and more reliable.

eF3HkR1daa	Depends what you're looking for really. If you want to move somewhere with a warmer climate like in FL, California or Texas or even Arizona would be a nice option. Up north, Colorado is gorgeous, but has an awful amount of snow. Ohio has city suburbs with a nice family atmosphere (Cleveland). Being in Ohio or in the midwest is great for making roadtrips to places in Illinois, Michigan, PA and even to the east. The east coast is great too, I'm slightly biased towards Washington DC and the surrounding areas.     So I guess you'll have to decide based on 1) what kind of weather you and your family enjoys 2) schools, if your kids are in school 3) how far from FL do you really want to go...|`|YCICrIKyaa	Of course I'm going to say the Chicago Suburbs because I live here -.- but honestly, moving right now .....

zBWefnYHaa	If you look at packet prices for travels to Europe you will get a fair impression, they are often about as expensive as you traveling on your own bookings using the same kind of accommodations.   But the catch is, when going with a tour you need pocket money too, that can run to half what the tour will cost you if a lot of optional excursions, and outings to pubs and so on, are on the plan but not included in the price.    If you travel in western Europe you can expect to spend at least $75 per person per day as absolute minimum, staying in hostels and doing your shopping in the cheapest supermarkets, spending near to nothing on sightseeing and drinking and as little as possible on travel.    If you want to travel by train, stay in a moderate or cheap hotel, spending a moderate amount on sightseeing and having the odd drink, count on $150 per person per day at least, more if you will travel a lot or many long distances, or when you want a better grade of hotel or spend more on luxerious dinners and evenings out.  The average tourist in the Netherlands seems to spend about $US 300 per person per day, so if you think you are average, that is a good number to aim for.    Eastern Europe is still a little cheaper, but the capital cities are catching up fast, and the difference between hostels and hotels is steep, and hotels are getting near in price to those in the west.|`|AA11155311	It all depends on how far you want  to go and how long you want to stay. Also how luxuries hotels,food, sightseeing etc. you want to do.  For a minimum one week tour of europe with bare required luxuries you can easily spend 150 dollar a day.That is approx.1050 dollars plus air fair from north america. For more luxurious trip you need 2000 to 3000 or 285 to 425 dollars per day.|`|O71xlcG3aa	Well it really depends on where you go and for how long.  Some places are more expensive than others.  I went to Germany, Austria, Poland, and Switzerland.  Everything is moderately priced there.  I would look up the Euro Rail and pick a few places that you think would be interesting along its route.  It is the cheapest way to get around.  Most of the hostels aren't that expensive.  I would plan on taking about two grand for each of you for a trip of about two to three weeks.

4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	It's a great place for water sports, including snorkeling, scuba diving, surfing, and body surfing.  It has some of the nicest beaches in the United States.  The Maui Ocean Center is an excellent aquarium, one of the best I've seen.  Lahaina is a scenic old whaling town.  It's a great place to go sightseeing or go to a luau.  It also has the largest banyan tree in the Hawaiian islands; it takes up a whole city block and it's an amazing sight.  A helicopter tour is fun too.  I'd also recommend spending a day driving to Hana.  You should start early and plan on taking the whole day because there are so many tropical forests, waterfalls, and other sights to see along the way.  Get a good guide book (I recommend "Maui Revealed" -- see the link below) so you'll be able to find the best sights.  Driving to the top of Haleakala is another very scenic drive, and if you're a little more adventurous you can bicycle down it.  Just be aware that it's 10,000 feet high and the road is steep in places.  For an inexpensive dinner you can go to the Big Wave Cafe in Kihei.  If you go between 5:00 and 6:30 PM you can take advantage of their early bird special, which is two entrees for the price of one (see second link below).  In Lahaina you can go to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company (if you don't mind being asked trivia questions about Forrest Gump by your waiter) or Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant.    [edit]  I almost forgot to mention that if you're going between now and April you should also plan on a whale watching cruise.  The humpback whales are there through April and they're an awesome sight.  You can go on a combined whale watch and snorkeling cruise and get both activities for almost the same price as either alone.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	The Haleakula volcano is a must see especially if you go up at dawn (so I have heard).    Avoid the road to Hana it is a tourist trap.    Kanapali probably has the best choice of restaurants sorry I haven't been there in awile. Lahaina is a good place to do shopping.    Have fun Magnum.

Hope that helps.|`|RtHq6y78aa	I was just there last year with my husband for our 25th wedding anniversary.  LOVED IT!  We rented a car (Mustang Convertible) and drove around the whole island.      LOVED -   1.  Haliakala Crater       a.  That general area has a winery.  We bought some pineapple wine and had it shipped home.  2.  Road to Hana (we found it interesting that they let old cars just sit and rust along the road...)      a. we swam in the waterfall pools      b. look for the rainbow trees...so cool  3.  Trilogy Tours       a.  Catamaran ride to Lanai and snorkeling (best part of the trip)  4.  Lahaina - LOVED that city and every place we ate was great.        Arctic Wave Fish and Chips is good and so is a place directly across from the huge banyan tree.  5.  Ioa State Park (it's only about a 1/2 walk on a trail but we loved it)    **Save your park pass from Haliakala Crater and you can get into Ioa Park free (we didn't know this)  6.  Kaanapoli Beach is the fun place to be.  7.  Go to the lava rock side of the island...SO COOL    Kehei is boring and so is Kahului but you need to drive thru them to get to the good stuff|`|kJG5FFXpaa	I don't know, but take me with you please!

vdW2CaBpaa	With a roommate - $30,000  W/out - $45,000    If you are coming here for the first time, youll want to get a feel for the cost of living. Rentals for the Downtown area: 1 Bedrooms start at $1600, 2 BRs are $2000 and up. Near the University of Hawaii, they are about 1/4 less. Add utilities costs to those (roughly $200 for cable, internet, electricity). Parking varies considerably. Email me if you need a list of rentals. I dont charge or make anything from them or handle any rentals. Tip: keep a rental application handy (send me a request and I will send you one). I would fill it out before you arrive.    6 months expenses. That can range from $1500/month (no car, living with roommates, not much going out), to as much as you want to spend. In your own apartment, with a car, and able to eat out 2-3x/week - $2500 minimum, $3500 would be a lot nicer (large one bedroom for $1500-$1700/month) + car than runs ($500/month) + food and other stuff. I would say $20,000 and you could not work for 4-5 months.    On a fixed budget? Most likely you will want a roommate, so they can also sign a lease with you. Be sure to keep your personal references handy from wherever you are now. Youll need a deposit equal to one months rent, + 1 months rent in advance. You also want to have a good list of professional references from work. Your present supervisor and/or manager and the new one as well.    Also check Craigslist Hawaii. Be careful, there are some ding dongs on Craigslist. You may want to try rent to room near town, such as in Kahala, Waialae Iki, Hawaii Loa, Wailupe or Aina Haina. They arent too hard to find, and your credit wont be as big an issue as getting an entire apartment.    OK, now for the juicy stuff. Vacation rentals. VRBO is by far the best place to check if you are renting a place for 3 months or less. The best approach is to send emails out to a half dozen places and see what kind of replies you get. Prices are negotiable. Many of these are in hotels too, so look around.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	200K if you can save anything|`|bNBpwCEOaa	Considering the cost of renting or buying a place, gas prices, and the higher prices for everything because of the import tax, I would say at least $100k+ a year.
36ukxyZPaa	It IS cheap.    Well, you're gonna need money for travel - I'd take 200 quid for the two weeks. (You wont use that much, but you're better safe than sorry.)    ANd maybe an extra 200/300 quid for other things, like snacks and gifts or whatever.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	cheap, nice but better in summer weather wise, they take any currency pound, dollar, euro....etc. have fun and watch belly dancing and eat Kebab.|`|11hMqNJJaa	Where abouts are you goin?    I've been goin for years and love it!    As your all in you wont need loads, just money for snacks and drinks when your out!    You'll prob wanna go on boat trips...there usually about 10 for the whole day..with food!    Id say 250 max...but there are markets and loverly shops, so if your into bags and shoes!!!!|`|4ANGYjIOaa	I change 400 into lira and always have some left. there is so many nice things to buy, at least this way you will have enough to do some sightseeing and boat trips if you want to.
77c01ce8cf82af273d427545bf48db7eaa	It will be far from cheap, or quick. You might be able to stow away on a tanker, and get there cheaply, but it will take quite a while.     The expensive option:  http://www.cruisecompete.com/itins/orian...

03sLrNPCaa	Please refine your question a bit.  The Pre-columbian period means all history up until the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries.  Or some definitions say until Columbus discovered the new world in the fourteen hundreds.
mGsGeAG6aa	Yes.    Banned breeds   The following four breeds cannot be imported into New Zealand: American Pit Bull Terrier, Dogo Argentino, Brazilian Fila, and Japanese Tosa.    Other breeds or types of dogs can be added to the list of restricted dogs, but only after an Order in Council is agreed by Parliament.     Before recommending such an Order, the Minister of Local Government is required to consult with local government, animal welfare organisations, dog clubs and veterinary practices, as appropriate|`|9YRH9LXpaa	So i've heard its illegal.    Its kinda weird. A few weeks ago i went to my aunts house and she had a Dogo Argentina at her house(She told me it was illegal). I'm thinking of calling the pound now! (We live in New Zealand).
Btsctjydaa	If you have a wife, she will spend it all anyways. So what difference does it make what your salary is?|`|1148622cf8972dbc25aac49df8fd7415aa	Its difficult my friend. 2000 usd is the rent of apartments usually, unless you share, but i think you cant share due to family. and food etc. are also expensive. dont think of going for this rate. in middleast, travel, transport, having your own car and apartment rent is very important before you decide to go there.
NNDcJb8Xaa	The Sanskrit word "MALADIVE" meaning "garland of islands" paints the picture.    Imagine a garland of 1,193 pearl shaped islands and 20 natural atolls scattered across the equator in the Indian Ocean. Only 199 islands are inhabited and 87 of these are currently operating as resorts. In 2005, the total population of the Maldives was merely 349,106 inhabitants. Male, the nation's capital, has a land area of approximately 192 sq km and a population of about 74,069 residents.|`|fe4d012a47bf2cc194cb4029a22da294aa	Maldives?? Is paradise of lot of colourfishes with a garden of colourful corals..really really big corals...never seen place like dat before...but its in indian ocean....been there...lovely..marvelous..|`|DdNAqWulaa	a nation of hundreds or tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean - just south of India.  It's beautiful - you should go  because in 20 years with rising sea levels it might not still be there
YvNCOYZZaa	The US Passport site is quoting 3 weeks to get your passport.  You can also track the status of your application online: http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/pro...    If it gets to 7 days out from your trip and you still don't have your passport, you'll need to contact the National Passport Information Center http://travel.state.gov/passport/about/n...      If you lose your passport while in the Bahamas, you'll need to immediately contact the US Embassy in the Nassau: http://nassau.usembassy.gov/    Be sure to make color photocopies of your passports and keep them in your hotel safe or a secret spot in your hotel room.  Also, leave a copies with a trusted friend or relative at home.      When I travel with my passport, it only gets taken out when it's immediately necessary.  Otherwise, I keep it in a particular spot in my carry-on luggage to prevent the chances of setting it down someplace or forgetting where I put it.  Once I arrive at my destination, it goes into the room safe or another secure location and it does not move until I need it again.|`|ItLN7fCBaa	Personally, I would start calling now. I do not mean to scare you. I personally went through that and barely got my passport in time for a trip abroad. And yes, if you do not get those passports, you cannot travel. You will then need to re-book, at your expense of course.    If you loose your passports abroad (to answer your original question) you go to the US Embassy in that Country to get a replacement.
g05wGcPhaa	When it comes to Miami there are literally hundreds of things to do and see. Here are the most interesting ones.     1. South Beach - South Beach is the quintenssential Miami hot spot. From shopping to partying, this area of Miami Beach is well-known for being a trendy locale.    2. Miami Metrozoo - Miami MetroZoo is fast becoming one of the best zoos in the nation. One of the first free-range zoos in the country, the exhibits are entirely cageless. Animals are grouped according to their geographic territory and animals that live together peacefully in the wild are placed in exhibits together.    3. Miami Seaquarium - The Miami Seaquarium is located on the causeway between downtown Miami and Miami Beach. It's a fabulous stop where you can witness an outdoor aquarium experience that's only possible in our tropical climate. Be sure to budget enough time to spend at least half a day there!    4. Everglades - Everglades National Park is one of the most unusual public parks in the Florida. The park is home to 14 rare and endangered species, including the American Crocodile, the Florida Panther and the West Indian Manatee. A large portion of the park is primitive, explored only by adventurists and researchers, but visitors have ample opportunity to walk, camp and canoe.    5. Miami Museum of Science - Check out the latest kid-friendly exhibits at the Miami Museum of Science. You're bound to find a learning adventure for the whole family. The museum is home to the Bird of Prey Research Center and the Weintraub Observatory.    6. Parrot Jungle Island - Parrot Jungle offers visitors a fun, educational opportunity to get an up-close look at tropical birds in replicas of their natural habitats. The attraction routinely hosts field trips and offers frequent educational programs.    7. Miami SkyLift - The Miami SkyLift is an interesting new attraction located in downtown Miamis Bayfront Park. Youll gain an interesting perspective on our city when you ride 500 feet into the air in a helium balloon suspended above the park. The ride lasts about 15 minutes and includes a narrated description of Miami as you ride.    8. Monkey Jungle - Monkey Jungle in southern Miami-Dade County is a truly unique park. While homo sapiens walk through carefully constructed wire pathways, many species of primates scamper above your head, swing through trees and interact with each other in ways difficult to observe in captivity. Keep your eyes open; you never know who's hanging around!     9. Coral Castle - Coral Castle is truly a monument to the uniqueness of Miami! This attractions was built by a Latvian-born Miami resident named Ed Leedskalnin as a monument to his lover. After 28 years of effort, he introduced his 1100-ton coral creation to the world. It's a bit of a trip from downtown, but well worth the time.    10. Vizcaya - No visit to Miami is complete without a stop at the historical 50-acre Vizcaya estate. This European-style mansion offers a glimpse at life in turn-of-the-century South Florida. It's also an extremely popular venue for galas, weddings and other entertainment events.|`|SAqOCOeZaa	relax in the beach|`|TvDubaNxaa	really not that much. if your going there for sure, though you can booze up just about anywhere|`|PKBecNkGaa	There's lots to do: South Beach has a bunch of different restaurants & nightclubs, North Miami beach is a pretty nice beach. There's always some sort of concerts going on. Sawgrass mall is actually in Ft. Lauderdale, but that's only about 20-25 minutes north of Miami. It is a really huge mall (one of the biggest in the country) with a lot of awesome stores, discount stores, and restaurants. Ft. Lauderdale strip is cool too- walk down the strip, lay out on the beach, or go to one of the cool bars. Just stay away from Little Havana, Carol City, and Liberty city, unless of course you need drugs. Hope that helped a little.|`|6fanRjFaaa	i imagine theres plenty of opportunities to find party + beach in sunny miami fla.
CoalvZDkaa	swimming and walking I guess|`|aJp3BbWcaa	Hey try this site http://www.wego.com/flights/airfares/HKG... they offer cheap flights..
JQa86WoVaa	More than enough, depending on where you stay. In Guatemala city, that will not be enough because any decent hotel in Guatemala city will be at least 50 USD a night. If you are staying in Antigua or Pana, that should be more than enough. It Antigua, a "hotel" room which is basically a small room with a bed and a night stand is about 9-15$ a night and plan on at most, for a pretty decent restaurant 2-6$ a meal, six being pretty steep. You can eat cheaper than this. Anyway, like the other person said, Antigua is beautiful and likely my favorite place in the world. It is colonial, and quaint. The houses and buildings are all painted different colors. So enjoy!!!!! You'll have the time of your life|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	yeah you should be fine, it is very very cheap there.... i recomend you go spend some time in antigua it is a very beautiful old historic city...  happy travels =)
Ghjaezi5aa	I go there every summer. Been there 6-7 times. Speaking of the resort and comfort, it's excellent (and I've been to many other 5-star hotels so I can compare). Since you can find almost everything on the website, I'm going to tell you what the website does not: the rooms are very comfortable, very clean and nice, you will find many restaurants for your taste, many bars to keep you hydrated and happy all through the day, all kinds of water sports, archery lessons, water games, water gym, a fitness center and a friendly and caring staff. The food is great - in the main restaurant you can find anything, from Turkish traditional food to sushi, and there are other restaurants as well (Turkish, Italian, sea food and barbeque restaurants).     As for the beach and the sea, you can find beaches with clearer, bluer sea elsewhere in Antalya, such as in Kemer. The sea is a little bit wavy and therefore not very clear, you can come across seaweed floating on the water. But it's great on the beach, you will find watermelon and corn service, iced towels that will relieve you from the hot weather. The nights could be a little bit boring, there is a show after dinner and there's a disco, foam parties on certain nights, but for the ones who are looking for a crazier nightlife, the hotel staff is taking you to Lara to great clubs and parties.    The pool area is very nice, around th olympic it's quiet and peaceful, there's a huge bar few steps away. There are enough sunbeds for everyone, and you get towels which you can change for clean ones as many times as you want during the day. Note that the resort is a really big one and it is a 10-minute-walk from the beach to your room.    I would recommend that you try to book a room on the upper floors and with a sea-view.The farther the room is from the elevators, the better the sight is (well you'll have to make a few steps more but if you enjoy visual beauty, it's really nice from the balcony at night especially if the moon is out!!) But there are also honeymoon villas, a VIP place, which make your vacation turn into an even more luxurious dream! You can order everything to your room, and your balcony opens up to the swimming pool, you won't even have to step out of your villa - but staying there is more expensive.    I think you'll really like it there. Here's link to the website in English:  http://titanic.com.tr/default.asp?lang=E...   If you have other questions, feel free to ask.    Addition:  Sorry, I have no idea about where to find the cheapest price. The prices are totally different for strangers.|`|f5772527c1bdb988f613cb36fe20d4eaaa	I've seen it from the exterior...never been inside however.  I've had friends and family who have been to formal receptions (weddings, parties, etc) at the hotel.  They said it was beautiful.  Considering these people are always very honest in their opinions...I would believe them :)
fv2GAAdPaa	I would say St.Lucia. It is a beautiful island.     =]|`|lcj1AKt1aa	St Lucia is a much nicer place and the people are very friendly. The weather is also nice and the beaches are good to go.

They have beautiful beaches and romantic resorts. The all-inclusive Sandals resorts are couples only and offer fantastic amenities. Nassau is  not as quite and laid back as St Lucia and i dont think the beaches are as nice. But Nassau does offer a Sandals and many other all inclusives the are very nice. I have been a travel agent for more than 20 years and have sent people all over the world. If there is anything  I can do to help you please let me know.|`|ZFFLhRtaaa	St.Lucia as well as offering beaches, you will have the Pitons & volcano to enjoy.

But its all for safety its better than slipping and cracking your head opened a day off no school is a dream for a kid.|`|oLhAi73caa	It does become a bit ridiculous with everything coming to a standstill.     But here in England we just don't get weather like this!!     I disagree with the idea of being a third world country because how often does it snow in the Uk?? Were not going to pay all the extra money in taxes for our country to be efficient when it snows every 18 years!! Its not worth it!     People aren't prepared, they have no idea how to drive in icy conditions, what to do, what they need etc etc. Its not worth the training.     Besides, its nice. It gives people a chance to spend time with families, have fun etc. Which is really important. I think any child which hates the snow day is absolutely mad!     Just enjoy it, get on with life. Who cares if you miss a day of work or school its nice to have a break once in a while!     :D|`|FHRfTlCxaa	I quite like the snow..we built some snowmen with my daughter.. :D|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Southern England is coming to a standstill.

It's the same in all the Nordic and Scandinavian countries.    @Penny, Iceland is not Scandinavian but a Nordic country. Denmark, Norway and Sweden are the ONLY Scandinavian countries. Finland is not Scandinavian because they don't share the same languages or ethnic background.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Most likely, in Nordic/Scandinavian countries they start learning English at a very young age.|`|C1y4sOfFaa	Try learning Icelandic.

Be sure to hang onto 25 CUC to pay the departure tax   Either spend the rest of your Pesos or hang onto some for your next visit,  you can't sell them back to a bank in Canada.  Chances are you go once you will go back.  Check below for the approximate rate.    Enjoy yourself Cuba is wonderful.  http://www.oanda.com/convert/classic  http://www.cuba-junky.com/cuba/what-to-b...  http://www.gocuba.ca/en/index.asp|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I don't know if it's still in effect, but a few years ago Cuban businesses were made to stop accepting US dollars. If it's still in effect, I don't know if they would exchange it for you. But Canadian has always been accepted as far as I know, and I've heard you can exchange that there in Cuba. I would ask a travel agent just to be on the safe side.|`|7lQp3nHhaa	DO NOT bring American ! I don't even think they'll touch it.    If they did, it'd be some crazy exchange rate.  You won't see any American people down there either.    You'll have to exchange it in Cuba.  All the hotels, I'm pretty sure, have a small little bank that is there to exchange money into cuban pesos.    Also, dont forget to see what kinda plugs the hotel has, and if you need to bring a converter. Also, bring stuff for the maids and their kids as tips.    I went to Varadero at this time last year. It was great, Sunny and hot all day everyday !      You might wanna listen to someone who's actually been there ! Travellers cheques wont help you much, Or even your credit card.   ANYTHING DEALING WITH AMERICAN INSTITUIONS.  So that means, visa, mastercard, american express.    Just bring Cdn Cash !  I'm sure your resort is all inclusive.......so you'd just need money for some cheap souvenirs, maybe dinner in town, and to pay for some of the daily excursions you go on.....which can be like $80 cdn.|`|AA10041941	I've never traveled internationally but I have traveled alot state to state and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your money is to get travelers checks have that money converted into the checks they are quite easy to use and as far as I know everyone accepts them they are just like spending money, to do this I had to go to the bank in my local area you just tell them what you need and where your going that will do the rest you have to bring id and all that though if you don't have an account|`|DRJtLAooaa	Cuban Covertible Peso is a closed currency - only available in Cuba.  Bring Canadian money - not torn or in poor shape and without anything written on it.  Exchange at the airport or your resort.

3OeE8kMQaa	Try travelzoo.com, it allows you to search multiple discount sites simultaneously for the best price on airfare. Be wary of sites that offer fares that are way lower then the average, often they make up the difference in taxes and fees at the end of purchase.     Good Luck!|`|AA11496012	Are you traveling international or domestic?  Many times it is good to go to the airline's website to book the ticket because with airlines losing money right now, they want you to buy the ticket on their website instead of you buying it on a travel website.  If you buy on a travel website, the airline has to pay the travel website a commission.  Therefore sometimes the price on the airline website is lower than what is on the travel website.  Check the airline website first and then go to a travel website such as http://www.expedia.com or http://www.kayak.com|`|eF3HkR1daa	Farecast.com has always been my preference. I've bought tickets from it to travel within the country and also internationally. I believe its a part of google (I could be wrong) but it compares against ALL travel websites and gives you the bext price, including fare predictions over a week, month or days, suggests if you should buy the ticket now or wait, etc. I love it. I can't see why you won't too. :)

N5Yhctbeaa	San Antonio is a great vacation spot because there are so many things to do there.  You mentioned Fiesta Texas and Sea World, but the Riverwalk is a lot of fun also.  You can take boat tours and see the Alamo and there's tons of shopping.  It seems like hotels are kind of expensive, especially if you stay downtown.  One good place to eat is the Guenther House.  They only serve breakfast and lunch, but the food is very good.  You can check out their menu at www.guentherhouse.com/Menu.aspx    Of course there are all kinds of Mexican food restaurants around there.  One that I can think of is Mi Tierra.  It's located in Market Square, not far from the Riverwalk.  They are open 24 hours a day and have a bakery in the front.  It's a very popular place.  I hope you find somewhere great to go on vacation!|`|VXQFT341aa	Oklahoma.|`|hz7oaQeqaa	South Padre Island.

There is pretty good nightlife, tons of restaurants, Six Flags, waterparks, tons of shopping, and you will be pretty close to Dallas and Ft Worth.

Hope that helps a little, and welcome to Texas!

de4e9edcd9db63bdf2eb13b6a3532830aa	?Each of the Hawaiian Islands has its own personality and character.  So, knowing what type of person you are and what you like to do will help you decide which of the islands you will like.    If you like tourists and fishing you should like the Kona area of the Big Island of Hawaii.  If you like solitude, a tropical feel, a rural atmosphere and you dont mind rain, you should like  the Hilo area of the Big Island.  The west side of the Big Island has a few nice small beaches, including black sand beaches.  Near Ka Lae, the southernmost point of the island you will find a green sand beach.  Big beaches are not prevalent on the Big Island.    If you enjoy scenery, hiking, snorkeling, kayaking or surfing and dont yearn for night life then the oldest of the islands, Kauai is for you.    If you are the kind of person who keep a bathing suit, snorkel gear or a surfboard in your car, then Maui is for you, because it has 120 miles of easily accessible and swimmable coastline, more than any other island.    If you have an artistic temperament or perhaps you like to get away and write, then seek out the island of Lanai.    If you love nature, hiking and solitude, then the most Hawaiian of the islands, Molokai is for you.    Youll enjoy Oahu if you like beaches, shopping, tourists, high-rises, traffic and dont mind a lot of other people.  Honolulu is like a tropical version of NYC, or LA as it was in the smog-free 1950's.|`|1pQK1u6daa	If you are going to travel between the islands basically your only option is by air.  Mokulele, Hawaiian, and GO! are the main airlines that fly between the islands.      Let me give a shout out to the Big Island.  Given your parameters and with only 3 nights, if you are looking for something unique try making it to the Big Island and see the active volcano.  There is no where else in the United States that you can see hot molten lava meeting the ocean.  Visiting the volcano can be a half day or a full day trip dependent upon how close you want to get.|`|goe3y4FPaa	all of them.. just fo for it.. like if short..|`|AA10818433	If you are going to extend your visit, I would personally suggest the island of Oahu.

It is quite fantastic and stay for the evening show "Horizons" it is a fantastic show!  Buy a 4 day TheBus bus pass! It is really cool, and you can almost get around the whole island with it! It is really worth the money!  For an inexpensive restaurant in Waikiki, please go to the Seaside Bar and Grill! They have fantastic breakfast, and dinner there! We have gone there plenty of times for breakfast and a few times for dinner. They have specials all the time!  Have fun and enjoy your stay!!

PSiNv7gUaa	Most airlines recommend that you put any prescriptions in your carry-on luggage just in case your checked luggage gets lost, as for some people it could be dangerous to not have their medication.  I personally have traveled with prescription medication in my carry-on, and nothing was ever said.  As someone said before, it never hurts to declare that you are carrying prescription drugs, if the label matches your picture ID I don't see a problem, but if you are worried about it in any way you can always call the airline and ask them what the proper procedure is.|`|Q6XYkUUNaa	It is wise to declare, without being asked, any prescription medicine in your possession, to the American Customs Officers.

The teams are playing at 10 stadiums - some are existing stadiums that are being improved and others are still in the process of being built.  They should all be ready in time for 2010.    Some improvements that I know about are:  Some airports are being extended/improved (eg Cape Town and an airport outside of George)  They are building a fast train between Jo'burg and Pretoria to take people to matches.    Cape Town is arguably the best place for going to see the matches and also seeing the nearby sights.  It's just going to be pot luck which countries get to play there in the first round matches. The finals are up in Jo'burg/Pretoria, which is also the financial hub of SA.  This area is busy, but isn't as scenic as the coastal areas (Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban etc).    South Africa is quite big - Cape Town to Jo'burg is a 2 hour flight.

I have to warn you if you do want to come be careful be very careful the crime is out of control here, you have to constantly over your shoulder always expecting the worst.

Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir built another mosque which has stood to the present-day.

In 1399, the Mosque caught fire and what was not destroyed in the fire (very little) was damaged by unseasonable heavy rain.

To Live in or Near Denver:  Highlands Ranch, because I just moved here a month ago and my girlfriend and I looked at the whole Denver area for the past year and a half.  We choose Highlands Ranch, because it is close to the mountains, it has 4 rec centers, a library is right next to us, i could go on and on and on, but I don't want to get too detailed and boring.    Small Town to live in:  Durango, is a great town to live in, but this could be a draw back or plus for you, it is pretty far away from any major towns. Albuquerque, NM is 214 miles and 3 hours and 40 minutes away driving from Durango.  Denver, CO is 336 miles and 6 hours and 25 minutes away driving from Durango.  Phoenix, AZ is 453 miles and 7 hours and 40 minutes away driving from Durango.  Salt Lake City, Utah is 393 miles and 6 hours and 40 minutes away driving from Durango.

VAZBvsoRaa	El Tamunangue consta de nueve partes:  1-. Presentacion  a  San Antonio y la Batalla  2.- El yiyivamos  3.- La Bella  4.- La juruminga  5.- La perrendenga  6.- Los calambres-caballito  7.- Galern  8.- Seis corrido  9.- La Salve  Paz y amor: muy completa tu respuesta, INDICA porque razn eres una "colaboradora destacada", solo debieras agregar que el tamunangue es un baile del Estado Lara, en Venezuela,que se baila el dia 14 de junio en honor a San Antonio.Aunque se ha extendido a otras regiones del Estado, el TAMUNANGUE, era bailado inicialmente  en los pueblos de El Tocuyo, Curarigua y Sanare.  Tiene sus raices en las tradiciones de los ****** africanos., traidos a esas tierras como esclavos y que al unir estas tradiciones o creencias con las de la religin catlica, dan origen a manifestaciones culturales-folkloricas originales  El Tamunague conjuga  elementos sagrados y profanos.asi, se inicia con la "Presentacin a San Antonio",  donde le pden prmiso al santo para iniciar la coreografa. En esta primera parte esta incluida tambien lo que se llama "La Batalla", en la cual, despues del permiso al Santo y de haber "consagrado  las armas " ( garrotes ), los  ?bailarines?  inician .una batalla de garrotes.Segn algunos estudiosos de  las consecuencias del sincretismo entre las creencias negras y occidentales, mucho de las fiestas de origen africano, son simplemente una recreacin de lo que los esclavos  veian  hacer a sus amos y lo repetian caricaturizandolo o simplemente haciendo una parodia con los elementos  rudimentarios que podian poseer, de donde se podra sospechar que "LA BATALLA"  del tamunangu  seria un duelo de esgrima  caricaturizado.  Deciamos anteriormente que  el tamunangue conjuga elementos sagrados y profanos pues el 3er  son o "La Bella" viene  significando la corte del hombre hacia la mujer y el 6o son o "Los calambres -caballito", ya es la recreacin del acto sexual y  "los calambres" la significacin del orgasmo.  Ojal algunos de los lectores pueda profundizar mas en esta simbologa, muy interesante pues nos puede llevar a tratar de desentar?ar lo que existe detrs de las manifestaciones flkloricas de nuestra Amrica.    SALUDOS|`|i0XLU6eIaa	Hola amigo...    LOS SONES DEL Tamunangue  Presentacion a San Antonio y la Batalla:  Marca el inicio del ritual. Comienza con una introduccin instrumental y luego es interpretada por un do masculino. Paralelamente, dos hombres simulan luchas de esgrima con varas.    La Bella: Caracterizada por un ritmo alegre y acompa?ada de gritos, consiste en una copla cantada mientras una mujer es perseguida al tiempo que se le entrega una vara de vez en vez.       El Chichivamos: Tambin llamado Yiyivamos, es un son responsorial en ritmo de tambor. En este baile, se saluda al santo y luego se inicia el baile en parejas sueltas y por turnos.     La Juruminga: Consiste en un verso cantado por una solista y contestado por un coro que anima a los que bailan. En este son, el hombre realiza movimientos de galanteo mientras que su compa?era toma la falda con la mano izquierda y con la otra, sostiene una vara. Cuando la pareja se cansa, entregan la vara a otra y as sucesivamente.         El Poco a Poco: Recibe su nombre de su primer movimiento, una pantomima de montaje de un caballito.Se compone de dos partes. En la primera, una solista canta y el coro responde y en la segunda, hay un allegro a dos voces en cuatro frases repetidas.   La danza es una pantomima bailada en giros enteros donde el hombre persigue a la mujer. Luego, ste sufre de calambres y debe ser auxiliado por ella, quien lo monta en el caballo para llevarlo a sitio seguro. Aqu tienen lugar improvisaciones humorsticas.    La Perrendenga: Ritmo alegre pero no ms que el Poco a Poco. En esta danza de carcter responsorial, tambin se usan varas pero para sugerir galanteo en vez de lucha.    El Galern: Son en honor a San Pascual, supuesto amigo de San Antonio. Se basa en una poesa que dicta las voces de mando para el baile, que puede realizarse bien sea en parejas o alternadas o simultneamente a manera de competencia.    El Seis figuriao: Tambin llamado Seis por Ocho, Seis Florido o Seis Corrido. Es el baile que cierra el Tamunangue y recibe su nombre porque lo ejecutan seis bailarines. Tiene un corte criollo en su estructura musical.  Dos parejas sueltas o enlazadas forman una especie de esquina alrededor de otra que baila haciendo figuras tpicas de la danza local y pasos de baile de saln...    Espero te sirva...te dejo un link donde te habla sobre su historia ok!...

No solo por los precios, sino por el psimo servicio en general. Para empezar en los lugares "tursticos" muy pocas personas hablan Ingles, te atienden mal en los hoteles y restaurantes no importa que sean unas taguaras o "5 estrellas", el criterio de clasificacin de estrellas para hoteles dista mucho de los internacionales, no hay actitud de servicio, nuestras ciudades son sumamente peligrosas, la mayora de los sitios bonitos estn sumamente sucios y descuidados, no hay oficinas de turismo, en fin todo lo que no debe ser en un pas que desee desarrollar el turismo.

They offer great prices and it's safe just like the other travel websites (expedia.com, travelocity, etc.)    The difference is that I do not need to consult with the agent unless I need travel ideas or help. Plus the reason why I do this is because it's a little bit CHEAPER!

A ilha era anteriormente conhecida por Kallisti, Strongili ou Thera, nome que ainda hoje ostenta em grego.O que quer dizer que, o nome e italiano por causa dos antigos conquistadores da ilha, que eram da cidade de Veneza na Itlia.

VAZBvsoRaa	Para explicar acerca de la inseguridad en Venezuela es necesario conocer como funciona el "chavismo". Es algo increble diablico y maquiavlico. La historia comienza as:         En el centro de las ciudades de nuestros pases  circula o habita una variopinta fauna de personajes: Pordioseros, dementes , muchos de ellos que llegaron a la demencia por la droga o el alcohol, delincuentes de poca monta, recogelatas, desplazados que comenzaron como ni?os de la calle, sin hogares lo personas que por problemas familiares fueron a dar en la calle y ahi se quedaron. Son seres llamados por algunas personas como  DESECHABLES, quienes no tienen  nada que perder, pues nada poseen y para quienes en la calle esta su rebusque.Toma a estos seres y vndeles la siguiente idea: "  Uds  no son culpables de la condicin en que  se encuentran , no tienen nada y viven en la miseria, no porque no trabajan o gastan lo que consiguen en drogas  o alcohol, sino que  son excluidos de la sociedad porque LOS OTROS, ganaderos, o industriales, o profesionales o los que han estudiado, o los que tienen algo, carro, o casa o familia, tienen las cosas que a uds. les pertenece; de manera que es licito que lo  recuperen de cualquier manera hurtandolo  o invadiendo fincas , casas o edificios, o atracando si acaso no lo consiguen por las buenas, el Estado les garantiza  IMPUNIDAD , pues cuando  invaden un edificio, la constitucin que el chavismo implant establece que " por encima de la propiedad privada, esta el derecho a tener vivienda propia"; asi que cada dia  los necesitados y los aprovechadores invaden no solo casas, apartamentos y  fincas .sino tierras urbanas, sin importarle si tienen due?o o no, las demarcan y construyen ranchos en los terrernos baldios de las ciudades, se roban la electricidad y luego exigen al Estado que les coloque el resto de servicios o los reubique. Se ha dado el caso de fincas invadidas en las cuales destruyen o se comen las cosechas y los animales y hasta han asesinado a los due?os de las mismas.Gracias a los altos precios del petroleo el gobierno tiene unos recursos incalculables, de los cuales no tienen que dar cuenta a nadie pues el chavismo se apoder de la Contraloria, La Corte Suprema de Justicia, el Fiscal General de la nacin y encima de eso, en vista de que la oposicin no participo en las elecciones pues el Tribunal Electoral tena montadao un fraude gigantesco con las maquinas de votacin el chavismo  tom  TODOS    los cargos del CONGRESO DE LA REPUBLICA. Como  el gobierno no tiene que dar cuentas del dinero que reparte, a los  DESECHABLES, reunidos en algo que se llama  "CIRCULOS BOLIVARIANOS" se les  entrega una mensualidad y se los tiene en las plaza de Bolvar en cada pueblo, como matones o Tonton Macoutes, para perseguir a los pocos medios de informacin independiente que quedan , para golpear a las manifestaciones de los opositores  o para perseguir a quienes no piensen como los militares que estan en el poder.    A los pobres de Venezuela  se les dan ddivas  o limosnas , no se les  ayuda  a salir de la miseria, pues al regimen no le interesa que se independicen pues ya no podra manipularlos. Por esta misma razn se persigue a la empresa privada . La idea es  que todos dependamos del gobierno para subsistir y asi ponernos un  BOZAL DE AREPAS, A los delincuentes no se les persigue , al contrario se les protege ya que aparentemente es una politica de Estado para lograr que los seres pensantes de las clases media abandonen el pas, como lo hicieron en Cuba y quede    en el pais  seres a quienes se pueda manipular facilmente. ?En que  Estados es fuerte el chavismo? En donde abunda la miseria  , la ignorancia y el atraso. Quedan otros factores por considerar que otros  amigos iran ampliando.|`|77565c121a7684f85d8cdce8db172c67aa	bueno no son el unico pais asi.. aca donde vivo yo ya van semanas en que todos los dias se oyen ambulancias, policias y disparon por todo lado..    la verdad es que a mi pensar la humanidan en si se esta volviendo mas violenta.. y esto genera inestabilidad..    que se puede hacer para frenarla. es dificil.. muy dificil no imposible pero casi.|`|vu5vzAVRaa	Cada da la inseguridad en Venezuela esta peor, esto es horrible los fines de semana nuestras calles se ti?en de sangre, todos tenemos aunque sea una historia de que nos hayan robado aunque sea una vez y lo mas inslito que ahora los Venezolanos nos tenemos que conformar en decir bueno por lo menos me robaron y no me mataron, en este pas sumando los muertos del fin de semana de estos cinco a?os son mayor a los muertos de la guerra de Irak.|`|DMop5zA6aa	Pues la verdadno se pero no lo dudo las muertes en Venezuela los fines de semana son muchas ms de las que se ven reflejada en las maquilladas estadisticas de la policia y el ministerio de interior y justicia entre comillas muy grnades.|`|O2cuTb37aa	Si, si amigo la inseguridad esta desatada, me han intentado robar dos veces en plena luz del da y sin contar con las cantidad d emuertos que hay cada fin de semana, te lo dice uno de la ciudad que quedo este a?o en primer lugar delictivo XD...bno q mas pa lante..............saludos|`|ZtjRMhAtaa	SI TU VIERAS LO QUE VIVIMOS EN MXICO CREO QUE UN TODO EL MUNDO LA COSA ESTA DE LA  MIERDA  SALUDO CUIDATE MUCHO|`|vcqSFC1xaa	soy de venezuela... y que pienso... es horrible vivir en un pas donde no puedas salir, pasear, estar sentado en una plaza... en mi ciudad San Juan de los Morros, matan a cada momento, muchos jovenes y adultos estan violentos, los barrios son un foco de bandidos, los taxistas mueren casi todos los da, te atracan en cualqioer sitio, en el centro, en una panarderia, en tu carro, en tu CASA!!!... ya no usas reloj, prendas, ni celular... a veces da miedo ir a hacer mercado... te roban la comida... es horrible muy dificil vivir asi. y o ms horrible es saber que muchos matones son portegidos por la autoridad.|`|7gvvNcfsaa	En la autopista lo mas probable haya sido un accidente...La inseguridad en Venezuela es cada da peor, no han hecho nada realmente efectivo para controlarla se les escapo el problema de las manos.. si he tenido experiencias de ese tipo pues me mataron un hermano para robarle y es algo terrible que nunca llegas a superar...hay que cuidarse y bueno dejar de estar tan tarde en la calle y protegerse|`|nwpAZQpYaa	la verdad es horrible la inseguridad que se vive en Venezuela en mi ciudad hay mucho secuestro ya no estamos seguro en ningn sitio y lo mas terrible es que te matan por quitarte cualquier cosas no les importa nada si estas con tu familia nada as que ojala que las cosas cambien y el presidente este mas pendiente de buscar una solucin a todo esto que vivimos da da|`|p60jBXRLaa	Y tienen una sola persona a quien agradecer....

yvPA8FSsaa	I have had many a memorable night in Las Vegas but the most memorable experience has to be celebrating my wife's birthday at the Top of the World restaurant atop the Stratosphere.  I made the reservations well in advance timed right around sunset.  The entire restaurant slowly revolves around 360 degrees.  The transition from twilight to darkness and all lights below is without compare.      It is pricey but excellent fare and the service it top notch. That was 5 years ago and my wife and her friends we had along still talk about it.      Another memorable experience is to stay at the Venetian which has only suites and pay extra for the Strip View.  We are talking a marble foyer, sunken living room with huge windows, huge beautifully appointed bathroom and canopied bed.  Very romantic.      *|`|mAV5MJQnaa	You can have some kind of a birthday bash with you and your Friends. It depends on how you want to celebrate it, the more People the better.|`|AA10240904	Take her for a night ride in the gondola outside at Venetian, pay extra to be the only two on the gondola.

Make reservations and dine at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris Las Vegas. The food is good and the view is spectacular with the with great views of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains.    Another nice place to dine is  the Top of the World Restaurant at the Stratosphere. The restaurant is 800 feet above the strip and it revolves around 360 degrees every hour.

The room was fabulous, but we sure made good use of the jacuzzi in the room.    Check to see if other hotels have that option.|`|aW10tHTnaa	You'd be surprised how many hotels want to please their guests and are therefore willing to set things up for you before arrival.  If you can get ahold of the hotel concierge and let them know its a special trip often times they are able to have a bottle of champagne or wine and cheese trays available in your rooms prior to your arrival.  The conceirge is there to please the guests and can do amazing things.  Im sure it might cost you a bit but the set up and preplanning will mean a lot to her I'm sure.|`|R5yl1yEvaa	A Helicopter tour of the strip at sundown

gkqmrIAGaa	My son was recently in Manila, I don't know where he stayed,but I can tell you it is the poorest that you have seen or could ever imagine. Because they are so poor you have to watch out for your wallet and belongings. I know that he said that the taxi drivers will try to cheat you and they will scream over a few pennies. The Phillipino people on a whole are wonderful people but there is such desperateness. You would think that Manila being the main city that this wouldn't be the case. But it is much more prevalent there. Many live in huts and cannot afford half of the things they need.  I hope this has to to with a Phillipino woman you are seeing.  My son married a woman from the Phillipines and spent a lot of time going back and forth spending time with her and her family.  She now is the daughter I never had.  She is wonderful, she loves my son and treats him like a king of course the love and appreciation is returned by him.  So good luck to you!|`|T6v3RWixaa	Be sure the roof is thick enough so that bullets won't penetrate it.

jTHJhy2laa	What you are paying for is more than a room to keep your stuff in while you go out on the town.You are paying salaries for all hotel employees who help to make your stay a comfortable one.Like the housekeepers who make your beds and the cook staff that makes the room service orders.It takes a lot of people to keep a hotel running,and not all of them are seen or allowed to take tips.That $400 helps to pay them.|`|1f53d307e103593725c9ad616aeeaca1aa	You mean what's the rationale for PAYING $400 a night?

Chances are the hotel is in a prime downtown location, uses top-quality supplies, offers luxury accomodations, etc. After someone stays in the room, it needs to be cleaned, no matter how long they were there. If you don't want to stay there, chances are there are dozens of other people who are willing to pay.

Beautiful beaches that can't compare to any I've seen in my life (I've done my share of traveling in the military) and great local places to hang out and do some site seeing.  I was at St Johns and St. Thomas and they're both uniquely beautiful.  I liked St. Johns more but St. Thomas had it's own charm.  Also check out Venice and Malta which are both near Italy.  Malta had more of a nightlife and Venice is more of a traditional "romantic" old fashion get away place.  Spain is nice too.  I think Japan would be a nice place to go too but I've never been there myself so I can't comment.  But I've always pictured Japan as a mountainous place with cherry blossoms blooming on trees in a serene Japanse garden.  With the gentle melody of a waterfall in the background.

Cause traveling that far can take a tole on you.  And make sure to keep your self in peak physical condition...

I've been planning for years now (but time isn't in my favor) to bike the Pacific Coast Highway. The Pacific Coast Highway, also known as Highway 101, runs the entire length of Washington, Oregon and California. Most cyclists start in Tillamook, Oregon and go from north to south to put the winds at their backs. There are books out there that you can buy or borrow from the library, which have experiences of many other bikers who have gone all the way from Washington to California or even Mexico. I would elect to camp whenever possible to cut down costs. I've referenced a few websites, hope it helps! You'll have to read-up by yourselves and become familiar with what it is that you want to see and make plans accordingly. :)     On a side note, you have to be very alert and prepared to bike the PCH... there have been rare cases of bikers ending up in motor vehicle-related accidents, especially as you get closer to LA.

eO4y3m1maa	2 houses? thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Owning houses has NOTHING to do with it.  The ONLY way he could immigrate to the U.S. would be if he were engaged or married to an American citizen, who could then sponsor him on a fiance or spousal visa. This is complicated and takes a lot of time.  Mexican citizens are not eligible to immigrate under the Diversity Lottery Program...and that is a very long shot anyway.|`|o06O3cISaa	you are retarded... please go live with him in mexico and both of you stay out of the US|`|Lzk24WGcaa	By getting a visa and passport.|`|mmAjpMX1aa	Not true.  House and property ownership has nothing to do with legal immigration.  He can come into this country legally in several ways:    1.  Employment preference.  If he can demonstrate job skills that are in demand by the economy and list companies who would seriously consider him as a candidate for hire (or want to hire him), he can get a visa for that.  This is usually obtained by highly skilled techincal people or health care workers.    2.  Family preference.  If he has any extended relatives who legally live in the U.S., one of them could sponsor him for immigration.  There is only a limited number of people who can be sponsored this way, though.    3.  Immediate relative status.  This one is the one most used; a would-be immigrant marrying a U.S. citizen would be eligible to become legal.  But the marriage must remain intact for five years before the process can even start, and can take several more years to complete.  In the meantime, you may have to live separately for long periods in your home countries as his temporary visas expire.  This, of course, is the most-used category.    4.  Diversity.  If the person is of an ethnic group that is under-represented in the U.S. population, he can choose this category.   This, of course, doesn't apply to the Hispanic population.    5.  Refugee.  He can request political asylum in the U.S. if he can demonstrate that his life would be in danger if he stayed in his home country.|`|GD8d9eVcaa	,,obtener los papeles... que es lo que hara cuando su curso a traves de la frontera ..,,,|`|Ou7Qt3emaa	He can VISIT the US if he applies for a TOURIST VISA from his nearest consulate or the US Embassy in Mexico City.

Tjp1ewFRaa	Im english, i have white straight teeth and most people i know do. Yes we binge drink, only the teenagers though, but is that not what youth is all about?  The weather is actually not that bad. Snow in winter. Sun in summer. Bit of rain now and again but that's totally normal.   London is amazing. Most people are incredibly friendly over here. There's obviously going to be a few grumpy people, just like any other country in the world. People who live in the north are usually stereotyped to be farmers who own sheep and drive tractors. But that is not true.   We have 'Chavs' which basically are yobs/delinquints but there the same as american gangsters (sorry if your not american, i am just assuming you are).  The press make England seem a very negative place but it is actually beautiful and very interesting. :):) x|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Well. for one thing THEY CAN SPELL and WRITE AN INTELLIGENT SENTENCE... they also have bad teeth and talk funny.

Britain, which includes England, Scotland and Wales is the 4th largest nation in Europe to binge drink. In the UK you are said to be a binge drinker if a male drinks 4 pints or if a female drinks 3 glasses of wine. Most people in France have a glass of wine with their meal.    And the only thing we are negative about really is the weather. Everything is then enhanced and blown out of proportion by the media saying we hate or are negative about everything.|`|baxhcxOeaa	haha, I'm from Scotland and I hate to argue with you but we binge drink as a nation too.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	If you have a microphone and speakers (or a headset) on your computer, the cheapest way is using Skype or Vyke. Vyke gives you $1 for associating your mobile number with your Vyke account, which is good for 25 calls to a US phone number.  http://vyke.com    Otherwise, a landline tends to be cheapest, unless you have an international deal on your mobile. You can also buy a phonecard at a shop, which will further reduce charges.|`|94b8KImYaa	Landline in combination with phonecard would be the cheapest. Plus, since there is a minimum of a 5 hr time difference, make the call after 7:00 pm your time. That should make it cheaper in addition.|`|nYi7UJaxaa	depends for how long you will have to stay on the phone.You don't want to run out of coins,you don't want your calling card to end the minutes,so your best one will be land-line.  Cell phones are more expensive.|`|ovQ9lgVgaa	All options you gave are not very cheap, you will need to use voip service for cheapest option.    Try www.voipbuster.com or www.voipwise.com   - these websites need registration for 10 euros. once registered you can call many free destinations including USA phone numbers for free (Mobile+Land line or land lines) from PC.    In case you don't want to call via PC, then you can check the toll free number provided by these sites, you need to call the toll free number then usa number which you want to call.     All options which don't include PC for calling, will require some small charge.    The service is reliable and with good quality. Weekly you can get 300 free minutes to call.    Cheers !!

Of course, it probably won't work, but if it did, that would be the cheapest.
YvNCOYZZaa	For a US passport, all your travel would have to be booked under Vinodh Deenadayalan, including plane tickets, hotel reservations, etc.  For anything that you have to show your passport as ID, the name on the reservation MUST match the name on the passport.

PVMsr2Faaa	Last time I was there, the farthest stop was in Vienna, VA. Right outside the beltway.    There are other stops closer in like Pentagon, Airport etc.|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Orange Line....furthest stop into Virgnia is the Vienna Metro station.  They have two large parking lots.  The station is located just off of the beltway and Interstate 66.    Two other good choices are West Falls Church and East Falls Church, they also have parking lots.    A few words of caution though.  Sometimes those parking lots actually become FULL.  It just depends on what time of day you decide to park your car.  By the early afternoon, some cars start to leave the parking lots and you can find spaces.  On weekends, parking is FREE.  During the week, there is a charge to park...upon leaving, if you leave before a certain time.    I DO recommend the Virginia Metro stations though.  I live in Maryland, but I usually drive to Virginia to take the Metro, as Virginia is a safer state in general and there is less likelihood of your car being broken into.  I've lived in both VA and MD, and let me tell you....VA is a safer state.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	There are several Metro stations in Virginia that have parking along the Orange Line and the Blue and Yellow lines.    Some hotels have a shuttle to a nearby Metro station, and you might want to try one of those.  There are also several hotels in Rosslyn, which doesn't have parking at the station, but all are a quick walk to the Metro station and a 15-minute walk into Georgetown.|`|G80M8TJLaa	It depends on which direction you arrive in DC from - and that depends on where in North Carolina you are.      If you're in the eastern side of North Carolina, for example the Outer Banks, then you will be coming up Rte 95.  In that case you probably want to get off 95 at Springfield, and park near the Springfield Mall, just off 95.  That Metro Station is Franconia/Springfield on the Blue Line.     If you are in the central to west part of North Carolina, and you will travel up 81 and either take 66 east from 81 or switch to a smaller road, like 29 in the Virginia mountains.  In that case, get off 66 at Nutley Street Vienna, and almost immediately  you will come to the Vienna Metro Station on the Orange line.     Both orange and Blue line go through most of the major downtown stations for tourists, and they also connect with the Red line that goes through the others.
UIhbK2xOaa	I was going to send you the same link as the person above me. How long it will take depends on how much documentation is required to prove your Metis ancestry. For example in my case my mother grew up as a recognized member of a traditionally Metis community in Saskatchewan and was easily able to become a member of the Metis society in Saskatchewan, so I was able to register in another province without documenting my ancestors. If you need to document your ancestors there are lots of resources on line to get you started. You will probably need actual copies of birth certificates though, but not for ALL your ancestors, that would be impossible. You can ask the Ontario Metis Society for guidelines. There is also a book that lists Red River census information and people who received scrip, the Genealogy of the First Metis Nation. Here is a link for that:     http://www.amazon.com/Genealogy-First-Me...    By the way, I hope you realize we don't get anything from the government at all just for being Metis. Even if you shoot a moose without a licence you will have to prove you were starving or get fined like everyone else.|`|azypqsphaa	a fed gov office...|`|0ZfZulnzaa	The link below has the application form, the process can be time consuming as you have to search out your genealogy, if it is already done then it will speed things up. As well if your parents and grandparents are registered with the Metis Nation it will help with the process.    There really is no way to determine exactly how long it will take until you submit the application, usually they will give you an estimated time.     My husband is First Nations and we are in the process of getting his Father(deceased) registered under the Indian Act so that our daughter can get her full Status and we were told it could take up to 2 yrs.  I do not think Metis registration will be much different, the more genealogical searching that has been done prior to you submitting the application the better it will be for you timewise.
AA10662056	It depends on college, of course, But it's usually 90-100%. It's not difficult.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Close to %100. The profs tend to give the exact same lectures and exams year after year, so that makes it pretty easy. Then there is the fact that anyone who is motivated enough to go through the entrance exam is probably going to want to graduate.|`|X40Ww89qaa	99% and the ones that don't kill themselves|`|AA11286432	The passing rate is high because the entry rate is low.  The entry exams are very difficult for 90% of the prospective students.  Once in, it is not as bad.      Students who do not get acceptance to a university, attend a cram school.  Locally it is known as being Ryonin or a master less samurai.|`|3xwFPL4naa	Japanese university is all about getting accepted.  Once you pass the entrance exams and pay the king's ransom of a tuition, you don't really have to study or do any work at all.  Lecture halls are mostly empty and students spend their time playing sports or socializing.  This is seen as a chance for them to network and build social skills, because they were furiously studying for the entrance exams 16+ hours a day all through junior and senior high school.      Most actual college-level skills are taught by the employers, not the universities.  The degree is just a piece of paper that proves "I passed the entrance exam and my family was rich enough for me to attend this school."|`|WtYz6VKMaa	hahaha passing rate?i dont know.who cares.  engineering programs tend to be harder to pass so the passing rate is low compared to other fields of program.(in some cases as low as 40% at some point)  the tuition fee of japanese univ. is not so high:around $6000/year for national universities(ones we normally attend).  private universities have their own tuition fee schedule but they approx. cost you double and there are fluctuations among programs

NWopkX4baa	There are plans for the construction of an LRT along Hurontario Street, and possibly on some other main thoroughfares, namely Dundas Street, but no definite dates have been set.
RrEESD6Paa	I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!
FvmrSeqRaa	Expedia.com is cheaper then any site out there! These are where the lowest prices are.    If you don't like the price, my second pick is Travelocity.com    Good luck!|`|1an0UT6Jaa	I suggest comparing prices before you purchase your ticket! There is NO website that ALWAYS has the lowest prices, so always shop around. They all use the same vendors, the difference is their contracts. That why the prices vary from site to site.

AA12370221	wiki tells you better than I could  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_King...    it is all very complicated, especially when it comes to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man    The commonwealth countries used to be part of the British Empire but now govern themselves.  Sharing a common official language, English, there are formal and informal discussions on all sorts of subjects.  A kind of special understanding exists.|`|aiKLvwGTaa	England is a country  Wales is a country.    Together with Scotland (a country), they make up Britain.    Britain and Northern Ireland make up the UK (otherwise known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).    Australia is a commonwealth country, but it has little to no significance on their everyday life. I tried telling a few Aussies that we owned them (they were calling me a Pom, and I was drunk...) They didn't appreciate it much|`|a9bc452f60356f9459d6653f3f409cfeaa	United Kingdom = England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  Great Britain = England, Wales and Scotland    England and Wales have the same government.    Commonwealth Countries are 53 independent Sovereign countries, most of them were former British Colonies. Elizabeth II is the monarch of these countries.     They include countries such as India, Pakistan, Canada, Australia and many many more.    This is the reason why citizens of an of the Commonwealth countries may legally migrate, and work and live in great Britain, and also the Brits can easily go to Canada or Australia or any other counties without a special permit (temporary visa) to work, or get education or any other purposes, whereas citizens of 'ordinary' european countries would need a visa in order to visit certain countries.    hope this helps xx|`|IKCxj9gHaa	England and Wales are as different as Usa and Canada, they are joined in a political system but are two very different countries, many Welsh people will speak welsh and English.    The commonwealth is made up of many countries that used to be members of the British Empire, these include Canada, Australia, new Zea land, India, South Africa and many others across the world, they are all separate countries but like the UK they recognise the Queen as their head of state.    Kent is a county in England, County's are like your states.   Ducheys are parts of the country that are owed by Dukes, these are mainly member of the royal family and they will be the major land owners of that area.|`|c9469a0c25b4c415d92edc506376c2afaa	England and Wales are not like American States.

3fHZOobiaa	In my experience, I've seen that teachers are very different when they are at school and when they are on vacation, they become more pleasing out of school walls... So if I were you I'd hear your mother's words and I'd definitely depart for this journey even without my best-friends, after all, you will stay in Italy only three days, and in your life you won't always have them with you...     Have a good Journey :-)|`|kgBPU4xxaa	This is a great opportunity for you. Yes, it would be nice for your friends to share the experience with you. However, if they choose not to go, that is their decision. You will still have a great time here and you're only talking about being away from your friends for three days. Since you already know you'll regret it later if you don't go, why even consider it?|`|jOM4bBMPaa	It could be a blessing in disguise that not too many others are going on the trip.  You'll feel less like a huge tourist group being herded around like animals & more like a large family traveling around.  Take lots of pictures, and have fun getting to know the other students in your class a little better.  One of them may end up becoming a new BFF of yours after all that you experience together.    Great life motto!  Stick to it and there will be plenty more opportunities like this for you in life.|`|uOIQaS68aa	I'm going on a trip to Italy with my school too. I don't know anyone.

e35d633f7189b4d850994567be3ff3dcaa	It usually takes about 16-18 hours with layover times. I usually stop in Miami and then go to Rio from there, sometimes i stop in Sao Paulo and transfer to Rio from there.Without layover times its about 14 hours and 20 mins. There are shopping malls around copacabana but i'd recommend shopping around Ipanema too as some parts of Copacabana are really touristy. Yea there are alot of single brazilian guys in Rio, and alot of them like foriegn girls too. Jus try and speak the little portuguese you know, we know portuguese isn't easy so don't worry if you mess up.|`|N9XEvwQLaa	It usually takes about a day and a half to fly to Rio from California between flight time and layovers.   Usually, it works out best to fly through Houston, Atlanta, or Miami since it makes a nice break about a little bit before half way through your journey.   As far as things to do around the Copacabana, the beach scene is pretty cool and there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and clubs nearby.   As far as hot guys go, I dont really know because I spent most of the time checking out the attractive females in skimpy bikinis.  But, it would stand to reason there would be hot guys as well.  As far as being taken goes, if they find you attractive they will hit on you.  As far as not knowing Portuguese goes, I wouldnt worry about it too much.  If you make the effort, people appreciate it and about 35% speak English.  Just bring the Lonely Planet English-Brazilian Portuguese phrasebook.  If you really get stuck, and need to converse with someone just use that.     Best of luck    Pauly    PS Make sure you have a travel visa to enter Brazil, it costs a hundred bucks and you can get it from the Brazilian Consulate in San Francisco or Los Angeles.  You need to be careful about street crime in Rio.  Dont carry large amounts of money with you at night.  Travel in groups at night. Keep your valuables and passport in the safe at the hotel.

S1uPEgbTaa	I don't know why its happening.Maybe we are tought to think this way: Buying a house is a first priority goal.    Almost everyone I know ,has been brought up with the idea that the first serious goal is to buy a house:    Mothers: If you want to start a family you should have at least your own house  !!!    Many people inherit a flat from their parents, many others take a ousing loan to by one.    Its better to pay the loan bill and at the end have your own house, instead of paying a rent and having nothing at the end.    http://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/eurodata...    look at here ,actually the rate says is 75%    "Most Greeks have two flats, one in a big urban centre and one on the islands or in the countryside. The house ownership rate is high with about 75%."|`|LiItrPvraa	Iskren, think.    Parents in any other country do buy the houses as well.  Nobody has such percentage.  It is the true that every Greek I know in Australia does have a house or two or three.    It is amazing, they must be collecting houses like other people  collect post stamps or butterflies.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Parents lose their entire life working , just to build a house for their spoiled children.Terrible isn't it?

But what Vasiliki and Cpinatsi told are also true for Turkey. So, I believe what they told you is very possible indeed.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Because more than anybody...    Greeks need their privacy...|`|AA11589437	Because Greek politicians have made the choice of allowing many buildings to be built in the method of "antiparochi", anyone who had a piece of land would give it to a contractor who would build flats sold for profit but the owner of the land would get some flats in return. So, many buildings were built, and parents usually give their children a flat or house when they get married, which is not done elsewhere, as far as I know. If I lived in Switzerland I would probably have a higher salary and pay a rent, because I couldn't buy a house on my salary here or there, but here I have a house that my parents gave me. And their parents gave them one flat each. We mostly invest in houses.|`|fT6VVji9aa	Because houses in Greece are handed down from parents to children ad infinitum.  Also businesses are handed down.  They are very loyal to the family, not like some other countries, sometimes like ours, therefore the houses stay in the families for generations and generations.  Also the families all live together, including parents and grandparents.  Not too much renting goes on in Greece.  Italians are similar in their thinking.|`|oAQib10naa	I don't know about the other countries, but the population of Kuwait is only about 25% Kuwaiti.

Nothing will happen on that land that the fed's don't want done.    2. Forests require massive amounts of water. That is something that is in short supply in Nevada and most of its neighboring states.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Well I don't know, part of Nevada is all federal government, but its good to be helpful with nature, but its part of federal for the unused lands.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	I do not understand your question.  Nevada is naturally a desert area.  "Foresting" a desert in not more nature it is more unnatural.      *|`|AA10240904	Sorry but Nevada is in the Mohave Desert where forest are NOT natural   In the mountain areas there are forests though|`|HAFZs1Liaa	Nevada has plenty of nature, thank you. We don't want or need forests as we have a desert climate.    Until you've lived here you can't appreciate the beauty of the desert.  The starkness of our mountains in the summer.  The desert teeming with life, the desert mice, the reptiles, the insects the coyotes etc.  The Colorado river and the Grand Canyon are as beautiful as any forest in Oregon.  A desert sunset will rival any beach one.    And to answer your question, it would be impossible to grow trees in our climate that you would classify as "forest trees" if they are not already growing there, such as the pines at Mt.  Charleston.  The mighty Douglas Fir would surely die in a minute here.    Next.

AA11349530	most Londoners complain of the cold any time it heads towards zero ... anything below +5 degrees Celsius I suppose ... if it does actually get to zero there's howls of protest ... and any "minus" temperatures and most people are in utter panic and want to hibernate ... half the problem is that people just don't seem to know how to dress when it gets cold|`|OHfZFR31aa	Londoners will complain it's to cold anytime it gets below freezing.

Believe me. nothing, NOTHING you put or use on the outside helps..  Its a combo of your genetics, your surroundings (ie: polution) and what you actually eat and your health..  your hair once it actually grows out and leaves the hair follical, is actually dead material.. Hair is no longer alive.. The point of the live part is in the skin.. So how healthy your skin/scalp is has a lot to do with your overall health as a person.. do you eat properly? plenty of fruit and vegetables, little fatty/salty foods? cut back on processed foods with loads of chemicals.. Drop the soda's... dont smoke cigarettes. Try to exercise to increase blood flow.. cut back on stress..  drink loads of water to hydrate your blood and skin.. Dont over process the hair you do have with chemicals, dyes, heavy products..  All this helps...
AA11341587	You are allowed.  I have heard of people commuting across the boarder to work.    And if doing so, you aren't in the US for 3 to 6 months.  You are there 12 hours to 2.5 days, until you cross back again to go to work.    If someone quits their job and crosses the boarder to stay with a friend they are more likely to get extra questions at the border.
AA11717111	No. Throwing a shoe at the Chinese Premier does not prove that the way the Communist party is governing China is wrong.     It was disrespectful to a visiting dignitary and the protester could have made his point in other less violent ways.     Nevertheless, I agree with the protesters sentiments that the world should keep up pressure on China to improve its human rights record.|`|oeAUkiq5aa	Haha, you know though I'm Chinese, I still think it's funny cos a few days ago Chinese state owned media mass reported President Bush was thrown shoes, but this time state owned media keeps mouth shut, only Chinese websites reported it, what a scene.    PS. Wen is not a competent premier but he's a soft guy, the real dictator is Hu Jintao.|`|asaLj4BTaa	I think shoes throwing will become very popular after these two accidents. us president is thrown, chinese premier is thrown, i think other big figures wont escape the destiny in the coming days. if you are disagree with somebody, just throw your shoes in the public against him, it will make him very embarrassed with very little price. maybe shoes throwing will become a career in the near future, headmasters, bosses, judges, anybody you may throw  by hiring a good shoe thrower.|`|AA11861533	We Chinese do have lots of problems, including human rights abuses you've mentioned. Thank you for your nice care. I don't agree with the gov on many things and of course I'm not satisfied with it.    But this shoe-throwing incident just reflects the uneducated way of a rude protester. If you have a basic logic, you'll agree with me.    What a liberty-labelled country he is in!  Sorry, shame on him. (I would not say shame on Cambridge)    And if you really care about the country and her people, WECOME TO CHINA.   And if you can, you may communicate with people who have been to China. (As far as I know, many people think that China is unsafe and underdeveloped before they spend a day here.)  Hope you read some books about the country, instead of just receieving some disgusting news I would say from CNN or BBC.(Somehow can you deny that they are not liars?)    Anyway, how do you know that "state-run media didnt mention the incident in reports on his visit."?  I live in China, though I'm sick of CCTV, I watched the report right on it. So you are spreading a lie.    Anyway, thank all  of you for your care about my country.|`|V9xCaV1raa	It proves: never speak with savage people.|`|YBbumuyFaa	Depends on who is interpreting it. Last time when it was Bush Chinese media tried to portray it as the loss of face for Bush. So if we use the same logic, I would say yes.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	the shoe attack proves that English gentlemen are extinct...  only rude dudes left...|`|7VxKjpHJaa	Chinese, The Most Envied Race/Civilization    huge land, a pure race, culturely, great economy, great technology, strong military and nukes, most thoughtful leaders, independent political system, physically superior(olympics), superpower    the huge land and pure race combination is enough. mutts (americans), and losers from failed races/civilizations(small countries) envy and fear the pure and mighty Chinese race|`|uVSZcClNaa	Actually Wen Jiabao has more moderate image than anybody else in the Communist Party of China. Remember he was in favor of talks with the pro-democracy demonstrators at Tinanmen Square. The whole point is that he is drawing a flak for the atrocities being committed by others. He is a nice person though if you compare him with others.|`|AA12026078	The feelings of the Chinese must of been DEEPLY HURT after this incidental. I'm wondering somewhere there must be a call for a boycott of UK goods as well.    It must be a shame that the Chinese have to get upset over just one protester or was it because the shoe was made in France...|`|NUDjFfLxaa	I think there is no country in this world can swear that it is perfect in every aspect. China does have a lot of problems and the communist party sucks, but still it is so rude of that guy to throw shoe in that occassion. What did he wanna prove? British are savage?|`|fDCY1iX7aa	It proves whatever you want it to prove
L6nyAX8Aaa	Waiters do fairly well in South Africa... The norm is to tip between 10 and 15% on a bill but if the service is good you can get up to 20%.    An average meal for 2 people cost about R500 (US$50) which means that the waiter will earn between R50 and R100 (US$5-$10) per table served. This is at an average restaurant. At upper class restaurants a bill for two people could easily fetch R1000 for 2 people.    I'd say that a good waiter earns about R12000 per month. This is a decent salary in South Africa.    Cheers    Johann      http://www.makeextramoney.co.za|`|p3mLEnyFaa	Johan J is basically describing a situation of "Upmarket Restaurants".    your average Joe at Spur, or Wimpy is not making that much. they earn perhaps a basic of R 5000, then commission. you have to appreciate the busy periods and release the potential for earnings. but i reckon these guys can make a R 9000 on a good month.
l9c2Uw5baa	I would recommend get your degree - don't go back to high school unless you need to complete certain courses. Try and go to college then university - try that route.

PA0bGBtCaa	Here's why airplanes are loaded the way they are:    First class, business elite, platinum, silver, gold, bronze, slightly yellow colored customers are always allowed to board first because they paid for it. That's what it is all about. Then the coach people are allowed to board.    Not all airlines do it that way. Airlines such as JetBlue board from the rear forward becuase they have proven that boarding that way is faster than letting certain groups from the front forward go. To prevent people who sit in the back from putting their bags in the overhead in the front, the flight attendants simply close those overhead bins until the last group of people who are in the front are ready to get on board.    Southwest boards their planes by A,B,or C. Your boarding pass letter is all about how early you check in. There's no math to figure out there, just check in early.    Also, I want to point out that jetBlue uses both rear and front doors in some of their cities. Boarding through both doors at the same time really speeds up the process and allows the plane to leave on time.|`|ToztjpAsaa	In my experience the people at the rear of the plane DO get on first.|`|ojtINp2raa	I fully agree with you that it *would* make more sense, but higher monetary status (IE: having more financial freedom to buy first-class tickets) apparently gives those 'first class' people the utmost privilege of being first served, first seated, first to be given their little peanut packages, etc.  Quite silly, I agree...but that's the way it will probably always be...not just in airplane-seating but in all aspects of daily events.|`|pF63IMyVaa	the airplane cant pull in that far to allow the gateway entrance to connect to the back entrance. the back entrance is for emergency purposes.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	I heard it was because of the overhead space. If the back people were loaded first, they might put their things in a closer overhead bin. Then when the front people get on, the only bin space would be the back, and that would really become a mess.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	in most cases the plane is usually boarded on the port (left) side of the aircraft   so  the first class passengers usually would turn left (toward first class)  and the rest of the passengers will turn  right  so i do not see why you think there is a delay  plus some airlines do back to front seating as well  and i heve never see any lockers on the airplane either! where are they hiding?|`|e77c54a2105590029b5c1b09151eef4aaa	First on, first off|`|7IfyFXT3aa	People who pay the money for the front of the plane want to be afforded the flexibility to get on whenever they like.  Some of them will board first, to settle in and get their luggage stowed, but many of them will be in the lounge anyway, so won't get on until later.  Most importantly, getting on first means you don't have to spent time standing in the jetway as the queue clears (the worst part of boarding).    Either way, the economy section is filled from the back of the plane first, which is where the real bottleneck usually is - there's generally no more than 20-30 people (out of 100-330 people) up front on any given flight, so boarding them first doesn't really slow up the process at all.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	I'm sure this isn't the only reason... but how about this one:    http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jet...    This happened many years ago, but an improperly loaded jet will fall backwards on its tail.    If only the front passengers were on first to provide some counterweight...|`|2LMDawItaa	Well... the front part of the aircraft is the most comfortable area because of the sound of the engines, therefore first class must be right there. So, there's no way in moving first class to the back of the plane.    I don't know if you've had the experience of one of those full flights where people need to check their luggage because there is no more overhead space... if that's going to happen, you don't want your first class customers to be the ones who would have no extra space, since they paid you more money than those flying coach.    Therefore, they are allowed to board first so that they can be guaranteed their overhead space.     In spite all of this, I do agree it would be much more efficient if the plane were to be loaded strictly from the rear to the front.|`|7wjYI6QNaa	My guess would be for the overhead bins space. The people who have purchased a seat in the first few rows/ classes have more than likely paid extra for the seat (I know with the company I work for it's an extra 15 a seat in the first 5 rows). If there isn't any overhead space the passengers get quite cranky.  You do have a good point there withg letting the back of the plane on first but it wouldn't work. The poor crew would get eaten alive by angrey business class passengers who paid for the overhead room and don't get it. War breaks out!!

TOIOyJ10aa	I am not really an expert on this area. But I do know that you will have to go to the center to get those things. Amstel Station is not really a shopping area, actually I dont think you can find any nice boutique there.  So go to Dam Square, Spuistraat, and Koningsplein.  These places are full of weird, special, professional, specialized boutiques and shops.  Amsterdam is full of tatoo and body shops. Really try Spuistraat, I bet just walking three minutes over it you will find what you're looking for.  Special tip: Piercing shop DARE 2 WARE. It's the best piercing shop in Amsterdam and it's located near Haarlemmerplein.  Ask people, everyone knows the place.  Sorry for misspellings.|`|LA5VwAvIaa	Go to a "smart shop" near the BABA coffee shop -- it is less than a mile from the central train station.

You just give them your preferences and then they don't let you go to those places ; ).  There are cheaper ways to travel, but depending on how long you want to your trip to be, sometimes you can't avoid it costing a certain amount of money.      I'd suggest you look at some travel blogs, or other websites that dedicate themselves to travelers and travel information.     Here's a good place to start: http://www.vagabondbible.com     -Joey P|`|EnhV6LESaa	Two part answer, It's kinda long but I hope it helps!!    Part1 - If you are considering Peace Corps  I just finished a 4 year service as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Pacific Islands (Vanuatu).  You can request where to go but it's all about timing because your skills are matched with a country that needs them. Peace Corps is reliable.  It's a gov't branch so they take care of all your needs (transport costs, medical, living allowance, well-being, etc) and no fees.       In regards to traveling, it's more flexible to travel in-country than out. I visited 11 of the16 main islands during service through "work" and on my own but had to use vacation time to travel out of country.  For vacations, I visited 6 different countries using saved allowance but time was limited.        I recommend PC for volunteering overseas.  I wouldn't take this route if you want to stay in different places for short periods of time.  PC asks you to commit to two years of service in the same country (you're not obligated) and the application process can take up to a year.        Part2 - Advice on planning and cutting costs         Meeting a lot of travelers and traveling myself in Peace Corps you learn how to cut cost.  Some tips:     1)Bum a ride on a yacht and worked as a crew member. A lot of  "yachtees" travel to different countries around the world.   2)Use skills (teach, farming, construction, business) to work on a community project in exchange for a room and food.    3)Found temporary "real" jobs as they traveled.  4)Became friends with other travelers, benefits-offered place to stay in home town, travel buddy to cut down on costs of traveling single.  5)Pay as you go...purchased plane, train, room or tour tickets in countries where you get more for the US dollar.  Can be better than a round the world ticket and more flexible.    Check out this great website:  www.thetravelersnotebook.com for loads of info and tips on world traveling.

AA12088252	Boy, is my cold medicine-induced insomnia going to help you out!  I lived there for 15 years and still go there to see my dad and a few friends.  First of all, Tyler has grown a LOT in the last decade (which means traffic really sucks now even though they are doing a ton of highway/road expansion) and a lot of the little country towns surrounding it (like Lindale, Whitehouse, Chapel Hill, Flint, and Chandler) kind of all just meld into the Tyler city area, so if you were to find a great house that you loved in one of those areas, you'd probably not mind the 10 minute drive to get anywhere other than a grocery store (there is a Brookshire's on every major intersection in most of Smith County - they've run everyone else out of town that has tried to compete, with the exception of SuperWalmart!).    Tyler DOES have an older part - North Tyler, that I wouldn't recommend to anyone moving there.  And then it has an older part that has really nice houses that are well-maintained... kind of a historic district, called Bergfeld or the Azalea District.  If you enjoy living in a very settled area with all kinds of neighbors, then you would be very centrally located to everything here.    Then there is SOUTH Tyler.  It's outside the Loop, has a different zip code, and most Tylerites who are proud to live in South Tyler will SAY they live in SOUTH Tyler because this denotes $$$.  Hollytree WAS the subdivision with the country club and golf course, but now there are newer ones that I don't know the names of that are further down on Broadway and Grande Blvd.      Of course your best ally in this is going to be your real estate agent who can show you houses in your price range and in neighborhoods that "speak" to you.  It's funny too, thinking back about all the areas and time I spent there... there are so many different types of neighborhoods there that just back up into one another... you could cross a major intersection and the architecture, types of cars, and quality of landscaping just dramatically changes like that!    I lived in Whitehouse, which is south of Tyler, connected to Lake Tyler and many people who moved out that way, but you'll be adding some drive time to anywhere you want to go for MAJOR shopping (they've got all the basic fast foods, CVS, Brookshire's, and other little local retails stuff on Troup Hwy/110).    Good luck!|`|rgAuy0MTaa	I love the area of Lindale it's just a few mins outside of Tyler but all around it's quite nice....The areas are really close together and shoping is everywhere:)|`|ApVyzJTOaa	Tyler TX...

t6G6L757aa	Well, according to todays exchange rate - $1,200,000 INR is $36,764AUD. So, $100,000 AUD is $3,263,977.52 INR'    IF YOU BECOME AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN you would be paying $18000, PLUS 40c for each $1 over $80,000 so on $100,000 you would be paying $26,000 in tax leaving you with $74,000    BUT BECAUSE YOURE NOT  you would need to pay $23,660 plus 40c for each $1 over $80,000 so that would = $31,660 AUD, leaving you with $68,340    This would need to be spent on accommodation, transportation, bills, food etc. So I guess it just depends how well you manage your money, and if your wife has a salary as well.     FOR EXAMPLE, if you rented a $600 a week 3 bedroom apartment then that would be 600*52 = 31,200 leaving you $37,140.    Because youre renting you wouldnt have to pay any bills, you would just need to buy your groceries and stuff. Just say $300 of groceries each week 300*52 = 15600  Leaving you with $21540, you would need to pay for transport on top of this, either buying a car or catching public transport such as buses.    If you manage your money efficiently, ( not taking into account whether or not your wife gets a job) there is a potential of saving, I would say around $20,000 ($652,795.50 INR) per year.    On top of that, you would need to take out your son's school fees, but I'm not sure how much there would be..   but there are some good schools in melbourne you can send him too.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	If you are the only one working then 100000 would be enough to have a reasonably comfortable middle class life in melbourne|`|AA12074269	One cost to take into account is the schooling cost - if you are not a perm resident you have to pay the full cost of schooling - which is around 4-7,000 per year.|`|11PFFVtJaa	The Rudd Government has just announced a $42 billion stimulus package to boost the economy, including tax cuts "for low to middle income earners" - if you earn over $100,000 you don't get any tax cuts.  So by the government's definition, $100,000 puts you above the middle income level.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	People with a mid range lifestyle can usually save a little on a salary of $50,000. On $100,000 therefore, you should be able to save considerably more but that will depend to a large degree on the style and location of your accommodation as that will be your major expense by far. The type of transport you use will also make a substantial difference as running a car can be very expensive in Australia. You could potentially save $30,000 but that is nothing more than a wild guess based on very sketchy information.    Make sure that employer funded superannuation is not included in the 100k as you will not be able to access that until you retire or leave the country permanently. The basic superannuation rate is 9% so if it's included in the 100k, you will actually only have access to around 90k before tax.|`|USI22nRMaa	I am planning to migrate in australia, which state would be best suited for me ? my current designation is system manager, IT , i have 5+ years job experience. pls suggest me.

I couldnt believe how easy it was. Everywhere is tourist friendly, and the basics are easy, book a place to stay before you get here, get an A-Z map on arrival (any newsagent or bookstore will sell them- you'll see them everywhere). And believe you me, you will laugh, it is that easy!!!   I'm from Australia - biggest town Id been to was Brisbane, not very big town. Seriously. Don't be worried.

CttXccd1aa	It's hard to answer your question without even knowing where in Germany are you. Germany is a federal country, and bus timetables design vary greatly from city to city.     Basically, there are two major types: one showing all stop times on all stops of the line (typically an excel file with painfully small letters). In this case, you should check in which stop of the line are you (it should be written somewhere on the stop).    The other type only states the stop times of that particular stop. Typically, you have a first column with the hours of the day, and (an)other column(s) with the minutes of each hour on which the bus stops.

lcj1AKt1aa	Yes they do based on this review.    "The facilities and entertainment were outstanding, shows are held every night and if thats not your scene you can relax in the bar area where cocktails are the order of the day. The pool has a swim up bar, many hotels feature these but are often not operating, this hotel was the exception, the swim up bar was open all day and served up some very much needed refreshments during the caribbean(sic) heat".    This is another one:    The Pool Bar 8am - 6pm is funnily enough located next to the pool - which is a vast affair offering ample sun loungers and a very loud animation team who work very hard throughout the day to keep guests entertained with various games, competitions and dance classes and as a result it tended to get quite hectic hence we avoided at all costs unless we were trying our hand at the Salsa . I hear the toasted sandwiches were to die for.    This also:    Facilities    Free-form pool; whirlpool; terrace with sunloungers and parasols; buffet restaurant; international ala carte, located on the lagoon; Italian and Cuban speciality restaurants; beach barbecue; pool bar; billiard bar; 24hr lobby bar; 24hr reception; money exchange facilities; souvenir shop; handicrafts shop; 24hr room service  Room Info|`|fv2GAAdPaa	i am not too sure becaus ei have never been but read the following reveiw which was taken from      http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserRevie...      My husband and I went to Melia Cayo Guillermo on Nov. 21, 04 for a period of one week. It was absolutely beautiful. It's about 45 mins. away from the airport, and the island is secluded, nothing there but a couple of other resorts.   I'll start with the room. It was spacious, nicely furnished, king size bed, with carribean color theme room.   The pool was nice and cool, it has a lovely swim-up bar, and a volleyball net. Activities took place around the pool area e.g. dance lessons, darts, etc. There's a bar right next to the pool which also serves cheese, ham, and tuna sandwiches. The beach is gorgeous. White sand with sky blue clear water. They have huts that are built over the sea, so you can just lay there on a hammeck all day...  If you like snorkling, then you should take an excrusion to Melia luna island which is only 10 km away from the resort..lots of fish, beautiful. But it's only worth it to go with the hotel if you want to have food and pay fifty pesos. we did that excrusion but the second time we went there we took a cab which is 5 pesos each, and then the catamaran to the island which is 8 pesos each with the equipment included.   The food in the resort was excellent, huge selection of every thing, great breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets. I loved the international a la cart.   Overall, had a great vacation over there.    Hope this helped. =]
DHczAdHIaa	There are NO trains from Girona airport to Barcelona.  However, you can take a taxi or bus from the airport into Girona, from where there are regular trains to Barcelona.  A better alternative, and just as quick, would be to catch the bus directly from Girona airport to Barcelona.   It is timed to meet each aircraft arriving at the airport and the journey to Barcelona takes 1hr 10 mins at a cost of 12 euros, for a single trip, or 21 euros return.    http://www.sagales.com/pubdocs/834_aerop...

However, this was Monday and it has cleared a little since then - but honestly since you will be travelling at night, it would be your safest bet.  The biggest problem on the M25 was Jnct 7-9, which you will miss, but even so...     Also check your flights with your airline, as I know they have been cancelling flights.    All the best and safe travels.|`|pfQ3RL0Jaa	yes I knew someone at same junction on M25 yesterday for 5 hours|`|DhhF9pF9aa	Both runways remain open this morning and we're working hard with the airlines to minimise disruption and operate a near full service.

uX1dhp5Iaa	What are the subjects that are applicable to ALL students?  - math, english, theology and pe. all takes 4 sems to finish.      Is there any subject difference between the four main years of college? [i.e. Math disappears at 2nd year]    -depends on your course. higher math for engineering students , higher science for chem. studs the likes.       What are the notable differences between high school and college?  - the hour. freedom. indifferent professors.     -schedule? [is it true that we choose our sched?]  yes. if you are an irregular student by choice.    -sections? [is it true that we have different classes for each subject and different people we share our classes with?]  yes.     -time [does the dismissal and arrival time differ each day depending on the schedule?  - yes    -weekends [we have to go to the university on weekends?]  depends on your schedule subject. Community Service (a requirement) usually goes on a weekend. However, some students avoid this by becoming athletes.    -vacation [do you still have summer, Christmas, etc..]  yes, holidays xmas until new year about 3 weeks tops. sem break usually in november (2 weeks). summer, you decide if you want to take summer classes or not.    -assemblies [do you still have them?]  yes. only if your professor wants you there and requires an attendance, otherwise you can ditch the stupid assemblies.     - field trips, other social activities [is it still existent?]  somewhat... depends on the subject. but it isnt called a field trip (childish ) :) . we had field trip when i was a fresh man. you still need consent of guardian though if a minor.       -fraternities, sororities [what are they, really?]  nah... bunch of groupies who hang outside school grounds and wait for the other group to get out of school gates to glare at each other. Or if i remember, a sisters brother's fraternity had a cleaning spree on streets. almost non existent depends on school conservatism. Graduate schools frat/sor are somewhat sophisticated though.       If I finished my first course and decided to take another one, do I have to repeat the subjects taken in the first 4 years?  - no.|`|kv6dGWJHaa	idk. my counselor told me to ask one of the college counselors over there.    i know that summer break for them starts earlier because school usually resumes in May.    holidays are also pretty different, because they have a lot of fiestas.|`|50pKPrHxaa	Different universities have different rules regarding a lot of stuffs.    1. yes i was able to choose to schedule. usually they have around 5 sections and then you can choose what schedule you would like to be in.  2. if you are a regular student you would have 1 set of classmates.  3. yes it will depend on your chosen schedule.  4. some universities or colleges have classes during saturdays some does not have (will also depend on your schedule)  5. yes we do have vacations like christmas vacations (around 2-3 wks), sem break (2 wks), summer break(2 months except when you have to take some summer classes)    field trip is mostly optional.    you don't have to repeat previous subjects that you have taken as long as you've passed them.    Good luck|`|PdtpXFZ8aa	Prior to enrollment, you have to meet with the registrar of the university (equivalent of academic advisor in US) youre planning to attend if you want your college units credited. You may have to defend some of your subjects to be credited since most registrars dont credit subjects if they differ in course description even though the course content is basically the same.     Students got to pick their classes but on a first come first serve basis. During enrolment, you are given a list of subjects and number of units you have to take for the semester. Usually, you attend each class 3 times a week. Foreigners are exempted to take 6 units of the compulsory NSTP and CWTS which are a weekend classes.    There are two semesters in college except for tri semester colleges and universities. First semester is in the months of  June  October. You go through a week or two of semester break then back again for the second semester in the months of November  March and yes there is Christmas break. There are at least one or two field trips in your 3rd or 4th year in college, more if you are in the college of Hotel and Restaurant Management and college of Tourism.    There are school fraternities in the colleges of Law, Medicine, and Engineering in the big colleges/universities (UST, UP, FEU) of the Philippines. Im not so sure of sororities.    If your course is under the college of Engineering & Architecture, Natural Science and Mathematics, Social Science and Education, and Computer, youll have Math subjects every year (from College Algebra to Calculus and higher math).    Ill post more info if Im on my desk.|`|EHw8zCgJaa	About your second sentence, I have no idea. I presume that it depends where you are admitted to.    What's the diff?  1.) I get to what classes i want to take (electives)  2.) I get to choose who teaches me.  3.) The profs have a bad habit of being unfashionably late  4.) About vacation, semestral break is much longer for most college studes.  5.) Assemblies are almost non-existent except for ones of which you voluntarily participate in (e.g. org. activities)  6.) Field Trips are mostly optional (In my case, I get to choose if I want to take field trips or not, simply by choosing subjects/profs that require them- e.g. geog camp, camping class, exposure/immersion trips)  7.) The main tradeoff would be your weekends, chances are, it will suck. That is, if you have classes that are available on saturdays/sundays.  8.) Frats/Soros- If you want to join one, go ahead. It's your choice, don't generalize and always assess if it will benefit you or not in the long run.    *NO, it will be credited, esp. general educ. units so you can focus on your majors (usually numbered 100 above subjects, thesis classes like 200-300 above numbered subjects)|`|7BAjFHqraa	First off Tertiary education here is ladder type. College & University is the same unlike in other countries where College is general education and University is your specialization (such as architecture).    Subject applicable to most students are general electives, usually on your 1st - 3rd year of study. However, major subjects or subject specific to your chosen course is already incorporated.    Depending on the course or degree you want to take, its does disappear. For example, if you take Architecture, you will have to take several math subjects in succession in varying degrees of difficulty.    College is very much different from high school at some point. People treat you as an adult; tougher requirements; better schedules; larger environment; more reading requirements.    Depending on the University, yes, you can choose your schedule.    Again depending on the University, there may or may not be any sections.    Depending on the schedules you take, you can have one whole day free or none at all. You can stay from 8am to 9pm or just have a class from 3-5pm.  There are academic classess on weekends but not Sundays. In some universities, Wednesdays are also free.    Vacations are long and Holidays are also days off. But trust me, once you get knee deep in your studies, you'll wish time does not fly.    Depending in which universities, you are not required to attend assemblies - except if you are graduating :)    Lots of social activities, Open Houses, Concerts and whatnot. Some classes have field trips as well, some abroad.  -fraternities, sororities [what are they, really?]    Depending on the university, NO. Its called a second degree you you only need to take the major subjects.    Most responders have said it all really. So allow me to say that "College Life" in the Philippines is simply Amazing.|`|LN07HZLsaa	Hey, I will let you speak of what my experiences are here at the University of the Philippines (UP).    1. I found out that vast majority of colleges here in the Philippines do really gave their students the independence of choosing the most suitable and most convenient class schedule to them. However, these colleges show you lists of classes where you could choose, they are mixed upon. Means that, for example, if you choose this schedule, then you have to take math whether you like it or not, anyway, it is your preference. They are called block sectioning.    Here at UP different atmosphere is felt. The university allows students choose their subjects freely to their extent. For example, if you do not want creative writing, then it is your option not to choose creative writing anyway, it will never affect your preferred schedule. Remember that colleges that do the rules I had said before, made lots of schedules' lists and lets you choose. Here in UP, they allow students to make up their style, make their schedules (for example again, you can choose to put your classes all in Tuesday Thursday only. In other colleges, it is not allowed). That's a freedom of choice.    2. At most times. If you ever recalled what I said, in block sectioning, you have the same classmates. You can also have the same classroom OR different classroom but still similar faces of classmates.    If you want to have different classmates at different subjects and at different classrooms, choose to be free section. You will choose your own subject, etc. like in UP. But here, we do not call it free section, since block sections here is open only for freshmen.    However, in universities offering both block and free sections, it is your option to choose.    3. Extremely true. Dismissals depend upon your chosen class schedule. Or maybe depends upon your professor/instructor. They had also the authority to cancel your class that day IF they had valid reason or had no power to teach that day.    4. Depending again to your schedule. If you will have NSTP, more likely that you will attend classes at Saturday and/or Sunday. Of course, most of the time, classes are weekend are only for post-graduate students.    5. Of course! Even though we are at college, we cherished Christmas breaks, semestral breaks, summer breaks, because it is our time to recreate ourselves, going out and to take some rest. College life, contrary to what you think, is not as easy as high school. Here, expect the unexpected--different faces, unapproachable professors, among others. You will have culture shock on your first day. But don't worry, you can adjust to these shocks. Well, if you experience pressure today in high school, expect that pressure in college would be ten times more difficult than that of high school. Of course, you can surpass it, but never make a subject fail.    6. Assemblies, are depending if you have organization. Meetings, having fun, etc. You can also assemble yourselves together with your high school friends if you are studying the same school. Or maybe assembly when there is a student protest. Here in UP, it is normal to see student rally inside the building or around the campus, we say that it is part of normal life. So it is very shocking to freshmen to see students with their banners, shouting for justice, shouting at the corridors and lobby with microphones and even banging doors when they are very angry at a certain issue.    7. Yes, field trips still exist. Depends on your subject and your course. But no more Enchanted Kingdom and Star City. Here, you will discover what field trip really means. For example, if you are taking up civil engineering, then your trips will be on construction sites etc. If you are geology, then on mountains, land forms and most likely, abroad to study rock formation forming there. If you are a biologist, on museums or laboratories of different other universities.    8. Yes, fraternities and sororities exist. Some of them are good and some of them makes up of frat war. Here in UP, there are very very lots of frats and soros, but I do not know who among them perform hazing and paddling. Mostly are named Greek letters.     Frats and soros, typically has different image than what your parents are saying to who they really are. They are really organizations, created for the benefit of the society and community. More than an association, it is a brotherhood/sisterhood. Once you become a member, it is for lifetime and you should not join other frat or soros if ever. Well, there are also prominent frats and soros, that really help the community, but gangsters created frats bearing the same names thus they had their names dirty. Among them are Tau Gamma Phi. Beta Epsilon, Alpha Phi Beta, Alpha Kappa Rho, Kappa Phi Kappa, and every two- or three- Greek letter formation you can form. Anyway, in UP, maybe the most famous is the Alpha Phi Omega or APO. They are the fraternity who do the famous Oblation Run, consisting of men ru|`|4rsSFkUbaa	in the philippines, college is like this:    1st 2 years: minor subjects, i.e. College Math and Algebra, Natural Sciences, PE, Religion and Theology, and minor subjects specific for the course or major you selected.    as to schedule and classmates, well... it depends on your major. some courses (especially those that have board or licensure exams) have block sections, so this means that provided you pass all your subjects and start you major subjects already, you have a definite schedule provided by the school. but for other courses, you get to choose your schedule. your dismissal depends on your chosen schedule.    some schools have classes 6 days a week, others 5 days a week. holiday vacations are awesome, they are very long, LOL. example, christmas break is usually from dec. 19 to jan 5. summer break is from March to May. Classes start the first Monday of June.     There are definitely assemblies, also conventions and seminars which are designed to give you deeper insight into your chosen career. As for field trips, some schools do, some schools don't. Some are selective like example, only Engineering majors go on a field trip. Everything is pretty much departmentalized.     school sanctioned fraternities and sororities exist only in a few schools like UP. but for other schools, there are just student organizations.     hope this helps.
AA11000347	When posting a queation check where it ends up, due to the word Amazon it ended up in Peru!  I would contact the seller directly (Amazon always tells you who the seller is) and ask why the delay.

fMPuTA6Uaa	i have a friend that lives in New Haven, CT and she pays about $900 a month in rent for an APT (you rent apt, not buy). I wouldn't recommend trying to even rent or buy anything in New York City as rent there is awful!!

XXm2yCHiaa	85k to 90k SGD annually is about 7k a month.  You should be comfortable but you will not be royalty.  Of course, comfortable has different meanings for different people.    you will probably find food to be cheaper in Singapore, you can get a meal at a hawker centre for less than $5 per person and if you cook, it is even cheaper.  Medical expense would depend on your company policy.  Many companies cover their employees and dependents with medical insurance.  Else, a visit to the doctors would cost in between $30 - $50 (higher if specialist or for children)    If your kids go through public shooling, it is rather cheap as it is subsidised.  Not sure about cost of international schools though.    I believe your highest cost should be housing as rentals are still close to the peak in SIngapore right now, you may spend from $1.8k to $5k depending on your requirements and location.    You can easily move about the island on public transport, hence you do not need to buy a car.  Owning a car is expensive in Singapore due to the car price, petrol, parking and ERP charges.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	yes, more than enough|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Having my own experience, going from Sydney you will find it difficult to handle S'pore.

If you don't mind this, Spore is a great place to shop and eat out.  Kids would probably love it too.  It is also easy to get to Malaya, Thailand, etc. too for a holiday.

The only concern is the high medical fee especially the hospital charge, you will feel the pain as you practically pay nothing in Sydney.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	The cost of living is high even in Australian Standard, as nowadays S$ & A$ is almost on par, your salary is on average standard if counted on annually. As for education and medical expenses, education can be cheaper than western countries mostly, but for medical, since you pay pay almost nothing like in the UK, you will find here at least 100% more expensive, even compared to the UK standard. But you should live well if you do not spend too much with your family. Spend wisely and your family can live well.|`|NeZ7JdHhaa	Cost of living is relatively high in Singapore, considering that is a high standard of living too. :) Education expenses are affordable if your kids don't go to International School, but the medical cost admittedly isn't low. But your income seems high, so I do believe that you will be able to manage quite comfortably.    The great thing about Singapore is that it's a really clean, safe and secure country to live in. And contrary to what tourists think, it really is a very globalised urban place with a lot of diverse kinds of people. (So don't come here expecting to see only Chinese faces or something). There are a lot of expats here as well.
