20080321125059AAel1XF	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Per favore, potreste spiegarmi perchè un'ammina è più idrosolubile di un'ammide?	Non riesco a capire;   Poniamo il caso di avere l'ammide CH3CH2CONH2 e l'ammina CH3CH2NH2. Riflettendoci ho pensato, sicuramente sbagliando che mentre nell'ammina c'è la possibilità di formare ponti ad H (legami ad idrogeno) tra N, nell'ammide è possibile che si formino legami ad H sia tra gli N che tra gli O.    In cosa sbaglio?

At first I didnt mind much, because i enjoyed the company of children, but as it turns out; im not so great in science, although I have lots of interest in becoming an Astronomer. They dont talk much about the Universe and space in science, once you get to highschool. But when we did learn about planets and all the phenomenons in space, i became highly interested. I was much better in Astronomy then Physics&Chemistry. But im not so sure if becoming an Astronomer is my final decision. What do astronomers do? And im looking for the most accurate explanaiton, please. How much do they get paid? Is it fun?...please&thank you.
20090222231920AAriPuZ	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Trouble picturing quantum tunneling?	I am having a bit of trouble conceptualizing quantum tunneling and probability waves. Can all particles be assigned a probability wave? How does that wave become affected when you look at macroscopic objects? Would you have to consider each component of the object (like each atom) or the whole object itself?       In addition, does a probability wave function change depending on the movement of an object? for example... I am looking at the pencil laying on my desk... it is not moving.. so I know 100% that I will find my pencil right where I am looking at it. Its probability is 100% at that spot. On the contrary, if I roll the pencil its moving but I can still visually see where the pencil is and will be so in that sense, also know the probability of finding the pencil at certain spots to be 100%.       Lastly, quantum tunneling. There is a slight chance that a particle can go through a classically forbidden energy barrier. What is the result or passing this barrier? the particle has the same energy as before? what happens to the particle if it appears within the barrier, since there is a chance of that too? how would it respond to its new surrounding and how could a state like that even exist?       Thanks I know that was a surge of questions, and perhaps I am completely misunderstanding the topic, but quantum mechanics just boggles my mind.

20090222225315AA8rzls	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Regarding Real Time Operating System Scheduling?	1) Is POSIX a real time operating system?      2) why virtual memory may not be as useful in a real-time system as it is in a general-purpose computing system?      3) Consider the following five with relative deadlines equal to periods: T1 = (e1 = 2;P1 = 10);T2 =(2;14);T3 = (3;15);T4 = (1;50);T5 = (3;24). The tasks are scheduled using the rate monotonic priority assignment.   (a) Suppose that the context-switch time is 0.1 units. Will all tasks meet their deadlines? Explain your answer. Also determine the maximum context switch time that would allow all tasks to   meet their deadlines.      (b) Ignore the clock tick assumption from the previous part. Now consider the case when tasks share two resources: X and Y. Each task requires X for 1 time unit. Only tasks T1 and T3 requireY, and for 1 and 1:5 time units respectively. Determine the blocking times for each task. Then determine if these tasks are schedulable when scheduled rate monotonically, and with priority inheritance. You may assume that there is no nesting of critical sections.      (c) With conditions remaining the same as in part (b), we would like to reduce the relative deadline for T3 to improve the quality of service. What is the shortest deadline that we can choose for task T3 such that all tasks will meet their deadlines? You need to reduce the deadline only for T3. After the deadline reduction, tasks will be scheduled using the deadline monotonic priority assignment.      Thank You

Would it be how the electricity is stored in a battery? Like 200V batteries are not common, and would require a lot of cells. But also why not just use a capacitor to store high voltage and give off in one hit rather than use loads of current?

20090223001350AAHEbdV	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	"Overdesigned", "oversized"? Which is correct...?	...if any?      I need to describe how a piece of machinery is designed for a performance greater than the one actually required, e.g. say I am designing an engine that will be required to provide 10 HP, but I design an engine providing 12 HP because I know that the actual operating conditions will not be optimal, the fuel might be low-quality etc.   Is there a right term to describe what I'm doing here?

20090223020442AALnjOW	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Qualitative Analysis Help?	Question # 1   When a solution containing an unknown number of metal ions is treated with dilute HCl, no precipitate forms. The pH is adjusted to about 1, and H2S is bubbled through. Again no precipitate forms. The pH of the solution is then adjusted to about 8 and treated with (NH4)2S. This time a precipitate forms. The filtrate from this solution is not tested. Which groups of metal ions are either known to be present or cannot be excluded?         A. Group III and Group IV   B. Group III only   C. Group II and Group IV   D. Group IV only   E. Group I and Group IV      Question # 2   In the course of various qualitative analysis procedures, the following mixture is encountered: Na+ and K+. Suggest how this mixture might be separated. You may need to refer to Table 4.1 from Zumdahl.         A. add dilute HCl   B. add 0.2 M HCl and H2S   C. add (NH4)2S at pH 8   D. add (NH4)2HPO4 to a basic solution   E. It is not possible to separate the ions using any reaction scheme found in either Zumdahl or your lab manual.         I got D for #1 because the rest will precipitate but then I'm thinking E because only some of the group I ions will precipitate.      For #2 I got E, its not possible because they are always soluble.      Can anyone help?

20090223021925AArl1Mr	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Can someone fill in a few blanks in my understandings of The Big Bang theory.?	How can we assume there was a big bang, where everything that ever existed - matter, light, energy ect was compacted from a single, infinity dense point in the universe then expanded outwards from that point yet apparently scientists deny such a thing as the centre of the universe?      Secondly I know a little about a fairly new discovery called Dark Energy, which I suppose works a little like gravity only opposite. Assuming this is a force what created it? Where did it come from? And how does it work?      I defiantly think there's a missing step somewhere. The universe is finite , but space is not. Nothing is where time and mass doesn't exist therefore it's right in assuming before the creation of anything there must of been abyss of absolute nothing. I mean we can trace it/theorize (because no one really knows) to this point or area I guess in space since everything is expanding out and anything before that is purely speculation, basically we don't have much of a clue. So it has some holes/gaps in which is why obviously there is a missing step between going from nothing to the creation of this point surely unless it just appeared, or is also infinite. (both unlikely)

20090223024016AAs5XUD	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Can someone please help me with some A-level maths questions (S2)?	Can you please show all your working out   The Normal Distribution      1. Soup tins have a capacity of 625 ml. The volume of soup, X ml, dispensed into each tin is Normally distributed with mean 610 and standard deviation 8. If more than 625 ml is dispensed, the tin overflows.   (i) Find the probability that the volume of soup dispensed into a tin is between 600 ml and 625 ml.       The proportion of tins containing at least 600 ml is too low. To increase this proportion to 95%, the dispenser is adjusted in such a way as to reduce the standard deviation of X while leaving the mean unchanged.   (ii) Show that the new value of the standard deviation is 6.08.       (iii) Show that the proportion of tins overflowing is now 0.68%.      Following the adjustment, 1000 randomly chosen tins are inspected.   (iv) Use a suitable approximating distribution to calculate the probability that the soup overflowed on more than 10 occasions when being dispensed into the tins.      2. The number of marks gained by candidates in a particular Statistics examination, for which the maximum mark is 60, is modelled by a Normal distribution with mean 36 and standard deviation 8. The marks are reported as integers.   (i) Find the probability that a randomly chosen candidate scores exactly 30 marks.      (ii) Three candidates are chosen at random. Find the probability that just one of them gets fewer than 30 marks.      (iii) It is intended that the proportion of candidates receiving a grade A should be as near as possible to 20%. What is the lowest integer mark that should be awarded a grade A?      (iv) In a future Statistics examinations it is intended that the top 25% of candidates should gain a reported mark of at least 45. Determine the required value for the mean mark, assuming the standard deviation remains at 8.      3. The number of arrivals per minute at a drive-in fast food outlet is modelled by a Poisson distribution with mean λ. During a Saturday evening, λ = 0.78.   (i) Give reasons why the proposed Poisson distribution might be a suitable model.       (ii) Calculate the probability of exactly two arrivals during a one-minute interval.      (iii) Calculate the probability of at least four arrivals during a five-minute interval.      (iv) Using a suitable approximating distribution, calculate the probability that there are more than 40 arrivals between 7 pm and 8 pm.      Due to capacity constraints, the management of the fast food outlet would like the probability of more than 40 arrivals in an hour to be 0.02. They ask a statistician to determine the value to which λ should be reduced.   (v) Show that λ must satisfy the equation (40.5-60λ)/(√60λ)=2.054      (vi) Use the substitution u=√(60λ) to formulate a quadratic equation in u. Solve this equation to show that the value of λ is just less than 0.5.       4. Every day, Morse attempts the crossword puzzle in his newspaper. The time taken, X minutes, to complete the crossword may be modelled by a Normal distribution with mean 22 and standard deviation 4.5.   (i) Calculate the probability that he takes   (A) more than 25 minutes,   (B) between 15 and 25 minutes   to complete the crossword.       (ii) What length of time would be enough for Morse to finish the crossword on 95% of days?       Each day Morse takes a train to work. The journey takes 25 minutes. He starts his crossword at the beginning of his journey.   (iii) Find the probability that he completes the puzzle by the end of his journey at least twice in a five-day week.      (iv) Morse changes his newspaper and finds that on 99% of occasions he completes the crossword during his morning train journey. Assuming that the time taken, Y minutes, to complete the crossword has the distribution   N(18, σ2), find the value of σ.
