My yellow lab Cichlid is holding (has been for approx 15 days) i have been putting some flake food in just incase she wants to eat. There are some flakes just sat on the bottom of the tank (probably most of what i put in actually) i have not seen her eat any at all. Please could anyone tell me if it is ok to do a small water change on her tank or will this stress her too much? She is in a tank alone at the moment.       Much Appreciated.    Catherine
20090220103159AA52hR4	Pets;Horses	Is anyone familiar with a 1975 King Horse trailer-2 horse straight load?	I am interested in buying a 1975 King 2 horse straight load, but I can't find anything on the web about this make of trailer. The owner says that the trailer only weighs $800 pounds or so, so I am concerned that the total weight capacity may not be enough for two large horses. The dimensions of the trailer are great 7' high x 5'5" wide. The trailer seems in decent shape, but I would feel better about the trade if I had something to compare it too.       I would appreciate any info!! Thanks!

20090220105537AANg7mw	Pets;Dogs	What breeds would compare to this dog?  (based on looks and temperment and other things)?	Well we found the perfect dog for us....and well she is our dog.  Problem is she doesn't have a breed.  She is a mutt.          But when we consider future dogs we want a dog like her.  She is perfect for us in everyway.      We love the way she looks...she is so sleek and beautiful.   We love her looks.      Her size is perfect...      And her temperent is wonderful and she is very smart and loyal.         Here is a little about her:      Looks: Smooth coat....beautiful sleek.   She does shed a little bit year round.      Size: She is 24 pounds      Activity level: She is very calm and we like the fact that she can handle a good 4 mile walk with us on the weekends but that she is also happy with a 30 minute walk or an hour walk when we can't give her more.      Temperment: She is calm by nature.  She is a fast learner and eager to please.   She loves to snuggle and is very tolerant.   She does get spooked easily though by loud sounds.   But she is overall a wonderful girl.  She loves to get out to run and play and she is great with other dogs.   She likes kids.   She is very loyal and protective but very friendly at the same time.      I will add she is terrified of cats and I'm not sure why....she will chase most small animals...mostly squirrels and rabbits.    She won't normally chase a cat though she usually ends up running in the opposite direction      Here is her picture:             http://www.i-love-dogs.com/forums/member...          Please let us know what you think.      We think perhaps a Treeing Feist or a Corgi would be a good match...but we really don't know.....List all the breeds you can think of

Okayy, when I was little, I had two purebred boxers, Buddy and Trouble (they had several litters of puppies, but we didn't keep them; we just kept Buddy and Trouble). They were brindle, and I loved them with all my heart. [My mom and] I want to get a boxer again (we don't have any pets right now other than my hamster and my tomato frog), and I'm just wondering how much the average price is? My mom wants to get one from a breeder, I'll happily accept one from anywhere. No mean comments about that please!!      So, on average, how much do they cost:   -From a breeder?   -From a pet store? (no mean comments)   -From a shelter? (probably won't get one from there unless they have like a young puppy-we don't want an adult or something that's like 7 months and looks like an adult)        I appreciate your help, especially if you've got a boxer (that sounds dumb, I know)!!

20090220104414AAqVBN4	Pets;Fish	Aggressive Neon Tetra?	I have a group of 10 neon tetras in a 60L tank. Generally speaking all is fine, water paramaters etc are spot on. Five of the fish used to be in a small quarantine tank before this bigger tank and I saw no aggression in this tank even with such a small size. Two weeks in the new tank and the biggest neon started to chase the others away. I added five more two months later and this fish also chases them although some are the same size as him. They don't school as much as they did. There are also no signs at all of disease. Im a bit confused here. Has anyone seen this before and what can i do t sort him out?      Thanks

My normally docile dog went nuts the other night - hyperactive, crying, growling as he rolled all over the floor, scratching like crazy. We're now on day 2. I assumed he had an allergic reaction to something and gave him Benadryl. That helped, but I think only because it made him drowsy. His food/location/activity has not changed. He has no fleas/ticks. Was at the vet a week ago for his rabies vaccination as was declared in good health. An insect bite is unlikely as it's winter... anyone have any ideas?

20090220110656AAKU8tE	Pets;Dogs	My parents dog was attacked and killed yesterday. What can happen to the attacking dog?	Yesterday, my parents pomeranian was attacked and killed by our neighbor's dog. Cubby got underneath the fence and one of the neighbors dog mangled him so badly that my dad was forced to have him put down. His eye was hanging from the socket, his jaw shattered, broken leg and several other internal and external injuries. Our neighbor has 3 dogs, one which is a rottweiler and one of the other two is pretty aggressive, although I'm not sure of the exact breed. It was either one of these two that killed Cubby. Our german shephard witnessed the whole incident and she knows which one it was. I called animal control to report the incident and they informed me the only thing that would happen if officially reported is that the owner would receive a ticket/citation for either damage to property of others or no restraint. I'm assuming since the incident happened in our neighbors backyard that only the first would apply and then the case could be addressed at civil court as well. I asked the animal control lady if this had been a kid what would happen and of course they would care more at that point. She said it would be a completely different issue, which is sad because dogs are usually part of the family for most people.       My question is what should happen to the attacking dog and can my parents be held liable for neglect if not reported to animal control in the event the dog attacks again?
20090220110836AATmS8L	Pets;Other - Pets	Disciplining or a ferret?	My boyfriend of 4 years and I have a year old ferret who for a long time, used his litter box every time. We were ecstatic especially since lots of people told us that its almost impossible to train a ferret to use a litter box. Recently our ferret stopped using it and would go on the floor. My boyfriend gets very angry at this and spanks him, so hard sometimes that last week it injured our ferret's leg and now he has a hard time walking. I told him to promise me NEVER to spank him again, for any reason, and the ferret still has problems using the litter box(I associate this with not being able to walk very well!) I want to take him to the vet, he doesnt seem like he is in pain, he's still playful and walks on it but its not healed either. My boyfriend still spanks him hard for not using the litter box, and acts like he has a right to. what do I do????

I'm scared, i don't know how to accommodate her. i've heard she is supposed to be away from the male if she is pregnant but if i take the male out of the hutch even for a few minutes to groom him or something, she starts getting stressed so i am really stuck!      Please can you answer!!!! ]????

20090220111344AAID9uH	Pets;Fish	What live rock will live in a brackish water tank?	I've been doing some research but I just cant find any straight answers.  I Probably know the answer but:      Which live rock has the ability to live in a brackish tank, or can any live in it at all?  I love the look and wanted to know so I don't kill the poor things if I take a chance and experiment... I love the way the rock provides great habitat for the fish and the surface for the beneficial bacteria.  I'm still a little new at this and been researching so I can turn my tropical tank brackish.  I'll take any tips you've got!  My fish all can be in a brackish environment.

20090220113236AAZWXft	Pets;Cats	Would these arrangements be ok for my cat?!?!?!...HELP?!?!?	Ok, so I'm getting a cat. She's a tabby cat and is 4 years old. She will be neutered, wormed, vaccinated and will have flea treatment so she will be alright in the outside world :)       Firstly, I would like to say that I live in England and in England we always have inside/outside cats. There are no preditors, no dogs, I don't live near any traffic, and it is just culture so if you are going to tell me to keep my cat inside then I'm sorry but I'm not going to do that.       There is nowhere to put a catflap in my house so I thought maybe these arrangements would be suitable. But I'm not sure. Please tell me what you think.      In the morning I will feed it and then I will let it out at 9:00am (when I go to work). I will leave the door from the conservatory to the garden open (but the door from the conservatory to my house will be locked) so the cat can get back to a shelter if he wants to. Don't worry, there will be nothing of value in there. Just an old rocking chair and some comfy cushions. Of course I will put his food, water, and toys in there as well.      I will come home at 3:00 and let the cat inside the house with me. And I will play with it and give it love and affection and in the evening I will feed it again. Then, when it's time for bed, I'll put him in the living room, where his bed, food, water, litter tray, scratching post and everything he needs will be.      Would it be ok if in the summer I put him to bed in the conservatory? It has no heating. Is there anything else I should think of?      Please, please, PRETTY please, give me some advice!      Thanks so much,       XD

20090220111504AAnl67k	Pets;Cats	What can I do to stop my cat from crying?	She is spayed and about 3 years old. About 2 years ago, she had kittens. We found homes for all of them.    I have this blanket that I used to sleep with every day when I was younger, and now it's just in my closet.     Every day when I come home the blanket is pulled out of my closet into my hallway, and my sister saw our cat pulling it, rolling in it, and crying really loudly. Is it possible that the kittens somehow came in contact with the blanket and their scent is upsetting her? I don't think this makes sense though, seeing as they were here 2 years ago. I also heared somewhere that most cats don't even remember their babies for very long after the babies are given away. Is this true? Any advice?
20090220111728AAnHRAK	Pets;Dogs	What types of fish are alright for my dog to eat?	Now I am asking this question again, I am going to start cooking for my dog, I want him to have fish in his diet.       I have done research on this I know the proportions of protein, carbs, fats etc. to give. I DO want to COOK so please don't tell me to go raw, I KNOW about salmon poisoning, that is why I am COOKING. Don't tell me I am doing bad because I am cooking instead of feeding raw, it is still better than kibble in my opinion and safer than raw in my opinion, you have your opinion about this I am sure... and I don't want to hear it because it does not answer my question, this is not an opinions blog.      All I want is a list of fish that are alright to be a main part of his diet. I know about tuna being bad in large quantities, so this is why I am asking.         Thank you.

She seemed nice, and she seemed good. But apparently the past owner lied.      One day, (a week or 2 after we brought her home) a girl wanted to get on her( she is experienced.) So she did, and Ava did these crazy bucks( like 4 feet high bunny hops) and Rachael fell off. Again, A girl named Sara got on. Again, she fell off. ( she had fallen off b4)   This time, Sara got on again, and ava bucked her off. She got back on, but then ava took her onto the concrete aisles in the barn and bucked her off. It was so bad Sara couldnt walk, and she had to go to the hospital!       So now we are trying to sell ava, and my mom is having a mental breakingdown. She is better now, but how are we supposed to sell Ava? She is crazy!      thanksxx

20090220115109AAIEAe0	Pets;Cats	My Cats Have Scabs, But No Fleas?	I have 2 cats one is 5 and the other is 1. Over the past couple of weeks they have begun developing scabs. They are mainly along the spine of my 5 year old cat and on the 1 year old cat they are around the neck and shoulder blades. My 1 year old cat is white and when she had fleas in the past they were easily visible. I cannot see any fleas or flea feces, and when they had fleas in the past they did not have scabs at all. I'm really confused about what is causing this. I have read some answers to other questions on here and I wanted to mention that I have had them on the same food both wet and dry for over a year, so I don't think its an allergy.
20090220115211AAqI2cL	Pets;Dogs	My dogs back legs aren't "working"?	I have an 8 year old Lab x Collie. This morning i took her for her normal morning walk, one hour off lead. She seemed fine, came home and went to sleep. When she got up a few hours later she couldn't walk well. At first, i thought it was just stiffness, although even that surprised me because she's never had that before. Her back legs seem to be kind of bow legged. Now she can barely walk, otherwise she just falls back onto her bum/legs. It's like she can't feel them as she doesn't seem to be in any pain. I realise if this persists she will need to go to the vet, but it's friday evening? Any idea what could be wrong? Note that she has never ever had problems with stiffness or joints or anything for that matter, previously. She is a very fit and healthy dog.

20090220120313AAEezQB	Pets;Dogs	RE:My dog doesnt want to go to the park!?	I have a 4 year old german sheperd longhaired. I have had him since a puppy and recently he started acting really strange. He use to love  it when i would take out the lead and he'd bark like crazy, and i then put the lead on him and he we'd go to the park and then id let him off to run around. But usually i would take him to the park in the car. so one day i got the lead out, and i said " come here boy" he just lay on the floor. i put the lead on him and he wouldnt budge. I was like "what's going on?"so i got the car keys, he ran out of the door to the boot, then quickly grabbed the lead before he could sit down and ran with him to the park,, next day same thing happend but this him i held him by the colar so he wouldnt sit down put the lead on him and just ran with him out of the path and on to the street where then he happly walked to the park. Its a constant battle every day to, ratle the car keys and then put the lead on him take him to the park, although it's fairly easy to hold him and get him to the street and start walking. im just a bit puzzled why? i really dont understand why he does it. At the park he's fine, doesnt get in any fights, he's just a regualr dog, and runs around the field playing fetch with the stick, and he always near me and he hasnt had any fall outs with dogs so i really dont know. What i have realised though it that when i use to run really fast acroos the field park, he'd bet me eaisly, and now he just tags behind and comes 5 mins later.      Doesnt he like the lead?      ive had him for 4 years and id sometimes take the car and sometimes take the lead and this never happened

So......would the All-Life Stages one be the best so I only have to buy 1 kind? And what's the difference between the grain-free and the regular version?   The regular version is $54 for a 44 pound bag   The grain free version is $53 for a 30 pound bag   So...the regular one is alot cheaper.   Like is there something wrong with the cheaper one? What are the benefits of the grain-free one versus the regular one?      The reason I'm going with Canidae is because it's supposed to be the cheapest brand of the best brands, so, if the regular version of All-Life-Stages will work just fine, I'd rather get that.

And being good with them      We have noticed it seems that Girls are the worst....my dogs are terrified of little girls. Because they have that high pitched squeal when they see a dog and then they run up and try to hug on it and smother it. Little girls are way worse boys in my opinion      We avoid all little girls like the plague...but little boys tend to be able to ask to pet the dog and the dogs love little boys. They are just calmer by nature it seems. It seems little boys can read the dog better and know when to stop.      Where little girls keep pestering and wanted to cuddle the dog even if the dog is growling at them.      I never let any child pet our dogs without asking and without them giving our pet a treat.      But I try to avoid children that we don't know coming near our dogs anyways because I trust my dogs but I don't trust these kids.      If its a child we know the dogs and the child can play together (supervised all they want)      I know our dogs prefer boys over girls.      What do you think      I wanted to add: My dogs have never growled at a child or bit at a child or shown any agression toward children but I don't want to take a chance.      I'm scared though if we have a girl the dogs won't like her.....what do you think?
20090220121951AAUxJBs	Pets;Dogs	Moving away...looking for dog activities to do when we get there besides dog park...what do you think?	When we move we will be moving away from all their doggy friends.....there are a few dogs that our relatives have out there but they are old dogs and don't like to play much.      So are there groups you can pay to sign up with so your dogs can have playdates and meet new dogs?      What else can we do?   We are going to start agility training in the fall?      Oh and no we will not be taking our dogs to the dog park.  I don't feel like risking my dogs life there.   We just had some bad experiences and WON'T EVER go to another dog park      So how can we meet people and our dogs get playdates

20090203041741AAwg0mS	Pets;Dogs	What breeds do you think my puppy could be?	I need some help with trying to figure out what my puppy "Trigger" might be. When we bought him his mother was on site, she looked like she was for sure black lab, but possibly a black lab/pit mix. The owner had no idea what the dad might have been. There were only 2 dogs in the whole litter that looked like Trigger and the rest were all black. We've just been telling everybody that he's a black lab/german shepherd mix because of his dark muzzle and the way his ears look sometimes. Also, if you google "brindled german shepherd" or lab/german shepherd mix there are pictures of dogs that look almost identical to him. Just wanted some more opinions!

I have a 8 month old lhasa alp so, when ever I or my mother leave the house he sits by the door til he can't see you anymore, and as soon as he can't see you he jumps at the door barking and crying. Of coarse he's never home alone, there's 2 other dogs with him, and most of the time my oldest sister is home. But he doesn't chew furniture, and when im home he's off on his own but when i walk out of the room he will follow me. I figured he'd always follow me cause i'm the "mother" to him. which we adopted him from a pet store back in october, and lately it's just been getting worse. yes i haven't been home that much lately, but he's been having "the poops" for the past 3 days, and the past 3 days ive slept over my boyfriend's house and came home the next morning then we slept at my house, and i brought him home in the morning and last night i slept over his house.. but it has been happening before i have been coming and going. he still eats normally, BUT he has been acting out and not listening, pooping all over the floor when we are home and aren't home, and he pees on my bedroom floor only, along with jumping on your legs when you come in the door, and he's just so excited to see you that when you sit on the couch he wont leave you alone for 10 minutes and when you want him to leave you alone you have to yell at him and i feel bad yelling at him for being excited to see me or my mother. please help, it's starting ot get a lil annoying!

The only problem is that my girlfriend and I live in rented flat and they do not allow pets. Obviously fish would be fine, but even though they are relaxing, they are kinda boring.    I want something that can be kept in a cage or tank, can be played with out of the cage and leves the least amount of evidence that I actually have a pet (eg, no smell, not too loud).   I have an idea what people are going to say but I just want to grab a general concensus.   BTW, I am excluding Spiders coz I hate them and Snakes too unfortuantely coz my gf hates them!   Looking forward to your suggestions.

20090220122756AAxlWSr	Pets;Cats	So.. how do I keep my inside cat from going outside?	My cat is about 2 years old, spayed female, and she is declawed. We recently moved (4 months) and lately she's been wanting outside, a lot. She sits and cries at the door to be let out and if someone goes in and out of the door, she dashes outside. I didn't think it was a problem but apparently it's irresponsible for me to allow my cat outside. We live on base, so a cat flap is not an option. We cannot add fencing. What I'm doing now is keeping her shut in the back part of the house so there's no way for her to escape. She never went outside before, I'm wondering why all of a sudden she likes going outside so much? There are other cats around but I thought that didn't matter, she's fixed. I was thinking that maybe she wanted a break from my 2 year old's reign of terror. Anyways, I need help on keeping this kitty inside, and occupied so she doesn't cry at the door all the time... it makes my husband mad, lol.

My 9 week old puppy has/had worms and I'm currenty giving him the medicine for it, tonight is the last time I have to give it to him, all this time his poo has been the same.

For example he's been outside like 5 times in the last hour already to poo out a little diarrhea, and he threw up once not too long ago. Other than that he's been acting normal.       Could this be caused by the deworming stuff? Or did he maybe eat something he shouldn't have?       At what point should I take him to the vet? Or do I need to take him right now? I'm not one to freak out and rush to the vet/doctor over something unless I'm sure it could be serious, so I'd like to know when puppy diarrhea would be considered serious.

20090220134227AAO5kTM	Pets;Rodents	Can a baby mouse live after losing/without a leg?	One of my mice had her very first litter a few days ago, 11 pups. They're 3 days old now.   I took a look in at them yesterday and I noticed that one of the pups had a mangled back leg. I don't know what caused the injury. It could have been born that way, the mother may have done it, I just don't know. (It was not caught in fluff bedding, incidentally, the nest is made of shredded paper.) I didn't try to touch this baby at that time, I didn't want to risk interfering with the litter at such a young age, in case the mother was upset.      I checked on the pup again today, and it seems the mother may have "cleaned up" the mangled piece of leg. It looks cleanly amputated from about the knee down. The little thing is feeding well & doesn't appear to notice the injury at all.      I'm wondering if a mouse can live a decent life if it loses a leg in such a manner.   Does anyone have any similar experience?   Any advice & opinions are greatly appreciated.

20090220125201AAowe40	Pets;Dogs	Parvo confusion any help....?	So a close relative of mine adopted a lab mix puppy from the shelter about two weeks ago. When she took the pup to its first vet exam she found out the pup had parvo (A pretty bad case, runny nose, diarrhea, no appetite, ect.)  I am planning on getting a puppy of my own within the next two months. My daughter spends a lot of time with this relative. I will make sure my pup is vaccinated for parvo before bringing it home but is there a possibility that my puppy can still catch the virus from my daughter when she comes home from visits. What can I do to lessen the chance of my future pup from catching the virus? Can it be carried in her cloths?

20090220130657AA84pSE	Pets;Cats	Is it normal for siamese kittens to act like puppies in cat bodies?	I rescued this kitten a while ago outside of my apartment and decided to keep him and nurse him back to health (he was tiny and super sick). Now that he is better and thriving, he is a terror. This is not the first kitten I've owned (though he is the first siamese I've owned), but if this is "normal" for kittens, he may be the last! I've had two others, and sure they were full of energy, but nothing like this. He seriously acts like a puppy.. chewing, getting into things that he shouldn't, and has even destroyed most of the toys I have spread all around my apartment. He doesn't respond to verbal ("NO!") or physical discipline (squirt bottles).      Is this normal for siamese kittens? Any advice?
20090220141107AAcrZwy	Pets;Dogs	Question about adoption of a dog...?	My husband and I may be adopting a dog from a family member of a friend of my sister. The dog belongs to a 19 year old who lives with her grandmother who is not allowing her to keep the dog. The dog is kept in a cage 90% of the time because the grandmother cannot handle it and the 19 year old is never home.       My question is, I guess they had a rescue orginazation coming to take the dog a few months ago but the 19 year old wouldn't sign the papers to allow them to take it. The person who has been talking to me about this says that since the grandmother owns the home, she can decide what happens to the dog and is ultimately going to take him to the pound if we can't take him. I am wondering if anyone knows the legal ramifications that can come from this. I've made it clear from the beginning that if we take him he is with us for a forever home. I simply cannot let this dog become a part of my family just to have her come crying and wanting him back later. Is it correct that the owner of the house can give this dog away to us?

She used to drink water, but once it started snowing she would only eat snow. Since she was still urinating I felt like she was getting adequate water.  Now the snow has melted and she still wont drink water. I've tried giving her crushed ice but she will only lick at it for a second and walk away. Is there anything I could add to the water to make it more appetizing.  I feed her dry dog food, should I changed to canned so she can get fluids that way? She still acts pretty normal, but feels a little warmer than normal.  Can any one give me some suggestions?

20090220142801AAh6Z19	Pets;Dogs	Border Collies as a 'first' dog?	As the title suggests, I'll be getting my first Border Collie (& first ever dog) this summer. I've loved this particular breed ever since I was a small child, & I'm looking forward to spending the tons of spare time I have with the dog. However, I have been told (on more than one occasion) that since I am a first time dog owner, then I should consider a dog that's known for being more docile, such as a lab.      Sure, I want a breed that would be best for me & my family, but would this include sticking with a calmer breed, or should I 'follow my heart?'      A few more points:   - I live in a small seaside town in the north of england, an hour or so away from where Border Collies originally came from. Bcs are very popular around here.   - I'm interested in taking part in agility, frisbee & herding. Possibly obedience?   - I'm a teenager, although due to some unfortunate mental problems, I rarely attend school.   - The dog will on no occasion be allowed on the sofas, beds or to eat from the table.   - I've helped out at a shelter for a few months, including walking some highly strung dogs.      Am I honestly ready for the huge responsibility that a Border Collie would bring?
20090220150752AAKEzva	Pets;Cats	Tips on finding a lost cat?	recently (well about four days ago) i lost my cat. i have put up a few posters, given an discription to the local vets and animal rescues, and have searched for him.      i searched for him today and my mum did the day before but we can't find him. we have just been calling him so tomorrow i will take some really stinky dried fish to see if i can lure him back to us.      i was just wondering if you have any tips on where to look and what to do. and if i am doing anything wrong.      he is a male, uneutured, un chipped cat so the vets said he is probebly OK and as he is 14 months old he is probably looking for a girl, if this has happened to you can you tell me any personal experiances of your cats doing this and how long they went missing for, just so i can know what to expect.      also its my little sisters pet but she is too young to do anything but i am only 12 and my parents don't seem to be helping much how can i get them interested-i have found all the numbers and called and made the posters      thnx in advance-----the question i would like answering mostly is the tips on how to find him but if you do have anything to do with the other to thnx again :-)     :-s   :-)

I had such a great experience with him that I want to get another. Now mine was a pretty small guy, but as I've been looking around the internet I've been seeing some really big pet hedgehogs, like up to 4 and 5 pounds (mine couldn't have weighed more than a pound). My fiance and I have decided that we would love to have a big hedgehog. Does anyone know how we go about this, or if it is even natural for a hedgie to grow that big? I mean I've seen alot of pictures of big ones, and they all seem to be the brown colored ones. Is it a particular breed of hedgie? Or do they grow to the size of their surroundings like some animals? Or is this just a case of people purposely fattening up their hedgie's? What gives people? I'd appreciate the help.

Last night my husband walked him and he relieved himself. Then he came in the house and pooped on the carpet! He pooped a few times before when he was kinda new. But I thought it was because he needed to get used to his new home. he doesnt pee. he just leaves a surprise. We don't feed him after 8, we walk him, he is fixed, he is loved and cared for very well. I don't know what to do. I don't think its right to use physical punishment, so I lower my voice and say to him "WHAT DID YOU DO??!!" his head lowers and I put him in his crate. Yesterday, he knew he did something wrong and went in the crate before we even saw the surprise. Any suggestions?

20090220144030AAUNO4Y	Pets;Birds	Keeping your cockatoo busy?	Hello all, I have two Cockatoos, One that I have had for about two months who is doing well. The other I bought off of craigslist about 4 months ago. I have always had birds, however not birds this large. I did alot of research and decided to go with cockatoos. My boyfriend and I saw the posting online which talked about a very tame very handled cockatoo, so we drove about 2 hours away to see the bird. When we got there I noticed that she plucked and I said something to the owner and he said she was just molting. Now I know that is not the case but I would have felt too bad leaving her there in the conditions she was in, so we brought her home. She is very very smart, know lots of tricks....but she WILL NOT play with any toys, she doesnt like to do anything besides be right with us or she screams. Our other cockatoo loves all of his toys and can entertain himself better. She wont even stay ontop of her cage while we are in the same room with her...she just screams.  I have tried cleaning or whatnot and leaving her out and It just turns into a scream. The other bird looks at her like shes crazy, lol....Do you have any suggestions?

If you guess    "Spaniel" for example, you have to say "tan and white english cocker spaniel". I'll give you a couple of hints   A. He is not any part Spaniel.   B. He is a mix of two breeds (both purebred)      Here is his picture:    http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn217...       have fun!

20090220150712AAxhaWy	Pets;Dogs	Advise on taking my dog to a dog park?	I have a 6 year old Shepard / Lab mix female dog. I really want to take her to a dog park, but I am scared she might fight. She has a lot of dog friends, and is friendly when we bring a dog to our home, or go to another home with dogs.  But when we are at a park and she sees another dog she goes crazy! She pulls and whines and wants to get to the dog, she does not bark, or act mean, I think she just wants to play.  This is why I have been hesitant to take her to a dog park! So how do I know if shell be ok? Do I just take her and let her go off the leash, even though she has never experienced it yet?? I mean, how do get a dog ready for a dog park?
20090220151316AAWGEfL	Pets;Dogs	Choosing A guard dog Rottweiler, German sheperd, etc...?	OK, my family are planning on getting a new dog. I know plenty about the breeds and everything, but my main questionn is about rottweilers. Ill explain that in a minute, but first, what would be the best guard dog/family dog for me? I want it to be able to protect my family and guard indoors/ outdoors, but be a good pet too. Im thinking german sheperd, but the problem is Ive been mugged way too many times in this area, so I want one that looks intimidating (AKA so damn scary you walk on the other side of the road, like when you see a huge rottweiler). Ive owned german sherperds, theyre great dogs, but my next question is about my friend's rottweiler.      He bought a rottweiler for ￡700 (Pedigree, KC red, etc) and pays ￡900 to get it trained. He puts it outside and its an amazing guard dog,  the second it sees ANYONE inside the house through the window, it wants to kill them. First it watches them, then it decides if the person poses a threat. It sees me and wags its tail etc, but if it sees anyone fighting, it will try and headbutt the window and kill the attacker.      Basically, he chose the biggest, broad skulled, big boned puppy out of the litter. The dog would be the alpha male, the leader of the pack is what the breeder says. But the problem is the dog is VERY cocky and only listens to the owner, no one else in the family can properly control it. When it was 8 months old, it turned and the owner beat the hell out of it, but the dog obviously sees him as the leader and lowers its head and wags it tail etc. It starts playing with him too.       If I bought a rottweiler, not the hugest of the litter, would it be good as a guard dog/ family pet? I dont want it to attack anyone on the road.

I know that the adult food kibbles are bigger in size. But what else is different about it? The puppy food from the same brand is less expensive than the adult food (when you compare by weight), so I'm tempted to keep giving him puppy food for a bit more time.

20090220124831AAkyN40	Pets;Reptiles	Snake Transportation Question?	I am getting an Asian green vine snake tomorrow at about 2PM.    I am visiting family and leaving Sunday at 7am and will be home at 2pm to put the snake in his enclosure.       My family is TERRIFIED of snakes so they can't know I am picking up this snake tomorrow. I'm doing it while they are out. I am having the seller put the snake in a Tupperware with holes for breathing and I am going to hide the snake in my room until I leave (the next morning) sunday.       So overall the snake will be in the Tupperware for about 24 hours.  Is that OK? Will the snake survive? I mean, when you overnight a snake from a breeder it is usually that long.  The snake will stay warm and will not be cold.    The snake is legal everywhere I'm traveling just in case you were going to bring that up. :-) Already checked laws.       Thanks

A needle biopsy was one which revealed nothing. Mass will be removed and biopsied as next step. Mass seemed to appear out of no where. As my dog is 12, I am concerned about her "dying on the operating room table". She has a heart murmur of about 2 on a scale of 1-6. I am also concerned about damaging her liver. Her current bloodwork is all normal except for her ALT is 191 and ALKP is 674. The type of anesthsia being used is going to be pro something. I remember the pro but forget the rest of the name. It is all one word beginning with pro. Is it typical for a dog with this kind of backround,age etc. to go under   anesthesia? Am I taking a rare and usual chance at harming my dog? Thank you.

20090220133336AAtnkAi	Pets;Dogs	Dog pooping and peeing in the house...?	I have a 3 year old lab mix named Posey. I got her from the Humane Society when she was about 12 weeks old. She is up to date on all her shots, etc. and she weighs about 51 lbs. She has always been a very affectionate, happy dog and she still seems to be, but lately she has taken to pooping right in front of the front door (INSIDE the house) at night and she has also been peeing on the tile floor. I guess I should be glad that it's on tile and not carpet, but I'm stumped as to why this dog is behaving this way. She has been housebroken since she was about a year old so I'm at my wit's end. I take her out frequently to go to the bathroom and she is outside all day in a fenced-in area. She is only in the house at night when I am home. She has always slept on my bed at night, but over the past few months she has been very jumpy at night and won't let me sleep, so I have been letting her out into the living room. Apparently the wind was bothering her, so her vet prescribed some sedatives. I don't give them to her every night because I hate drugging her, but I'm almost to the point where I WANT to give her a pill every evening so she will sleep comfortably on my bed like she always did before. The pooping and peeing indoors only happens when she sleeps in the living room.      Any ideas? Please help me! This dog is driving me crazy!
