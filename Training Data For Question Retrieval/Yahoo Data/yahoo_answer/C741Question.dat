20090205084529AANqXEj	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	When did cans of tuna go from 6  ounces down to 5 ounces?	I'm usually pretty good with noticing this kind of thing but this seems to have slipped by me.     I really hate sneaky price increases.         This kind of practice should be illegal.      These companies are preying on the fact that a large percentage of consumers won't notice the can size reduction.    By making moderate reductions in the height of the can, they have created a 5 ounce can that is indistinguishable from a 6  ounce can.         Obviously there is no compelling consumer driven desire for a can size that is 20% smaller.  Nor are people eating 20% less tuna.        This is simply a predatory price increase.      I am not normally pro government involvement but this is an area that is spiraling out of control.     There needs to be standardized package sizes.          What do you think about these predatory practices?

My local supermarket had a couple extra Stone Brewing Company India Pale Ale "bombers" (22oz bottles) and it happens to be one of my favourite beers.

Bottom line do I really need to keep them in the fridge, or can I keep them in a cool place like my other beers? (Only have so much room in the fridge, but do keep at least a 6 pack there at all times) I went to their website (www.stonebrew.com) and there's an email I could write them at, gonna do that as well, but no phone number to call.

20090205105855AAF9uzV	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Why is Opus One so expensive?	I collect a small amount of wine. Currently I have about 60 bottles. I started collecting Opus One and a lesser-known Bordeaux by Rothschild with the 1998 vintages. Yesterday, I bought three bottles of a 2005 Concha y Toro  Don Melchor Cabernet for about $55 each, and three bottles the 2005 Opus One for about $140 each. The Don Melchor was rated by Wine Enthusiast at 96 while the Opus One has a 95 depending on which magazine rated it.      The ratings have been similar for these wines. Here's what I've been able to find for both:      2004 both were rated at 94   2002 DM was 93 OO was 94   2001 DM was 94 OO was 89   2000 DM was 95 OO was 89      I know the 89s for the Opus is not a good representation of it's true quality. Both tend to come in around the mid 90s.      Also, Don Melchor came in as the fourth best wine in 2006 according to Wine Spectator .      So, why does the Opus One get so much attention when you can get what appears to be just as good a wine for much less money? I know the name is a part of it, but why wouldn't Don Melchor end up with as good a name after years of great wine?      I guess my question is, I'm I missing something? Is there something other than name and points that make Opus worth more?

20080704071547AAys9VW	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	I'm confused on which one is healthier?	I've been drinking at least two or three juice boxes for over a year, thinking that they're healthy (especially compared to 7up/sunny D that I usually drink) but after drinking a few I started to feel kind of sick. I drink the HI C strawberry (100 calories and 26 sugars, plus it's 10% juice) with 100% vitamin C. Is that unhealthy? What about Sunny D (90 Calories, 20 sugars, 100% vitamin c, it's 3% juice, and 20% thiamin (<-even though idk what that means))? Which, if either, is healthier? How can I learn how to identify the healthy choice? I don't eat meat so I know I lose a lot of nutrients that I try to make up for in pastas and bread and stuff but how do I know if what I'm choosing is healthiest since the calories are so high?

Basically, one my of parents is going off to visit friends and relatives in Aus on friday, so I'm planning to cook for the both of them before he leaves - meaning this thursday. Now, I can cook a few things, including packet based stuff, but I'm aiming to make something a little better, just nothing to hard.      I'd really appreciate it if you guys could lend me some ideas and/or recipes that wouldn't be to complicated. Remembering I'm fifteen. I don't mind using a few packet based, but something made from hand aswell would be good.      I'll be aiming for both meal and pudding, though I have a pudding planned. So, please, anyone with meal ideas? I'm kinda desparate..      Thanks in advance btw, (:
