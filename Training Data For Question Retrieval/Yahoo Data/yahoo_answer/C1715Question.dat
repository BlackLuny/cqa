20080304184646AAYowrG	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Can you summarize this?	This year, 29 out of about 1,000 new teachers departed.               By TIA MITCHELL, The Times-Union         When school began last fall, nearly half of Highlands Middle School teachers were new.         sponsored links   florida times union archives   News From Anywhere In The World's Largest Newspaper Archive.

FreeCreditReportsInstantly.com   Ads by Yahoo!         "I always wanted to be a teacher," is something Principal Cathy Barnes remembers hearing more than once as she conducted interviews over the summer.      Most of the 26 newbies had no formal educator training. They were mostly midcareer professionals looking to make a change.      Barnes offered to give them a chance, and then set up training and coaching to help them succeed, she said. It took about a month for her to realize that not all of them would.      By the winter break, Barnes had let go four of those new teachers by invoking a state law that allows new teachers to be fired without giving a reason so long as it is done within the first half of the school year.      Known as the "97-day rule" because of the stated deadline, school administrators say it allows schools to quickly part ways with teachers that simply are not equipped for the job. However, union officials say the law makes it so easy to fire new teachers that principals do that rather than spend the time and money to mold them into better educators.      The district has approximately 9,000 teachers.      This year in Duval County, 29 out of the approximately 1,000 newly minted teachers were terminated under the 97-day rule or resigned in lieu of being terminated. Many other new teachers have also left the school system this year, though other reasons were cited for their departure. One was later rehired at another school.      After their 97-day probationary period expired on Jan. 9, those teachers received the security of knowing they cannot be fired midyear without due process. But they don't have to be reappointed to their post at the end of the school year.      After three years, Florida teachers receive tenure, meaning if during the summer break a principal decides not to invite them back to a school, they must be offered other options.      The 97-day rule was created in 1997, a time when Education Commissioner Frank Brogan was introducing sweeping education reform. At the time, a group of lawmakers wanted to eliminate teacher tenure laws. Knowing that such a law would not pass, they settled for the 97-day rule instead.      Terrie Brady, president of the local teachers union, said of the 800 teachers who have left the school system this year, she feels the 97-day rule is responsible for more than 29, possibly close to 100.      She feels half a year isn't long enough to determine who will become a great teacher.      "If somebody chooses to want to go into education, why would we not give them as much support as possible and encourage them to stay and make sure they are successful?" she said.      Brady said the school system lacks the money, time and resources to devote to professional development, especially since both new and veteran teachers are already bogged down with paperwork, mandates and other things that tax their time outside of the classroom. She advocates for more mentoring and training to help new teachers adapt to the job.      She said she agrees there are teachers who should removed from the classroom, but she thinks there should always be a process in place to hear both sides of the story and determine a fair course to follow.      Veteran educator Jim Williams was a principal for over a decade before the 97-day rule was in place and about the same time after.      During that time, he said he probably used the 97-day rule only twice.      "It was always that I cannot leave this person working with students because I believe they are doing damage to students," Williams said. "Nor do I see between now and the end of the year any change."      Williams said he always considered the impact of the decision on the students, as well as the employee. Now that he supervises a cluster of principals, he expects them to provide ample evidence supporting their decision to exercise the 97-day rule. In the end, however, he agrees that teachers who are not effective in the classroom should be removed.      "We're not an employment agency; we're a teaching institution and students ought to be primary in this," he said.

20080927025808AAs2fQc	News & Events;Current Events	How Can A Poor man Stand Such Times As These?	Paraphrasing the Blind Alfred Reid song that was later covered by Bruce Springsteen.   Anyway the poor folks from the ghettos in New Orleans are still struggling to get by with large parts of their community not yet rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina struck a few years back. Now we have the banking crisis created purely by the banks. Whilst Bush rushed to do hee haw after Katrina for the poor folks, he is rushing to save the banks with this $700 billion con trick. The banks created this mess, they should not be receiving state hand outs. Is it not funny how the Capitalists always believe in the power of the free market when it affects the poor man but believe in state aid when it affects them?   If state aid is needed, should the $ 700 billion not be used on infrastructure projects. Rebuild the schools, rebuild the Hospitals, rebuild the roads and railways, rebuild New Orleans! Unlike the badly conceived saving the banking industry plan, the money would go straight to the people who need it most. The man in the street, the construction industry and spin off companies. This would also be cheaper in the long run as the Government would recoup large chunks of the money instantly from Corporation Tax and general taxation. It would also keep the economy buoyant as it would keep money in the hands of the people who buy TVs, Cookers, Carpets, Food, etc.

I personally gave a LOT of money and so did members of my family. The money we donated was for those locals who lost everything, loved ones, villages, homes, jobs....      Now it has been claimed Millions of pounds destined for local fishing communities hit by the 2004 Tsunami are being used instead to create a surfing mecca for tourists.      While the locals stuggle daily to rebuild their lives, try to work and find food for their families, they can watch while artificial reef, beach lamposts and walkways are being built for foreign travellers.      This is disgusting! Yes it may bring more to tourists to the area but It is expected that a further 500 fishermen will lose their livelihoods, when, in addition to the surf reef, a sport fishing base for tourists is created.       http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-N...

This is where I stand      I am a christian   I am a 9/11 Truther (I have critical thinking skills)   Anyone who thinks 9/11 was done by osama is a braindead moron   I am anti-war   I am anti-nwo   I vote for people like Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin (Anti Nwo. Pro liberties)   I have no stance on abortion or homosexuality. I am not for or against, because I just dont know where to stand on these issues.      I am a proud future Draft Dodger, I believe all should dodge.      Draft Dodgers are Hero's. I look upto them.      I believe In Civil Liberties and Gun rights.      I am Anti NAU   I dont know to much about this, but i think all the countries of the world should abolish there militaries and there governments, and everybody should have the option to own a gun. (Hitler, Stalin agrees gun control works) Also everybody at 18 in the world should pledge to never goto warand they abolish the SSS as well. I assume there will never be a war ever again, Again i dont know to much about this.      I believe in law enforcement, Law and Order.      I do not support the troops.      I do not support the government      I believe Everyone is Capable of every crime, and we do not necessarily have free will.      I believe the U.S. Military Needs to get out of our schools!      If people absolutely must join the military, which nobody should right now, because of these 2 illegal wars, then they need to raise the minimum age to 21 At least, Maybe higher.      I believe people who support bush and what the damage he did to my nation, are stupid and hate liberty.      I know the truth, that wars are staged for profits of the elites.   I know about the New World Order.      I believe Iraq and Afghanistan are both illegal wars and should have never happened, and they need to end now.      I think the 40,000 deserters should be given amnesty and are and the 200 in canada are right and the ivaw.org are right
