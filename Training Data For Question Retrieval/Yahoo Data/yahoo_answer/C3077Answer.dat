IUYtmGtHaa	I have not done it personally, but through word of mouth know people who have<br>  <br>  1. worked for insurance companies, or md offices as call centers (look up telenurse, or telehealth RN)<br>  <br>  2. worked at home with research companies, but I do think you have to put in time before you can work at home.<br>  <br>  3. have worked as home health RNs. Not exactly working at home, but it is more flexible than clocking in at a hospital.|`|ZnN7KTinaa	You can come and work at my house.

HBv7EpN0aa	Yes, they are having a liquidation sale. Warning - the computers are used, and about 10 years old. They are not new. I did buy my favorite brand of perfume for $35 and it is usually $79. They are selling a lot of crap, belt buckles, skullcap hats, fake name brand purses for $5, stuff like that. Oh they have someone selling ShamWow too and I got suckered into buying one. Worth going if you don't mind paying the $6 entrance fee, just don't go expecting new Dell computers for $79, as advertised.|`|Lbg26g5xaa	My understanding is there is a sales event that started at noon today. It runs until Sunday. They are supposed to have mega deals on computers, cameras, and all kinds of goodies. I have found many of these events charge a fee around $6 a person just to get in to browse. You can get deals, but I believe they always advertise the low-end items to bait you and then get you on the real goodies once you get in there. Just remember, you get what you pay for. I'm not saying you can't get a deal, just be careful and know something about what you are purchasing before you go... or research it and return. The fee usually permits you to return for the entire weekend... with a stamp on your hand.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|jUfq0IXjaa	It is a big SCAM they get your money to in get in at $6!we saw it on tv any way to stop people like this from riping outer people off?They need to be fined and spend time in jail!dose anyone know who runs them you can always turn them into the Better Business Bureau www.bbb.org
flGXcxwGaa	Do you mean you need two people who knows what they do or how to do it. I know what crane operators do but I can't actually drive one myself. They do many things mostly helping to lift heavy objects up really high.<br>  <br>  try calling a contracotrs service or use criagslist. I would try getting in touch with a landscaper and seeing if any of them have any credited people because you do not want just anyone using a crane around anything that is yours unles they know how to currctly do it and all the building laws and requirements of what must be done and how.|`|p46Y5Qriaa	they sit and play with big toys all day i do it its fun man just do it!!|`|78MINbB5aa	They operate cranes.
