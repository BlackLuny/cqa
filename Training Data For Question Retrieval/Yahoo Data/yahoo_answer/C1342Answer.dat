NAGiNKFWaa	Well one lesson you need to learn in life is that everybody answers to somebody.  Your teacher, and counselor, both answer to the principal.  So if you are having a problem with them, you can report them to the principal.  I would suggest you write your problem down on a piece of paper, so you don't get interrupted.  If the principal doesn't help you, you can report him to the superintendent, and then the school board, and then the state, and so on, until someone helps you.  This is a good lesson to learn when you go in to the work force, everyone answers to somebody.|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	You should find help outside the school.

RLBYSpU4aa	No your not ugly. The people who are saying that you are ugly are the people who chase after unobtainable women. They look at supermodels and think that is the way everyone should look. They have no idea that when they look at those people they are looking at something that is fake. People are stupid. You are beautiful though, and a very natural beauty at that. So don't fret about what some A-Hole on the internet says. Chances are they are some 300 pound loser who lives in his mothers basement.|`|B0nTbAkwaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so of course there's going to be people calling you beautiful and ugly.

Personally, you look kind of cute (no homo) & I've seen wayyy uglier lol!|`|b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	Well the answer to whether you are ugly or pretty: you are both. Everyone has different ideas of what is beautiful. Some think you look nice, others will not. Do not worry about what people think (good or bad). Worry about being a good person. Doing good things and treating people well. And for the record i think you are VERY pretty.<br>  Take care.<br>  ~chai|`|0NcRUSCoaa	You are FAR from ugly, darling.  You are a very pretty girl.  Don't listen to people who are just trying to run you down.|`|8xH05DqDaa	Obviously you feel ugly and are confused by people telling you that you are cute. You are cute! Almost exotic but in a innocent way.

I'm fairly certain you took the pictures during a sedentary moment and your heart rate would have been between around 60 & 80 bpm....  Try get it up to 120, keep it there until comfortably 'cruising' on it's plateau and look at the difference, it's like; Constance Wellbeing the superwoman of steel, multiwholegrain friendly bacteria drinks with added caffeine boost and unending spa weekend break posture, smiles back & says, "yes it's this way"<br>  <br>   To my mind, you actually look like someone & I cannot place the name - but highly comparable in every given likeness, overall facial features & shape, eyes, lips, etc...   <br>   To your credit you have deep soulful eyes - a knowing smile with cheeks bunched up confidently to frame them under soft unfurrowed brows & a flash of the pearly whites would crown your PhotoBouquet, perhaps also 'wearing' your hair for best effect (something less permanent than puncturing skin), a single accessory here performs tirelessly as an interchangeable bit (colours, designs, size) & you can wear it differently too, while the same cost in reliably good piercings again still commits you to that permanent scar, in one place.....  If you 'must' anyway, try something that's stick-on instead before you commit to it.|`|6GmtcZteaa	You're gorgeous.

5nni4JRyaa	Could be the couple married too soon without exploring their issues. <br>  <br>  It can happen when two people don't start out as friends, but sex partners. Later thinking that they have something and marry, and then realize that they have issues.<br>  <br>  People change everyday. If a couple isn't communicating all the time about their life and the changes. Then yes, two people can grow apart. Communicating at least 3 times a day can help prevent this. Mainly making sure that the last conversation of the day is the longest one.<br>  <br>  Starting out as friends and then letting the relationship develop by accident is the best way to insure a long lasting partnership. However, one has to be always ready for the changes that occur all the time. <br>  <br>  Ultimately the best laid plans cannot always insure a relationship. It'll always be a risk. The only thing you can really do is study what makes a happy relationship. This will help decrease the chances of finding a bad seed.<br>  <br>  As you probably have learned by now. There is no guarantee in this life.|`|0XR15Dbuaa	1 cause is selfishness.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	selfishness, unforgiveness, impatience, and the attempt unity of two imperfect people requires strength to keep it together greater than what they have in themselves.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Money, Infidelity, Falling out of love, Different goals in life. In my humble opinion, most of these individuals are ill prepared for marriage. How many of them actually discuss their long term plans. Such as number of children, where to live, will mom or dad work if or when children arrive. How much money to contribute to savings. What if one of you plan to go back to college or wants to quit his/her job. These are the type of questions that need to be asked.
86PFQF4raa	(Have you seen the movie "The Birds" lol <br>  If you really dreamed this kind of dream,then you are missing some magic in your life.Has soon as you return home you will receive plenty of magic through the touching of our hands.I have so much love for you.My love would fill the size and depth of the Gran-canyon.A never-ending supply for you.(I LOVE YOU ) Darling with all my heart.|`|CguXFU4paa	Our dream are caused by our thoughts rather we see them or not.

AA10916001	I most certainly have.    Right now he is sitting on our couch reading the paper.    I'm sure our love is the real thing....we have been married (Happily!) for over 16 years and have two handsome (they look like their dad), intelligent, well-behaved teen-age sons.    Our marriage at times is not easy, but we are fully devoted to each other and if there are difficult periods, we work through them. To us, since we are one of the few fortunate couples who met each other and actually enjoy each others company it is totally worth being there "for better and for worse". We are each others best friend.    My parents were married (And in love!!!!!) for over 50 years. They were a huge inspiration to both of us. When my dad gave the toast at our marriage, he used a wonderful quote that we had written in calligraphy and framed: "Marriage does not consist of gazing at each other, but looking forward in the same direction together".    It is also important for people to remember that marriage and long term relationships are hard work. If a person is going to cut and run in the face of adversity, then they might as well not even bother having a relationship with anyone because ALL relationships have problems. All of them. that's life and life is not fair.    If you have not met the love of your life ("Soul mate") I sincerely hope you do. If you have not, be patient, keep looking and never, ever settle.|`|xN5QDXMmaa	Not Yet.|`|houWY7qvaa	yes and he is here with me|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Yes!  Learning to appreciate self has opened a frontier of appreciation, compassion, devotion, education, knowledge, and pleasure.  Intellectual growth is an empowering dynamic that inspires a phenomenal personal evolution.      It is this increasing the capacity to love self that facilitates sharing the wisdom of achievement, accomplishment, and self reliance.   Self enrichment is fundamental sharing the wealth of education and experience.    Love will always be in the Mirror.    Love is the radiant reflection of self.    Love is the opportunity to embrace life.|`|YWQdsoOMaa	God is the love of my life.  For I have God in me and that love transcends to others, especially to the ones who don't believe in God.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	Ya, it's called honesty.

We have been having some troubles lately, so I hope we will pull through, but at one point I swore he was my soul mate (however naive that may have been).|`|tVvhbPLfaa	I think I could have - - we shall see. I am bit apprehensive until I'm 100% but yeah he's an awesome person.|`|Xl28pRORaa	idk. im not sure.|`|WmZqykz1aa	We've been married for more than thirty years.    I absolutely believe that he is the love of my life.  I also believe that had our situations been different, he would have found a different love, and so would I.  People are made to love, but it takes a lot of effort.  You have to communicate, bargain, compromise, and take the effort seriously, or it slips away.  The experiences of lust and infatuation are quick and easily available, but it takes time to develop any sort of lasting love.    I love my husband with all my heart, and am secure that he loves me.  However, I've seen enough widows and widowers in my lifetime to know that you can start over.  It won't be the same, but it can still be grand.      Love is only a risk until you trust the other person to love you back.  After that commitment on both sides, it's an effort but not a risk.  If you don't put in the effort to stay connected, however, then risk returns.      For us, it's the real thing.  I know where he is emotionally and mentally as well as physically, and I trust him implicitly.  He trusts me, too.  We didn't get this way over night, but I'm sure it will continue this way as long as we both live.  If I should die, I'd expect him to find a new love.  If he goes, it will be difficult, but eventually, I'd put my heart back out there.  I believe people are meant to love.|`|qq1q0NEpaa	I believe I have...where is he?  At work making money to take care of me & our 2 kids :)  What is it? Hmmm...a male hehe.  Am I sure it's the real thing or is it another risk I am taking?  I guess nobody is really sure if it is the absolute real thing until you guys are together until the end of time right?  Cause anything can happen.  As of right now, I would consider him a risk, but he is a risk I am enjoying every minute of taking.  He has given me 2 beautifu children & 5 of the greatest years of my life.  I have never been happier in my entire life.      Before I was with him I thought I was in love once with another man.  And now there is a HUGE HUGE HUGE difference in how I felt then, and how I feel NOW with HIM.  It's completely undescribeable...|`|si0TWxGGaa	my boyfriend and i have been going out since we are 14 years old. we are now 20 and i think it was the best "yes" i have ever given him. my boyfriend is white canadian and im hmong (asian) canadian.

I continued to think so for the 28 years we were married.  When he died in May of 1997, I thought the world had ended!    Then, in March of 2003, I met my current boyfriend.  There is no doubt that HE is the TRUE love of my life!  He has all the good qualities of my late mate, none of the bad ones and the most beautiful human personality I have ever encountered!.    We live together unmarried because financial complications regarding his health care and insurance make it necessary, but we both know we are a permanent couple for the rest of our lives!    As much as I loved my late husband, and thought any chance for happiness in this life died with him, I would not trade my current boyfriend for him  if I could have him back alive and well today!    It has been a wonderful and amazing experience to have discovered the REAL love of my life at the age of 59 - long after I had thought I'd lost any hope or chance of ever loving and being loved again!
sIhPpdv3aa	A lot of dream interpretation is about what was happening before and after, and about how you react to stuff. More details, please!<br>  <br>  Was it cool-looking? did it remind you of something? was it like the world was ending? Were you with someone who you have a troubled relationship with? Were you seeing it from space?|`|e4OWhHP1aa	there are a number of possibilities, and as cristina said, we cannot give an accurate interpretation without more details, for example, i could get a better idea of what caused it if i knew how old/young you are, and if i knew how the dream made you feel  could get a better image of what it was like.<br>  <br>  i think that you are getting bothered by this whole 'global warming' stuff. you are subconsiously worried that if we all dont change soon, then we will be scorched. <br>  <br>  but another idea, if you are say, 13 or 14 your mind will be much more vunerable. and if you have just learned about stars and supernovas in school, and not understood it properly, it could be the way your brain is trying to make sense of the information. i was 10 when i first learned that stars exploded, and i kept looking at the sun, hoping it wouldn't explode in my lifetime, but then i learned that it would be in millions of years.<br>  <br>  i could be miles off here, but i hope that i have helped in some way
uXqDYPNVaa	There should only be one set of laws/rights per country and, in some cases, one set of laws/rights that applies to all countries (i.e. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Geneva Conventions, etc.). If different groups of women don't want to take advantage of certain rights, that's their business, but there's no legitimate reason for them not to be available.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	A major problem of feminist ideology is that it often confuses being equal with men with being identical to men. Womens rights around the world are an important indicator of understanding global well-being. Many may think that womens rights are only an issue in countries where religion is law, such as many Muslim countries. Or even worse, some may think this is no longer an issue at all.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I believe women's rights should be universal. That being said - there are actually a lot of women - especially in the Muslim world who either through brainwashing or just truly believing it think that their status - given to them by men - is deserved and welcomed.    I think a lot of feminists are working hard to try to change life for women in countries where they are severely stripped of their human rights.|`|3Ige8x7gaa	All women should have equal rights as men. The End.|`|Ks99kkNfaa	Ummmm- well- NO  I think all people, including women, should have the same human rights.  Weird question "scratching head"|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Well, I actually think that women with children have more rights than those of us who don't. I have lost count of how many times ive had to take a back seat for a woman with kids. And I'm sorry, but it wasnt part of the deal! I havent chosen to remain childless so that i can compensate for those who have chosen to have children.|`|rpajoT0raa	The example of Sharia Law being applied to women is the UK is where it all goes wrong. Feminism advocates equal rights for women under the laws of a country. And this can extend to the social justice arguments against women not having equal rights under the laws of other countries. Can we argue that the laws of other countries are wrong? Hekk yeah; if those laws are socially unjust then we should keep on arguing.    Edit-  LOL wow you are sooooo simplistic....noone needs to move to the country where women are denied rights to fight it. Feminists are not matyristic suicide bombers. There are more effective channels to assist social justice - through government, the media, trade negotiations, cultural influence and disseminating information to the oppressed so they can become aware of the wrongs and learn to fight it themselves.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	They already do...there is no such thing as the 'universal' woman...or for that matter life opportunities or experience. Women are not only discriminated against because of their gender, but also because of class, race, sexuality, ability, age etc...That is what makes the drive for equality difficult within a system which relies on societal hierarchies to propogate itself.   But, no, to allow cultural norms to mask oppression of any group in society is wrong. If you are also suggesting that western feminism should be criticised for its failure to deal with issues of race class and sexuality effectively, then would also agree, but many of us have been successful in  ensuring those criticisms have been taken on board. That is why, hopefully, the most effective and world changing wave of feminism is emerging from those very countries where women's rights are oppressed in the most brutal ways. And when those women revolt, it will make the cultural shift of the 60's in the west look like a bit of a tiff!  And so many inequities used to be part of our culture...from slavery to children up chimneys..never made it right or moral did it?  And lets be careul about confusing equality and greater independence..just because a cage is gilded, it is still a cage...western women should not look at 'poor Muslim women' veiled, in Afghanistan, their very movements affected, their health damaged, then walk purposefully away feeling liberated in 4 inch high heels affecting their movement, their physical well being etc...women's perception of freedom may also be relative to their life experiences!|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Different categories of women?! How can there be different categories of women - that implies, to me, that you perceive women of different cultures have less or more value than another.     All women should have equal rights, no matter where they came from.|`|onbwN4csaa	All people of all cultures. should have all the same rights.

But then who ?????????????????.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	No. By the way, I completely agreed with what you wrote on the other question.     By the way part deux, I have a feeling (based on experience) that people also give a thumbs down to answers they don't understand.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Well, no. That would in fact be in accordance to what we refer to as 'Orwellian Nightmare'.|`|AA12316366	all people, men, women, children etc should have equal rights but maybe children should  have some extras|`|P8vt2aLhaa	I think all women should have equal rights no matter where they live. As for if they live in another country that does not have the same laws or rights then until it changes you should abide by those laws and rights where you live at that time. If you don't agree then lobby to get them changed.
jIk2ttH1aa	I think that would give them a good indication as to what the issue is that brought you there.  I don't think they would 'judge' you in a bad way for it, I think it would give them further insight as to what is going on with you.  Alot of people express themselves in writing.  You could write down things before hand and bring them into your session and if you really feel anxious about speaking you could do the same in your session.  Or have premade index cards yes, no, sometimes, I understand, I am confused, etc....to hold up.  Eventually if the therapist is any good they will be able to coax you into speaking, not force you into it.|`|3pZJYpu3aa	that u dont speak at all|`|OUbNSXjJaa	She will go on thinking instead of giving you the proper advice.|`|bt8CNlVuaa	nothing. my friend does this with her t, and i do it with mine all the time. they dont mind at all, they usually understand that we can express more through writing, or that we have trouble speaking.  it will all be okay, dont worry about it.  good luck  xx|`|AA10798839	Would waste time ascertaining if you were mute next depending on answer if you had physical illness that stopped you from speaking and depending on answer: start to wonder what kind of game you were playing, and reason for it.

mCAWxobNaa	The Feminists will argue frequently that they should be compensated more because they have parenting responsibilities that men supposedly don't.  It's a pretty silly argument if you ask me, but that's basically it.  I don't see how or why ladies should receive more remuneration because of responsibilities they have at home.  If one of those responsibilities is taking care of a child, well that's life.  If we start paying ladies to be moms, then the next step is for me to start demanding money for brushing my teeth.<br>  <br>  The wage gap is nonsense that's been debunked long ago.  If there's any question as to why, for example, ladies aren't equally represented in the hard sciences and maths, it's because this is a matter of choice and nothing more.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	The complaint that the wage-gap is dependent on gender would cease to exist when people realize the truth for what it is. People whining about it existing because of their gender is a result of massive statistic massaging by Feminists.<br>  <br>  Ok, the whining has begun ! :-D|`|iHKJsyfTaa	The wage gap is a misstatement of fact.<br>  <br>  It is based on total dollars earned<br>  <br>  More men work, they work longer hours and at higher paying jobs ,they also work more years.<br>  <br>  The total dollars earned by men are more , not because of an imbalance in the rate of pay , but rather the type and the amount of work done.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	"wrong" and "justified" are mutually exclusive concepts.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	The reporting of wage gap statistics is notoriously skewed and inconsistent.  Aggregate reporting does not indicate the reality of pink collar ghetto jobs, the gender distribution of executive (CEO/CFO) positions, nor does it recognize the completely unbiased step/tier system used by the American government for civilian employees.<br>  <br>  When a real apples to apples comparison is made, the differential is less than 2%.  <br>  <br>  <br>  So what is your point?|`|V1MptCMiaa	It's a woman's job to physically provide for the family (take/pick kids up from school, doctors/dentist appointments, illness...) the man usually has nothing to do with that kind of stuff so he has no reason to work less.  I know that when I was younger, my dad never took off when I got sick or had a doctors appointment and he never cooked, all he did was work.

9b66cd8ec3fab9f633ae688834cf4043aa	well I don't know about school counsellors per se, but I do know about counsellors "out in the real world".  The first session is usually just getting to know you, and why you are there. My counsellor asked me to explain why I was there and what I wanted by the end of my "therapy". What expectations I had and then to try to tell him in my own words what I thought my "problem" was.    The first session was very interactive and he asked me questions to which I replied. I didn't have to do that much talking on my own that very first time.  The following meetings that we have had so far have been interactive as well. Although much less than the first session. I talk about what's in my head at the time, maybe what's bothering me, or just about what I've done so far that week.    The counsellor is there to help you, not terrify you or force you to talk about things you don't want to talk about. If it helps, you should look at them just as a really good friend who is a good listener. Or a diary perhaps. Just unload what you have on your mind onto them, they won't judge. And as it is a school counsellor they may even give you some sound advice or reassuring.  And if you voice your concern about not feeling very comfortable just talking about yourself and that you'd prefer a more interactive approach I'm sure that the counsellor would try to accommodate your wishes.    I know when I was in school, my school counsellors had issues with students not feeling comfortable coming to see them. So they renamed themselves to "school buddies", which sorta took the edge off it all and didn't make it seem as daunting going to see them.
bwRp0EeWaa	You would have to lay out your whole personality/character to determine that, and that's far too much here. However, you can ask yourself: do you reflect your insecurities onto other people, constantly seeking confidence or reassurance in an overbearing manner? Or do you internalize these insecurities, appearing confident but letting these thoughts weigh on you inside? Neither is healthy for you.  Because you asked the question, I would suggest finding someone to talk to: a doctor, counselor, someone at your church, someone educated on this subject.     Also, consider how much time and energy you put into these thoughts: 5 minutes a day, 5 hours, 8 hours? Do your insecurities interfere with your ability to recognize what makes you special, your good qualities? If these thoughts control too much of your time, I would say it is time to seek help. And seeking help does not make you crazy, but rather smarter. Meanwhile, spend some time each day recognizing what is good about you, and do not give any thoughts to your insecurities until you have done this. In other words, do not let your insecurities control you.
H3JK4Zp2aa	I have just been reading about this.  <br>  <br>  "A key word is that our dominance is a preference, not an absolute... it is not so much that we are biologically right brain or left brain dominant, but that we are more comfortable with the learning strategies characteristics of one over the other."  <br>  <br>  I took this test, <br>  <a href="http://frank.mtsu.edu/~studskl/hd/hemis.html" rel="nofollow">http://frank.mtsu.edu/~studskl/hd/hemis....</a><br>  <br>  and the indication is that I function almost fully right brained.<br>  <br>  Over the years, though, I have learned to use the left side of my brain.  This mostly has come from necessity.  If I were not able to tap into the left side on occasion, I would probably never be balanced.<br>  <br>  From what I've been reading and from personal experience, most of us have a dominant side.  The analytical side is our left brain, the intuitive side, our right.  To be in balance, we need both but not necessarily equal, imho.  I feel that we, as individuals, have the ability to tap into either yet we naturally default to our dominant left or right side. <br>  <br>   The truth is, just about everyone uses BOTH sides, it just depends on which side a person naturally functions predominantly.  <br>  <br>  The answer: Yes, of course we do need both sides, but the degree is probably never going to be 50/50.  What is more important to achieve a personal sense of balance with right/left activity is not forcing them to be EQUAL.    Balance, for an individual, is a personal thing and has much to do with our own preferences and ideals.  Most artists seem to function more towards their right brain yet regularly use their left brain everyday.  To achieve balance really doesn't have much to do with equality of left/right sides, rather the degree that a person chooses, as individuals, to be the person whom they are.  Balance, therefore, has much to do with a personal sense of identity and thus differs from person to person. <br>  <br>  For me, I feel most comfortable as a 'right brained" person, yet I know that to function in society, it is necessary for me to tap into my left brain sometimes, in order  to achieve my own sense of balance.|`|gor9l2Fmaa	You can reach your potential with one side of the brain completely removed.  It is just that your potential will be reduced in certain ways.  If you are interested in acheiving balance across specific categories you can do that with a left brain emphasis (logical, rational, analytical) or right brain emphasis (random, subjective, intuitive).<br>  <br>  There is a web site that focuses on balance between five major categories of your life:  Financial, Intellectual, Spiritual, Health and Relationships.  You can take a left or right brained approach to improving your balance.  The web site has a life balance test you can take (you must join the site first, but that's a good thing).<br>  <br>  Personally I am very left brained.  I can't draw anything more complex than a stick figure.  Yet I consider myself to be a very creative person.  I find creative solutions to problems and often "think outside the box."|`|reFBvTvSaa	Balance is achieved from the ear.  I believe that it is sort of a reflex and only loops in the brain stem.

We are cross-wired through the spinal cord.  Our nerves from the left side of our body go through the spine to the right and up to the brain.

We have two brain parts, two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, two breast-sides, two pairs of heart chambers, two lungs, two kidneys, two..., two balls, two ovaries, two nates, two ... souls! Perhaps also two souls, why not!!<br>  <br>  Also, as separate bodies again we are two, male and female.<br>  <br>  An old obscure myth, that I think I have from Blavatsky, goes that once during the primeval dawn of all dawns male and female where sublimely blissfully ardently together in one single body. Then the notorious envious bad goddess decided to split them, thus bringing about two quite distinct beings out of one, one male, the other female, and from then on they only and with many difficulties could try and unite in their outside, the one only very limitedly understanding and penetrating the other, and their off-spring ever inherited the characters of two different beings.<br>  <br>  But as for our brain sides, our brain sides obviously, and for the whole of our life-time, ever elaborate and interact in a wondrous harmony, but we do not fully reach our potential, not even by ever using and astutely boosting up both of them in greatest exertion and with all the available outer help. Not yet. Maybe never at our present earthly level of simian evolution. Perhaps later.

For me, the key lies more within my body.  It has less to do with right side/left side, but I do need both in order to have the balance that I need to move my life forward.<br>  <br>  We really need both.

nkTKIXcBaa	Aww I'm sorry :(<br>  You really need to have a nice emotional talk with your parents. It seems like you already put a lot of pressure on yourself, so explain that to them and tell them that they don't need to worry about you doing your best. Ask them to get off your back for a week, and during that week, be the most responsible perfect child ever. If they just start yelling at you again, tell them that they're wrong, that their criticisms don't apply to you. Unless you do procrastinate, in which case, stop.<br>  Whatever you do, wait until tomorrow to talk to your parents, since you're in a bad mood right now. It's hard to think straight while you're in a bad mood. <br>  That said, I highly doubt that you failed the test because your mom made you study. It's more like you failed the test because you spent the time she made you "study" resenting her and not paying attention. I've done it before; it's annoying of me to assume that you're doing the same thing, but it seems pretty likely. She's probably right about your study skills. Develop a bearable way of studying, like flashcards, doing practice problems, or copying your notes (rather than just reading the chapter over and over) and that should help. It'll also get her off your back if she sees you obviously doing work, of your own accord, without her nagging you.|`|nM2k6geEaa	Thank you, I know you wish you didn't have to bother with my studies, but you want me to succeed in life and be Truly proud of myself<br>  The best way of relieving stress is to beat it by overcoming the problem<br>  Education is the root of all income, do you want to live the american dream, prepare for the job or business now!|`|pAC9yVlBaa	Your parents seem mean and overpowering, but they really are doing that to make sure you do your best.

Wpulf29Maa	psychiatrist: A psychiatrist (also archaically called an alienist) is a physician who specializes in psychiatry and is certified in treating mental disorders.[1] All psychiatrists are trained in diagnostic evaluation and in psychotherapy. And, as part of their evaluation of the patient, psychiatrists are one of only a few mental health professionals who may prescribe psychiatric medication, conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and electroencephalograms, and may order brain imaging studies such as computed tomography or computed axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scanning.<br>  <br>  <br>  psychologist: is an academic, occupational or professional title describing individuals who are either: [1] social scientists conducting research and/or teaching psychology in a college or university; employed by the government in psychology positions; <br>  or professionals who apply the science of psychology in health care services or in business and industry. <br>  There are many different types of psychologists, as is reflected by the 56 different divisions of the American Psychological Association (the APA). [2] Psychologists are generally described as being either "applied" or "research" oriented.

You glimpse someone from the corner of your eye and turn to find them staring at you.<br>  <br>  Another possible explanation is the kind of long lines that fish and other animals have that allow them to sense the approach of predators from changes in electromagnetic fields.  It is quite likely that some sort of similar sense apparatus exists in humans, but that we aren't highly conscious of it.<br>  <br>  Yet another explanation might be pheromones or other olfactory sense of others.

No you guys are not super heroes!! It is possible to just have the feeling that someone is staring at you. Staring is very powerful, even dogs don't like to be stared at in the eyes.

The social research projects are usually involved social concern/ social issue. The social research tend to explain how that particular issue affect the society or to find out the predictions of the society in the future. Depends on the purposes of the researchers, the social research projects will be done in different ways like secondary research or primary research
8WgEN8gAaa	The Nuclear plants that are proposed for construction in the US in the next 1-10 years will cost between 5-7 billion dollars per reactor, depending on which design.  In the past, they were built for as little as 300 million dollars.        * Provisional contracts for two 1,117 MWe AP1000 reactors at the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station have estimated final costs of approximately $4.9 billion per reactor. [1]        * On April 9, 2008, Georgia Power Company reached a contract agreement for two AP1000 reactors to be built at Vogtle, at an estimated final cost of $14 billion. [2]    The profit on a running reactor is about $1 million dollars a day, the cost is 5.93 cents per kWh, and includes Uranium for fuel, insurance, waste disposal, and employees like security.    The lifetime cost of new generating capacity in the United States was estimated in 2006 by the U.S. government: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MWh, coal (cheap in the U.S.) at $53.10, natural gas at $52.50 and nuclear at $59.30.  "Future costs" include the cost to decommission a reactor, which is currently around $300 million dollars.  If we expand the topic from electricity to energy in general, Nuclear Power really starts to get cheap.  According to Dr. Arthur Robinson of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine: The construction of just one nuclear power station like Palo Verde (CA) in each of the 50 states, with a full complement of 10 reactors, would supply all of the energy that the United States currently importswith, in addition and at current prices, $300 billion per year worth of excess energy to export.    Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into parts (lighter nuclei) often producing free neutrons and other smaller nuclei, which may eventually produce photons (in the form of gamma rays). Fission of heavy elements is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments (heating the bulk material where fission takes place). Fission is a form of elemental transmutation because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom.    Nuclear energy is a way of creating heat through the fission process of atoms. All power plants convert heat into electricity using steam. At nuclear power plants, the heat to make the steam is created when atoms split apart -- called fission. (Other types of power plants burn coal or oil for heat to make steam.)    The fission process take place when the nucleus of a heavy atom, like uranium or plutonium, is split in two when struck by a neutron. The "fissioning" of the nucleus releases two or three new neutrons.    It also releases energy in the form of heat. The released neutrons can then repeat the process. This releases even more neutrons and more nuclear energy. The repeating of the process is called a chain reaction. In a nuclear power plant, uranium is the material used in the fission process.      The heat from fission boils water and creates steam to turn a turbine. As the turbine spins, the generator turns and its magnetic field produces electricity. The electricity can then be carried to your home, so you can work on the computer, watch television, play video games, or make toast!    MW = Mega Watt (1 million watts)  kW= Kilo Watt (1 thousand watts)|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Very expensive to construct, about $2000- 4000 per kilowatt of capacity, or $5 to $10 billion per reactor.|`|pJ87narOaa	it cost lot of money i guess 700 million dollar or so.

uIXpjxTpaa	Im just an A2 psychology student but this topic interests me so this is what i have concluded;<br>  <br>  Its quite difficult to prove that becoming a serial killer is genetic, althought psychological studies have shown that some killer have a different chemical balance in certain parts of their brain effecting their behaviour. <br>  <br>  Otherwise i would say serial killing is a balance of both genetic and environmental as some personality traits can be catergorized as being able to kill ie- lack of emotions or understand of others. etc...<br>  But mainly environmental as from a young age we are shown violence and anger for example you play games where you kill people -- they die then the next time their back again. Therefore influencing our thoughts about death from a early age and then as you get older death becomes an everyday thing in you life from the news etc.. possibly becoming a 'norm' to a small percentage of people.<br>  <br>  Serial Killers have also been known to say they experience sexual pleasure from it. (weird) <br>  Most serial killers come from a suppressed background or abuse as a child. Killing is a form of empowerment for them sometimes.<br>  Hence their being a type of man/women being killed. <br>  <br>  Therapy or Drugs? It is a possibility, like for the chemical imbalance, if found at an early stage... erm... i dont think their children would be in the risk of becoming a serial killer due to genetics because some children dont even know their parent was/is one. If a child of a serial killer does become one its because of their influences and environment brought up in. <br>  <br>  It is possible for anyone to become a serial killer is socialised or subjected to an environment with violence/ death being acceptable.<br>  <br>  Sorry its so long winded:( & hope it makes sense<br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|Rt02nQ7yaa	it becomes an urge from enviromental isues, the urge to feel power and the urge to feel free from pain by making an other pay, in some cases i meen in these cases it starts off an urge or fantasy then they live of that fantasy they get this wierd buzz inside them like they are free gen soon this buz aint great enough, so they have to act out there fantasy to witness that power and feeling the emotion of killing.|`|LC3Gf5uBaa	I don't think its meant as an excuse.

Pijw2xnKaa	This would require some more knowledge about the person and his/her environment. It could have been gang related, the individual could have had an increased amount of violence in his/her life growing up, he/she could have been acting out.

J97kVSJ4aa	Hi, I applaud your decision to steer clear of smoking.  You will encounter many many people during your life such as this.  I've known people who have fallen to alcohol, hard drugs, and others food (obesity has become almost as big a problem).<br>  <br>  To be fair, I know great people with good personalities who help others and contribute to society that also smoke but they are not doing themselves a good service.  The best thing you can do is be strong for your friend, perhaps mention it in a non-threatening fashion and if that person rejects your talk or decides to continue anyway then you've exhausted all your possibilities.  People will ultimately just do as they see fit.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much :)  Keep yourself clean and perhaps some day your friend may think about how they should have listened to you.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I wouldn't be around someone that smokes either.

CGvjALPOaa	choosing to be affected throughout your life by a trauma that you experienced is the victims mentality. the dangers are never moving on with your life, being held back by this trauma you have experienced, and possibly the loss of friends and maybe family. i believe, that to rise above a victims mentality is to come to terms with it, accept that it happened, accept that it has past, and forgive

2GNFQPdmaa	One of the first and worst ways that Canada was affected was when the American dollar was worth the same as or less than the Canadian dollar. Canada has an export economy, and export economies prefer to have cheap currency because it means their goods will sell better in other countries. When the American dollar dropped in value, a lot of exporters in Canada were hurt, because they had a lot of American dollars that were suddenly worth less, and their exports were now more expensive in America, making Americans less likely to buy them. The drop in oil prices has hurt Canada, too. Alberta's projects to develop its oil sands for exploitation have been basically put on hold because oil is too cheap for them to make a profit on it.

Only "good" drugs like weed, mushrooms, and maybe LSD can open certain pathways in the brain that allow you to see things differently. I've never done "bad" drugs like meth, heroin, crack, etc, so I can't say anything about those, except that they can mess you up in a very bad way. I'm a weed smoker, and I can tell you from experience that it has not affected my life in any way other than I am much more "chill" than I was before I started smoking, and I feel as if I can see things from different perspectives. NOT ALL DRUGS ARE BAD, but remember, a "good" drug can be bad if not used properly or in moderation.
O15my3olaa	The fastest way you can recover lost ground is to take the following steps::    >>Form a group of 3 or 4 friends for moral support and as a general  study group, for exchange of notes, revision, etc. Choose one or two who are really good at maths.    >>If you are still 'slow' at basic maths, practice addition and multiplication now and then, with younger siblings, cousins or neighbours. Like doing a quick mental calculation for 7+8+9, 12+25+33, 6x7+8, 8x9+9, etc. You will get very good at it, and gain lots of confidence. It can be fun with maths games. Explore. You will have no more phobia.    >>Spend twice as much time on practicing maths problems than on other subjects. Do more than the usual home-work given. If you are not organized, have a rough time-table. That's the trick to get all critical things done. Read a couple of books on mathematicians and their works, ancient or modern.    >>Believe me once you get into an organized routine, your progress will be fast. Generally maths is easier to score than other subjects once you get going. And later you will need less time than on other subjects like history, literature, geography, etc which need lots of revisions to score 70% and beyond. It is possible to score more than 80% in maths with lesser effort.    It is not difficult when you have friends' support and when you are determined to succeed. Wish you success!  :-))|`|KEqMlOhraa	if you actually try and learn about the theroys that are in maths then you question....

It might help if you try to instead reassociate math with something positive - for example, eating your favorite snack while studying for an important math test, or doing math homework with a good friend.    If you have more positive feelings about math, it will become easier for you to learn it and make you more willing to try harder when you're learning part of math that's particularly difficult - you can do it!|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	try to do some equations in your head like love+trust= happiness...     n find everything n apply it in maths,.. it's not that difficult,.. u can like it if u keep trying.. buy books where u get exercises n keep doin them in ur free time... u have to like wat ur doing...|`|yg2eqkYMaa	ur not alone...i dont like it either....but i always stay with couple of mates who r great at maths so they help me a lot...but in ur case i believe that u should always remember one thing which is u need to pass maths classes to achieve ur aim,and u DONT want some silly maths classes to beat u..i kno its stupid but it works with me!  i am in year 11 btw  if u need a lil chat IM me|`|0LHXNXVfaa	u can't

3rq39Pgmaa	There is nothing wrong with needing someone to talk to, but I think to answer your question you need to understand why you do these things. The answer will be different for different people. The fact that you recognize you're "needy/clingy" and want to change is the biggest factor in your ability to change, so you're off to a good start. So really try to think about why you are and be honest with yourself. I tend to take a "cognitive-behaviorist approach" which means you have to change the way you think before you can change your actions. But you have to understand why you do things before you can change the way you think (psychoanalysis approach). So why do you depend on people? Do you like the attention? Do you feel you can't care for yourself? Then ask why you feel that way, then think about the truth of the situation. I used to be very dependent on an ex of mine. But through tons of psychology courses, I started to examine myself. I'm extremely independent now and it is invigorating! You can find the answers in yourself, you just have to take the time to "introspect."|`|LC3Gf5uBaa	People weren't meant to be alone.

Right now you are co-dependent, meaning you probably have low self-esteem and lack confidence.  You don't realize your own potential.  You are a better, stronger person than you give yourself credit for.  Next time you feel the need to have someone "take care" of you, stop yourself and realize that you are strong enough to take care of yourself!  Good luck! :)

AA12022384	The money he has released is for agencies who offer family planning advice in addition to birth control and abortion.  These are women in the poorest countries in the world who deserve to have the same and certainly need it more access to birth control that the vast majority of women in the western world have.  Abortion is just a small part of the services they offer.    Well done Mr President for seeing that by providing these women with access to birth control they stand a better chance of being able to feed, cloth, educate and pay for the necessary medicine for the children they already have who then have a far better chance of reaching adulthood.     Here at last there is a President who has lived in a country and seen the effects of poverty first hand, even though he was only a child this has stayed with him and he is acting with real humanity.    The anti-abortionists are deliberately ignoring these facts by repeatedly saying this is money for abortions.  The withholding of these funds by Bush no doubt caused the deaths of far more children through starvation, malnutrition to say nothing of the women who died because they were unable to survive another pregnancy.  More will have died than would ever have been aborted.  They are using the plight of the poorest women in the world who they really care nothing about.  If they really cared about these children they would not keep telling these lies.    Shame on them.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Human Rights activists, more than Feminists are required all the time. What happened to 'some people' rejoicing that Obama himself was a Feminist? "babies aren't human" - What are they then? Aliens?|`|YQOT68xFaa	Are you for real? If you are serious, then please explain to me how exactly a baby is not human. Science says otherwise. Obama seems like he's no longer in pro-choice territory; he's just plain pro-abortion. It's disturbing.    And one of the reasons I think exporting abortion is a mistake is because the U.S. is in severe debt. You guys owe trillions of dollars, and he wants to fund abortions overseas?? What the heck?! That's so stupid. If women want to kill their babies, let them fund it out of their own pockets or let their own governments help. Obama should be focusing on finding ways to *stop* spending.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	No it shows that we need less of it if the president is giving away money to fund murder around the world.|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	Not really.  That statistic in itself is not meaningful without a proper analysis of the reasons for approval or disapproval of that order.  For instance, some people might disapprove of their taxes being used on non-domestic health policies, which is not related to their personal position on the legal/ethical aspects of abortion.    That is if you really want an answer to your question. (But it seems you just are using Yahoo Answers just to make political statements).|`|RuLPI7CEaa	The elite are worried about the population growth.  Feminist are the dupes who aid them in slowing the growth.    Obama is their mangina.    Need more abortion, need more war and need to turn more kids gay since they don't reproduce.  CheckMate|`|AA11532132	The idea that a human baby is not human is preposterous. They are genetically identifiable as a completely independent human entity at the moment of conception.     The concept that abortions are an indispensable service suggests more than I think you are willing to admit. If you believe that a woman needs the option of abortion or is otherwise unable to be equal to a man because of her reproductive organs and their role in the continuation of the human species, you are suggesting that women are inherently and biologically inferior to men.     Why don't we celebrate all that is glorious about women? They hold within them the ability to create life.  We, as a nation, are slowly robbing women of their humanity.|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Feminism is not the promotion of women, it is the promotion of an "approved" stereotype.  Feminism decries and berates women who choose to be stay at home wives or, Lord help us, raise a family.  The only women modern "feminism" supports are those who choose to attempt to parallel the traditional roles of men.  Only working career women get any praise from modern feminists.  Only women who "wear the pants" in their family (whatever shape it may be) get praise from modern feminists.  The whole movement is such a farce, and I think most American women see right through it, which is why groups like NOW, with their radical liberal agendas, have such a difficult time raising and maintaining group membership levels.    As far as babies go ... how can you argue that they aren't human?  Sure, they can't vote, but what do you think they are going to grow into, trees?  A HUMAN baby can only become a HUMAN adult.  It can't turn into anything else.  So why is this still an argument.  This is why modern feminists are ignored even by the women they seek to recruit.  Women are able to give birth, and only to human babies.  They can't have puppies or ponies or any other warm-blooded mammal babies.  So long as you preach this doctrine you will forever be a lunatic in the eyes of most women in this country.    Did you know that the modern feminist movement was the progeny of the Eugenics movement?  Do you know what eugenics is?  Look it up, it's the message you are preaching in your question.|`|84gK4XlHaa	And would 35% be the number of people who support legal abortions, or just the number who support this particular act?  It seems like you're skewing statistics for your own purposes.    Edit:  Don't dance around the question with meaningless rhetoric about liberals-this and hate-that.  According to the most recent surveys, 48% of Americans (meaning men and women) support legal domestic abortion.  43% oppose it and 9% are undecided.  Aside from 48 being a bigger number than 35 (which you apparently need pointed out to you), that would put a slight majority of Americans in favor.  So I suppose 48% of the population is either an evil feminist or has some how been corrupted by them?  If only we were all as intelligent and free-minded as yourself.    http://www.abortiontv.com/Misc/AbortionS...|`|ftbIWNydaa	Perhaps.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	there is a difference between a fetus and a baby|`|SwojYmvdaa	babies aren't human? you're kidding right? lol I sincerely hope so
TGI53selaa	From my limited knowledge of psychology this sounds like it may be stemming from a sort of emotional distancing resulting from an overly judgmental personality.    The fact that people were being taken away and tested would lead me to believe that you can be somewhat untrusting or judgmental towards people. The same could be said by your inability to find anyone you know leading me to believe that you find it hard to form a real relationship with other people resulting in an emotional distancing even if externally you are quite close and social. As for your boyfriend it seems that you have a rather strong emotional attachment to him judging by the emotions displayed in the dream (crying, confessions of love) while nobody else from your life was present.    I would suggest you take time to view how you feel about your friends, are they the sort of people you want to surround yourself with? Are you happy with your friendships? Try reevaluating how you feel towards other people and what sort of attachment you feel towards your friends.    I hope this helps,    Alex-san|`|f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	Dreams do have meanings. i.e. When you dream of seeing yourself in dressy clothes, makeup and all that is a bad omen. To dream of seeing yourself or another person die means that they are in good health. To dream of water, or swimming forecasts that you or someone is sick. To dream of teeth falling out or easily being pulled out is also a bad omen, someone near/relative will pass away.     In your case, to dream of crying, is a forerunner of illusory pleasures, which will turn into gloom and distressing influences affecting for evil business engagements and domestic affairs. To dream of someone else crying means they need help/aid from you.    There is a strong connection between you and your boyfriend, almost as if you can't live without him..On that note, stand by your man, no matter what.|`|IVjspiStaa	war of the worlds, I saw that one last week.|`|3wFt9fyZaa	Go to MSN.com  under astrology you can find meaning under the dream dictionary.

fmr98EBtaa	Well, I would obviously require some evidence I was the only one left. I would probably turn on the TV, the radio, go from house to house. Then I would get in my car and drive to an area where there are usually a lot of people. If I couldn't find anyone I would probably hang around that area and pick up any items that I might want, and then bring them back home. Eventually I would want to explore other areas of the world and establish different places of residency (more houses). I would have to learn to drive a boat or to fly in order to explore other countries, both out of the desire to visit them and also to find anyone else who may still be alive. My actions wouldn't be destructive though, unless they are out of anger or frustration at being alone.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I would start dying of anguish and sadness, very slowly and painfully.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	MM said it best.

In addition, some sellers will create additional accounts to bid on their own auctions to encourage this "bidding war" and drive prices higher.
e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	Usually, our peers, not our parents, define our social view of the world.    We will tend to adopt and adapt to the cultural views that our peers manifest, in both private and public settings.    That pressure to conform is difficult to ignore, even when our personal beliefs or views conflict with the views espoused by our peers.
91be33a93393b2cfe2ea14aae38ab03daa	This is studied under the Sociocultural perspective of psychology. One of the classic studies was done by researchers Darly and Latane (1968). They dound that the percense of toher people actually decreased the chances that a person in trouble would receive help. The phenomenon is called the bystander effcet and it is believed to be the result of diffusio of resposibility, which is the tendency to feel that someone else is responsible for taking action when others are present.<br>  I once read a news article about a woman who was attacked and raped right outside of her apartment building. Although many were witnessing from their rooms, they all though someone else would call the police (they were anonymously interviewed afterwards). Of the 30 peole watchin, only 2 people called. Another reason given was that they did not want to get involved, possibly risking their own safety.<br>  That is why people are told to yell out "fire" in case of an attack/rape/etc... Most people wil respond to a "fire" because 1) it will affect everyone regardless, 2) it is destructive and will spread, 3) you are most likely already involved if you are close enough to hear the shout, 4) it doesn't have thesame consequences as a rape/attack. Of course, these are true for real fires. But that is why you yell "fire."|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Just make sure you are the one that does help and everyone else will have to live with their own decision.

2GNFQPdmaa	You've got the cart before the horse. In a market economy, innovation is driven by a profit motive. You don't NEED to inject money to get innovation, it will happen on its own. However, by injecting money you could theoretically increase the rate of innovation. But you've done so artificially. And any time you ever artificially prop up a segment of the economy, the bill eventually comes due.<br>  <br>  That being the case, it's not capitalism's fault that this situation occured, it's the fault of the government for propping up the system.|`|AA10023809	you got the connection wrong.

You know you could build another research lab which will increase your profits by $100/year, but you do not have money to build it.

3rq39Pgmaa	I can't give you a definate on what your psych professor would say the relationship is, but it just so happens that I teach general psychology at a junior college and am teaching about motivation this week. (quite a coincidence) Motivation is the process that defines the reinforcement value of an outcome. That value depends on situation and may hold more value at one time than the next, thus you may be more motivated to do the same behavior at different times in your life, even in a given day. The more emotionally arounsing the situation is the more motivated your are to do the action. So the intensity of the emotion directly effects your level of motivation.

From what you've said, you are still with her, so I speculate that your feelings come despite you being together.<br>  <br>  You do not value yourself, so you must be convinced that your girlfriend cannot value you, and twice in your unconscious you've been working through your fear of being abandoned.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if you came into the relationship without confidence, or whether or not the relationship has either 1. caused this lack of confidence or 2. brought your insecure side to the surface because you are not being valued by your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  I suggest you talk to someone who knows you well, perhaps a close friend, to find out.  Many times people find it very hard to understand that a romantic interest truly values them, for reasons that have nothing to do with anyone else.  If it is that you are not being listened to, perhaps it is time to sit and talk with her.  Is there a reason behind your feelings?  Is her behavior dismissive? <br>  <br>  From your words it sounds like you know that she does value you--she cries over your separation.  <br>   <br>  Is there some part of yourself you cannot express in this relationship that is going by the wayside?  A way you wish to be with her that you hesitate to act upon? <br>  <br>  Because you say she cries which shows emotional investment in you, I tend to suspect that this is more your insecurity than not.  However your own mind is trying to resolve this conflict inside of you, and after talking to a friend about it, I urge you to share this with your girlfriend to gauge her reaction.  Then you will know if she is open to the part of you that you might not feel able right now to share with her, and your relationship will grow.  That's what I hope happens.  Good luck to you!

3p6wp7DYaa	Do you mean why are banks in general in the middle of the cycle? Well, think about it for a second. Banks loan money to people so that they can afford to buy a house, a car, or open a business, right? The economy would be much smaller if everyone had to pay for a house in full without financing, since people would just not be able to do it.<br>  <br>  Additionally, banks actually "create" money in an economy, also. You deposit your $1,000 paycheck at the local bank every Friday. The bank is only required to keep a small percentage of your money actually deposited in a safe location (the Fed). Let's say they need to keep $100 locked up in a safe somewhere. Well, the other $900 can be used to make loans to other people. These loans, in turn, will be recorded at the bank's books as assets. When the monthly payments + interest are paid back, the bank can turn around and make other loans with that revenue. All while holding on to your deposits in checking and savings in the books without having the cash physically in its safes. Think about it. How much cash do you actually take out of your bank account in a month? Banks operate under the principle that people deposit most of their money, but their customers will never come to claim that money all at the same time, so the excess cash can be loaned and generate income while a little portion is reserved for small withdrawals made by individuals.

What qualifies as 'sexual harassment', is where we all differ.|`|FhKtIk2Paa	I am a feminist (unlike most of the people who are answering this question) and I don't think there should be zero tolerance.  Sexual harassment is very serious so it should be approached with both time and understanding of both parties at question.  When you say "zero tolerance policy" it makes me wonder if someone claiming to be a victim will automatically recieve credit while the "perpetrator" may not be guilty of anything at all.  <br>  Sometimes there is no black and white to these situations, and every person is unique...so to apply the same punishment to all these cases may not be a wise decision to make.|`|GIHvKrnHaa	1) When posting a question such as this, it is always best to define your terms - what exactly do you mean by "sexual harassment", and in what context?  Teaches harassing students? students harassing each other?  Clarity always helps you obtain better answers.  Also, what do you mean by "zero tolerance", and what kind of a "policy" are you referring to?<br>  <br>  2) To reply briefly, i have no idea what "feminists" ( another difficult to define term - it can mean a dozen different things to different  people under different circumstances - indeed it is almost impossible to accurately define anymore!!) might think any more - as a group, they are as diverse as you could imagine!!  So, your question would seem to have no answer because it is not possible to define the terms very well. <br>  <br>  3) "ZERO TOLERANCE" policies tend to be a complete nightmare most of the time: they often result in a school context, in students getting suspended or expelled or hauled away by the police in front of their classmates to face charges and courts and such, over actions that would otherwise be easily dealt with through guidance councellors, parents, teachers and principles without causing a huge scene.  "zero tolerance" policies tend to encourage authoritarian responses to even the most trivial incidents: i have heard and read about such evils as  a 6 year old being arrested and suspended for kissing someone, for example.  Only extreme situations shoule be answered with extreme measures: zero tolerance policies tend to encourage extreme responses to ALL situations - which can do far more harm than it was intended to cure.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	When the harassment is sexual in nature (and most people who have hit puberty are able to recognize when it is), then of course I support a zero-tolerance policy.

awuGFzOPaa	Recessions are a natural part of the economy, they purge excesses and inefficient businesses. There has been an excess in home sales artificially driving up prices of homes.   The government helped to cause this by requiring banks to make loans to people not qualified. The people thought they were getting something for nothing, so all were equally responsible.     The people that have been foreclosed on have the opportunity to remove their property from their home before they are cleaned out. They basically leave behind their trash and unwanted items. I have seen the garbage they leave behind.     I have also lost a home to foreclosure in 1988, we were young and did not plan for any downturns in the economy, we spent all we earned and didn't have any savings. That taught us a valuable lesson. You can feel sorry for yourself or you can learn from your mistakes and it will make you stronger and better. We now have savings, no credit cards, no personal loans and no car loans. We pay cash for everything.     I recently bought a foreclosed property to fix up and rent out. The foreclosures are driving home prices down which makes it affordable for new buyers to own a home.      Try not to use your emotions when analyzing a situation, use data and sound reasoning. Read the US Constitution and then ask yourself if it is the governments responsibility/authourity to "fix" the economy.|`|AA10023809	Good command of English, and it will please a left-wing teacher, but otherwise uses too much emotion and little logic.    Foreclosed families had sufficient time to move, so if they left something behind, it was probably because they did not want it. I bet you have a pile of forgotten toys somewhere in the closet.    Instead, you should probably talk about banks who encouraged people to buy houses they cannot afford, and the government who endorsed this.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	You sound like you have been very effectively propagandized. Nobody wants foreclosures. The question is, what is causing so many of them and what can be done. The fact is that in most foreclosures the people never should have been able to buy that particular house, because they couldn't afford it. Whether you want to blame the government for pushing banks to lend to poorer people, or the banks for making loans that were too risky, or the borrowers for spending beyond their means, it's hard to see a solution that doesn't involve getting them out of the houses they really don't belong in.|`|AA11661950	The banks and other lending institutions begged people to buy homes they could not afford.

vAdtlZDpaa	Yes, dreams really mean something - they are a way for your subconscious to bring to your awareness feelings that you may have repressed or not acknowledged in your waking life.     This dream (and the others that you have had like it) are about your insecurities in your relationship. To dream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you, indicates your fears of being abandoned. You may feel a lack of attention in the relationship. Alternatively, you may feel that you are not measuring up to the expectations of others. This notion may stem from issues of trust or self-esteem. The dream could also indicate that you are unconsciously picking up hints and cues that your significant other is not being completely truth or is not fully committed in the relationship.      To dream that you are beating someone indicates that you are shoving your own views and opinions on others. To see a broom in your dream, denotes that it is time to clean up your act and resolve your past issues. You need to discard what is no longer useful to you. Alternatively, brooms symbolize domesticity and the establishment of a household. Also, brooms are sometimes associated with witches and thus broomsticks may refer to the female shadow aspect of yourself.    When you feel emotion in your dream, that is a feeling that you have not given expression to in your waking life - which in your case is anger.|`|jOVH6fmSaa	It probably means that because of your past experience with your ex cheating on you, you are afraid that your new boyfriend will be the same way.  Don't worry.  Dreams don't tell the truth.

Only then will the dream become a reality and knowledge be king.    good luck.|`|2Yxw6xpPaa	I believe dreams have a limited meaning in the waking world. If there are signs that you perceive subconsciously while awake they MIGHT be manifested in your dreams as a warning. A way to use this is  bring it up in a conversation with your boyfriend: I had the weirdest dream last night, I was in my child hood home in (**) and you were there with (****) on the floor trying to have sex. I beat the snot out of you both with a stick broom and you ran out into the street naked where the villagers tied you to a party clown and threw you into a huge cheesecake. Then it started to rain and my teacher from High school was there with Denzel Washinton who was wearing a vest.They wanted me to ride a pony and sing the national anthem. Thats when the dinner bell rang and you were dancing with Linda Rondstadt while they were playing Ton Locs " funky cold Medina"     Wait  that was my dream from last night.|`|AA11878672	Sometimes dreams do have meanings, but then again a dream is just that.  A dream.  You may have dreamed about your boyfriend cheating on you because your ex-husband did.  Maybe you're not fully secure yet because your ex hurt you.  Also with this woman that's a stripper that you say you know in real life, maybe the broom in your dream means it time to clean up and get new friends, if this woman is a friend, and no longer hang around with her that way she wont flirt with your current boyfriend.  Also if your boyfriend is any kind of a man he will not pay any attention to the flirting and tell the other woman to back off that he is already in a relationship.  Not to sound mean or rude, but if you think that you're not secure to be with a man maybe you should wait a little while longer.  Again like I said if the problems seem to be with the woman who's a stripper no longer be around her or the places that she is.  Hope that helps.|`|fmr98EBtaa	Let me say first: dreams don't mean anything.     Now that that is out of the way, I would say that you have probably been thinking about whether your boyfriend is cheating on you and are probably suspicious of this stripper woman. If you lived in a world without consequences and saw them getting hot and heavy on the floor and a broom was close at hand, you would begin smacking them with it.

BtbhruXUaa	Graphology is considered a "science" of sorts.  It's more to describe personality than mood, though as some haven noted, your mood can show through in your handwriting.

There is a saying, “class does not come with money”, which means our action reveals our classiness (inner character) no matter how rich we are (let’s think of Paris Hilton). Besides our action, our handwriting can also reveal a chunk of our character, thought and emotional well being.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <!--[endif]--><br>  <br>  Handwriting analysis, sometimes referred as Graphology, is the study of human character based on handwriting. Our emotion and thought can affect how we write our words, since the stuffs that we want to write are processed from the brain (center) and are affected by them. Through research, experts have found out how our handwriting is correlated to our character. In modern days, handwriting analysis is used by companies to analyze the handwriting of potential employees as hiring procedure, in countries such as France.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Together with background check, employers can better understand whether the potential employee can fit in well with the specific working condition and corporate culture, or not. Certain tasks require special character traits, for example an engineer has to be a team player and PR officer has to show great communication ability. <br>  <br>  <br>  What can we do with handwriting analysis other than predicting people’s character and analyzing job application? I used it to impress my friends, especially girls. Yup, I am that mischievous.<br>  <br>  <br>  When I was younger, I used to ask my friend to show me their handwriting, and I would analyze it for them and reveal their character. I like to see how they reacted with amazement. It was pretty cool and fun. OK, jokes aside, let us learn how to analyze our handwriting. I doubt that I can cover every thing in one post so I will make a mini lesson on Graphology. Hopefully it is enough to impress your friends, or your favorite girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  I shall use a sample of my handwriting, which is extracted from my thesis summary, to demonstrate how the magic works. <br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  1. Spacing<br>  <br>  <br>  <!--[if !vml]--><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Spacing is how we organize the space between two lines of words. My series of spacing is quite even, which shows a good sense of space. Such pattern shows that the writer is neat and well organized and aware of the big picture. Uneven and ugly spacing reflects disorganization. Spacing works only when we analyze handwriting on unlined paper.<br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2. Zones<br>  <br>  <br>  <!--[if !vml]--><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  You can see there are two thin red lines dividing my words into three zones: top, middle and bottom. Bottom zone depicts our basic or physical needs. When the bottom zone is dominant and huge (Imagine a long, deep hook of letter “g”), the writer shows a wanting for material satisfaction (car, house etc.). The middle zone is where the writer reveals his perspective on the present moment. Words with dominant middle zone (imagine a big tummy “b”) are from writer who is focusing on his life at present. Top zone shows how a person dreams about his future. A dominant top zone (Imagine the letter “P” with very big head) shows an ambitious person with insight into the future. <br>  <br>  <br>  My words have a balance of three zones, showing a balance in present life and future ambition.<br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3. Slant<br>  <br>  <br>  <!--[if !vml]--><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Words can be written slanted or vertical. Mine are vertical, as clarified by the red line above. Vertical writing requires conscious control from the writer, or else the vertical strokes will slant aside. It shows a trait of discipline (I put quite some effect to make the letters stand straight up like perfect erection), and a moderate range of emotional expressiveness. A slant towards right (green line) shows that the writer has rich emotional expressiveness and a leftward slant (blue line) reveals that the writer is like “wood”, refraining from being emotionally expressive.<br>  <br>  <!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  4. Shape<br>  <br>  <!--[if !vml]--><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  The font shape above is quite “fluid” and pretty curvy. It exposes that I am an easy going guy. I have a habit of raising my last stroke, which is a sign of high energy. Square handwriting indicates a real world, practical based approach; Squiggles and irregular strokes indicate an artistic and non standard approach.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Slope<br>  <br>  <br>  <!--[if !vml]--><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  In my second paragraph, the words are “ascending” up a slope as outlined by the red lines. Normally, this trait shows that the writer is optimistic and energetic. The descending slope (blue lines) is a trait of lack of energy and pessimism. In my case, this might be slightly misleading since I have a habit of slanting my sitting position while writing (for ergonomic and comfort reason) and that might affect the “slope” of my words. This analysis will only work when it is written on unlined|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You can probably find a book on handwriting analysis at your local library.  They can break down even the actual letters.  You might be able to find something on the internet too.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It doesn't really tell you about the person's specific emotions, because emotions come and go.

Medium Maintenance:- Enjoys looking good but can do it for herself, doesn't rely on fashion magazines to get dressed in the morning, grows her own hair( even if bad mistake of a mullet from bad hairdresser), enjoys flowers occasionally and being told you love her, but it is not essential to her well being.

I look good 90% of the time but Im the kind of girl that doesn't have to put on 10lbs of makeup to look good.  I don't care about designer clothes  (I rock out the Wal-mart name because I can look just as good)    And I only chill with guys because I know how to kick back, down a bud, and kick everyones @ss in Halo 3|`|WSlxwSlFaa	high matence is like "I cant do anything unless i get fully ready and do my hair perfect and everything has to be perfect or im not doing anything today"|`|y5i8GIFWaa	high maintenance= means she wants to do everything to please her man and look after the kids, dress up, dinner for 2, cleaning, pay for a good future for her kids, big job,money, romance,try's to look her best .etc    medium maintenance= a woman who is trying to look after her family and put a roof over there heads and food on there  plates......make dinner, look after the kids, go to work, clean. normal everyday life    low maintenance= does nothing, lazy- doesn't care about anything. doesn't care about her children or there future      high money =  good future= good standards= big house         (good life)  medium money= OK future= simple standards= medium house (fine life)  low money= bad future= poor standards = small house (bad              life )              these are examples of levels  that different woman have,   some may not care and cant be bothered to get educated to get a good job- which then leads to small horrible house and no education or money for there child's future.     however,others may have enough  to pay off there bills and pay for some sort of education for there kids.     but there are some woman who decide to stick to there education and get a great job-this can help get money in which can also pay for  there children 's future too.    so basically i have just given you the levels of what each woman at each stage does- mainly in everyday life depending on there money, education and status= ( means whether there a high maintenance medium maintenance or low maintenance)    remember: maintenance= status of life  i hope this has helped you to understand!    its not just  woman and money     its with other subjects too- so try not to jump to conclusions OK!             it can also mean.......  High Maintenance:- Wants the new car, liposuction if she eats a cake, fake tan, hair extensions, demands full attention wherever she goes and you have to be her training dog    Medium Maintenance:- Enjoys looking good but can do it for herself, doesn't rely on fashion magazines to get dressed in the morning, grows her own hair, enjoys flowers occasionally and being told you love her, but it is not essential to her well being.    low maintenance:- doesn't care at all      remember: its not just woman!

My father died of lung cancer, my mom from a stroke. Both were fairly long illness so it was a relief to see them again in a better setting. I had just left the room for a few minutes when my dad passed and I'd left the hospital for a few hours to check on my children when my mom died. Maybe they are simply dreams, but we need them and I took my as a beautiful message that they were ok and truely wanted to say goodbye, I could feel the warmth of my moms face and hand and I could smell my dads face when I woke up. It couldn't get anymore real than that. I would say you were very blessed that she came back to say goodbye, even if she doesn't come back again, know that she made contact and you were in her thoughts as well.
AA12027265	This child is only 9?? Good grief. Sadly it sounds like a classic case of favoritism. Who knows how a person even comes to decide that someone is their "favorite" over others...it sucks, I know.    If this little girl is only 9, they are probably creating a real monster and setting her up for problems.. Might be interesting to watch and see how she is by the time she is your age.    In at least one way consider yourself lucky, that you will hopefully not grow up to be someone who expects everything to be handed to you. Hopefully you'll appreciate what you have that much more, and the work it took to get it. And be a more likable person.    Karlee has the potential to be a mess as an adult socially.|`|KHhiacLraa	The only rational explanation I have for this is that your grandmother prefers girls over boys and not just that, she thinks that little girls deserve to be showered with things and treated like a princess, whilst boys do not.     It's the only meaning I can give to you because it sounds just like the situation that some of the old people that I know experience, they have these preset ways to view the world even though they are old, and stubbornly assign different people a different standard simply because they are different, and does not assign them the same standard because they are people.     either that or your grandmother likes Karlee's mom better than your mom.

vAdtlZDpaa	Your dream is an indication that you are very upset about something in your waking life, but you have repressed the feelings or not acknowledged them, thus they are coming out in your dreams symbolically.     Water in dreams always symbolize emotions. To see a pool of water in your dream, indicates that you need to understand and deal with your emotions. You need to dive right in. Alternatively, a pool may indicate your need for cleansing. You need to wash away the past.     To see a tidal wave in your dream represents an overwhelming emotional issue that demands attention. You may have been keeping your feelings and negative emotions bottled up inside for too long.    Screaming in your dream symbolizes anger and fear. It is an expression of your powerful emotions which you have kept pent up inside.    Skin represents protection or shield of your inner self. In your dream the skin was burning off the bodies of your friends. Other people in your dreams represents various aspects of your personality.  To dream that your skin is covered with rashes or other skin deformity signifies your fear in facing a harsh reality. To see something burning indicates that you are experiencing some intense emotions. There is some situation or issue that you can no longer avoid and ignore.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	My question would be is your friendship with these people is turbulent right now.|`|gpQm5ZPpaa	You better stay outta pools, your skin might fall off

You are setting the trap that anyone who answers must think for some reason that life is preferable to death, even if that reason is shame/not wanting to hurt others, etc.  If they didn't, they would already be dead.  <br>  <br>  Selfish/egotistical/macho values may be what determines material success in even most areas, but it is not the only way to success there, and that's only if you define success as material.  This, of course, is not to mention that you do NOT know that death is just a dreamless sleep.  The definitions of what all these things mean makes this question nigh-unanswerable.<br>  <br>  That being said, I find that everything in life exhibits its own beauty out of it's nature.  I embrace death as an eventual end because impermanence is what makes life worth living.  Wanting to live is completely separate from wanting to live rather than die.|`|c2b69802ef9d960e8e16708b4ecfdc15aa	I am probably wasting my time in responding to this, because I really doubt that you will believe anything I say here, but I am going to try, anyway.<br>  <br>  There is NO SUCH THING as "nonexistence" - only existence on different spiritual levels.  That "dreamless sleep" you speak of may be temporarily self-induced upon leaving the body (if you really want it strongly enough) but "temporarily" is the key word there.  It WILL wear off and you WILL "wake up" - you'll just "wake up" into a very different pattern of existence.<br>  <br>  "why be bound to any will to live?"<br>  Life is a learning experience.  Each life we live is another school year. What we commonly call "death" is comparable to what we call "summer vacation"  - a rest after one school year ends and before the next one begins - it is NOT unconscious oblivion! <br>  The lessons are not always pretty or fun, but they ARE sufficiently important that if they are "skipped over" or "skipped out on" in one life, they WILL be presented AGAIN, in another.  <br>  To be sure, some of those around you who are living by what you call "selfish, egotistic, macho values" are poor students flunking their life courses and some are actually teachers teaching the fact that negative values DO exist and giving others the chance to learn how to confront and deal with them.<br>  <br>  I can almost hear the little wheels grinding in your head as you are thinking, "Who does she think she is?  WHERE in the heck did she come up with this cr-p?"<br>  <br>  I have gleaned this - and a LOT more such information - from the accounts of those who have been there and come back to describe what they encountered.  Accounts of what we call "Near Death Experiences" are a valuable source of information, but not as complete and comprehensive as the accounts of those who have been hypnotically regressed through a past life, past death and on into "the afterlife".<br>  <br>  If you REALLY want to find out for yourself, then find a professional, certified hypnotherapist to take you on such a journey for yourself.<br>  (I still hope to be able to do so someday soon.)|`|7ye9rwntaa	Finally, someone who thinks like I do !  haha <br>  Its called Enjoyment. I think thats what U mean??
8d8ejHPfaa	Although you dream about your life, your experiences, the things you think about, the problems you have, when you dream about these things, your mind presents ideas to you using symbols to convey concepts about your experiences in waking life.  A fairy, for example, may suggest the material you are dreaming about is joyful. Other mythical creatures present clues what the dream is about, based on your understanding of them, and what they represent to you.  Dreams are presented in a language all their own, the pictures they place before you are a kind of shorthand designed to convey a lot of information in a short amount of time :)  You're still dreaming about everything you know and experience in the world, but the way you tell yourself about it in dreams is different from when you are talking about something in your waking life.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream that you are a character in a fairy tale, suggests your need to be rescued or to be swept off your feet. It also indicates that you are exploring your limits and trying to awaken your fullest potential. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are reading a fairy tale, indicates that you are a romantic at heart.|`|AkCY6rVWaa	Well, some might say that since you always dream of real things, then do to your dreams, mythical creatures are real as well and that your dreams are proof. No. The dreams that you have that you have experienced before and seen and that are based on real things, is because those things are in your mind, even though you may have not been thinking about them before you went to bed or you haven't been thinking about them at all, does not mean that they are not there in your head. You may have never really given a thought about the Eiffel tower, but it might show up in your dreams, because it is there in your head, you know what it is and what it looks like so your brain just replays the image. Usually people dream about things that are constantly on their minds, or completly random things and images put together. It's your brain trying to do something while your body is at rest. Just like when a person gets bored.|`|mbNWBem6aa	You've probably seen pictures of them somewhere, or heard stories, and you imagined what they were like. <br>  <br>  Your brain doesn't really create images of anything you haven't seen, or versions or combinations of things you haven't seen or heard of.|`|WpAtF0MCaa	wow that's defineately something else, but idk really, only time will tell I guess.|`|MIw3GCJyaa	Your obviously a faery!|`|hMZdgcImaa	One can't ever be sure about such things.<br>  <br>  Holy men say that such dreams are often related to events taken place in your previous birth. <br>  <br>  Mythical creatures can sometimes be about your mind's feelings. They may support you in what you do, encourage you, create passion, aggressiveness, or they may try to terrify you, discourage you or tell you not to do something.<br>  <br>  Whatever such dreams mean, They do mean something. They do have some meaning, we can't say exactly what.|`|c9lAEXdzaa	Fairy <br>  To see a fairy in your dream, signifies joy and happiness in your surroundings. It may also represent a feminine qualities and aspects of yourself. <br>  <br>  To see a sad fairy in your dream, symbolizes loss of love or money, or both.|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Nothing, sometimes you dream about things you wish.  Or your mind is just trying to make sense of the weird light shapes behind your eyelids.|`|EyUEZ5llaa	it means you really really want to see the girl of your dreams nude and all s53xed up like you been seeing her in your dreams riding the back of a unicorn
1TPGdaXJaa	I was actually researching this topic today as well.<br>  <br>  It seems these schools aren't really accredited by anyone or anything; they claim to be approved by certain agencies, but upon researching these agencies, they weren't really anything either. <br>  <br>  My conclusion was 3 fold - 1) these institutions charge college-like tuition, but the degree isn't really practical for obtaining a job to repay the expended tuition 2) Since they aren't really certified or regulated, they can basically do and teach whatever they want, and 3) they obviously charge high tuition to not only pay staff and support themselves but to also make a profit, and it seems to me that anyone who was a true specialist in metaphysics would be such for reasons of pure knowledge and compassion, and spreading this to others, not for making money. I think I would be better off taking a class here and there, but maybe not necessairly through a metaphysical university. <br>  <br>  Who am I though, I've never experienced it firsthand. You should probably go there and ask the right questions to find out for yourself. <br>  Maybe it could be your cosmic destiny; maybe it could be a scheme.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	I can't imagine that they would have more than one course. Actually I figured that course was like a weekend workshop. I don't understand what at all is scientific about metaphysics, but maybe I'm just too stubborn.|`|AA11496527	Not sure a degree in Metaphysical Science even exist in the U.S., and from what I read it's not accepted in any form in the U.S.. However, I understand the UK is big on degrees and doctorates in the Metaphysical Sciences. You may want to check this out for yourself though. Ask your priest or minister (if you have one), they should be able to direct you in the study of spiritual things.|`|AA10023809	read " The note" in the middle of this page: <a href="http://www.umsonline.org/accred.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umsonline.org/accred.htm</a><br>  <br>  and this page: <a href="http://www.umsonline.org/501(c)3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umsonline.org/501(c)3.htm</a><br>  <br>  So basically unless you plan on a career in a New Age business, the only benefit you will be getting is your own spiritual growth.
ZF8zu2ehaa	To see your girlfriend in your dream, represents your waking relationship with her and how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  <br>  To wake up from a dream symbolizes your need to grieve or let go of something that has been close to you. It is also okay to seek the support of those around you to help you get through this difficult time. Alternatively, the dream suggests that it is time to celebrate the good attributes and positive qualities of someone who is no longer in your life|`|iBthgmSDaa	you're scared? i don't know
vAdtlZDpaa	Your mom's dream about your getting killed likely has to do with her feelings about something that she had working on and invested hopes and dreams in, like a project that she had "given birth to", ending or being destroyed. Specifically it may have been something that she created jointly with your dad or a significant other.|`|OtfSP7kHaa	I'd answer your question but you're probably already dead...so I won't bother.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Could just be fear...did you tell her what happened to you that day?|`|ac5mKd4caa	It actually means that you're going to live a long happy life. If she had a weird dream about a baby then id be worried. Cuz that would signify death. i dono the details of your dreams, but yeah,.. good luck|`|CIzrjrykaa	that she is just worried about you
PYnC1t7Taa	Yeah, it's possible. People are in your life just temporarily so live at the moment, don't hold back. Hang out with everyone!
AA10548610	Sigmund Freud said "Sometimes a dream is just a dream"  I would try not to worry about it.|`|VNum3TKyaa	Well you don"t want us to say that ur subconscious is telling you that your gay ......Well maybe there is a part of you even if it is a small part is turned on by women and is curious and secretly wants to sample some of what  the other side has to offer ....Don't be offended maybe your in denial.    I wasn't suggesting that YOUR GAY or that you don't get hot making out with your boyfriend only that there may be a small hidden part of you that is turned on by a sexy women. There must be some truth to what we're saying otherwise you wouldn't be getting so heated & mad.|`|6Qnnn84Jaa	Dreams come from things that we've seen and things that are in our mind. And combinations of both, imagination and weird, made up stuff.   So the possibilities of what you might see in a dream are almost endless.  Ultimately, you may have seen it somewhere, or thought about it from time to time.  Gay or not, I suppose it could happen to anybody.  I'm sure these dreams are a passing phase, and will cease shortly.|`|NqAzcrtsaa	God's flirting with u.|`|ciqAXgCgaa	well it depends, was it someone you know?  guys always freak out when they see their mom in their dream that's not dressed "proper", but that really just means they want to be closer to their mothers, and not in a sexual way.  the subconscious has the innocence of a child, and just relates intimacy with friendship.  ma bey you just had a fight with a girl that is a friend of yours and you miss her?  maybe you wish you were closer with your mom sister friend aunt teacher anything like that.|`|CIzrjrykaa	you like women  hey i like em to   you just dream about em|`|qZF4r71taa	You are actually bi-sexual, meaning you enjoy having sex with both sexes, and even at the same time.|`|piCOVRC6aa	because you're gay|`|FaS3CT5waa	because you are secretly gay|`|b03002dca550628194ee370158b39412aa	eh don't worry about it. I'm 23 and i'm straight and married.  Women are beautiful sometime i have dreams like yours too.  They are just dreams man.  Us girls can sit there and say out loud how pretty a women is and still be confident about our sexuality.  As long as your not awake staring a women picturing her naked then your fine.  Sometime I have dreams that I die...it doesn't mean I want to kill myself.  Maybe your just curious. A few years back me and my good friend (female) kissed on a dare and it was no big deal.  I was like that's it?  That's what the big deal is? And we went on as friends not bothered by a simple kiss that society makes a big deal out of.  Don't worry about the dream you know your not gay so your not gay.

2UnjeOQUaa	Aside of good communication skills I am not sure not only of what importance but even what is psychological health or an optimistic outlook ? I have an open mind. I try not to judge, I have traveled the world and have seen many different life styles and cultures. I am well educated. I look at many different issues before I make a decision. And I am sure that my psychological health is very much in question. Most of my life I have had an innate optimistic outlook on life. Now that I look back I see that it was only due to ignorance and selfishness. And last but not least, the most constructive approach to dealing with anger is revenge.
