20090309232622AAzqXYt	Politics & Government;Government	How can i be president?	See my main goal in life is to change the world for the best and leave it a better place than it was when my time is  finally up. I've been thinking about it recently and i think the best way to do this would be to become president. I'm a really smart person, ( iknow that sounds egotistical but i'm just being honest, i would say if i was bad at something) i'm good at reading people and "reading a book by it's cover," i know i could play the political game to get to where i want to be, i'm a charismatic person,  i'm a very kind person but i know i could make tough decisions, and i know that once i was there i'd be able to accomplish my goals.    I am not affiliated with any political party and do not think of myself as either a republican, democrat or a third party candidate. I would associate myself with whatever political party would aide me best in my quest to be the president.   I see so many problems with the way things are and i think that i could change them for the best. I would not be a corrupt politician and would not subscribe to that sort of thought. If i ever got into office i wouldn't have my actions hindered by wanting to be re-elected. Sure i'd want to stay in office longer so i could push through my agenda.       The reason I feel i should try to be president is that my goals mirror  the ideal agenda of all human kind. I also see so many stupid people in office (sarah pailin) and if they can do it i can do it too.

20090309233718AAM2iSn	Politics & Government;Politics	Who agrees that its good policy for a government to allow outsourcing of its citizens jobs?	so that goods those citizens used to make and get say $15 an hour in wages plus benefits ...are now  made in some other countries by that country's businesses, paying those foreign workers $2.00 an hour and no benefits only for those goods to be reimported back into the country to sell to the same citizens that got laid off?  Who agrees that this is a good sound policy for a government to follow so that its businesses are competitive and profitable...and that if its citizens suffer from it ...then that is just the cost of living in a global economy...a global economy that is racing to find the cheapest labor it can find in all 4 corners of the globe to boost profits....at the expense of lower and lower wages?  who agrees that a government that decided years ago that this was the path it wanted made the right choice for its people and workers?

If they are as poor as their parents say they are, why would this be considered a downgrade from what they are eating at home?  Or are they saying that they eat well at home because the parents are part of the meal, but their parents can't afford lunch money that they aren't a part of?  I grew up in a middle class family and cold sandwiches for lunch were the norm.  Why are they complaining?  At least their kids get to eat.

20090225093452AAJIytI	Politics & Government;Politics	Do most of Yahoo Answers' Republicans know what it's like to run a business?	I don't think they do.      Now, I had a little assistant manager position at a restaurant, but my boss was so lazy I did everything for him.      Obviously, most of you people have never run a business, so I'll tell you what it's like.      You have to have the money to start the business. This costs a lot of money, at least thousands of dollars. It's at least hundreds of thousands to start a franchise. With some of those franchises, you have to have liquid assets of a million or so, and up. You can get a partner, but that's the last thing I advise you to do. I've seen a lot of partners rob one another and sink the business.      Lots of these franchises are set up to rob people and young kids that have trust funds or have inherited money. There are a lot of sob stories out there. My boss took a call from a young guy who saw his store go down while I was there. There's another guy around my age that somehow bought a franchise with his brother, and his sales are abysmal. They're going down too.      You have to consider the fact that your managers can rob you blind, your employees can rob you and if you are part of a franchise, they will rob you! They make royalty and advertising fees, but also make you buy from a supplier they choose, basically extorting you by force through artificially high prices.      A bad location is about as bad as getting tortured. It's a slow death, and agonizing for anyone. You put so much money in and realize you'll never even make it back. Of course, if you're reasonably smart, you should be able to avoid this, but it can definitely happen to anyone.      Of course, your business might have a product that is desired, but not up to par with your competitors. That's another slow death too.      I think most of the people on here are college kids or unemployed people still living at home, firing off applications to $100K a year jobs, or those who are "running their own business," but really living off mommy and daddy's dime. There are lots of these wannabes out there that file an LLC and think they are a business owner. What a joke.      At least I'm not ashamed to admit where I used to work. I learned a lot from it. There are a lot of people out there that can't hack that sort of food service job. That's why they rip on it. I see a lot of prettier, preppy girls applying and working at these fast food places now. Obviously, there must be nothing else out there. Anyone ripping on it has to be still living at home, still in college, still thinking they are destined to that "John Thain office in the Manhattan sky."      Keep dreaming, and keep voting Republican to keep America in poverty!

Scenario: Car driving 5 miles under the speed limit due to wet road conditions and limited visibility approaching a crosswalk in a hospital zone. Time of day is before the sunrise so its still dark. Vehicle lights are on. Crosswalk has the flashing yellow lights on both sides of the street and lining the crosswalk on the road to signal traffic that someone is in the crosswalk.      A pedestrian wearing all black runs into the crosswalk without using the lights. I saw him and stopped before reaching the crosswalk.      So if I had not seen him, who would be at fault? The driver because pedestrians are supposed to have the right of way or the pedestrian who failed to use provided safety measures to notify oncoming traffic.

20090225095302AATL63i	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Will countless Obama souvenir merchandise sold on major city's streets tarnish President Obama' image?	I am a STRONG Obama supporter.  I went door to door canvassing for his campaign during the national election.  I have become very concerned with the numerous Obama souvenir items sold on the streets (e.g. Washington, DC.)  These street vendors are more into "cashing in" on his campaign success without paying any royalty or contribution rather than celebrating history.  And honestly, most of these vendors are African Americans.  When will these vendors start to practice responsible merchandising and reduce the number of Obama items?  Or they will only reduce selling these items as the demand for them fades out?  I am afraid that when white Americans walk by these vendor booths, they will have a second thought, "Wait a minute, did I vote for a wrong man - a celebrity - who is only worth to be on the face of a T-shirt and do not deserve to run a country?        By the way, if I give my approval rating for Obama today, I will still give him a good score.  The bail-out package is badly needed to jump-start the economy.  I believe that the American people have learned a lesson and they want a chance to get back to the right track and start savings.  The bail-out package is their chance.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has worsened sharply since President Barack Obama took office as prison guards "get their kicks in" before the camp is closed, according to a lawyer who represents detainees.      Abuses began to pick up in December after Obama was elected, human rights lawyer Ahmed Ghappour told Reuters. He cited beatings, the dislocation of limbs, spraying of pepper spray into closed cells, applying pepper spray to toilet paper and over-forcefeeding detainees who are on hunger strike."       http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/i...

20090225085648AAiFCpZ	Politics & Government;Politics	Who here thinks the media has just been given the green light to do whatever it takes to push Obama's agenda?	I posted this earlier but no one really responded.      According to a news article concerning the states part of the pork stimulus pie, if the states are not spending the money the way the Obama administration wants them to then the admin will either revoke funding or "use the television and the radio and the media to embarrass them for not doing what they're supposed to do."      Basically the Obama admin is stating "if you don't do as we say then you will be cut off financially or embarrassed and harassed till you give in or quit"      Nice threat and a good way to use media propaganda to an advantage, first it is funding next it will be laws and then rights.      What do you think?      Before you answer, the question I am asking has nothing to do with accountability of the states but it is about the sugar coated threat that this admin has issued. I know a lot of you think that the states should be accountable and you are right to a degree however if you look at it closely the intention is not to control spending but an attempt to have more control over the states. In other words the federal government is increasing its power and authority not by laws and legislation but through threats and imtimidation via the media and public opinion.

Jews have been historically treated like some kind of plague.   But your words do not sway me. My Grandfather was a Hungarian Jew. Being a "Zionist" is not the same as being "Jewish". My point was that groups that claim my people are better than yours for WHATEVER reason are bad for humanity. You mentioned many of them. The Crusaders, The Catholic Church, The people of WW2 Germany and Austria, The Arab nations that could care less about Palestine but cared everything for your destruction. I understand all that but you can not put a minority population into a majority population with the sole reasoning   of getting rid of that majority. That's what the "Zionist" did to the Palestinians. The "Jews" were the regular people who only wanted safety came to Israel in the 50's. It is no different than what the Europeans did to the Native Americans or what Arabs have done to African peoples for 1000 years.       Think about the arrogance involved in choosing whether to bring Jews to Argentina, Uganda, or Palestine. Can you imagine if the Gypsies went to the United Nations and declared they would take back some country in Asia because they were told it was there's. What would the United Nations say? What would the World say? What would the people already living there do when the gypsies just kept coming year after year imposing the same unjust laws on these people that the gypsies themselves were fleeing from??????

Collective wealth of Congress grew 13% from last year.       Overall, nearly two of every three senators are millionaires.       Only 1 percent of all Americans are considered millionaires.      The 535 members of Congress, who earn average annual salaries of $169,000 and receive cost-of-living pay increases, had a total net worth of $3.7 billion last year.       Because the law does not require them to do so, members of Congress don’t disclose the value of their homes unless they produce income. As a result, a member’s true net worth is likely to be much higher than what gets reported.      “Members of Congress don’t make it easy for the public to keep tabs on their personal holdings and any conflicts of interest those holdings present,” said Dan Auble, who manages the center’s database of lawmakers’ financial information.      Who’s the wealthiest of them all?      Here’s a list of the members who had the highest average net worth last year:      Senate      1 John Kerry (D-Mass.)……..$336,224,883      2 Herb Kohl (D-Wis.)……..$241,545,513      3 Edward M.

20061107124643AA8ewoM	Politics & Government;Politics	Comment accueillir la décision du tribunal iraquien quant à la condamnation à mort de Saddam Husse?n ?	Je trouve qu'il aurait d? être jugé par le tribunal international de La Haye car il auraient été plus impartiaux. Ne vous semble-t'il que cette condamnation vient à point nommer pour certains politiciens américains au moment des élections ? Que cette décision risque de provoquer des tensions qui pourraient justifier une présence militaire des forces américaines et autres bélligérents sur le sol iraquien ? Que penser aussi de la réaction européene un peu "molle" ? Je pense que la peine de mort ne doit plus être appliquée ! Je ne nis en aucune fa?on le fait que Saddam Husse?n était un dictateur et que ce qu'il a fait est tout à fait innomable, mais dans le passé, n'a-t'il pas re?u des aides ? Ne l'a t'on pas laisser un peu trop agir ? Pour ma part je suis vous l'aurez compris contre la peine de mort et je trouve qu'il est moins dangereux en vie que mort. Le condamner à mort serait mettre le feu aux poudres. Et même sans cela, condamner quelqu'un a mort c'est être un peu un  meurtrier

I do know that Obama always has one message whenever he appears for campaign or speech ---      "I am a SUPERMAN who can fix things with my golden touch in heartbeat time "      However the situation on the ground is dire. Almost everyone is economically suffering very badly and the stimulus provides no help whatsoever to the ordinary citizen. The trillion dollar stimulus is more intended for bailing out banks, general motor, AIG, etc etc and some pork spending.        Who else feels, Obama stimulus will crash and things will worsen a lot more for the rest of 2009 and into 2010 too? And Obama will still continue saying in speeches --      I am a SUPERMAN!!!!!!!!!

Ce lo hanno chiesto, lo abbiamo fatto e oggi abbiamo uno dei nostri in galera".     NEANCHE UNA PAROLA SULLO SGOZZATO E SUL FUCILATO DI DUE ORE FA....... DAVVERO INCREDIBILE !!!

20070506150121AAXLPOZ	Politics & Government;Politics	So, how do we "distinguish" between "acceptable" vices and "unacceptable" ones?	Continuing from my previous question about gambling, I really have no personal problem with it, I was just asking if it was the most "moral" kind of revenue. I was asking YOU.      Now, if gambling is okee-dokee, how is it that we cannot bring ourselves to legalize cannabis or prostitution?      We have laws controlling every other kind of adult "entertainment."      Most policymakers in the Netherlands believe that if a problem has proved to be unsolvable, it is better to try controlling it instead of continuing to enforce laws with mixed results.      Users are not prosecuted for possession of small quantities of soft drugs ("for personal use"). but driving under the influence is nevertheless prohibited, as is being under the influence in public, mainly from a public nuisance perspective.      The Dutch drug policy is based on the general principle of self-determination in matters of the body. Specifically, that it is not illegal to hurt yourself.

Denn unser aller Kaiser hatte im Jahre 1902, also vor mehr als 100 Jahren eine sogenannte "Sektsteuer" beschlossen und verfügt.

Nach Rücksprache mit Kanzlei stellte sich heraus, da? diese vergessen hatte, die Police bei der Versicherung einzureichen. Es wurde erst gesagt, da? sie nicht vorlag, was dann aber revidiert wurde. Nachdem die Versicherung dann anschlie?end die Kostennübernahme ablehnte, bekam ich erneut die Rechnung. Nach pers?nlichem Gespr?ch mit Anwalt bot dieser an, 100 € zu nehmen, beim zweiten Gespr?ch, weil ich mir zwischenzeiltich Rat holen wollte, sollten es er 200 € sein.

20070331141702AAVaA1D	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Molta gente è ottusa e non cambierà mai?	mi stupisco come certa gente si permetta di criticare varie ideologie politiche, senza nemmeno conoscerle.   un esempio: in una mia domanda, l'utente ducati 749, mi risponde che il fascismo si basa sull'odio razziale (????).   allora io gli chiedo se almeno conosce l'ideologia fascista e gli metto un link.   la sua risposta?   "non lo ho letto e non lo leggerò mai perchè mi fa schifo". (e ha continuato a sparare a zero sul fascismo in altre risposte).   con gente del genere, dove si arriva?   io prima di fare qualsiasi critica mi informo,ho letto e leggo le dottrine e i documenti, e dopo posso dire di non condividere o di essere contrario.   il mio era un esempio.   la domanda è : non è assurdo che certa gente muova critiche senza nemmeno conoscere quello di cui parla?

I also signed him up on an international pen pal site & gave his mailing address to a few women in a different country that I know it will "raise eyebrows" if he gets mail from there.

20090227101919AAA92Xv	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is this fraud....? what do you think?	I used to work for a company that closed it's doors in August of 2008. When they closed they told no one that they were planning to close. None of their employees, none of their supervisors, nor none of their managers new they were closing. Only the people up at the top.   The problem is is that they continued to allow their employees to work even though they knew they were not going to be able to pay them. And they kept sending out paycheques that were bouncing. In my state sending out paycheques that you know are not going to clear is against the law. I called up the Department of Labour in my state and they confirmed that this was against the law.   When the old employees got their W-2s there was a letter enclosed telling us that the CEO of the company had filed bankruptcy and lost his house due to the investments he had in the company.   When I called up the Department of Labour they said that filing bankruptcy does not absolve you from following the law and that sending out cheques you knew weren't going to clear is still against the law. They also said that allowing people to work when you knew you couldn't pay them is fraud and that you can not discharge debts you incurred during fraud or breaking the law. They said that the old employees have up to 2 years to file a suit and get that money.      What do you think? Is allowing people to work when you know you can't pay them fraud? I believe sending out cheques you know will bounce is a misdemeanour but escalates to a felony when you do it more then a certain amount of times.      Thoughts?

20090227103828AARd3XT	Politics & Government;Politics	If it is fair to call Obama a "national socialist" then isn't it fair to call Bush a Fascist?	Socialists want to take resources (wealth) and distribute it where it is needed most through policy. They believe that resources should be used only in places where they are needed and used in amounts that are needed.  This is often called the extreme left.      Fascists want to take resources (wealth) and let it be accumulated by a select few (the wealthy) so that they can distribute it where needed for financial gain (capitalism). They don't believe on any restrictions on how much resources are consumed or how much resources any single individual can attain, as long as they distribute it to generate wealth for themselves, it is OK. This is often called the far right.      So, if Obama is a socialist, then isn't Bush, Papa Bush, Regan, and any other Neo-con a Fascist?      I mean to say, you critics of Obama want to label him in the extreme, but you refuse to do so to your own party. Bush did more for the fascist cause than any other President since Ronald Regan, yet you don't bat an eye. Obama wants to take this country a little more to the center, after 30 years of Republican dominated philosophy, and you call him a Socialist.      So, if Obama is a socialist like Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin, fine.  Then Bush, Regan, and the Republicans are Fascists like Mussolini and Hitler.

20090227111736AAWOSTo	Politics & Government;Politics	Will 'anti torture' liberals protest the continuation of this practice or is it OK now Obama defends it?	The Obama administration has insisted that prisoners being detained indefinitely without trial at a US prison at Bagram air base in Afghanistan have no right to challenge their detention or treatment through American courts.   Last Friday, in a case in the federal district court involving four detainees at Bagram, Obama's Justice Department stood by the Bush administration's claim that the men were "enemy combatants" and that US courts had no jurisdiction. "Having considered the matter," Acting Assistant Attorney General Michael Hertz wrote in a submission, "the government adheres to its previously articulated position".   Upon taking office, Obama has attempted to repair the damage done to the image of US imperialism by the Guantánamo Bay detention centre. He announced its closure and publicly declared that "we don't torture". Now, the real stance of his administration is clear. While alleged "terrorist suspects" will no longer be abused at Guantánamo—which American courts ultimately ruled was US territory and subject to legal oversight—similar outrages will continue unchecked in Afghanistan and elsewhere.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...

I'll go along with the fact that Obama hasnt really done anything yet (cept lie and cheat, he's not born here, but that's not the point). . . .Point being, I'll stop complaining, when everyone here stops picking on Palin and McCain, as well as the "rednecks", and the people who dont agree with Obama. . . If you guys can stop putting us down, then I'll start giving Obama a fair chance and not complain that he won.

'In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.      But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American. ... There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all.      We have room for but one flag, the American flag. ... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language ... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.'      ~Theodore Roosevelt        http://michaelsavage.wnd.com/index.php?f...

Yes it is a tax increase for EVERYONE! and the tiers will also be lowered. So is this tax increase Bush's fault also?

Dems plan to let Bush tax cuts expire which will increase taxes considerably. It will be OK because they will just blame it on Bush. Obama will then do a tiny tax cut and BINGO his promise of cutting taxes is fufilled. Sounds like a jewelery sale: mark the prices up 400% and then put them on sale at 70% off. You still pay more.

Another terminology example is the massive pork filled spending increase that they are "blaming on Bush" where they say the Pork is not Pork but "earmarks"

20081009075508AAQu0lv	Politics & Government;Politics	Is South Africa in danger of drifting into tribal politics or tribalism?	I saw a report on the news yesterday about how the South African defence minister was worried about the A.N.C. splitting and the wrong people gaining power. In the report one prominent politician was seen on a stage singing a song about rallying people to pick up guns and talking to people with tribal undertones. There seems, to me, to be power struggle now that Mbeki was forced to resign. When you think of what tribal violence did after Kenya elections, you can see what could happen if the same thing happened in S.A. If certain people still held a grudge in post-apartheid, could we see it go the way of Zimbabwe if white people were forced to hand over land to black people? Worse again, could tribalism force a Rawanda, Darfur or Congo situation in extreme cases? What can the international community do while they are mananaging their own financial crises, to encourage stability to remain in South Africa? Can the World Cup be an iconic tool to keep the country stable tribally, politically and inter-racially?

I know these are bad examples and I can definitely answer both questions easily but the point is that there is some common ground between our parties and everyone just seems to pick a side and fight the other regardless of what we really want for our country.

USAA (the person who hit me's insurance co.)Got in touch with me and did an estimate and only paid me half of the money it was not enough to fix the bumper. I did not notify the finance co. because the damage was so minor.  I used the $650.00 to make other repairs on the van. Now it is October and I can't afford the van so I turned it back in to them. at the time of the accident I did not have insurance on my van it had been canceled for about 3 days.  Now the finance company is calling me saying I have to pay them the money that USAA paid me for the bumper with in 10 days or they will file legal actions against me. They said that they would have to call the sheriff on me. Can they do that is it possible that I could go to jail for that? I offered to make payments of $200 but they said no they want a lump sum now. I have a family to support and I am the only one who works. I don't have that kind of money. What can I do?

I have some understanding of employment law but not specifically on this matter. So yesterday I was scheduled to work an 8 hour shift. but when I got to work my manager told me he was suspending me... He didnt give me a timeline... My first question is, since i was scheduled to work do they still have to pay me 4 hours eventhough i was only there for about 5 minutes? Also, I am scheduled to work 3 days, but now im suspended. Should I get paid for those days? Whats the process?
20090227103404AA1gRN2	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My place of employment gives me hardly no notice ahead of time when it's mandatory for us to work.?	I work at a call center, I work Mon-Fri from 4-9. Well sometimes on a Wednesday or a Thursday they will tell us that it is mandatory for us to work that upcoming Saturday.   Are they allowed to do that? I mean normally I wouldn't have a problem, but I have a son and my babysitter is not very flexible, plus when I don't give at least a weeks notice I have to pay like a hundred dollars extra. The sad thing is the daycares and other babysitters in my area are the same way, and I don't have any family close by to help. One day they told me the night before that it was mandatory for me to work the next day and of course I couldn't so they said if I didn't want to be fired I had to work the next two Saturday's, and on top of that I got chewed out! How much time by law are they suppose to give you for mandatory days? When I first signed on we worked from 5-10 Mon-Thurs with 8-5 on Saturdays. Then they changed our schedules and did away with Saturdays and told us we had to work Mon-Fri from 4-9, and now all of a sudden they say certain Saturdays are mandatory with no warning. We live in Indiana. Does anyone know the Indiana laws on this? I really need help. I need the job, and I don't mind working over, but it's hard when I don't have babysitting options and they don't give me much heads up.

I see a lot of Republicans ranting about Obama, but I'm wondering if any of it will matter. I think even Republicans would have to change our policies, if they were in power. We are being forced to accept an economic reality that we have been ignoring for years.       It's a zero-sum game now. There is no cushion. It's either this, or that. It's buy that Prada bag or starve. There is no credit to buy the groceries, or the bag. You can't charge the credit card to buy lower-level seats to watch Lebron. Pro player salaries will have to decline too.      Business and the government will have to admit that the so-called talented people cannot get paid this much in our society. They will have to admit that their customers will have to get money in order for the economy to work again.      It's a zero-sum game now.

20090225095616AAGT8pW	Politics & Government;Immigration	Perry wants 1,000 troops to guard border   is this further proof wide open borders are dangerous?	EL PASO - Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he wants 1,000 troops to help guard the Texas-Mexico border, and for the federal government to fund security issues closer to home than Iraq and Afghanistan, such as the menacing Mexican drug cartels and their collaborators.      "We're asking the (state) Legislature for $135 million for border security - to go after transnational gangs, for technology and aviation assets, and for 1,000 troops" Perry said at a news conference Tuesday at the Chamizal National Memorial.      "I don't care if they are military, National Guard or customs agents. We're very concerned that the federal government is not funding border security adequately. We must be ready for any contingency."      Former U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey, who also was at the news conference, said the U.S. federal government is spending $12 billion on Iraq and $2 billion on Afghanistan each month, "without taking into account what is happening in Mexico."      With the right infusion of money for Mexico to battle the cartels, Perry said "I believe this can be put to bed rather quickly."      Perry said he, too, is committed to protecting Juárez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, who took refuge in El Paso after he and his family received death threats from a drug cartel.       http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci...

20090225100340AALIldL	Politics & Government;Government	When even other Dems say Obama is power grabbing, shouldn't we be worried?	Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the longest-serving Democratic senator, is criticizing President Obama’s appointment of White House “czars” to oversee federal policy, saying these executive positions amount to a power grab by the executive branch.       In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama’s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions “can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.”       While it's rare for Byrd to criticize a president in his own party, Byrd is a stern constitutional scholar who has always stood up for the legislative branch in its role in checking the power of the White House. Byrd no longer holds the powerful Appropriations chairmanship, so his criticism does not carry as much weight these days. Byrd repeatedly clashed with the Bush administration over executive power, and it appears that he's not limiting his criticism to Republican administrations.      Byrd also wants Obama to limit claims of executive privilege while also ensuring that the White House czars don’t have authority over Cabinet officers confirmed by the Senate.

If the scenario is a boy about 6-9 years old abused continuously by another boy at school. The abuser threatened to beat the child up and did physically hurt him too. A friend of the abuser would hold the door shut in the toilets whilst the abuser forced the child to give him oral sex. There are no witnesses except the child who held the door perhaps. It is about 8 years on now could be more. Is there anything that can be done about this? The abused child does not wish to contact the police unless the abuser could be prosecuted. The abuser later went on to brag about what he had done a few years after the attacks to belittle his victim. The victim denied everything when confronted by other. What would happen if the victim was to come forward to the police. How else could he prove it happend? Is there a chance of prosecution with such little evidence?         This is the UK btw      I am really shocked and want to help this person get justice and perhaps be able to move on from it
