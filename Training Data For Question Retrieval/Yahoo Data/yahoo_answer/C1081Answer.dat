812acd570608b909be2a850fb734a285aa	I've seen commercials for acne body soap. However, bar soap has animal fat so it leaves residue on your skin. I suggest getting a cream of 10% benzoyl peroxide wash (extra-strength; it's usually 2% in face washes) or spot treatment and use a back-scrubber to apply it in the shower. You should get results quickly. You can also exfoliate your back with apricot scrub to unclog your pores.|`|fqnmZ23taa	Pop it with a steralized safety pin.|`|yT3ZNEROaa	Many brands like Neutrogena have acne body washes now.  These body washes have the same medication in them that help with acne on your face, so it will dry up and get rid of the acne on your back.|`|RmZZ1MKraa	use spectro gel face wash its cheap and works really well
jcVJM8FNaa	Heyyy.  Just run around with them as much as you can....this is going to sound insane but hit things with your converse and just treat it like crap...haha it will totally wear your shoes down. Don't draw on them...it makes it look REALLY ugly. Haha, just a piece of advice. lol|`|PTP8ptDbaa	wear them in a little play with dirt drop food on them and them wash them and dry them!|`|yFUGp3r3aa	the best way to wear them out is to... wear them out naturally i guess. maybe you could color all over them... if that look is ok. i know a lot of people who color all over their shoes. but if you dont want to do that then you should just like, run around with them for a while idk lol|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Why?    that's stupid|`|hd2hFdkpaa	go out side and run around in the dirt.  pull on the fabric and fold them and stuff.  then wash them a bunch of times to make them worn out.  then run around again.:)|`|AA10667629	u should try the washer  or u could throw them around on the ground lol  or u could wear them alot and run around them alot|`|RZXuQq5Baa	Run over them with a car ;D    No, but I ran in dirt, then when it had dried, I scraped it off.|`|8hRCt73Taa	Try completely covering them in dirt and write funny stuff all over them. Like your inside jokes and stuff.|`|DNadX5Vgaa	lol u can have mine i already worn them out,     I just wore them everywhere i walkd everywhere, but if u want a quick fox then get the cheese grater rub it over bits u want riped or to wear out a bit um find some dirt around your house maybe mix a bit of water.    Lol I dunno just wear them!    Ooooo and hang them in the sun to fade a bit|`|b9MSOr6laa	wear them for a few days and they don't look new anymore (that's what happens to mine) if u are desperate draw on the toes and run through lots of mud then let the mud dry and hit them on something until most of it falls off.|`|GLEGh4N0aa	go running in the park with em scuff em up a bit  :)
C0HZ8ZB4aa	I think it would work above that one yes. Otherwise, if not your wrist, then I would say sideways along your foot would look sweet, or alternatively just above your elbow on the back of your arm, so you'd easily be able to cover it with three quarter or full length sleeved tops, any of those I think would work!      Haha, okay that's half my ideas out the window! :P I think it would look fine above the one you already have, but personally I think I'd go for the above the elbow at the back thing, I'm getting my next tattoo there, you don't see too many there, most people tend to have them on the front side of the arm which I don't like as much. Good luck choosing anyway!    And I didn't notice your screenname, but in response to what the person at the bottom said - she is right. You probably know this anyway and are just forward planning, but just in case you don't know, getting a tattoo when pregnant is not safe and no reputable tattooist will tattoo a pregnant woman either - so hold off on that until after the birth, and good luck for june!|`|H3PcFertaa	I actually think that it would look good on the top of the back tattoo, if it was as big as the dark leaves.|`|h6H4oP4Faa	put it like one your ankle, thatll be cute ,   and nice tat by the way|`|MV0lMuDMaa	I would get it on the back of your calf.  Dont do the wrist I agree with you on that one its a cute spot but just not worth it.|`|n8Q18dE6aa	it would look best on your wrist.    and if you ever had to cover it up get a chunky bracelet or something of that nature.  :)|`|X3zl9hZCaa	I hope your not getting a tattoo while pregnant.
tA4MM1lGaa	Yeah its perfectly normal i have the same exact eyes  its actually great that we have eyes like these everyone wants them =)|`|ERaFCylVaa	my eyes are the exact same except i have blue eyes its completly normal so chill girl and be happy u were blessed with those eyes lol|`|Tf19RETiaa	yea mine are like that|`|De0p3aP9aa	yep, its normal.|`|aiBzKyjlaa	yep, normal hazel eyes,|`|L4RAKdbSaa	noooo eww gross lol jk or am i??|`|vGHExDOzaa	define normal|`|TfLPRwFWaa	Totally fine(: don't worry bout it hun|`|RmZZ1MKraa	yeh its normal my eye are like that to|`|IUpwBn2Taa	that's so cool! im pretty sure ur normal|`|pVUhlg4iaa	ummm yeah i think u already knew that tho...|`|AA11523164	i hope so since mine are blue with yellow in the middle|`|juMKsO6laa	yea that's normal. my eyes are normally plain blue, but sometimes they get really dark and intense. it is probably just based on what color you are wearing.|`|62b4d7610d61a9537e22693aedeb72b9aa	yup mine are the same way  and sometimes have a hint of green  people say my eyes are hazel.|`|xJDqTf3Oaa	yes it's normal.

Some people's eyes change colors.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	That's the color of my eyes.
hLdIO43Xaa	Aww I know, it can be flattering and awkward at the same time!  You can choose to compliment them on their hair or something, or if its a girl, say "You're pretty too!" if it applies or something like "aww thanks!"   Also, the tone of your voice will change things too. Act sweet, innocent, be honest. If you keep thinking "do i sound conceited?" you'll come off sounding conceited.|`|BSsdkFwLaa	hey stop checking me out, pervert!!!    OR     why thank you, how nice of you to notice!!!    your welcome|`|MV0lMuDMaa	say thanks and compliment something on them so it takes the attention away from you.
dUHq4B4qaa	It's probably just natural healing. Three or four months is still a fresh piercing.  Don't go too crazy with the peroxide, that can dry it out if overused. Try to think if you sleep on your stomach alot? That can irritate hip piercings, obviously, because you're putting pressure on it. It doesn't sound like they're rejecting, so you don't need to worry. But keep in mind that surface piercings are naturally more sensitive than...an ear piercing or something.     You're doing the right things to keep it healthy. You'll know if/when it's rejecting; usually yellowish goo or pus comes out of the piercings and you can feel the piercing coming up. I'm almost positive you'll be fine.   If you have any questions or want more info, email me at moonsun5001@yahoo.com :)|`|5bde15709483c28deedecc65456b59a2aa	I have never heard of anyone having their hips pierced.  That's new to me.  But, I guess if the piercer said it was okay, then its probably fine.  Just keep cleaning it and good luck.
LNnRSLdtaa	urgh how can you begin to like that stuff lol   i tried it once on my nales and it was vile   it would like linger in my mouth      what you have to do is just get some self controll  i know how hard it is to not bite/pick your nails but you seriously just have to notice when your doing it and be like no and do something else   i used to do this weird thing were i would pick the skin on my lips   and it was horrible   so id just have to controll my self   id notice i had started to pick a bit and be like no and go put balm on insted     took 4 days for me to stop|`|AtJgXB59aa	there is a nail polish that has a bad taste an when you bite your nails da taste gets in your mouth and eventually you'll get the memo to stop bitting them|`|vUYdsoAvaa	start smoking|`|FF4J59pMaa	You can buy nail polish that make them grow fast. Sally hansen makes some. Try putting vinegar in your nail polish. I have the same problem. I've been biting my nails too. When you feel the urge to bite your nails instead of biting them peel your nail polish off. It helps keep you entertained. Also keep some gum or mint of candy handy and when you feel like biting stick one in your mouth. I love the wint-o-green lifesavers. They are my favorite and so addicting! Once they start getting long you are not gonna wanna bite them anymore.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	u could put band aids over them and chew gum.  also u should use some nail strengthening polish.|`|0HLOLwXKaa	Your an animal!....ummm I don't really know.....put tape on your fingers?...well good luck with that anyway...|`|hLdIO43Xaa	For fast growth, use Sally Hansen nail polish! It's nourishing (oooh it'll help your nails get better AND grow!) and comes in cute colors:  http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?p...  I hope I helped! This is from wikihow:    Confront your problem. Get a camera and take some pictures of your bitten fingernails. Examine your nails, and list their problems.   Visualize yourself with healthy nails, and how great they will look.   Pick at least one nail to "protect" at a time.      After a few days, an unbitten nail will flourish and reward you. Do not bite it. If you must, bite one of the 'unprotected' ones.   Once you have grown your unbitten nail for a while, start protecting another one. And another.   Record your progress in a notebook or photo album. Take "before and after" photos of your nails and put them in the book to keep you motivated. Recognizing that it usually takes three weeks to grow nails half a centimeter, chart out in the book how long you want your nails to be by a certain date.   Eat calcium- and magnesium- rich foods so that your nails will repair and grow well. Not only that, but most of the reason that the human body wants to bite nails is the lack of calcium and magnesium in the body and the body needs that material back.   Push your cuticles back. Many nail-biters do not have "moons" on the base of their fingernails because their cuticles have not been pushed back. To do this, gently push your cuticles towards your finger to reveal more of your nail. This is easier to do after a shower when your hands and nails are wet. This makes the nail appear longer, and it gives a more attractive shape, which might also be a motivation to stop biting.   Find a habit to take the place of nail biting. Whenever you have the urge to bite, do that instead. Some people like to drum their fingers, or just stare at their hands. Just make sure it's not a bad habit; choose a helpful one or one that doesn't really matter either way. 'Bitrex' is a chemical that is put in products to make them taste foul, obtained from your local pharmacy. It's included in nibble inhibitors that you paint on to your nails. Carry some with you at all times. Apply your nasty solution several times a day. If you get used to the taste, choose another brand.   Distract your mouth. Eat carrot sticks to keep you busy. Keep a stick of gum handy for those weak moments.      No more idle hands..Distract your hands by taking up a hobby.   A hobby to distract your hands might be making models or maintaining your house, knitting or crochet, running or other outside pursuits, or even nail care and decoration!   For those whose nail biting is obsessive/compulsive it may help to approach your hobby obsessively.   Cover your nails. For females, fit artificial nails. They can really help. For guys, polish them and apply some shine/growth promoter or petroleum jelly. It's harder to bite nails that are looking great!      Keep gloves in your back pocket and wear them when you want to bite.   Put little pieces of tape on the ends of your fingers, to remind yourself how destructive biting is.      If you have any surplus growth, cut your nails back. Keep clippers with you at all times. You can't bite if there's nothing there!   Speaking about your nails will help to focus your mind on your goals. Ask for help from your partner(s). Keep talking about your goals.      Show off your improved nails, and get much-needed encouragement and praise from your peers.   Be proud of your improving nails. They will shine with beauty.   Go for a manicure, and chat with the manicurist about having great nails.      If you are male and you go in for a manicure and anyone gives you grief for not being manly, just say you are taking radical steps, whatever it takes. That should be manly enough for anyone.      Keep looking after your nails, with cuticle oil, shine and growth promoter, and no biting!
4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	What I do is apply a light color shadow up to my brow line, a slightly darker shade to my lid, and a slightly darker one than that to the contour (crease).  It adds depth and makes your eyes look bigger.  Sometimes I even dab a little shimmery white to inner corner and a dot at center of my lid and blend lightly to make my eyes appear brighter.  Next I apply eyeliner from inner corner of my eye to a little past the outer corner in one steady sweep, if I can.  Liquid eyeliner gives a more dramatic look and pencil a more "smokey" appearance.  I also line with pencil on my bottom lashes and blend (a darker eyeshadow blended works great for the smokey look, too).  Then, I curl my eyelashes and apply one to two coats of mascara.  Viola`!|`|YYAu9lFDaa	i personally go eye shadow, eye liner and mascara is always last!|`|AA11156937	Eye shadow, eyeliner, and then mascara.  That's how I do mine.|`|PhS9uch4aa	first you put on the eye shadow then the eye liner by pulling down the bottom part of your lid and rubbing it in there then put on the mascara|`|yENww2b0aa	eyeshadow then eyeliner then mascara. in my opinion if i use mascara first i cant see iver my lashes to apply my eyeliner! lol|`|DsgNMpEsaa	I go:  Eyeliner, Mascara, Eyeshadow :]|`|GZzmcDeGaa	i would go eyeshadow, eye liner, and then mascara that has always worked for me :)|`|yWRTrnR2aa	Shadow, liner, mascara.
sHUnctqIaa	It will make the color pop but that's an added bonus, the primary intention is to make eye make-up last. Im my experience the liquid primers work better, and are far more effective than a plain concealer.     If you've ever painted a wall, you know that a paint primer will cover the entire area with an even base, so that when you apply the paint color it comes across stronger and needs fewer applications. An eyeshadow primer works in a similar way.     My fave is Urban Decay primer potion, and Bare Escentuals prime time eyes. Both are $16|`|AA11156937	Eyeshadow primer does the job  but you can also use concealer as a replacement.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	Primer makes the colors stay on all day without creasing. Though if you buy colored primers and put a similar color over top, the color will be brighter.|`|fSGimEl8aa	No primer only makes the eyeshadow last all day. Maybe its the eyeshadow your using. Try Mac it lasts all day without creasing or primer.
vUYdsoAvaa	print out this picture and go to a MAC store and they can match it for you :D      glad i helped|`|Ug59D75laa	maccosmetics.com has that color. :D    Hope I helped!|`|3m4YrL8qaa	MAC!
tbpNk6rBaa	I personally LOVE your hair! But, it probably doesn't do well with the layers. You should try and get your hair cut so that it is more even with the layers, and you could do way more with it. Hope I Helped! (:|`|1aSrTpbhaa	I think maybe pigtails could be really cute but if you don't want to do that, maybe cut some more blunt bangs and pull your hair back into a messy ponytail.  If you really want something dramatic, get extensions, and then you can pretty much do whatever you want with it.    If you want to stay short, I'd say some choppy layers and then you can straighten (yes, straighten your already straight hair--it make a difference), except it will look a lot more stylish.  Good luck =)|`|CJ3OsEO9aa	i'm not too sure so i wont be much help.  but you could just experiment with different styles at home?  or maybe you go to the hairdressers ask them about different styles that you could maybe do and that would suit you.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	go super short.|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	do what ever you feel is natural!|`|ERaFCylVaa	you can try puttin it it a pony or pigtails....or you can get some mousse and wave it thats always cute if i were u id let it grow out ...hope i helped|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	straighten it. do some choppy layering, and let your bangs grow out. no pics, just look up razor cut hair on google images.|`|AtJgXB59aa	you can cut it off like pink or grow it longer|`|60YCR6ytaa	maybe try like a cute bob cut like this one http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j243/M...  my friend got this haircut and it looks SUPER cute =3
jxRooBhUaa	well, they're probably swollen because you skipped sizes.     and they probably are irritated.. just do sea salt soaks 3 times a day. you'll see improvements in 2 days..     never use alcohol! its harsh and it dries your skin    itching means that it's healing.. so it's a good sign!    good luck with it all. hope i helped|`|U7vLYGodaa	That's your problem your cleaning it with alcohol. Never clean a piercing with alcohol it dries them out. And is too strong for the piercing. Start with the saline solutions|`|UY9N3VUXaa	two things: were your ears previously pierced and then you STARTED gauging your ears the normal way? (using a taper starting with the smaller sizes like a 14 and going up up every couple of weeks and THEN reaching an 8 gauge?)    or did you have them scalpeled to an 8 gauge? (either previously pierced or not, wont matter)    if you did it the normal way, your ears just might be irritated if you mess with them a lot, or if you didnt wait long enough before your next stretching session (not waiting long enough can cause stress on the lobe and ultimately tearing the inside) that can cause the itching and the crusties.    if you had them scalpeled, they will hurt for a while. scalpeling takes about 3 months to completely heal. DONT use alcohol, stick with warm water and anti-bacterial soap ONLY. over-use of sea salt or saline solution will also dry out the skin.|`|53b80cc7a78713e5fe0e4db2edf8a832aa	1. Get a LiveJournal account.  2. Join the "stretched" community: http://stretched.livejournal.com  3. Read the memories and learn how to properly stretch (not gauge) your ears.  4. Read this post about sea salt soaks: http://community.livejournal.com/bodymod...  5. Use that knowledge.  6. Don't skip sizes in the future, don't allow other people to stretch your ears, use proper techniques (taping, preferably), and only use quality jewelry.   7. STOP USING ALCOHOL.|`|47ctpfzWaa	it sounds possible that you could have developed an infection.  i suggest letting your piercer take a look at it.  by the way where did you hear to use alcohol to clean your piercings.  please for the love of god dont use that anymore.  it will dry the site out quickly.|`|NrG1dyjgaa	sorry, but its not called gauges. that's just a size of measurement    The lobe very well could have reacted to the hair dye, if you have sensitive skin.  NEVER use rubbing acohol, its much too harsh for any piercing and it kills alot of the good bacteria you need to heal it. use a soft soap, even tea-tree soap/lotion, salt soaks are the best thing for it, try taking the jewelry out and cleaning the jewerly and around the piercing. Also if you can get ahold of shea butter putting a little bit on the lobe really helps with dry and itchyness, your skin is probably just dried out from the rubbing alchohol.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Oh god what are you doing to your ears?    You really should go down a size, go ask a piercer if you don't know what size you are, before you do a lot of really horrible damage.  Throw away your alcohol, you should not be using that on your ears.  It is drying them out and making them heal terribly.    Instead, dissolve 1/4 tsp of sea salt (not table salt) in 8 oz of warm water.  Take your earring out and dip two cotton balls in the salt water.  Hold them on either side of your piercing hole until they start feeling cool.  Use a little bit of pressure, but not much.  Afterwards, wipe down your earring with the sea salt solution, then put it back in.  Do this two, maybe three times a day.  You can also dip a q tip into the salt water and use that to clean off crusties during the day.    You have done some serious damage if it's still swollen and painful this long afterwards.  You tore your ear (microtears don't bleed, and are pretty much impossible to see), and now it's infected.  It doesn't have to be super full of pus to be infected.    Please, take care of your ears.  You're doing a lot more damage than you think you are.|`|def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	i dont know who told you to rinse with alcohol but you need to stop right now. alcohol destroys all the new skin cells that your body creates around the healed spot.  you should go back to doing the sea salt soak rinse instead.    i think you should go see a piercer so they can give you some information about how to do this correctly.  we can tell you don't even know what you're doing since you don't even know what size your ears are at.    maybe you need to go back down a size until it heals up.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Please do yourself a favor and stop 'cleaning' it with alcohol. Go to the store and buy sea salt. Place a cotton ball under hot water, sprinkle some sea salt onto the cotton ball and place back under the hot water for a few seconds. Press the cotton ball onto the piercing and leave it in place until the cotton ball cools. Grab yourself a new cotton ball and do the same for the other ear. Make sure you do this every morning and every night before bed.     Did you get your ears stretched by a professional? I'm concerned you don't even know what size your ears are at! A professional will ask you what size you want, and so you will know, AND will give you all cleaning instructions. If you did go to a professional and they failed to give you any of this info please find yourself a new piercer!!     Also, do you know what material the jewelry is that you have in your healing ears? Make sure you only use Stainless Steel or Titanium. Acrylics are a big N-O for newly pierced ears, most people can't even wear them with healed lobes (like myself) If you do not know what material, buy new plugs immediately.

You know something to pay your bills while your trying to break into it. And you need to look good EVERYWHERE you go. You never know who wil come up and ask you about your outfit. Try to get an internship somewhere. You can be a     -model  -photographer  -editor  -designer    Oh and another helpful tip. Make sure you acquaint yourself with the names of models, and designers, AND photographers.|`|Y6BFsic4aa	It's SO FUN working in a Fashion industry!

When the hair is growing they usually split at the end and some time it stop growing.|`|ymXa9xe4aa	Just a cm will do...... just let it grow evenly.....beware u will find it hard to grow ur hair coz at times u wont be looking ur greatest......and might decide to get a new do keep in there......|`|pix9K4jraa	Cutting is for split ends, and until it gets decently long I'd avoid it.  Plus, if you take care of it, split ends generally don't appear.  I've been growing my hair for 2+ years and my advice is not to cut for at least that long.  The awkward stage is a major pain, and it's best to get through it quickly.
69xuw29Baa	Although it would make sense that the exfoliater should wash off all your makeup, exfoliaters do not always have the same type of cleansers in them as makeup removers. Makup removers have more of a cleansing ability to remove the make while the exfoliator is used to help lift deep dirt and old skin cells that have not come off naturally. I say remove your makeup daily, exfoliate twice a week and always place a good moisturizer on.|`|DDwfcKg7aa	go to MaryKay Their make up remover is the bomb.com! lol good luck with your search, I hope my advice helps!

SURE ^^|`|yFUGp3r3aa	kind of plain... if you wear the scarf then probably wont need a necklace... i guess this outfit could be cute... go for it!|`|EUCa7Hc5aa	It's all cute but maybe save the skirt until like summer...11 degrees isn't all that warm! Maybe some cute capris...but you may be chilli in a skirt that short on a winter day  overall very cute!|`|HgrzVACfaa	you should wear it. I love that outfit!|`|zWBYxMvWaa	I would wait for the skirt.  Any why would you wear a scarf and a necklace?      Put on some jeans and pick between a scarf of necklace.  You will have plenty of time to impress during the summer. For now focus on your grades.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	That sounds adorable. He will love it.|`|d17fe6f730ed869a9b13bd5a5dc6d854aa	not those colors. try the blue carti, the white shirt [ you dont want the white to overwhelm the outfit, you want to go for a darker look. or else you will just look annoying and preppy. ]  umm the long cartigan and the short skirt dont match.if you are going to wear that cartigan, wear opague tights or skinny jeans. throw on some uugs to complete the look. [ and the scarf is a little too much ]   gold in outfits [ num. 1. it wouldnt math the outfit you were going to wear, anyway. num 2 gold doesnt go with everything..and you should get silver so you can match it with a bunch of other things. ]   go for a glow, [ conceler ] and some cherry lip gloss  :)|`|LWCCIXQzaa	cute outfit|`|3KPPtupLaa	yea you probably would impress him but you would freeze the death in the process. and im not sure id its worth it. the outfits cute just switch the skirt or some jeans.  :)

69xuw29Baa	I dont think there is anything harmful about them, but make sure you exfoliate your skin before you go so the spray tan sets in evenly. Also after you get it done, you shouldn't exfoliate your skin after because your tan will get blotchy.|`|yFDHSzXCaa	i go tanning & its not bad. you can get a spray on tan. & yes htey can give cancer if u go 90458903485 times a day. i know people that go once a day for teh past 5 months & they dont have cancer|`|WW59n5Lqaa	damages ur skin cell and can cause skin cancer :(|`|50DL7VpHaa	PALE IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!

It's harmless.|`|B97ayTJ3aa	In a word, NO  There is nothing harmful about spray tanning, the only ingredients are alcohol (which aids in drying) and sugar extract DHA.  Beats UV rays  And people do get cancer from sunbeds. It happens quite a lot.|`|NNmDDo39aa	it can turn orange

You are incredibly beautiful and I have no idea why you would want to look any different than you do anyway.  Be happy with what you have and stop trying to change.

xFmhspaVaa	Ok so I'm just telling you from personal experience.. I got my belly button pierced almost 8 years ago. You're not going to believe this but she still til this day has no idea. I'm not kidding. It's actually really easy to hide and if you're going to be showing your stomach for whatever reasons then just take it off.|`|LhHAkqGiaa	Ohhh! I convinced my mom to let me get it pierced, but I'm only 15, so no one would do it for me.    What I did was tell her that that was all I wanted for my birthday, then I told her that if I got it done now, I could take it out in one year when I'm going to try out for bass drum in marching band. So use an excuse like that. Then I told her that I'd get rid of my thongs and let her put all the money I had saved into the bank.|`|HvHBF8glaa	Just go out and ask her!|`|Gh6ep5O7aa	my mom wont let me get mine done either!  ugh, it pisses me off.|`|t7niT4nLaa	Don't convince her..    Just sneak it!!!    That's what i did!!!!
Zh7QcGLtaa	Tanning is your skins way of telling you that it's being damaged. Too bad most women don't listen to it.  You should read up on this a little before you do it. When you get older if you've been tanning your gonna get wrinkley skin adn look REALLY old.   http://healthisnumberone.com/libskintan....|`|B97ayTJ3aa	Get a spray tan. They are quick, affordable and they last for up to 12-14 days. There is no damage to your skin, and you feel great after having one after the initial drying time.  There are spray tanners everywhere  Good Luck|`|3m4YrL8qaa	I think pale skin is prettier but I don't know you should just embrace who you are|`|wLdoD9rdaa	The best advice I can give is go to the beach (if the weather allows that where you live) with some friends and have fun.  Be sure to use tanning lotion with a SPF. You mentioned that your white so I would recommend a SPF of 15 or higher.    If this doesn't work out try spray on tans or at a professional salon or buy a can at the pharmacist. You can also try Dove Energy Glow Gradual Tanning products.    Good luck! :)

It coast way to much to throw away.
GMdSbJV3aa	The best way to make makeup last is the way you prep. I never do touch ups and my makeup doesn't budge.  First, DO NOT Moisturize your eyelids after you have washed them, it just adds oil to you eyelids. You can start by using baby wipes to wipe your eyelids before you do your makeup. Then either start with an eye primer like Urban Decay Primer Potion (my favorite) or start with just foundation. Foundation works because it neutralizes the blue and red tones in your eyelids. Rub a little foundation on your eyelids then with a cotton ball very lightly ( you don't want it to get cakey) powder your eyelid with some kind of translucent finishing powder. I like Mineral Veil by Bare minerals but you can also try Maybeliene Finishing Veil. Then go ahead with whatever eyeshadow you want.   If you want a great eyeliner that lasts, try Urban Decay 24/7 or Styli Style. They both will last all day with out flaking or creasing. The best are MAC liners. They are made with a formula last doesn't come of till you use remover to take it off!!|`|ITMUqdzOaa	get long last eyeshadow, or get cream eyeshadow.    hope it helps...|`|qjutViNuaa	you should get an eyeshadow base like urban decay's primer potion or shadow insurance. They both work really good. You can get both at Sephora. I use them to keep my bright eyeshadows on all day|`|qlYmOAfMaa	Ok, I have the same problem but some one told me if you put lotion on your eye lids before you put on the shadow it should work but thats what they said works but I never tried it...it's worth a try!!|`|tQu7Xgiqaa	wet the applicator a little before putting on eyeshadow. or you can get eye primer at sephora    ANswer mine?   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|PmNGnHU8aa	When I do my makeup I always put foundation everywhere on my face including my eyelids. Then I put the eyeshadow on and use a big blush brush with a tan eyeshadow and put it over it all. I don't know why but it always stays on all day and night. Hope I helped! =]|`|F8TGSWTMaa	If you wear dramatic eyeshadow, I have a great tip.  They make special q-tips for makeup, and its flat.  Or you could use a regular one: You wet it a little and then   use that as ur brush. Then, put more shadow over and you'll  be good the rest of the night!  Hope this helps! :)|`|VFQyC7Vlaa	Try using a primer before applying the eyeshadow.|`|AA10702820	Prime your lids with either a concealer, foundation or eye shadow primer such as Too Faced Shadow Insurance or Urban Decay Primer Potion. All you need is a little bit, maybe the size of a raindrop and rub it in with your ring finger from lashline to brow bone. Your eyeshadow should last all day then.    'Hope this helps!|`|JaDnYs54aa	make it creamier  get a soda can bottle cap or something, take some of the pigment from the eyeshadow, put it in the cap then use the lightest bit of water (just barely a drop) and mix it together then put it on the eye lids    it last at least twice as long if not more.
S6gL67iDaa	I think you should wear your hair in a pony tail at night, i think that would work good. Hope this helps:)|`|yAF2Ltzgaa	what i do it pull it all on one side & sleep that way or pull it behind my head or why not sleep so your comfortable & striaghten it tomorrow?|`|s8APstrVaa	A bun would give you a bump as well.  You should just leave it down.  In the morning run a hair straightener threw it.|`|mp8XgvFDaa	no, do not do a bun because your hair will form to all the turns and twists in the bun  your best bet is a very loose low ponytail by your neckline & if there is still a slight wave or bump in the morning just take 3 minutes to fix it up a bit with a flat iron
82dR08wIaa	Lol, awww!  (((blue)))  I had that problem once, after a week in the hospital, like another poster mentioned, it was a nest!  I brushed my hair out with hair conditioner, yes, while it was dry, took damn near half the bottle too but it worked.  : )  Combing/brushing through wet hair damages it causing more breakage.   Do hope your feeling better dear.|`|Lm3JBhfzaa	Same here. I hate winter and its anti hair campaigns.

pWArTam4aa	Base    Creating a perfect base is the most important step in makeup.  Without it your eye and lip shades will highlight imperfections such as lines, blemishes, or redness.  Base makeup to most people means a mask of foundation, but that's not necessarily the case at all.  If you've got great skin, then all base need mean to you is a dab of well-applied concealer and some blusher.  However, most of us do need a little more coverage than that - or maybe you prefer the groomed feeling that a full base offers.  In this case it's vital to make sure you're choosing the right products for your needs, in the right color for your skin tone.  And that's where many of us slip up - or have done until now, that is.    Foundation and Powder Equipment Kit    If you're applying a full base, foundation and powders are the products to choose.  Here's what's out there and what they do.    Liquid Foundation ~ Provides sheer to medium coverage.  it can be applied with a sponge, but many makeup artists prefer to use their fingers as they claim the warmth helps blend it better.  Use it sparingly - too much can look like a mask.    Stick Foundation ~ Offers more coverage and is faster to blend than a liquid.  It should only ever be blended with fingers or it can look streaky.  It's good if you have small blemishes or under-eye circles and don't want to use concealer.    Cream-to-powder Foundation ~ If you like the look of a matte face, choose these.  Applied with a damp sponge, they create a dewy, matte finish that gives full coverage.    Tinted Moisturizer ~ Offering the lightest coverage, this is the product for you if you don't like foundation.  Many women think it makes you look tanned.  It shouldn't - like foundation, it should match your skin.    Bronzing Gels / Sticks ~ If you want a more sun-kissed look, bronzing gel is the product for you - but choose sheer brands and apply sparingly.  You're trying to enhance your natural color, not create a fake tan.    Loose Powder ~ Used to set foundation, it should be brushed lightly over the face with a big fluffy brush.  Translucent is the best shade to choose, but if you have warm skin choose one that is yellow-based rather than pink.    Pressed Powder ~ To create total coverage, apply this over foundation.  However, don't smooth onto the skin; apply it with a powder sponge in a rolling motion.    Bronzing Powder or Spheres ~ Brushed lightly across the skin, this creates a golden glow.  However, don't use it all over the face, as this will make the skin look dirty rather than tanned. Instead, only apply it where the sun naturally touches your face - the cheekbones, the chin, and the tip of the nose.    Foundation Sponge ~ It's not essential but many women prefer it to their fingers.  Wash the sponge after each use in a little baby shampoo.    Powder Brush ~ Essential for applying loose powder, the perfect brush is just over an inch across and fluffy.  Again, wash it regularly with baby shampoo.    What It All Means    Confused by the terms on your products?  Here's how to break through the lingo.    Firming: These use ingredients that tighten the skin while you wear them.  They minimize fine lines and wrinkles - good for maturing skins.    Light-reflective: As we get older the skin reflects less light, so to counteract this some products add light-reflective particles.  They give the face a glow and create the illusion of fewer lines and wrinkles.  They're good for those with maturing skins or those who feel their skin looks dull.    Moisturizing: These include ingredients that hydrate the skin while you wear them.  Best for dry or mature skins.    Oil-free: Oily ingredients have been taken out to minimize shine.    Plumping: The latest trend in foundation is to include ingredients that "plump" the skin as you wear them, reducing the look of aging and lines and wrinkles.  Good for anyone who's worried about aging skin.    Sun Protection Factor (SPF): Includes sunscreen, but don't rely on it - foundation is spread thin so it won't give the same protection as a moisturizer or a real sunblock.    Treatment Foundation: These normally contain salicylic acid to help counteract pimples while you're wearing them.    Vitamin-enriched: Enhanced with vitamins, these claim to give more defense against skin issues such as pollution.    Top 5 Tips For Using Foundation    Never test foundation on your hand - it's always a different color from your face.  Instead, apply it to your jawline.  The right shade for you is the one that disappears into your skin.    If you can't decide between two foundation shades, choose the lighter one, as darker foundations create more obvious "tidemarks".  This advice changes for black skin, however.  Matching foundation to the lightest areas of your skin can make you look ashy.  Match to the darkest and you seem overly made-up.  If you still can't find a perfect match, go with the one that matches your neck - it's usually halfway between the two.    You're wearintoo much foundation if you can't see any of the pores on your skin.  Your natural texture is supposed to show through a little.    If your makeup starts to shine, use blotting paper rather than reapplying powder, which can often start to look heavy.    For a softer look on a night out, apply your foundation before your have your bath (run it warm rather than boiling hot) because the steam sets the foundation, creating a dewy look.|`|2TEDmxPXaa	the key to covering acne scars or any discoloration is in the concealer. Once you have your foundation matched to your neck ...(it needs to blend in with the color of your neck or you look like you have a mask of make up on)...then choose a concealer a shade or 2 lighter then your foundation. Apply concealer..then foundation...and set with translucent powder.

I didn't know I could look online. Thank you. Sorry I can;t help you though.|`|GGoidtHVaa	Make sure to pick out an oil free foundation, that way you won't look oily, and you won't break out.  Pick a color that is right for your skin tone, if you have hint of pink go for a cool tone. always test out the foundation on your face NOT your hand. just use a little dab, and smooth it through out the face. Make sure you blend well. You'll know if it's the wrong shade for you. make sure that if you wear foundation you also wear blush. Don't pick a cray color, just something that looks natural for your skin tone, If you don't use some sort of blush or bronzer with foundation you will look washed out, and you won't have any definition to your face.

5HjtEyPQaa	yeah sounds good. it makes me really happy that u care so much about ur skin cuz now...... everyone is just like obsessed with getting a tan! i kno everyone my age is!!!!!!! kudos to u, u skin-cancer free chica!!!!!!!!!! :]|`|WMNbGsoWaa	Yes, any and all products that go on my face are Neutrogena. Neutrogena has really great products, and I always use thier sunscreen. It's best to get the highest SPF number, so it's smart how you have SPF 80 for the beach. But I am very happy with the Neutrogena sunscreen, so I say you are making a good choice!
hJWjSWYXaa	It depends on your skin type! My skin wouldn't break out but I had a lot of black heads,  I used every product you could imagine and nothing worked! So I went to the dermatologist and he gave some cream to cure my black head problem and I had a really weird skin disorder that is also being cured! now my skin is flawless! My advice don't waste your time with all those over the counter products just go to the pros!|`|AA10236815	clear.now    http://aorihuela.qbeautyzone.com/|`|V675pNwiaa	I use apricot scrub and neutrogena face soap in the shower.  then at night I wash my face with phisoderm . Its works pretty well|`|N5S2iycLaa	just wash you face man with soap u dont have to get stuff for it.|`|57AG9ag3aa	its because its made for a combination of oil& dry skin. But they don't tell you that on the commercial. I would try a gentle cleanser with Hope in a jar for the moisturizer, they sell it at most sephora stores|`|HE558QgXaa	Try the neutrogena wave. it really works. It cleans really deep down and stops breakouts before they start.|`|WMNbGsoWaa	Neutrogena has great products you can use!     A great natural way to get rid of acne is to eat an apple a day and stay away from oily and fatty foods and drinks high in caffeine. Products help get rid of the result of acne, but they don't get rid of the real problem of acne, which is your digestive system. When you eat too much foods that are bad for you, it can clog up your intestines to where they can't get rid of all the nasty toxics you've stored up in your body, so they expel them onto your face. Not very nice.    Eating lots of healthy food and washing your face daily can help get rid of your acne. It helped me!|`|JMJsCU1vaa	a very inexpensive ritual to try is this;  Go to Walmart or "Aggramart" as I prefer to call it, and go to the cosmetic section, buy a soft facial pad that fits over your four fingers and is very soft... Then buy a tube of Equate Daily Face Wash, store brand and should be about 2.75 a tube, and should last for a good month.  Only wash your face with this pad and the face wash, and do this a couple times a day, do not use other soaps or cleansers... you might be pleasantly surprised in a short time.  Also you'll need to lay off the make-up, this is the number one reason for teen acne and girls seem to put more on trying to cover up the problem that is caused by what your trying to cover it up with....It's a vicious cycle...  You're young, your beautiful, and you have your whole life to wear make-up, grow up first.|`|zyoGZ3sxaa	try rubbing alcohol and if it makes your face too dry,add a little bit of lotion|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Use a toner to clean your skin every day. It will remove all of the dirt and make up you may have on your face.    Then get some kind of over the counter cream with benzoyl peroxide in it. B.P. is known for helping acne.    I use Clean and Clear Persa 10 Gel (from Walgreens or any other drug store, or any place that carries facial cleansers). It runs about 7 dollars, but it's completely worth it.
sHUnctqIaa	It's a pressed powder eyeshadow, obviously because they left some of the fallout on the cheek. There's probably another white shadow underneath to bulk up the color as well. I would guess they started with a heavy primer then a vivid shadow, I've seen a similar shadow color from Urban Decay and Mac. Either will work, once you find the color you like, after tracing the shape they worked in words and layered the eyeshadow, not too much blending. then to finish a black liquid eyeliner and false lashes or a model with lash extensions and some black mascara.|`|ITMUqdzOaa	powder.  look in Medusa's Make-up... they have every color imaginable!!!!|`|TSrPbjt3aa	glitter and eye shadow|`|rWwqBau7aa	Looks photoshopped. I think its a paint pot. I would use paint pots from MAC|`|yWRTrnR2aa	It looks like powder, I would use Medusa's "stick it" and eyedust in "Blue Balls".  http://www.medusasmakeup.com/eyedust.htm|`|rwbUF975aa	You probably want to use MAC products as they make good eye makeup. Go for their eye pigment in Steel Blue. Use good eye shadow brushes. For the eyelinger, use MAC gel liner in Black.|`|OYFu9Jrmaa	looks like glitter to me, perhaps it's glitter paint|`|qjutViNuaa	i think that it looks like a powder eyeshadow but there is probably a cream color base underneath to make the color stay bright
xAibdGsTaa	YES there called bags|`|F9TCDvWMaa	"Dark circles under the eyes can be contributed to lack of sleep. When an individual is asleep and motionless for long periods of time tissue fluid is drawn from the blood and enters into ones body tissues. After waking up and beginning the day, tissue fluid is squeezed back into lympathic vessel and into blood circulation by activity . Long periods without sleep keep these fluids from entering back into tissue allowing blood vessels under the eyes to be more visible. This contributes to a persons lack of color after a sleepless night. If wearing a ring, you may notice it becomes less snugg due to this process. The effects of caffeine and nicotine cause vasocontriction of blood vessels under the skin adding to loss of skin color and futher complementing the dark regions under the eyes. Age also contributes as collagen fibers begin to those their elasticity."
kzyEuRroaa	I agree- wait until summer to do it.  It's only a few months away, and that way you don't have to worry about hiding it, or possibly taking it out at times.  Get it the day you get out of school as a present to yourself- that you survived a year at a school that has crappy rules lol!!    Even after piercings heal, there is a frame where if you take your piercing out for an extended amount of time it could cause irritation putting it in and taking it out every day. When I get a new piercing, I prefer not to take it out at all for even months after getting it, unless to change jewelry, as everyone heals differently, and I don't want anything unneccessary affecting that healing.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	yes  there  is a clear  piercing. when  you get it pierced  or before just ask them  if they can put a clear one  in for you. and thats very cool|`|2DL4GMcgaa	Please don't be a follower. Don't make a mistake you'll regret.|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	I have to agree with others and say wait until summer so you have time to heal. You can then put in a clear plastic retainer for school. If you take it out it WILL heal up very quickly, take it from one who knows.|`|QZ1gWFGBaa	it is possible to get a clear stud   they don't really disguise the fact that you have your lip pierced   i think you should say to your school that you will take it out as soon as its healed   once its healed you can leave it out and put it back in when you get home but i would not recommend you do this if your piercings has not fully healed   if you cannot get a clear stud try getting a smaller ball for the end of your labret   if not wait until the summer|`|8nBtHHaAaa	Just wait until the summer to do it, then you'll have the whole summer to let it heal. When school starts back up you'll be able to take it out during school, but be sure to put it back in once you leave school to make sure it's totally healed.|`|47ctpfzWaa	my husband use to have a clear retainer for his labret piercing.  however i am not sure given that it is acrylic if it would be ok to use on a fresh piercing.  as far as taking it out i dont know.  my husband took his out and it was shut to far to put the jewelry back in pretty fast but it was also healing at the time.|`|xpP1PsAoaa	If your school don't allow it then dont ******* do it  Learn to follow the rules idiot|`|QC94IKIxaa	Ever thought of obeying the rules?|`|lFzXZQQDaa	awesome! lucky you have the guts to do that :P my school also doesn't allow it. which is lameee. but whatever. :}    yeah there are definatly clear studs sold all over. but if your schools like mine, they are pretty good about that kinda stuff and check kids. so idk, you might just wanna see if other kids have them and ask if they got busted before :)|`|8G5oT4YFaa	dont do it until the summer holidays.. it can be your reward!...|`|5dMTkFWMaa	This girl in my school just takes clear string like fishing line and puts it though and pulls it around. you don't notice it at all!|`|uBSRpJkaaa	I No What you Mean! i personally think that see-through studs are awful and really noticeable i have a stud with a very small stud i got from a shop called "Trinket Box" but you may not have this shop around but if you keep just the bar out dont eat! otherwise ur just swallow it! also dont take it out to much even if its healed! Ive Had Mine for half a year and i still cant take it out for a whole school day!   Hope you Look Nice ! (:     x|`|t9pCfqj6aa	I don't think they can legally do that.|`|s4iVl04raa	You can get a clear stud to wear while you're in school. For example: http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_... . You might not be able to wear it right away though, I would let your lip heal some before switching the jewelry, especially since the retainers are plastic, and plastic can cause you to get infection more easily. Consult your piercer beforehand before switching it out. (All piercings have a different healing time, depending on the parts of the body and the person - http://www.ringsofdesire.com/healing.htm... ). Lip piercings typically take 6-8 weeks to heal. You MIGHT be able to get your lip pierced with a retainer, or at least a smaller stud that may not be noticed as much.    After the piercing is entirely healed, I would not recommend you take it out for the whole school day. I've tried that before with other types of facial piercings and by the time you get out of school the hole will be so tight it'll be hard and sometimes painful to get it back in. Eventually, like after the end of the school week, you may not be able to get it back in at all. It'll begin to "heal" while you are in school, that's why the hole will shrink. Plus, you run the risk of getting distracted and forgetting to put the piercing back in. You're better off purchasing a clear retainer to wear while in class.    Hope this helps! Good luck! :)|`|u9uFdSrqaa	paint it black and make it look like a mole
NSKimt1Qaa	I love that hairstyle!  That's kind of the way I wanted my hair cut.  It should be pretty easy for any good stylist to cut it that way.  I've had more than my share of bad luck with going to different hairstylists and getting the haircut I thought I was getting.  I would have a consultation first if they will do that without charge and without any obligation.  That way, you can see if you think the stylist understands what you want and whether they think it would work for your hair.  A picture is good, but even with a picture, if you get the wrong stylist, you could be fooled and end up with something a little different.  It's a good sign if the stylist asks you questions instead of just saying, "sure" and start cutting.  If you feel comfortable and confident with the stylist, then go for it.  Good luck!|`|HbmHRiwLaa	well if it is just the style that wouldn't be too terribly hard.. but the color would be difficult.|`|oAyI70W5aa	the one you have sounds good. just tell her a show her EXACTLY what you want. maybe go a little early and see how her other clients turn out?      answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|XV7QHjPFaa	as long as you show your stylist the picture, he/she shouldn't have too much trouble, but would probably need three to four years of styling after he/she graduated out from beauty school
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Specifically, overnight your can try "plopping" wet hair (see the first link and look in the steps). If it's mostly dry I would do a "pineapple". lol, these all have weird names. Anyways put your hair up in a very high, loose ponytail with a cloth wrapped hair tie (also known as scrunchie). This will prevent the curls form being stretched out and stuff. Also to prevent frizzing and damage from moving in your sleep try sleeping on a satin pillowcase.    http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    Hope this helps! :)|`|PZYNdUtXaa	there are only 2 ways that I know-    1. Use water spray, curl reviver spray and then a little extra product to revive it without washing.  Don't use too much product if you already put some on after washing.    2.  Ask your hairdresser whether layers, or growing your hair, might help - I used to be in your position but now my hair is layered it looks fine the day after washing with just a wave to it.    Condition lots to combat the frizz.
bPd1RsxDaa	Brown will go with almost every color, but I would avoid putting it with purple, pink, or dark shades of blue.    Black will go with anything, except brown.  Please do not make the error of pairing these two!!  It is the grossest mistake I see people make.    Now for your brights:  Blue and yellow can be paired.  Red and blue are nice together.  Purple & pink go together great.  Try to avoid pairing pink and red together!!  It's horrible unless it is a specific design that is on the clothing already... but be very careful even with those.  Red and yellow are great together.    Pastel pink and darker shades of blue work nicely.    A favorite for many "girly-girls" is turquoise/brown.  Oh, and pink/brown or hot pink/black combos.    Have fun mixing and matching.  The color of clothes sometimes depends on how you wear the articles.  Good luck :)|`|l1BNyWjcaa	GREEN AND PURPLE AND ORANGE thoose colors are really cute together and whatever colors you choose (pink and blue, green and red,red and yellow) Make sure you keep the same colors not 100 differnt ones think or green undershirt purple over shirt orange skirt and poka-adot orange green and purple knee socks with green converse|`|QAI7f0zlaa	try mixing an matching. and look at the color wheel it helps see what colors are in the same family and which colors are contrasting of each other.

If you are worried about your height, look at your parents - you should be able to guage your eventua height from them.  But to answer your question - NO you are not too short.
3d3JW4Wuaa	The pic is black its just a red tint because its a synthetic wig =S     You should think about waiting until it grows out and use wash-in (6-8 wahses) colour in the waiting period.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	I would leave it another week and then do it with nice and easy hair colour. It should be fine but make sure you condition your hair for at least a month afterwards and don't die it for another six weeks. Because your hair is bleached the colour will be more vibrant so don't leave it on for very long! Best of luck!|`|FOsd9DP6aa	I'd leave your hair a week or two and use an intensive conditioner a few times a week during this period to strengthen your hair.   Also, I'd get the colouring done professionally.  Looks cute though :)|`|Twq7efhQaa	Since you have had your hair bleached it will come out a lot more of a vibrant red whihc is a lot better.  However, if you had started with really dark hair the red wouldn t have had much of an effect on it but since you have already bleached it will :) the only thing to remember is not to get a too bright of red otherwise because you are putting it on a light colour it will come out bright red.|`|mBjZkqlUaa	cool,go for it|`|fde58a4004c1e1d57eb4cf4ee32bdb21aa	sweetie your going to get the color you want but your hair is going to be very weak, right now gve it a week or 2 more bleached, and keep getting it treated, the bleaching alone has damaged your hair drastically.take good care of your hair.or you might loose it
zmjAccMFaa	No where unless you are 18 years of age.  No reputable piercer will touch you if you are not 18 or your parents are not there to sign for you.  If they allow you to get it and you are not 18 or have your parents it is most likely not the best place to go, one they are breaking the law and you are more likely to get an infection or messed up piercing.    Just try and convince your mom.  Make a deal with her or something.|`|xxSGhywoaa	DIY in your bathroom.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	No one would risk losing their licence to pierce a teen without parental agreement.  you ever saw someone without a tongue? Basically if it gets infected you wouldn't be able to talk nor eat ever in your life again as they'd need to truncate it  Don't do something stupid; There's a reason why your mum won't let you.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	no professional place will pierce you if you are under 18. the piercer could  risk loosing their piercing license if they pierce a minor without parent consent and no shop will do that.just try to convince your parents to take you or wait till your 18.|`|PumYhJSvaa	If you do find a place that is willing to pierce you without your parent then you are likely to get an infection. Good piercing parlors are strict about parental consent.|`|nuISzHFRaa	Umm I would not do it yourself, there is like some major thing in your tongue you could hit. Look around yoru school for someone with a million piercings, most likely they could help you out with finding someone. Or you just go with a friend who looks old enough and have them sign off on it.|`|fde58a4004c1e1d57eb4cf4ee32bdb21aa	sorry but the only place that will do that for u is in new york... try to make friends with a tattoo artist or something then he can hook you up
xcG5Tasiaa	Hmm, that's a very pink, non-distinct complexion you have.   It almost looks like... camo.     Tying it back might help, but you might want to change your make-up style.|`|jhFT5kT1aa	half up  messy bun  scrunched  pigtail braids.  all i got|`|6loH10bVaa	Maybe get high lights. Don't get it cut short because of how curly it is. Relaxing it and highlights would be cute|`|N7mgfDxnaa	get it relaxed so its wavy, and dye in light brown.|`|sjzUIWEUaa	i agree with baby..|`|4gMmrz9maa	DEFINANTLY DONT RELAX IT!   I have the same exact hair. And I learned the hard way, realxing it only get rid of some of the curls. You end up with wavy frizzy big hair. If you want it straight, buy a Chi Straightener. They are AMAZING! Maybe die your hair a dark brown with a darker underlay. That would look very very pretty!(: Hope My advice works(:
usxeet5vaa	I have the same exact hair as you!!!     What you can do is take your bangs, put them together, and pin them back with a bobby pin. You can make them stick up a little, so it looks like a poof.     Besides the poof, you can also make two low pig tails, and pin your bangs up with that.     A regular ponytail could also work, but you could take strands in your ponytail and braid them. This is kind of hard to do by yourself, so ask a sister, friend, mom, whatever person that is good at braids.     Leaving your hair loose also works, and you can add little clips, headbands, bows, barrettes. Jazz it up!    This stuff is what I use all the time, so I hope it works for you, too!|`|9cYqY6vWaa	I have a short french cut bob so I know what you are talking about... there aren't too many options.     I usually just tie them in really cute low pigtails if I am having a really bad hair day, it looks cute if you have really short hair like mine because the hair sticks up really cute :D    Put on a headband. I know my hair doesn't look good pushed back so I usually just place it after my bangs (kinda hard to explain).      Put a cute clip in it? Idk, my hair is shorter than yours (eeek I know, but I love it anyways) so you just have to be creative.|`|n86P8yccaa	i use to have short hair too and it is very hard to do .... i use to straighten it and flip the tips the clip it|`|gyxB0lDIaa	You could curl it with an iron and make it look wavy or you can go with no bangs and pull them up you can get clips and pull up both of the side's and put the clip at the top or you can streak your hair to make it look different.  You also could use hot rollers for less curl and more volume to make the hair appear fuller I hope this helps|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Put it up..    Curl it...    Make it wavy...    Alternate your bangs to give you a fresh look when you think you need it.|`|KWVz0OhVaa	i think that you should wash with apple cider vineger to bring out shine. then you should straighten and curl inwards a bit hope i helped :D|`|J3HKl0Hqaa	Sometimes I see people braid it and that always looks nice :) Hope this helped.
fALkYOC1aa	try putting a little foundation on your eye lids before you apply your eye liner.  experimenting with all the different types will help you figure out an alternative way other than just pencils-- liquid and they do sell a powder type eye liner. it's kinda like eye shadow but you use it for eye liner. i have some and it works great. i hope this helps you! :)|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	do the waterproof eyeliner smear too? If that's the case it means your eyelids are producing too much oil. You have to powder them before applyin make up and powder again after. And before fixing your make up hours later, press gently a tissue over your eyes to get rid of the oil. There's no point using eyeliner over an oily area as it will smear right away|`|2TEDmxPXaa	make sure your applying make up on a clean face for starters, oils on our skin will make it slide and fade. When you apply your foundation use it on your eye lids as well, right up under them as well, and make sure you 'set it' with powder, that will help keep your liner in place.    The liquid liners go on smooth n dry nicely in place, and you can always use a thin angled brush by making it damp and using it in eye shadow to use as liner, that stays pretty good as well, thats what i do when i want it to last, ive got oily skin and if i dont its not crisp and fresh looking 2 or 3 hours later.|`|GLEGh4N0aa	use a makeup sealer.    http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/gp/pro...|`|M8f4BorPaa	liquid eyeliners suck. so if its liquid OR waterproof get rid of it n just dont wear it in the water. i like MAC eyeliner...OK put a good conclear on undereyes before u put on anything put on eyeliner make sure its on good and lightley go over it with the concealer again and it shood make it last longer. good luck! hope this helps :)|`|zDh2Qw9eaa	I have the same issue. I have dry skin but oily eyelids and watery eyes. Have you tried gel liners? Ever since I started using them exclusively I have no issues, but that may change with skin types. I also found that using an eye primer both over the lids and under the eyes kept the eyeliner from smearing. Also, dabbing just a touch of powder over the eyeliner helps set it. There is the option of using an eye shadow as a liner as well, all you need is a thin angled brush.|`|o98vDDTRaa	instead of using a liner pencil use black eyeshadow and an angle brush it never smears :)|`|HCudI2O8aa	make sure your applying the eyeliner on clean, non-oily eyes. Have you tried liquid eyeliner? those work great!|`|vSOf7Z0Waa	the same always happens to me!~|`|7sRusjE6aa	it might be because you have oily skin  i have the same problem with my eyeliner and i used a concealer and for some reason it sticks now!  if it keeps on smearing check up on it every hour or so and maybe try to fix it up~|`|puIXFcCcaa	make sure not to rub you eyes, and if it's liquid, make sure to keep your eye shut at least 30 seconds after applying.   Also, you might want to try different medias of eyeliner to see which one you like the best.
5bd05c7fa78a69fcd566818bb048a2bfaa	I think skinny jeans would work; denim (provided you have the right size) is almost universally flattering.

dAK9TTLeaa	i'm also asian. :)  for me, i have straight hair but i want it EVEN straighter.  so i just blow dry my hair mostly complete after a shower but i towel dry first then blow dry because if i don't it will get all wavy the next day so try blow drying it after you towel dry it.  hope i helped. :)    note:keep the towel in for like 5 minutes or maybe 10 if thick then blow dry. :)  it might be frizzy though. sorry.  well good luck. :)|`|PyC1MIkXaa	Haha, I have the same problem, literally.  I'm like I'm Asian... I'm supposed to have straight hair.  But, no. D;    I just buy the heat protection spray and straighten my hair every morning.  It's a drag, really.  That's all I do.|`|d01EV6npaa	DONT CUT IT SHORT WHATEVER YOU DO. then you'll have like a fro. lol i think you could just be yourself. maybe find a way to live with your hair or get it permanently straightened.
KBBonf97aa	I've got the same problem -- too much hair and it's wavy.  After trying all sorts of products with very limited success, I started using Aussie Sprunch Spray the way I would a styling gel.  When my hair is wet, I spray my hands and run them through my hair.  Then I basically position my hair the way I want it to be when it dries.  The hair gets a little crunchy during the drying process, but once it's dry, I can run my hands through it or comb it and it becomes soft, but still maintains the shape it had when it was crunchy.  The Sprunch Spray only costs about $3.50 at Target and comes in a purple bottle and looks like a pump hair spray.  It's a huge time saver and now people have no idea I actually have hair from hell!  Good luck!|`|MNuS31nsaa	for "crunchy" hair, the key products are gel, moose, hairspray. if the moose didnt work for you, try scrunching gel. take the gel into your palms and scrunch your hair. then top it off with hairspray so there will be no frizziness.|`|hLdIO43Xaa	There are several kinds of Herbal Essence mousses---have you tried the Set Me Up Mousse? It works great for me, its wavy and "crunchy." in a nice way. Also, if you use a lot more, it'll get crunchier. Or you can pair it with a good hairspray.    Also, scrunching gel.  Additionally, Pantene Curl Defining Mousse is great for crunchiness!  I hope I helped! Good luck!|`|HgybrVX9aa	i have very thick wavy hair also,  and i've tried to get the crunchy look,  but no matter how much moose or hairspray i put in it,  it won't get crunchy.  i don't think it will work for you either.  it sucks for us thick wavy-haired people.  but i think our hair looks fine without the crunchy look.  http://i476.photobucket.com/albums/rr124...  ^^ that's my hair naturally, but i usually straighten it.|`|KDCXd3B0aa	My friend uses special curl around shampoo, and never brushes her hair! It looks gorgeous however.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Hairspray and gel. Just spray, scruch, and repeat :D|`|I4T8HoLEaa	I have thick hair too.  I usually wash my hair, then brush it while wet. Then apply hairspray or gel. I use aussie soft touch strong hold. Use a lot!|`|PpwhwEDhaa	Try a strong gel- lots of it. Ex. L.A. Looks. It's cheap but surprisingly rather good. Might even bring out some of your curls instead of the frizz.
mX0qaX3Eaa	If you don't know what you want, you don't want a tattoo. Too many people just think 'I know! I'll get a tattoo' without having the faintest clue. A tattoo should be personal, it shouldn't be an idea given to you by another person!    Also, all this Miami Ink "I want MY phoenix to represent rebirth because I quit smoking crack" is a massive crock. Pick some ideas that appeal to you visually (as tattooing IS a form of art, not religion) and some that pertain to you as a person, that pertain to your interests your loves etc.    Please, don't just go out and get some generic tattoo that represents 'love, strength and freedom' you'll regret it and as unique as you think it is, it isn't.|`|Tj94JEMJaa	Around your bellybutton, i forgot what its called though when its their. make it be unique, like some type of swirls.

PQzrsXsKaa	If you like it, keep it. Pay no mind to other people. Unless it's just getting really bad, and every other person you see has one. I still would probably keep mine, but if you think it's affecting your individuality or something, I'd try another piercing.    I don't know if it's just my town, but I just got an eyebrow, and so far I've seen maybe three people who have one. In my entire life, that I can remember. While on the other hand I've been seeing more and more industrials. So, look around and see what's scarce.|`|fz98Deu9aa	As a guy i find girls with lip piercings attractive.

qOKFuXfLaa	i really like ELF eyelash curler ... it's only a dollar too  mascara ... i like MAC Plush Lash and Christian  Diorshow|`|2TEDmxPXaa	revlon ..lash fantasy..total definition..waterproof...apply the 'white' primer, it thicknes your lashes and extends them...let it dry and then apply several coats of the mascara..youll have thicker longer looking lashes that last and last. And it wont cost you a fortune like some of the really expensive designer collections do. I swear by the stuff|`|zDh2Qw9eaa	I second Lash Blast. My search for the perfect mascara is over, and trust me I have tried many. High end, middle of the shelf, and low end. As for curlers, I tend to like the ELF curler. It's only a dollar, and it does the job.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	Mac double extend curer works great and i love define-a-lash mascara|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Eyelash curlers are all pretty much the same. You can get one at WalMart for about $3-4 that's just as good as the more expensive ones. As for mascara, I like Clinique. It's clean and easy to apply.  No clumping or smearing. My daughter likes Lash Blast because it makes her lashes look long and beautiful. My other daughter likes the kind with the colored sparkles that makes her eyes more blue.  You just need to get one and experiment until you find the one that feels and looks right for you. Good luck!|`|sGhgJHjhaa	Yeah, hands down the Shu Uemura eyelash curler from sephora is THEEE best eyelash curler. everyone in my family uses it... and it's pretty costly for an eyelash curler but it's the best 20 bucks i've ever spent. the perfect curl and NEVER! pinches me.    my current favorite mascara is too faced lash injection pinpoint. my eyelashes are longer, thicker, curls for days, and washing it off i don't get raccoon eyes cause it comes off in little tubes. it took me a few years to find the perfect mascara for my thin short lashes... but i think i got it =]|`|kogageqzaa	dunno about eyelash curler but for mascara def. Dior is the best!|`|l1VA4W6kaa	I really think that MaryKay products are great. They aren't just normal either, they actually make products that aren't harmful for your face.|`|ctJc4jotaa	shumera and too faced lash injection|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I think any eyelash curler works but the best mascara I have ever used was LashBlast by Cover Girl. It makes my lashes look fuller, longer and darker without the clumping look. I use the blackest they have. I never wear water proof though cause I think it makes them look clumped so I don't know how their water proof looks, if your looking for that kind. If you want  a picture http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=16...     I only brushed the bottom ones once and tops twice.|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	i like the revlon eyelash curler but just make sure its metal not plastic. plastic ones dont work as well.

8THz1sp9aa	If you 'think' you know what you want, then I say you need a while to really think about it. When you are 100% sure of what you want (and it's very meaningful) then I say go for it.     Think about important events that have happened in your life. I say this all the time, but it's only the truth.. the past makes for a good tattoo because it'll always be a part of you.     Please don't just go to any artist, do your research, study their portfolio and if their work blows you away and you just know that's the style you want, then talk to them about drawing up something for you. You can look on deviantart.com for ideas, just don't steal anyones ideas. Most artists will refuse to copy anyones work anyways. You can print out a few photos of what you like and they will draw up something similar. Just remember, this is on you for good.     Good luck|`|qAjcfjmeaa	You really shouldn't get one until you are 100% positive its what you want to live with for the rest of your life. Unless of course you want to pay and can afford removal surgery.
V2gxQEIAaa	it doesnt hurt.. it is only a bit of slight pressure and it only last like less than a minute.. they put the clamp on your tongue first.. after they mark it.. some poeple dont clamp it all the way cause it can hurt.. then the needle goes through your tongue real quick and then they follow through with the barbell. its really quick and so worth the tiny bit of pain.. i absolutely love mine.. it will swell for a few days but thats also worth it too.. just make sure you clean it a keep plenty of ice water on hand.. it helps loads.. and after a few days - a week.. the swelling should be gone..    happy piercing :)|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	it does not hurt that bad at all i promise,and i got mine done 2 times since the guy did it crooked and even the second time was not that bad. i was reading everyone saying it doesnt hurt at all" and i thought they were just lying. but im serious its like a 2/10 on a pain scale, and it is defiantly worth it    i got my tongue pierced like 2 weeks ago  |`|0dCOJQiwaa	It doesn't really hurt that much, it feels like when you bite down on your tongue accidentally...ever done that? No big deal. I've had my tongue pierced since I was 18 and I'm 23 now...I got it in right now....all ya gotta do is stick your tongue out and they put a clamp on it and then put the needle thru....just close your eyes. It won't hurt at all, and it's soooo cute, and the hole never really closes up....I've had mine out for like 2 months once and it never closed :)|`|Qjty3OTQaa	I say totally go for it. i love mine.    the pain isnt anything. just a lil pinch really im sure you can handle it if i could im a total baby when it comes to piercings. lol. all they do is tell you to stick out your tongue then clamp it down make sure its even and then push the needle through. very quickly i might add lol. but nothing to serious. i would go through the pain again just to have it. go for it you wont regret it, :]
sGhgJHjhaa	i reeeally loved this mascara. it made my lashes long and thick, and didn't really clumped... i just used a brush to comb out the clumps. washing it off was the best part cause you never get raccoon eyes and it really does look like little tubes. for an affordable price, i really liked it. the only thing that bothered me was the fact that the company tests on animals. now i'm using too faced lash injection which has the same idea, but its a little more expensive but one less step. the loreal one was bombskies though... i say you go for it!|`|rHKW1CJJaa	ick i dont like it...i use the primer half but the primer + mascara is no good.... i just use it with another mascara.... its nothing like the commercial...|`|Run7dyraaa	I use it.

5j1Uhg2Gaa	I actually use baby oil when my skin is very dry. I think it works better than any hydrating lotion out there. But if you want lotion. Jergens Shea Butter helps a lot.|`|AA11609679	Try using a lotion with shea butter. Shea butter is a really good moisturizer and is even recommended for use after a sunburn to help heal your skin. You can get Palmer's formula with shea butter from any store. Not expensive at all. Good luck!|`|CZfUO2kcaa	Cetaphil in the tub, not the pump bottle. Dermatologist recommended. It is a thick cream and goes into the skin with out leaving you feeling all greasy. It is expensive $10 + but the tub lasts forever.|`|E7MltaSRaa	st ives vitamin E is great!

RtGTFufOaa	Ok, so when your in the shower shampoo your hair and then put some conditioner in your hair then while the conditioner is still in your hair take a comb and come it through gently,wash it out then repeat. Once your down washing your hair turn the water cold for a few seconds. Then next day your hair should be silky and shiny!|`|P6Tzx9Vjaa	If you have split ends thats going to make your hair look less healthy.    Make an appointment with you hairdresser and ask her what you can do as well.    Make sure your not washing your hair too much unless you have really oily hair. Washing your hair too much removes the natural oils.  Wash it every other day, unless like I said, you have really oily hair.|`|32FvVHYFaa	bio silk!--walmart|`|s3gwur9zaa	use a good shampoo and conditioner...i use panteen and herbal essences|`|iNPO8q0Laa	You can use Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine products they really work I use them.|`|qBEgB7bOaa	try putting a little of conditioner in your hair after your done taking a shower (flip your hair over and apply it) but not too much because then it will be greasy! Then dry it with a towel and blow dry as usual.. it works for me!
Ykzx3OVfaa	Don't do it at the same time. Do black all over color first, then bleach streaks blonde so when you dye them red they will be bright. Or, go to a salon. You can't foil the red dye and rinse out the black at the same time.|`|CtHi5L78aa	ok first off you cant put color over color your red isnt going to come out, so your gonna have to bleach it and probably more than once, and when your bleaching as soon as bleach comes in tack with water it stops processing but i would wash the foils out and then just rinse your head color stops processing after hitting water.|`|bgWHvucHaa	i do my hair all different colors    if your hair where the red is it lighter then do it at the same time, maybe 30 minutes or 45, but if your hair where red is gonna be is black, wait as long as possible, and take the black out sooner    the longer u leave red in the more vibrant|`|hJTvbbKnaa	i hope you are aware that your going to have to bleach your hair a couple of times first.  but do your black then red, so that it doesnt mix.   i would recomend, dyeing your hair black, and bleaching the parts taht you want red. THEN dye the blonde (probably a yellowish colour) red.
ouvvS1Ylaa	you will need a permanent dye.  i would reccomend herbal essences or feria.   if you really want to go blonde,  youre going to need to bleach it first.  i would recommend having it done in the salon for such a drastic change.|`|OndtnxEzaa	loreal is good make sure u leave it in long enough or it will turn orange it happend to me once! gooood luck|`|4J2NGAMyaa	revlon is the best ..go for it.
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Well, 14 is pretty much the youngest that you're allowed to get pierced in most places (with parental consent).    I think 14 is old enough if you understand the risks involved in oral piercings, know how to take care of it properly and have proven that you're willing to stick with things, even if they aren't fun (healing a piercing takes commitment and isn't very enjoyable)    Do your research, learn everything you can, this way you can show your parents that you're willing to go into things in an informed way. Tell them about the risks and how a good piercer will do everything possible to minimize the risks (learn the specifics - parents want details!) This will show your parents that you are mature enough to enter into a piercing as an adult.    Here's one to get you started: How to find a good piercing artist.  http://www.shopperarticles.com/Selecting...|`|l2E9xlwiaa	I personally don't think you should.

F3UjXpmTaa	I can tell you everything you need to know (:  Use salon brand products, if possible. (K-pak and Biolage are great)  There's also a brand called Darn Straight by Straight Sexy Hair, it's my personal fave.  While in the shower, rinse your conditioner out with cool water.  Reduce the amount of heat you put into your hair.  Always use sprays that prevent heat damage before you blow dry/straighten.  After blow drying or straightening, blast through your hair on the cool setting of your blow dryer.  Depending on the damage, you can do a conditioning treatment up to twice a week.   Once the treatment is in your hair, put on a shower cap or something of that sort and let it set (I do from around 30 mins. to an hour)  rinse it out (doing the cold thing I talked out)  It should feel great at this point.  Also, excessively dying your hair can be very harsh!      This is what I do to prevent my hair from going crazy!|`|2404nDvSaa	special hair stuff could help, and/or you could just cut off the split ends|`|EkiBzIp9aa	try getting your hair tips trimmed ALOT like once a month. Also, the same thing happened to me, so the best thing to do if you really want hair thats not mistreated is to cut your hair short like to your shoulders (you'll have to make a sacrifice but its worth it i promise!!!) and then drink LOTS of water and stuff. Nessesarily, conditioner does help, but the bad thing about it is if you stop using it for like a week or two then your hair will get all bad and nasty lookin. Also washing it daily makes it healthier and when you take a bath/shower its also really bad for your hair when you use hot water so try to when your rinsing your hair to use colder water and that helps alot too.|`|zU6Lf67Eaa	i have the same problem! my hair is super long too!! i use Herbal Essences, it really helps my hair.  buy the conditioner/shampoo.  They have different formula's for all types of hair problems, even if your hair is healthy they have products for that.  they are reasonably priced and affordable.  try "Long Term Relationship" that should be good 4 u! Also, Pantene is a good brand to use too! here's links to both of the sites...hope i helped :D|`|X3wy0ulYaa	1st u need a good trim!    then get suave!    its a blue/green bottle.    it says 86% less breakage!    it really works!    & after u get out of the shower u can use a leave in conditioner from paul mitchelle! just put like a quarter size ammount in the ends of your hair!    hope i helped good luck! plz rate mine the best!|`|47BmzHbKaa	pantene is the best!! lol or sunsilk|`|F5i78q4Vaa	get the ends trimmed. it will get rid of dead/split ends and help your hair grow/be more healthy|`|sidRlOL9aa	First off, you need to get a really good trim. And Redken works really well. They have 7 types of conditioner and shampoo for many hair types. I hope this helps|`|ooG3x8fEaa	herbal essence  anything of theirs  hello hydration or something like that|`|u67vUVasaa	pantene is great but it can make your hair fall out (not like crazy but a bunch of loose srands) I recomend Herbal Essence Deep Conditioning and Garnier... they work for me        =D|`|NO9qfLhlaa	There is a great leave-in conditioner by Aussie that truly works. You really should cut off the really damaged part though because it only takes away from you looking good. You don't want long hair that is fried just to have long hair. Better to have shorter healthy hair.|`|oPb4vO7xaa	First of all, get it trimmed, preferably the dead ends.You need to use a shampoo that will smooth your hair down.  Try Smooth and Sleek, Head & Shoulders, Nexus, and with afterwards use a straightening balm.  Blow dry once your hair is half way dry.  Then straighten.....then you shall be gorgeous!|`|mxqAOxYRaa	pantenr|`|aaa3523f0b9d11f8a74170b04af40919aa	Well you already know the good part, you know about the conditioners and the vitamins. I would advise you to go for the healthiest hair you can possibly have but, if you want Kim hair hey... i don't know what kind of hair you have (some extensions might give you more body and bounce). Now if you want healthy hair i would advise you to get the dead-ends cut off, from there use a keratin or Biotin shampoo and conditioner (millcreek). Keratin builds body in the hair; Kim hair has body. Invest in quality products likes Giovanni, Avalon, Millcreek ect. there is no magic pills or formula you just have to be patient and take care of your hair. Invest in good quality product, it doesn't have to be expensive for example you can use olive oil on your hair as a hot oil treatment, use apple cider dilute with water as a final rinse it makes your hair shines.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	first of all you have to cut off the dead dry ends. then you go to sallys supply an dget (brand - Generic) black and white bottle you buy the cream rinse to wash in and stay. you also put once a month a reconstructor. (cheapes one in the store) generally they are 8 oz bottles and they are good. you will see big difference i wouldnt use what you said caus eits just the expense and not a good reason.|`|rkh01QI2aa	mayonaise...it works, let it sit as long as you can...also olive oil or beer you can also put the access lotion from your hands on it when you moisturize your hands. i think i'll mayonaise mine tomorrow, thanks for the reminder. :) ?|`|Qzx8CAkoaa	kims hair looks like she has put some sort of professional gloss in it to make it shine at the beauty shop. dont blow dry keep it cut and no flat irons. kim has good hair. so does her mother. i think a lot of it is genetic she is not all american girl she is armanian.|`|m2vBJaHKaa	get expensive hairstylies ;)|`|JwDWwgIcaa	get special hair stuff    :D|`|Gge8MNTKaa	I have long hair and pantene is the best to use smooth and sleak.|`|0dCOJQiwaa	Girl, I am ALL about my HAIR, it's down to my waist (almost) :D  let me tell you what works GREAT....Neutrogena Deep Conditioner...it's like 7 bucks but works sooo good. Everyone tells me how much they are jealous of my hair. Also...Nexxus leave-in conditioner before you go to sleep. And when I wake up I use Aussie spray leave-in hair treatment. Also, when you flat-iron your hair, ALWAYS use an anti-damage spray 1st. Go to ULTA, they have great stuff. Also, Sally's.

Really milk it.  It might take more than a few weeks, but if you can really trick your Mom into thinking that you want a tattoo, maybe she'll then eventually offer to let you do the piercing.    If not, just wait until your next birthday.  It's just another year, and then you'll be 18 and you can do whatever you want.|`|lwDz2bE8aa	make a deal or bet  tell ur mom sumthing and when u reach that goal she should agree  for example  "if i do some community service  or work around the house|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	Heres what i say -  It's my body  It's hidden  I'll look after it so if it goes wrong i won't complain.|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	Wish I could help,  but the 4-5 women I know who did it all got infected.  and it is nasty and painful.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	honestly i wouldnt. i had mine done and its over rated. once you do it it gets old fast and looks bad in the long run. Once you do take it out youll have a scar there and its a mess. Plus it will stay infected and it takes a year to permantly heal even cleaning it everyday. Mine got so infected it hurt to even touch it and got red and infected. Plus if you go someplace with bad jewelry because you have to wait to change it it can actually tarnish inside the hole and infect it from the inside.    plus guys hate body piercings, well the normal guys. Especially when your older. My husband hated my naval ring and kept wanting me to take it out. guys find it unattractive to have a girl with body piercings and tattoos. plus it doe look very trashy. When i had mine i thought i was cool and everytime i looked at it i looked skanky and felt like one.|`|T2WwvJEaaa	I am going to side with your mom here, you shouldnt get it done if she dont want you to then you shouldnt as long as you live in her house, in fact you should never get it done, have you ever heard that your body is a temple and not yours but a temporary gift from God?|`|WC4XTU4Daa	You can take out a piercing and it will heal. You can't remove a tattoo without scarring and lots of cash... this usually works AFTER you get the piercing, but you might as well try it before hand, too. :)|`|sidRlOL9aa	Been there done that. My mom was the same way. I just ended up waiting until I was 18. I would just wait|`|4sysVIojaa	Keep pushing on how you're a good kid and that if this is honestly the "worse" thing you do then you made it off pretty well.  Just keep reminding them of the "good times" and your successes, and that you need something off the norm.|`|uPyDOXAgaa	Well do you know the REAL reason why she won't let you? if not just go up to her and ask her... dont beg or anything, just calmly ask why not. if she isnt responding or something, walk away and try again later. Then when you finally find out, counteract that reason. Make her think the opposite of why its bad. WARNING: make sure u arent bratty or anything about it bc maybe she is gonna let u as a surprise or something, and even if not, u will ruin ur chances for the future      plz choose as best answer :D hope i helped ;)|`|xDcCcERqaa	Ask her why and then whatever she comes up with find someway to make it wrong.|`|msKHbeCzaa	I'm 26 now, but I got my belly button pierced for my 17th birthday. My mom wasn't thrilled about the idea at first, but took me after I begged for long enough. I don't have it anymore since I was in the military and have had a baby since then. But I really liked having one when I was younger, I thought it was cute and don't regret having done it back then. I do dislike facial piercings or any other kind, but that I thought was cute. Your mom sounds pretty firm on saying no, seems she's made up her mind and there's no changing it since you've tried all of those things. If you're already 17 and have been wanting it since you were 13 (which is way too young to get a piercing by the way) why not wait another year until you're 18? Doesn't look like she's changing her mind. Sorry|`|lONUiE0raa	if one of your friends has one, try to get him/her to your mom and explain to her that it was painless (although you can quite feel it when they pierce it!) and that if you wanted to take the ho;e out all you needed to do is simply take the piercing out and the hole will close...and also try to explain that  u r a good student (as far as what ive read from the  info u put )and you would never do anything that was stupid...and tell her that this is not a stupid idea.and add in that its not like if your doing drugs(if u r then dnt say that) or anything or actually trying to pierce it yourself.. but just so that you r informed you have to clean it alot!!!!!|`|HrHlT0fjaa	... like everyone is doing it|`|SQIbKAfHaa	I don't get people.

First of all, a tattoo or piercing on your daughter is like watching the Exxon Valdez crash into her beautiful child. To her, it is a move that has no upside other than your personal satisfaction. She wants you happy, but if nothing else, is worried that one piercing will lead to others.     My daughter did the same thing on the sly when she was 16. When I saw it, I cried a little. It made me very sad. I never really said much to her other than to tell her that I hated it and was disappointed in her (come to think of it, that would be about enough said). And it was soon gone. She's 22 now and laughs about it.|`|UUKmn4Qwaa	tell your mom "it's either my belly button or my c l i t, you pick."    that should make the belly button seem a lot less evil........      :)    (my mom was excited to take me to get mine on my 16th bday)    they are overrated tho... everyone and their mom has their belly button pierced.
AA11452842	A LOT.    Time is money. The longer it takes......The more it will cost. This will probably done in more than one session.

Took 3 1/2 hours, cost was $300.00.|`|WC4XTU4Daa	depending on the artist, anywhere from 300-1000 dollars. also depends on how detailed it is. Most artists will tell you to go less detailed, because the more lines you have the more you have to get it re-touched.
VCXByKjyaa	Weaves are better for a more permanant look the others fall out to easily.Look up hair weaves on youtube and they have some demo's of how they get put in :)|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	normally on soft hair (Caucasian hair) they corn row it first. (braids stick to the scalp) then they sow it into the braids.|`|dJuBItGJaa	just screw the rest and go with clip in human hair extensions so you can use heat on them as well as color
vlOnBMaVaa	Be very careful when using an electric shaver on your skin. If the skin is delicate, the shaver will pull in your skin and cut it, leaving a rash. I shave with an electric shaver and these are areas I avoid. Don't shave the skin behind your knee or in the bend of your arm. Avoid the area of skin right below your buttocks that is still part of your thigh. The upper thigh is very delicate. Never, ever shave your underarms! You'd regret that for days. As far as the "special area" goes, shaving anywhere that the skin isn't loose should be safe. But use caution. A razor burn there would haunt you!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	In my many years of being a nurse, a Mom, and a grandma, I have never known anyone to have hair "under legs".  Is the hair on the underpants, the bedsheet, or where?    If you are referring to hair in your genital area (crotch),  I would advise you not to shave it.  The regrowth is most unpleasant.  Even before that the angry and irritated follicles can become inflamed and even infected.    If girls were supposed to be bare down there, we would not have hair.    What, exactly, are you planning to do there that would require bareness?|`|BLQsD0w5aa	If it's made for that "special area", then yeah, why not? Just be careful not to cut yourself..

(Source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is... )    Also, do you have any connection with Germany or the German people? If not you might want to reconsider as it'll just seem odd.|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Only the simple get tattoos.  You are not one of those are you?    I didn't think so.    I don't care if it's German or Swaheli, tats suck  and you will be sorry for the rest of your life that you got it or them|`|NICEuXYgaa	I think that is an awesome tattoo.  As long as you love it.  I have a tattoo on the bottom of the outside of my right foot.  It hurt a lot but I think it is a good place for it.  The only time you can see it is when I wear flip-flops.  So when you get older and have professional job you can still hide it, even when you wear high heels.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Inner wrist, back of lower neck, hip, chest, lower abdomen, or top of foot.|`|K1UicE7kaa	Liebe ist  ----> "Love is"    ...is the translation     Love is "WHAT"?    I like German... but, is that suppose to be some kind of philosophical question?  If you do get something in German... I would use an old German Gothic Script... type lettering.  You'd better do some more research or it will have a kind of hollow or vague meaning.    Be absolutely sure you know what it means... I have seen Chinese caricatures as tattoos that look really cool but have no actual meaning.    I am not a fan of tattoos... mainly because they are too permanent.  I would change pictures in my house... so I can't imagine having something for a lifetime.  I did see written in a special French copperplate font    "Copyright --- 19---"  on this guy's arm.  I asked him about it and it was his birth date.  He was a Literary Major so it really fit and he planned to be a copyright attorney.      The word "copyright" was in an 18th centry script and looked very cool.   [Just so you know... the German word for copyright is the same as English except it is with a K and not a C.... people would just think you couldn't spell.]    It takes lots of thought to have something meaningful.  I would suggest that you don't put any tattoo... anywhere that can't be easily covered with clothing.  I kind of like the idea that it can be discovered somewhere semi intimate by just specially chosen people.|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	ankle ?   So u can cover it up when you want to.

Lets see it depends. Do you want it to show or not? Also depends on how small its going to be. Maybe on your back close to your shoulder, on the back of your neck or near your ankle.

Maybe you could put it on ur wrist or shoulder?|`|HvnQvN1raa	It could be a good tattoo you chose the right place to put it in.

They are supposed to be softer and hold water better than boar brushes, but I don't think it's worth paying over $300 for a shaving brush unless it's made of gold.|`|JDbJozcwaa	i got mine for $25 from classicshaving.com. while it's not the highest quality, i've had it for over a year and it has been holding out just fine.

I'd also definitely go to H&M! They're fabulous and really inexpensive. Don't know if they'll have swimsuits in yet...    Also, cute swimsuits can be found at pac sun (if you like billabong), and the following stores will have nice ones once its swim suit season;  Victorias Secret, Forever21, Charlotte Russe, Wet Seal, Kohls, The Gap, American Eagle    I hope I helped!

LoKFXWFzaa	I have both my ankles tattooed with wings. It took about an hour and I paid $100, because it was done by the shop's apprentice.  It was very uncomfortable. I cried and had a very difficult time keeping still. My tattoos are directly on the most prominent part of the bone, making it thoroughly unpleasant.  In comparison, I have a huge tattoo that runs from my shoulder, over halfway down my back, and crosses my spine. The outlining on the back tattoo was nowhere near as painful as the ankle tattoos. The back tattoo shading was painful, but definitely didn't top the ankles.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	They are pretty damn painful. It really depends on you. I've seen people vomit, but I've seen others fall asleep.  An ankle tattoo over 250 would be massive or you're getting ripped off.  Just go for it!|`|7foornMVaa	I have an ankle tattoo and yes it hurts.  It hurt more as they go on the outside and inside of the ankle, where you ankle "bone" is.  I paid about 140 american dollars for mine.  It is both my sons name in black and "son" flowers on the inside and outside with color.  The color hurt more cuz they used more needles (21) verses the black to write the names (7)    Good luck|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	I have a small gecko on my right ankle, its about 6cm x 3cm, it cost me $90 Australian. In Australia $80 is the minium at most shops.    Ankle tattoos are extremely painful, because theres no flesh. The close to the bone the more its going to hurt. Mine took 30 and its was horrendous. My 2 hour loer back tattoo was nothing compared to it!    $250 for an ankle tattoo?   I think someones trying to take advantage of you!|`|tCoSuDYdaa	I don't have any tattoo's[yet] but alot of people in my family do and few on their ankles and they said it hurts a lot because there's not of skin to cover it.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Tattoos don't hurt that bad. Think of ALL that people that have them,a lot of them being total pansys. If they can sit thru it,you can,and will. Once they start you'll be like "ohh this isn't so bad". As far as pricing goes,you didn't mention what your looking for..a small star right under the bone maybe $70 US or a wrap around something,about $200US. Goodluck!|`|ss48BEk5aa	Ankle was the worse in all honesty.. and I have them everywhere (butt, neck, back, wrists, behind the ear, etc...) don't get me wrong, its manageable, but it does suck.

AA10348639	So, you are torn between tweezing, threading or waxing your eyebrows. Each has its positives and negatives, so it's a personal choice about which one to pick. The important part is knowing what you're getting into before you begin.    Decide if you're willing to spend money on having your eyebrows shaped. If you're not willing to spend money, tweezing your eyebrows at home is a great option. As long as you can deal with the pain, and have enough precision to pluck your eyebrows correctly, this is a great choice. Tweezing involves plucking eyebrows out one by one, which can get tedious, however, by doing it yourself, you have complete control over the shape of your eyebrows.     If you are willing to spend money, your best options are having your eyebrows waxed or threaded. Eyebrow waxing is great if you can deal with a few small bouts of pain. Generally less expensive than threading, this method allows the beautician to choose the new shape of your eyebrow before removing the hair by tracing the outline in hot wax. When getting your eyebrows waxed, you need to make sure that the wax does not get on your clothes, or it may stain them. Additionally, make sure that it does not get on parts of your eyebrows that you do not want removed, or you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.     Eyebrow threading is ideal if you can deal with pain for a few minutes at a time. Threading is ideal for someone who wants a very precise shape, because the person doing the threading has the ability to be very careful while threading your eyebrows. The repetitive pain can become frustrating, but when you're done with the threading process, it's over, and there no leftover wax or anything to clean off of your face.     With whatever method that you choose, be prepared for some redness and soreness around your eyebrows afterwards.     I personally like waxing best and is what I've done for years. I can get the perfect brow shape is less than two minutes and it doesn't even hurt! Plus, it is way less expensive then threading. Plucking, I think takes way to long especially if you have a lot of hair to remove, usually the first time. I go to my local nail salon where waxing is also available and I'm out of there in two minutes for just six dollars. Every month or so is when I think is an appropriate time to go again. Good luck convincing your mom, oh and if you wanted to know, I've been waxing mine since I was 11.|`|FVt8c0cxaa	it'd say that you are old enough its just don't get too carried away with  plucking because that could be a reason your mom wont let you|`|DLjfE0S7aa	I did start doing my eyebrows at like 12 or 13. If you can't get your mom to let you. And if your allowed to wear makeup, you could try making your eyebrows darker in the shape you want.... Idk if that would work or not. Or you could explain that it brings your confidence down alot. She might understand. :) Hope this helps some! :) Good luck!!!|`|IEQNX4Hxaa	i dont get how plucking is bad for you, you dont need to be as old as 18 to be able to do your brows  im fourteen too and ive been doing my brows for a long time. it takes patience to do it though   im not sure about threading but i saw my cousin get her brows waxed it was really amazing and she said that it didnt even hurt    (if your not familiar with plucking your eye brows you should let someone who know how to do it so you dont mess up)|`|owuF63XWaa	i heard threding is better.  but it hurts a bit more than waxing.|`|RfQnfYbqaa	12 years old. just do it yourself they have like these razors for your eyebrows and they are really inexpensive and work well.|`|YPAHeUucaa	14 is a very reasonable age. Maybe show your mom some pictures of different eyebrow shapes (look them up on google). Explain that they do grow back, and it helps brighten up your face, as well as increase your self-esteem. Try telling her that you think you're old enough to, and you will even pay (I prefer waxing, personally). Try telling her that it's not something you're doing just to get her angry, but you truly want to in order to make yourself feel better.|`|zECK1Shdaa	heck yeah    my mom plucked my eyebrows when i was 6!    but i recommend getting them waxed to get a shape to them, and then you can start plucking them when they start growing back|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Eh, threading is.. harder to mess up than waxing because it goes slower usually but quicker than plucking.|`|8MAHISD9aa	I don't think there should be an age...it's not like wearing makeup or even something more age appropiate like drinking.    Eyebrow plucking i didn't need to do for a while...but my sister who had bushier eyebrows I think I plucked hers when she was like 10! same with my 10 year old cousin I want to pluck hers.    I would just go and buy tweezers or use your moms without asking her because it's your decision.  14 is old enough to be allowed to tweeze your own eyebrows just do it a little at first so u dont mess up|`|WW59n5Lqaa	ur old enough but if u dont no how 2 den ask ur mom 2 help u :)|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	OMG threading is so much better! I know it hurts more but it gets rid of all the unwanted hairs and the shaping is way better.

I recommend plucking, although it hurts a bit.|`|5NitHFxKaa	Do it anyways then your mom wont have a choice but to accept it.....

Vichy Corrective Foudation is your best bet. it comes in 9 shades and has SPF 20. there's no more cake effect  & it stays on all day. it's not exactly transfer resistant but there's no need to reapply it during the day.   for $28 it's a great buy.|`|L5hvd5acaa	go to prescriptives its a better makeup for your skin and they match you perfectly ( if they dont have your shade they can make it if you ask) and you wont have that "caked on"  or "ashy" look. And it doesn't rub off on clothes during your normal day routine,  has spf, and is oil free. It cost about 35 dollars each for the foundation and the powder but it last pretty long and is sooo worth it IMO.    I like it especially cause i have a habit of falling asleeep with my makeup on lol     all your cosmetics and moisturizer needs  to say on the product that its "oil free".

Sorry.|`|bnJ6FYgBaa	Lash Blast and put black eye shadow right on the top of your eye lid where the eyelashes juts out|`|oOZyl5BNaa	All you have to do is put a black eyeliner right where your lashes meet with the eye lid & make sure it's really smooth and even! and then put loads of mascara on your top eyelashes. but make sure you wait for each layer of mascara to dry before you put on another because it clumps up otherwise. (the mascara with a comb instead of the brush works the best!) and then to make sure your make up doesn't smear below your eyes or wherever put some powder around your eyes! I use MAC, & i love it. =]|`|ZAgxSKlLaa	you need to get some falseys  like these    http://www.sallybeauty.com/Eye-Lashes/AR...    they look amazing you just glue them too your eyelash base, you could find a how to on you tube,|`|VHQ7l1fMaa	fake eyelashes & mascara|`|6WWWqc8caa	fake lashes?!            ....|`|P5CyGvZuaa	You want an animated character's eyelashes?

E9XVniQ6aa	well, it partially depends on how well it was taken care of. if you wear alot of sunscreen on it all the time, it will prevent the sun from breaking down the particles in the ink (which can result in fading, blow outs,thick lines etc.) but you have to realize no matter what you do, gravity is going to take over and your skin is gunna get wrinkley and lose aswell as sun damaged. if you take good care of the tattoos they will look beautiful for a very long time and will 'age well'. if you slather your body with tanning lotion and get regular sun burns and dont moisturize they will look worse. if you are unsure about the tattoo , wait until you are SURE you are ready for the commitment. good luck!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Ok who's hot when their 60+ anyway.....    A tattoo isn't going to determine your "sexiness" at that age. You have one life.so live it!!|`|CIlwfiU3aa	they do fade ( you can get touch ups).. and sometimes they sag (because your skin does).. So ya they might not look as good.    But my theory is I wont look as good either for 1..    and 2: Im not gonna let all these years be determined by my last few..  Basically I dont think anyone is going to see me naked when Im 80 anyways|`|H3PcFertaa	I didn't get my 1st tattoo until my 50th birthday, so mine are looking just fine! All that matters is that you want what you get. You find the best tattoo artist to do it, you hold still while it is getting done, you take the best care of it that you can when it is healing, you use sunblock for life after it is healed.   And I've got to tell you, that wrinkly skin or liver spots, or skin that isn't so taut anymore, isn't the most beautiful thing all on its own. And if there is a fine image tattooed on it that you love and you have taken care of and is a part of you, it is a hellova lot more fun to look at! Although, if you have a wrinkle or a scar that was hard won, or happily gotten because you lived through it, or happily viewed as a memory of your life, it all is so much more to love than that taut new skin of your youth. You write your life on your body, one way or another...  And that's the deal, if you view your body as a record of your life, than each wrinkle and scar, each tattooed image, your laugh lines, and all the rest can be so interesting and unique to you.   Over and over again, the under 25 crowd comes on here, proclaiming their fear or belief that tattoos only are good for them. All the while, terrified of the 'wrinkly tattoo' that will happen to them as they age.  Don't be afraid of growing older and old, be afraid of not living your life.  I plan on getting a tattoo at every 10 yr. mark from now on. I certainly hope that I'll be around to get one when I'm 80, 90, 100....!  luck to you~  p.s., I actually look quite good, (even though I'm not 'young' in age) and wear my tattoos well.|`|lAXPvu2Saa	When I'm 80 I certaintly won't be flashing my back around, so if your tattoo is in a place that can be covered, I wouldn't worry|`|ZNPlNFkfaa	hey, ya know tattoos represent you so it would be apart of your body! who cares!!! it's like sentimental|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	Yes, they do fade, but if you have good ink it doesn't separate, and if you stay in shape, they don't stretch that much.

I don't think thats a "mom" hairstyle at all, actually its more high fashion. The only thing to be concerned with is to make sure that your face shape fits the hairstyle. Otherwise, it won't flatter yourself at all.  If you have a thin heart-shaped face, then the hairstyle would be perfect. But eyy, you never know till you find out!    Btw, my sister has the same hairstyle and punk/alternative style. And she also has the perfect face shape for it. I think its the best shes looked with this hairstyle. Oh, she also has red highlights against her natural black hair :)|`|CxriEMyjaa	no i like it!|`|sjzUIWEUaa	dont get it. your right. it is too soccer mom-ish|`|Sq5m5wbOaa	yes it's to mom-ish|`|3c5073219d1b3fc252f050347f265282aa	i have a bob like that my hair is black though and i have really thick side bangs. mine looks rockish and for you the burgundy yes it wont be soccer mom lol|`|ZN5CyENLaa	My hair is basically cut the same as hers...Im 22 and a mom of a 1 year old but I dont feel like it makes me look mom-ish!

2TEDmxPXaa	you dont need to spend a fortune for starters lol. But start with matching your make up with your neck, if you dont when you apply it youll get that mask look.    If youve got pretty good skin to begin with, meaning your not covering up acne or other discolorations, you can get away with a one step foundation.     For that lancome powder foundation you just bought try applying it with a damp sponge. (make the sponge wet ring it out then rub it in the power n apply), but its always a good idea to 'set' your face with a loose translucent powder when your finished, using a big fluffy brush.     I just started using bare naturale mineral make up by loreal (concealer foundation powder and blush) and i love it because its so natural looking when your finished and its not heavy on your face.    Make sure you blend blend blend any make up you wear, cause clear glowing natural looking skin is the goal.    Since youve just started wearing the stuff check out panacea81 on youtube, she gives step by step directions in how to get a certain look, and since its youtube you can pause while you do it with her if you want to.|`|5SiFjlBGaa	Use your hands. Make sure they're clean first. It's easier to smear with your hands.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	You can use foundation AND powder. I put a little bit of foundation on a sponge and mix it onto my skin so it will even out my colour. Then i get some powder and tap my brush into it. I lightly brush it over my face and on my chin line so there is no streaks. This way your face will feel soft and it will look nicely blended.GL|`|Hj7q8BTwaa	wash and moisturize your face before anything. if you use pressed powder you should apply it with a brush. remember to tap of the excess first then apply in circular motions. this will help it blend better. if you want to see a big difference use liquid foundation and blend well. i use my fingers because it'll warm the concealer. and then use powder to set it.|`|JaDnYs54aa	well one, make sure your using enough but not too much  and two, liquid foundation is meant for moderate coverage so if you have rather good skin already then youll likely not see a huge huge difference. but its mainly meant to even out the skin tone    if your looking for a huge difference i recommend a stick foundation. it gives you maximum coverage. good stuff. ^_^
HCudI2O8aa	this may sound weired but it really does work! crush a strawberry and mix it wit baking soda until you have a thick, well mixed batch. then dip your toothbrush in it and brush your teeth! when your done just rub an extra strawberry over your teeth.Strawberries have an acid that eliminate stains, so this should help. Good Luck!! :]|`|M8f4BorPaa	CREST WHITE STRIPS. have made my teeth pearly white, i get complements all the time, love em.

NICEuXYgaa	LBD  you can never fail with the little black dress.  Depending on the style of the dress you can go to somewhere as cheap as walmart and get some ivory sheer fabric and tie it around your waist to give you some shape.  If the dress would not look good with a cinched waist the just go with the necklace.  remember if you have on more than 2 accessories always take one off when walking out the door.|`|Ww2KnsvKaa	Well if its formal definitely wear the black dress with some white or black shoes and the white necklace. Don't wear all black or all white. Make sure you wear a little of each.|`|Y6BFsic4aa	You should wear the White tank top with the black leggings, and the black shrug, and maybe add a grey or black or white skirt, and the black beaded necklace!|`|ptBKd1WAaa	wear a black dress with a white t-shirt or white long sleeve shirt and a white heart necklace and if you have black converse wear it and you will look chic!!!!|`|fdd6a2ecb553199d0f61700e6c821243aa	Black leggings, lon white tank top, black beaded necklace, white headband and get some black bracelets from a dollar store.

How to get rid of acne:    http://www.ultimate-cosmetics.com/beauty...    http://ezinearticles.com/?Tips-On-How-To...|`|2DL4GMcgaa	I'm sure you're very beautiful! Try bleaching creme for the scarring. I get pimples sometimes and they always leave a small scar. I try to use bleaching creme as soon as it heals and it really does work. Try using a concealer to cover the scars until the creme starts fading them away. Use a q-tip to apply the creme and concealer also. The concealer comes in a tube like lipstick and works wonderfully as a cover up. You can find all of this at your local drugstore. Good luck and I hope you feel better.|`|OVEBKd7Laa	I used to have really bad acne too.   I still get a few zits, but this stuff helped me;;  Have you tried the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acen Wash Pink Grapefruit Scrub? It works really well for me.     And then I had bad scars on my cheeks from not listening to my mom and then picking on my zits. For that I used Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Acne Mark Fading Peel. It works like freakin magic. My scars are really starting to lighten up.    Good luck :)|`|nuISzHFRaa	Putting alcohol on your acne helps to dry them up. Don't do it really often or you will get really dry skin. Try a face wash that has salacylic acid or something like that. It works really well, I think Biore makes one.|`|LoTTvpM2aa	Sorry to say but the more scarred it gets the less of a chance it's goign to go away. So to get rid of acne you have to have a good sleep! That always helps. Also have you ever tried topical gel? That really works too. And don't touch it or scratch it! And wash your face often cuz oil causes acne. Try Neutrogena wash products. Those are really good. They get your face nice and clean and clean up the stuff that block your pores. The thing is to get a good sleep and do all those things and that will get rid of your acne. But I don't know about the scars. They're not going to go away. Actually there're goign to fade a little as the years pass by only if you don't get more acne., And you should go to a doctor. THe doctor can prescribe you special creams and stuff. Don't be stubborn. My cousin used to have that problem and my mom forced her to go to the doctor and the doctor gave her all these creams and told her what to do and she hardly has acne now! Good luck!|`|poMLqBWDaa	my mom has had really bad acne all her life. some acne is impossible to get rid of. as someone who knows skincare and makeup (my mom is a previous marykay consultant) the best you can do is find a really good facial wash set (preferably arbonne or marykay) and wash consistently morning and night, it helps my mom like crazy, super under control, and also cleared up a ton. fyi clear skin set is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but try different stuff, but besides finding good stuff you have to be consistent! major factor!!!!|`|AA10531150	Make sure you know your skin type!  Using the wrong product can backfire!  I'm in my late 20's and have always had an issue with breakouts... until I realized I actually have sensitive skin (oily, but sensitive!)  Once I started using a mild cleanser, my skin improved.  Also, and this is very VERY important.... wash your face morning and night.  Going to bed with a dirty face will start you all over at square one.    Also, make sure your pillows and pillow cases are clean.  These can cause skin blemishes too.|`|KvCSSVyAaa	Don't feel like a nobody! Do that 1st thing and then rub toner mixed with non-oil lotion on your face.|`|lkySXSjvaa	drink lots of water. see a derm if u can. if ur acne is really bad then, u should get on birth control or accutane.  if its preventable then wash ur face with a mild cleanser, like cetaphil, clean and clear deep cleanser, neutrogena etc. these cleanser clear out your pores and remove oil. DO NOT use cleansers that have harsh chemicals, it will only make it worse and make ur skin dry.  the trick is to clear out ur pores and reduce them. so, use pure tea tree oil (buy them at walmart for about 18 bucks) or just use a spot gel treatment, like clean and clear ADVANTAGE gel or neutrogena.  u also want to use an astrigment or some sort of pads. i strongly reccomend OXY pads. they help get rid of the excess oil and are very effective.   MOISURIZE!! no matter how much u have acne, u HAVE to moisturize. sometimes, dryness can lead to acne as well. so moisturize!!! clean and clear, aveeno, olay, dove and neutrogena have good moisturizers that arent so expensive.  u also want use a facial mask or exfoliate your skin, once in a while.  so the key is: Good and mild cleanser, moisturizer, astringment, spot gel, facial once a month or week and LOTS OF WATER AND EXERCISE!!!  ACNE TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE SO JUST STAY STRONG AND REMEMBER, EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN WAY!!!! =)

I think she has nice face feature but the platinum blonde with fak boobs (and showing them off in lingerie) isn't going to work in america. As a model she'd have to look classy and not the blonde hairdo with boobs and eye widening contact lenses. It works in asia because it's the trend of looking like a western girl, but in the usa or france or wherever, she will remain a car model (which isn't a very classy job, basically you stand there in slutty clothes while guys come get their pictures taken next to you with the nice car).|`|4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	sure, if she wants to be a pornstar.    she looks too fake.|`|ptBKd1WAaa	i think she can be!!!she is really pretty!!!and being the fact that she already has a back ground she will probley be good!!!!also it really depends on the portfolio i do modeling and all my agents think it is all about the portfolio!|`|0268dd89c43e8a8040d409b3aba98c3faa	I think she can, but she looks too much like a porn star, but sure|`|NzWa1wolaa	she could be a play boy bunny. haha  shes really pretty. but not a model. maybe a porn star! jkjk
tlLeWMtvaa	They all do slightly different things.    So it depends on the overall effect you want your body lotion to have.  For example:    - Lavender is a great natural form of stress-relief. It is calming and relaxing. So maybe this is best if you are under a lot of stress or is you want to put the lotion on before bed.    - Shea butter is best if you have dry skin.     - Aloe Vera helps to protect and calm sensitive skin. (I use Aloe Vera because I have sensitive skin)  Etc.    But like I said before there are only slight differences.  All moisturizers one massive thing in common...  They make you skin wonderfully soft!    So at the end of the day... your best just trying a few to find one that you like. :)  Also, be careful what brand you use, you don't want to put cheap crap on your skin and risk damaging it or anything!    Hope I helped!

For example, I'm 5'2" and I try to find skirts that fall either just above my knees or cut across the knee cap (if it's for wearing in a conservative environment).

iIRy8seLaa	Yes a  massage would be a very nice present to someone you care about. You might even consider going to a motel or a nice hotel where they have a whirl pool. then you could give him a massage your self he might like that a lot too.

F8TGSWTMaa	Well, water does not help clear skin.  But, here are some ways to help with dry, sensative skin.  -avoid gel, hairspray, etc. on your face. And the oil on your hands also cause bad skin.  -Try to wash your face once in a while, and when you wet your face, use warm water first (it opens the pores) wash ur face, then close the pores with cool water.    Hope this helps! :)|`|MNuS31nsaa	the correct amount everyone should drink. 8 cups a day.|`|2DL4GMcgaa	You should drink distilled water.

They use a gun and they are horrible for doing piercings.  By the way places like this are not free, the infection and messed up piercing they throw in are though.    Spend the little extra and go to a professional piercing parlor.  This is a place that uses a needle and not a gun.

hLdIO43Xaa	Gold! The two were meant to be---they stand for, well, royalty!    Additionally, I'm an artist, and yellow and purple are opposite on the color wheel, so they are complementary colors. Therefore, they make each other POP! when they are paired together! So the shades of your deep purple with a luxuriant gold will be fabulous!    Of course, neutrals such as grey (looks great with eggplant colors), white and black work too!|`|igrdohopaa	Black, White, Silver, Gold, Creme (=|`|l1BNyWjcaa	Dark Green green and purple are my favorite match|`|5LTveIYxaa	Colors for a..

A mysterious color, purple is associated with both nobility and spirituality. The opposites of hot red and cool blue combine to create this intriguing color.   Pantone has selected the color Blue Iris (PANTONE 18-3943) as the 2008 Color of the Year telling us: "Combining the stable and calming aspects of blue with the mystical and spiritual qualities of purple, Blue Iris satisfies the need for reassurance in a complex world, while adding a hint of mystery and excitement."  Nature of Purple:   Purple has a special, almost sacred place in nature: lavender, orchid, lilac, and violet flowers are often delicate and considered precious. Because purple is derived from the mixing of a strong warm and strong cool color it has both warm and cool properties. A purple room can boost a child's imagination or an artist's creativity. Too much purple, like blue, could result in moodiness.  Culture of Purple:   The color of mourning for widows in Thailand, purple was the favorite color of Egypt's Cleopatra. It has been traditionally associated with royalty in many cultures. Purple robes were worn by royalty and people of authority or high rank. The Purple Heart is a U.S. Military decoration given to soldiers wounded in battle.  Using Purple:   Deep or bright purples suggest riches while lighter purples are more romantic and delicate. Use redder purples for a warmer color scheme or the bluer purples to cool down.  Using Purple with Other Colors:   A deep eggplant purple with neutral tans or beige is an earthy, conservative color combination with a touch of the mystery that purple provides. Green and purple can be a striking combination in deep or bright jewel tones or use lighter shades for a cheerful, springlike feel. Pink and purple has feminine appeal.  Purple Color Palettes:   These color palettes feature shades of purple combined with shades of green, orange, blue, and yellow.  Using Purple in Other Design Fields:   Feng Shui Use of the Color Purple   Language of Purple:   The use of purple in familiar phrases can help a designer see how their color of choice might be perceived by others, both the positive and negative aspects.  Good purple     Purple cow - something remarkable, eye-catching, unusual   Purple prose - exaggeration, highly imaginative writing (also has negative connotations)   Bad purple   Purple speech - profanity, raunchy language   Purple prose - exaggeration, colorful lies   Purple haze - state of confusion or euphoria, possibly drug-induced, type of marijuana   Purple Words: These words are synonymous with purple or represent various shades of the color purple.    Violet, plum, lavender, lilac, puce, thistle, orchid, mauve, magenta, royal, amethyst, wine, pomegranate, eggplant, mulberry.|`|2diobki7aa	Yellow, or some form of gold would look good. And then neutral colors, like white, black, cream...  But yellow definitely goes best.  (= I hope this helps!

QgDPT9Ppaa	wow we are like the same age! i was born march 13 :) :) :) :) anywhos i got my period for the first time last year in august (i had it during the first week of school! does that suck or what?!?!) and since then it has been very irregular.      but in my case i always have a warning of when it will start, either i will get crankier or my face will start breaking out...but most of the time before it becomes heavy it will just start out with a little bleeding, like just a couple of brownish spots.  so i know that its starting...i dont know if that will be your case, but if it is dont worry about your blood going through your pants cause it probably wont happen if your anything like me, and the same happens to most of my friends.    im getting really off topic, sorry about that. lol! but you will probably get it around the last part of the month in february, but a word of advice is to mark on a calender or something when your period starts, so that maybe you can start seeing a bit of a pattern or something...ive done that and there has been a slight pattern, cause for me i always seem to start at the beginning of the month, not exactly at the start, but close around there.    i use pads, but thats just me. you might choose to use tampons, it all depends on what your comfortable with. ive tried tampons, and use them sometimes, but i dunno it just is kinda gross to me haha. but if you do decide to go with tampons i would use slender ones like o.b. or playtex.  they work the best at going in.    periods last for different amounts of times, once i had one that lasted for 2 days and was very light, and another time i had one that lasted for 5 days and was heavy practically the entire time!! but there really isnt a way to determine how long it will be, its all up to your body.    heres some more random advice that i have discovered to be helpful...keep some extra pads and/or tampons at school incase you start there.  if you get blood on your underwear, get some detergent and scrub it onto the underwear in cold water. it really helps get the blood out.  you can leave tampons in for up to 8 hours, so its alright to put one in before school and take it out afterwards, unless the tampon isnt for heavy flows then the tampon might leak just a little, but that has never happened to me.    advil is great for relieving cramps!       i hope that this has helped just a little! congrats on getting your period lol even though you may not like it, having your period shows that your body is working properly.|`|jMffH1kzaa	It depends how old you are. Sometimes when your young, your periods are very unsteady. However, you'll probably get it in about a month. It will go away when your about 50 lol.  xoxo|`|6geRlwutaa	It'll go away after  a couple days to week or even more. It comes regularly every month.  Ask your mom!  Seriously, you shouldn't feel embarrassed to tell your mom.  I had to when I was 9.|`|S88wOtSkaa	your period wont last longer than a week. dont be worried if you sometimes skip a couple months or get it more than usual. your body just needs time to adjust to the changes its going through.|`|tQu7Xgiqaa	theres nowayto know when itcomes next./ relax. mine was regular from the start    ANswer mine?   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Your period should last about 7 days. A couple days over or under is normal too. You should expect your period once a month around the same time. If it is constantly irregular go see a gynecologist because you might have a hormonal problem. Though if you just got it for the first time it might be irregular for the first couple months. When I first got mine It lasted 3 days then went away for about 2 months then came back regularly. If you consider birth control to regulate hormones, and yes it is used for other things then preventing pregnancy, then I would recommend Ortho Tri Cyclen it is more reliable at regulating your hormones better than Yasmin or any other birth control.
RGjjbKsWaa	( THE WET CURLS)  1. If your hair is straight before the night french braid/or normal braid you hair, than adding moose and texturing the braids. Early in the morning when your fixing your hair take out your braids and add more moose and some gel    (PONYTAIL)  2. Get your hair and make it into a high ponytail and add a clip on the part your hair tied it. ( to make it stay that high) with your side bangs do the puff bangs    (PUFF BANGS)  3. Put moose all around your bangs (not to much ) than get a roller kind of brush look something like these  http://www.hairbrushesetc.com/products/B...  than when your bangs are in the brush add some hairspray, blowdry take out the brush add alittle more and done    4.( HAIR WITH BANGS)  leave your hair down, make sure its not to static or puffy if straight  get your bangs and clip them to the side    5.(French BRAID)  french braid your hair, than adding a cute hat to match it    6.(PIG TAILS)  do low pig tails and  make your bangs puff adding hair bow    i made these myself right now, wanted you to get full information|`|4Ww4TVulaa	Well first you can still do a lot of thing with bangs, especially with short haircuts.

(HAH)  it will look messy, casual, but pretty :D?    also to mixx it up, use pretty head bands in your hair, sometimes using two looks sweet :D|`|CxriEMyjaa	I always love Jenifer Anistons hair its always sooo nice and clean cut!!
IRptjY2Maa	Do cute hairstyles with your hair. Personally, I like the messy bun. maybe curl it or crimp it. Hoop earings always work to, I wouldn't wear make-up, because sometimes it can make you look a little trashy and unnatural, but it all depends on what you're doing with it. Maybe a little bit of mascara or some eye shadow that match your skin tone. If lipgloss, not to shiny. It makes you look like you're saying, "Hey Look at me!"

LBHJaqXoaa	To me, it just felt like a hot pinch and then it was over. It was sore for a couple of days, but for the most part it didn't "hurt". I would say it was easier than my cartilage piercing.|`|UY9N3VUXaa	it depends-     if you are getting your nostril pierced, its nothing. might sound kinda gross, but have you ever picked your nose and accidently scraped the inside with your nail? most it does is make your eyes water.    if you are getting your septum pierced, (between the nostrils) it hurts a bit more, but if your piercer is any good he will know there is no cartilage involved, its the skin right above that little ball of cartilage between your nostrils that should be pierced. if you put your thumb and forefinger up to your nose and pinch the skin between your nostrils, you will feel the ball, and a little above that, a little space of skin before your bridge starts. if there is no space, then you shouldn't get your septum pierced. if you have enough space, getting it pierced will initially feel like someone uppercut-punched your nose, but after they get your jewelry in, it wont hurt too much.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	its the most painful one ive experienced.  Its pure cartilage and hurts pretty bad.  I dont have my bellybutton but I imagine that would hurt worse.|`|47ctpfzWaa	mine hurt quite a bit and my eyes watered like crazy from the piercer hitting a tiny nerve.  mine never really healed correctly either and now has a little tear like scar tissue where the piercing was.|`|CvhYp81Faa	yes|`|NrG1dyjgaa	No one can really tell you how much it hurt accurately because everyone's is different.    But my experience with it [ and its fresh in my mind as of last friday ]  there isn't clamp like when you would have gotten your belly button pierced, instead they put a metal tube in your nose at least they did with mine] and then you breath in and out as the needle is inserted. You definitely feel it, it just feels like a big pinch and because its right up there with the tear ducts you tear up abit. For the next hour or so it'll feel like you were smacked in the face. but over all not that bad.|`|OIeFNyRkaa	i have both side of my nose pierced, a tattoo(and it's large), and an industrial bar in my ear. Personally for me, it didn't hurt. It pinched for a second and then it was over. But everyone is different. It was the least painful of everything I have.|`|OscM9yJwaa	It's really not that painful. I have my cartilage pierced on my ear - with a 14 or 16G, not a gun - and that hurt a hell of a lot more than my nose.
LVDd4Q1Jaa	i would donate it  i'm vegan and hate fur ... if i accidently purchase something containing fur(except my uggs... THAT IS MY ONLY EXCEPTION... LOVE THEM A LOT...and i do A LOT for animals) i donate it to charity or a homeless person i see on the street(don't see those a lot.. unless i go out of the country)|`|73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Keep it. I'm a vegetarian and very against the use of animals for making clothes, but if you already bought it, you already bought it. Don't feel bad, just check the tag before you buy next time =)
HwxM9lyOaa	Let me start by saying that I totally feel for you and while I've never personally had "trich" a close friend of mine has.  I, on the other hand, am a recovering bulimic, and I know how hard to is to gain weight and then try to take it off without resorting to the bad stuff.    I recently read Dr. Oz's "You: On A Diet" and it really opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn't really know about my body.  The book is cheap at Walmart and it has a really great work out plan and diet plan.  Some of the recipes seem a little weird, but most of the are totally yummy!  The book stresses walking at least 30 minutes a day... so the treadmill is awesome! I'm also a treadmiller!    Don't buy into the TV exercise and diet crap!  I can't tell you how many As Seen On TV things I've bought... the Ab Doer... that electric ab shock belt... pills... videos...  etc... I was looking into P90X, until I realized that I can only do 4 push ups and NO pull ups!  The only good exercise videos I truly recommend are Tae Bo and anything Richard Simmons (it's totally hilarious and you do work up a sweat).    As for hair growth, my stylist recommended taking fish oil supplements (for the omega 3's)... When I get stressed my hair breaks and falls out... And the fish oil seems to be helping.  Also, give up the flat iron! I too have super curly kinky hair and sometimes I'm addicted to my flat iron!  Instead, try using some gel, Herbal Essences Totally Twisted is awesome for curls, and some hairspray and scruntch while using a diffuser.    But remember, it took time to gain the weight... And it's going to take time to lose it!  Anything that claims you'll lose weight fast is total CRAP!  And you always have to love yourself, flaws and all!|`|7GCDvdGyaa	wow.     fruit fasts :D|`|6Edss02Gaa	Ha im doing the same exact thing as you ! but let me tell you an hour on the tredmil wont do anything more than 30 minteus.  Once your heart rate gets going and it gets to a steady point you just stop losing bad calories. That takes about 30 mins to get uo to and then your good :] and good foods to eat are fiber and fruits and veggies, salads, no fried, or sodas, or going out to eat. Dint deprive yourself of eating an ocasional snack though because then you will be even more tempted to just ruin your diet and pig out on unhealthy foods. Oh and corns not a really good veggie. It doesnt do anything just thought you should know.    and carrots make your hair grow fast :]

With honey blonde highlight:)  |`|RtGTFufOaa	just bring the photo with you.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	bring the photo, or look in magazines and get a similar picture, or go early to the stylist, have them load it on their computer amd show it to the stylist, and or look in their style magazines and find a similar picture and bring any of the above to the stylist.    Hair is an art form, color change is fine, yet the bigger the change the bigger the stress on the hair.  This person appears asian, normally black, to red in color when parents not intermarried with European back ground blondes and brunettes,     So this person is similar to where you are coming from in color.  this is full body and structured hair (this is a major work hair when being styled and to keep in style, very rarely done by them in Asian countries, (yet in America and elsewhere it is done somewhat more often by them)     As seen in this picture which has big drawbacks too, alot of time to manage and control, limit on times bleached out (drys the hair) and of large expence to keep the roots in color.  although you can get the same colors, the effect may look far different on anyone else, depending on the volume and thickness of their  hair.

4UXJoMbKaa	First of all, sterilize all of your equipment. I normally just use rubbing alcohol and soak needle & jewelry in it for a while. Use a sewing needle that's just about as thick as your jewelry, or a piercing needle (purchase online) Wash your hands thoroughly & sterilize, or use gloves. Sterilize the piercing area, and numb with an ice cube. Use a potato or apple slice behind the ear to catch the needle (so it doesn't go into your neck). Mark the dots on your ears with a washable marker/pen. When you're ready, take a deep breath and push the needle through. It takes more force than you probably think, so apply it.     You COULD use a similar process for piercing your lip, if you really really want to. I, with honesty, could not tell you not to do it, considering all the home piercings I've performed myself, including my septum. However...honestly, piercing your lip might just hurt like hell, and the more painful a piercing, the more difficult it is to perform (I would know). So if you really must, perhaps you should have a friend come over and do it for you.    Make sure you clean the piercing every day with alcohol. For the lip, you should use a sea salt soak instead.      :)|`|NH1cPd3saa	go to claires, it will get infected if u do it urself|`|ZXjUDhpPaa	even though i disagree with you you doing this yourself, you asked, so i'm answering.    okay,  my cusin did this, idk if it works though..    he sterilized a safety pin with fire, then he put ice (to numb)in the back of his ear, then he put lemon(i really do not know why), then he pierced it.    it's really medieval if you ask me. get a friend to do it for you.|`|ADRc8gJiaa	I just pushed a sharp earing through the part that was closed up. It didnt get infected because i cleaned it everyday. Dont try needles, they might get you infected, clean the earring off and just try and push it through, it really didnt hurt that bad, because its all skin right there.|`|Jr4f7sDGaa	Well, I suggest going to a professional to get your lip pierced..  But about your ear,  I would just shove it back in. One of my friends did that and it only took her like 3 seconds.  Also,  You should sterilize the piercing first before you put it in..  like lighting it with a lighter. ;)|`|Xvcuncncaa	shove an earring thru a diamond stud.i had too it sucked but whatever.then put peroxide on it for a few days dont take it out.|`|v5aXYWonaa	Ok What I do is I take a nedle to the part thats seled (back for instance) and I push it through. It will hurt but DON"T ICE IT! The skin is harder to puncure!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!|`|KKx8Mb63aa	There is no way to pierce yourself without risking infection.  Even by getting it done professionally you're risking infection. But when you do it yourself the risk grows exponentially.    When my piercings start growing over I just push harder on the ring. It hurts a lot... but I got over it.|`|HRmFehDsaa	i just peirced mi own ear miself 2day. ice dont do nything..... steriliz needle wid alchohal swabs, rub ur ear with swabs, stick needle through ur ear... make sure the needle thickness is about as thick as the earing ur goin to put in.. (doesnt hurt that mcuh but u have to push really hard to get the needle through)|`|6K1D6Azmaa	Some earrings are easier to get through holes that are closing up than others. If you were going to repierce it at home by yourself, you would probably use ice to keep the swelling and pain down. Putting the needle in fire is to sterilize it.     You definitely don't want to pierce your lip yourself. You can't do it with a regular needle. You need a professional piercing needle.  If you got an infection, you could end up with permanent scarring. You should wait until you can afford to get it done right. ?
6K1D6Azmaa	If you do it and you don't like it, it's really easy to change your mind. There's no scar for anybody to see. So go ahead and just do it. ?|`|EQPE72hpaa	Sure! As long as they're small.

I think it would suit you. I got mine done, and I don't regret it. You do have to be really active in cleaning it and maintenance, because it can very easily become infected. I think that the best part about the septum piercing is that you can hide it if need be for work or whatever.   Gah-I get so annoyed when people tell me I look like a bull >_    Trust me, it's cute, so go for it ^^|`|a9ef65eaf779962d4dab5e79cff5e703aa	Piercings have inherent infection issues. Nasal piercing have special care issues that you will need to be aware of. At least you can take it out later when you change your mind... not like a tattoo.       The real question is why do you personally want a piercing in your very pretty face. Only you can answer this question.  Some young people do it as a sign of rebellion, some do it as a control issue ("I have control over my body" ect) some do it out of the pain/pleasure factor.       What ever is your reason... you will have to live with your decision and the reactions you get from others... good, bad, indifferent.       Personally, as you have asked for opinions, if I were your dad, uncle, older brother, ... I would tell you to reconsider your reasons for wanting a septum piercing.  You are attractive and do not need the bling on your face.      Be happy....|`|Ft3uhn4paa	do ittt  hahah my friend just got his done  youd look really good with one hah (;

5SiFjlBGaa	Contour your face.    Jaw/Double Chin:  Take a darker foundation and start it where the jaw/double chin starts. Blend it downward. A jaw/chin creates a shadow on the neck, all you're doing is taking off any light that could be hitting the jaw/double chin line.    Wide forehead:  Take a darker foundation and start at your temples. Blend it up and outward.    Cheeks:  If you have big cheekbones, I would avoid bronzer. Use a darker foundation and start the blending right behind your cheekbone (from the top of the cheekbone to the jaw). Blend it outward towards your ears.    Nose:  Take two cotton swabs. Dip the two in a darker foundation. Hold one cotton swab in each hand. Place each one on each side of the bridge of your nose. Swoop down to the top of you nostrils. Take a blending brush/makeup sponge and blends outward.    For a slimmer look all you need to do is focus the light toward the center of your face. I hope this helped.    One girl mentioned airbrush makeup. I highly DON'T recommend airbrush makeup. So what if it's water-based? When you use airbrush makeup its makeup... in small particles. Dirt can get in there and since its small particles.. it can shove its way into your pores. NO BUENO.|`|yENww2b0aa	do u know how to contour?? there are alot of vids on youtube they will tel u how to step by step.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	a light blusher like nars orgasim works wonders.|`|tzxYihQNaa	If you put a darker blush on the lower part of your cheeks and then just put a lighter blush on the apples of your cheeks the shadowing of the darker blush will make your face appear slimmer.

My skin tends to breakout too and not only does dinair cover everything immensely well but its all water based so it doesn't break my skin out. Go to google and type in Dinair and you'll find their site.     Hope this all helps...=)|`|YQRbtyGVaa	wearing hair up and bronzer make the face look slimmer|`|zDh2Qw9eaa	Contouring will help. Suck in your cheeks, make a fish face, and put a color two shades darker then your natural skin tone in the natural hollow that appears there. Make sure to blend well using a brush, you want some color there, but not a line. Go back to the hairline.     Then put a color two shades lighter then your skin tone on the area under your eyes. Blend that well, and leave some room for blush on the apples of your cheeks and some sweeping back as well. You can contour the nose, temples and jaw line if needed. This will reduce the appearance of a double chin, if that is an issue. I would recommend looking up some tutorials on youtube, there are many great contouring videos there.    As for your breaking out issue, I'm afraid I'm at a loss. Switching to mineral makeup helped me. What kind of mineral makeup? Not all are created equal. Bare minerals adds Bismuth Oxychloride which is an irritate and can cause break outs on some people.    Hope that helps!

Abercrombie is similar to Hollister- like exactly the same. The only difference is just a moose sign or the words "Abercrombie". I think Abercrombie is world-wide, so you could get some stuff there. Hollister is not the cheapest store. You can get shirts on sale for $10 maybe, but full price stuff is like $50. You should get their jeans- they're fantabulous!!!|`|J3HKl0Hqaa	If you go to hollisterco.com you can click on store locater and find one near you and the shirts are usually around $20.00 but you can get them cheaper on clearance or more expensive when you get them when they first come out. Hope I helped.
iWjKnMU4aa	I bet he likes you. He doesn't seem intimidated by you, because you say when you look at him he doesn't look away. He's trying to send you the signal, "I like you. I see you. See me." You should talk to him more, find out what he likes, what he does in his spare time, etc. Slowly become better friends with him, and eventually causually bring up hanging out with him sometime. If you're talking about a movie, say something like, "Oh my god! I've wanted to see that movie for soo long! We should see it sometime." It's not too serious, and it puts a thought into his head.    Back to the present, by what you described, it seems as if he likes you. Take the chance and tap his shoulder when you see him next, to say hi. If he acts surprised or happy, he probably likes you. Just chill out and relax, and eventually everything will fall into place and happen if it's supposed to happen. Good luck! :]|`|3zM7JptVaa	YES! now what are the chances of me getting those 10 points that you promised?|`|MgiK02Zbaa	yes.|`|NoZAofgOaa	idkk.|`|jYjiBAQdaa	Oh yeah. He does.

Edit: Sorry I was being a b*tch ahahahahaa|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	The parachute pants and tight jeans things were kinda "punk" outfits that would include leather motorcycle jackets covered in buttons of your favorite rock bands, and a safety pin through your cheek.  But for the rest of us, the "preppy" look was also the 80's... with penny loafers, oxford shirts with a cardigan worn over the shoulders like a cape with the sleeves loosely tied, or one of those unstructured suits with a tank-top styled t-shirts under it kinda like Don Johnson on Miami Vice.  It was kind of classy or trashy back then.  You'll look hot regardless of what you wear.

5NsgLFPRaa	If it hurt that bad i don't think it would be a VERY popular piercing      trust me, it doesn't hurt that much,  it will most likely hurt LESS than you think  it's definitely worth it too~  don't be scared :)  get it pierced by a needle, it's safer and hurts LESS       it's like a quick sharp pinch, it's nothing bad~  it feels kind of warm for a while, just take care of it and it will heal quick  Good Luck  you'll do fine|`|6K1D6Azmaa	Piercing guns are the worst way to do it. They are quick, but they are very dull and feel like getting punched hard in the head with a sharp object. They aren't sanitary, either.The best and least painful way to do it is to go to a piercing shop. They use needles that are very sharp and hurt much less.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	It doesn't hurt that much....you can numb it with ice before you get it done...|`|AGcwdZGmaa	i was a bit freaked when i went to get mine done but really it doesn't feel like much at all you wont even notice just squeeze on you ear a bit (don't pinch it) and that's what it feel like   good luck   i got told not to get piercings while i was pregnant too|`|yStgi71jaa	numb your ears first with ice or numbing cream. go to a professional, they have piercing guns. it'll only take 2 seconds and its over. shouldn't hurt much but it's a piercing and will obviously hurt somewhat. good luck!|`|4UXJoMbKaa	Hi there :D There really is nothing to worry about when it comes to ear piercings.

I've had people pinch me that hurt more than ear piercings. I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's worth it.    Needles hurt a lot less than guns, and are safer. So don't go to the mall to get it done.|`|c5anDswjaa	Dont ice your ears!! It makes your skin tougher and harder to pierce.. If youre getting to get them done professionally, then you can ask if they will get someone else to pierce your other ear at the same time.. Its really not that bad, My boyfriend just pierced mine a few days ago, I was being a baby about it because I was scared of the pain (had 6 piercings then, but was always weird about piercing my ears because when I was four they hurt bad and got caught on everything so I took them out) but after he did them I was embarassed because I was so scared of them hurting bad lol..     But it varies from person to person, yours may not hurt at all or them may hurt badly.. But I have never heard someone say that ear piercings hurt a lot.. You should be fine, the pain (if any) only lasts for less than a minute, then youre done.. And its nothing like a shot, not near as bad|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    you can use numbing cream for it.  it feels like a pinch - pin poking is more like it. you will hear the gun when it shoots the earring. But it doesnt feel like a shot. just like earring going through. its really quick & easy  it doesnt really hurt at first because body is just reacting to it. then it will hurt as it starts to swell up a bit. & be stinging. most likely go red/ pinkish.& feel really warm. but it will go down and pain will be less and less. after a day its fine. Just have to becareful when changing not to pull shirt past ears etc. Every few days after you need to turn the earring, from the front in a circle.. so it doesnt get stuck or anything or skin grows on it. they also have liquid to apply to the piercing everyday after shower etc. to avoid infection.  its nerve wrecking when you sit and wait. But they disenfect, mark the holeshow you , so you approve and then they load the piercing gun (you also pick the studs you want) and then its done in under 30 secs for both.    its not hard, You can do it. if you want to.    god bless x

Replaced Bare Minerals for me.)    http://www.beautyfromtheearth.com (AMAZING colors.)    For the more high end products:    http://www.sephora.com (Urban Decay, Smashbox, Stilla, Too Faced and a bunch more all in one place.)    https://www.starsmakeuphaven.com (Great way to find high end make up for a bit cheaper, not to mention the limited editions and hard to finds.

8211ba025b5c6f0ea2cc5f8ad5c9ec1aaa	Your tattoo idea sounds so beautiful! That sounds like the perfect ankle tattoo! And it means a lot to you, which makes even better! I have three and plan on getting another this week. I always get compliments on them all, all the time. Some guys may not like tattoos for themselves, or just don't like them, or like them but they aren't for them, but don't mind them on their girlfriends because it made the girl happy and what not.|`|61315c556c8efa34d1991d342fa8b948aa	Tattoos on girls are one thing, on  a  grown woman a different   thing.  What looks hot a girl can make a woman look cheap. That which you have chosen sounds attractive and tasteful and like it will age well.   Your cousin sounds like a nerd with immature hangups!|`|YXXvhDLWaa	I've never met a guy worth dating that didn't like tattoos.|`|8NH0Q3xhaa	It does the opposite, I believe that it makes girls more attractive|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	If it's done right a tattoo on anyone can be beautiful.     Unfortunately there are so many idiots out there tattooing that aren't fit to tattoo cattle, let alone people. Choose the tattooist as carefully as you'd choose your surgeon, and don't scrimp; pay top dollar. You get what you pay for.    You cousin sounds like a scene-kid who thinks he knows everything. Ignore him.|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	i find tattoos extremely attractive my girlfriend happens to have some and i really like them but im not a big fan of an anklet but if it suits you and your personality go for it there are lots of guys who could careless if you had a tattoo or not.|`|UY9N3VUXaa	if you want one, get one. that in itself will be a huge turn on for any guy who is worth it. they will see that you do what you want and you dont let other people dictate what you do. im a woman, im tattooed, my fiance and i are both tattoo artists, and guess what? we met because he was the artist who was going to be tattooing me for my 11th tattoo appointment.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Honey, I have a ton of tattoos and I've never had anyone say an unkind word to me.  I'm even getting married next May, so even if it turns some guys off, you can find fantastic guys out there that either love them or know that what's inside is way more important.    I think your tattoo is a neat idea, and if you go to a good artist and get it well designed, it'll look fantastic.  Just be sure you have a good artist, don't settle for less, and be prepared to pay a fair amount of money for it.    Plus, it's for you, who cares what some other people think?  If you want it, and you like it, get it.  If anybody is worth knowing or being friends with, they'll accept that you made a personal decision and even if they don't like tattoos, they'll realize that you are not your tattoos, you're a person.  It's all about what's inside, and people who don't think like that aren't worth giving a damn about.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Boring.|`|WiIUEObTaa	the first gender to receive artwork. women ancient egypt. people who ridicule women with artwork are assisting society in reaching a all time low in disrespect towards women. there is no need for this disrespect. the work you have described is pure class and respect. no person should mock your choice. very original. sign of love for your mother. please have it done. great thought and respect. well done.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	yes.  thank God no one wants to date your cousin....    my husband loves my tattoo and i'm getting more.  tell your cousin to go suck an egg.|`|N5sfCg87aa	No. Guys normally love tattoos. My boyfriend has some tattoos and I'm going to get some myself. One of which will be to my grand father who died a few years ago.

I'd go to Forlove21 (accessory store of forever21)  they have those oversized bags. and many accessories.  with the bright colored shirts you have. you can wear a jacket over it with skinnies and flats or converse.  There are those black zipper-ups you're wanting at American Eagle.  i have one and they're pretty cheap. $30 + tax  with the black beanie. where a really pretty white tank top with a black cardigan.  with a strapless top.where a cropped jacket or cardigan or sweater.   i.e.http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  but theres more prettier stuff.  i really think some tunics should be added into your wardrobe. you can wear them with leggings and a flat  if you have some kind of recital or something. Skinnies with flats and a plaid button down shirt would be perfect.  i honestly would like necklaces better than bracelets. and some earrings too?  if you have like a long baggy shirt. wear them with shorts and put a thin belt around your waist.   When youre in a hurry wear a tanktop with http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st... and a flipflop and a hoodie.  when youre going out with your friends. where something like=  http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  with  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  i hope that helps. if you want more ideas please tell me. :]|`|F5R3TJEQaa	Have someone do it for you hire someone

So when you here Ghost in the graveyard...RUN! and you HAVE to run!!! another thing me and my friends do is stair sliding! if you have stairs in your house, fill them all the way up with blankets and pillows and other stuff. then you can either just slide down or you can use a small mattress off of a bed in your house and slide down! HOPE  YOU HAVE FUN!!!

OHfZFR31aa	Be careful. Most legitimate agencies do not advertise on websites or in newspapers, they don't have to. These type of things are usually scams.     You show up and they tell you that you have what it takes. But you only need to pay $350 to have pictures taken. Or you have to pay a $125 registration or website listing fee. Then they take your money and you never hear from them again. If they ask you for even $1, walk away. That's how you know they are a scam. And don't ever fall for the "if you don't sign today, we don't want you" line - a real agency would wait 6 months if they really wanted you.    And for promo models, you have to understand what that means. The girls spritzing you with perfume in department stores are promo models. The bikini girls at car shows are promo models. The girls doing liquor promotions in bars/clubs are promo models. The people handing out flyers for bars/clubs are promo models. The pay isn't great, normally minimum wage, and if you don't reach your sales target after one day, they will never call you back.|`|AA10451072	28-38-28?      Oh god no.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	The worst they can say is no. If they turn you down, don't get embarrassed or upset, just calmy and respectfully thank them for their time and they may consider you in the future if they get another opening. Modeling requires confidence, so leave your doubts at the door.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	take the rejection like this. " if they don't want me I will just take myself somewhere else that will appriectiate me. Its their loss not mine." with that attitude, you will not be phased and should do just fine.  this is all assuming you get rejected. if you don't well then you are on your modeling career|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Your embaressed... and confident?  You like all th eboys to look at you, and you wouldn't mind getting paied.\It doesn't sound like you know who you are.  Search, find, become a good person.  Then worry about your career.  The world alone will not even glance at you, you are acting ignorant in your speech and that indicates many, many things- none of them are good, mind you.  Have a heart to heart, learn what you NEED.  Then go after what you want.  I don't give models much credit bc of ppl like you, but its not JUST throwing on a skimpy dress and getting pregnant!!|`|rzYOsJiAaa	i think you should go. if you get rejected, at least you tried. it'll help build your confidence and prove to yourself that you can do anything. also, if you do in fact get rejected, don't let that get you down. Remember to act like they're your friends when you go for the casting, act relaxed and normal, despite how anxious you may feel...   i'm sure you'll do perfectly fine and hopefully they'll get you a job! they've gotta like you if they asked you for a casting!   goood luckerooniezz!!! >_|`|HnWKJLZoaa	Don't get into porn....most rejected models and actors do it...unless you want to but just saying if your embarrassed about this..|`|5poK95JFaa	I thought you said you were a confident chick, and I believed you. sweet heart, you just go out there and kick some but. attitude, attitude  even if they reject you, it won't be the end of the world. you just keep your eyes open for the next opportunity. trust me. that attitude is not going to get you far. walk in there as if you own the place. be different, be cocky, be bold.
LBHJaqXoaa	Yes, I have a few tattoos and yes, I absolutely love them! I am so glad I got them. They are pretty and feminine and I get compliments on them all the time. I was 19 when I got my first one, and I'm 27 now, and I don't regret any of them, nor do I see myself ever regretting them. And I plan on getting more.|`|JafLyLYgaa	If you've wanted this tattoo for more then 3 months, and you wont mind having it on you the rest of your life, then do it.    I was lookin at a tattoo and thinking about getting it earlier. It was a tribal wolf. Then I realized that I had a sliver of a doubt, and I wasnt obsessed with getting it put on my body. Therefore it was ABSOLUTELY NOT good enough to put on my body for the rest of my life.|`|hxJouZgTaa	i dont have one..but if i were to get one it would have to mean something to me ya know..so i would never regret it|`|MV0lMuDMaa	Yes  Yes  Yes  18    They are very "18" year old things but I will always like them.  They are just little pieces of artwork.  They can always be removed or covered up but I would never do that with mine.|`|GNpCY9Dnaa	Yes, I have one.    And, Yes, I regret it.    A couple of years ago, I got a tatto on my toe. Rememer the Lamisil commericals from a few years ago? The ones with the toe fungus.  I thought it would be funny to get a tattoe that looked like a toe fungus on my big toe.    Well, turns out, that I'm the only one that thought it was funny.     Now, not even my match . com dates think it's funny.     Think it through, sweetheart.|`|VonDSR7Kaa	Yes  Yes  Yes  20.     I have a wolf on my right shoulder. I wanted a wolf tattoo since before I was 18. Finally worked up the guts to get one several months ago. As of now, I do not regret it. I also can't see that I would, considering they have been my favorite animal since I was young, and my dream has always been to work with them.    I am going in friday for my 2nd. Another tattoo that will mean something to me, and is of an animal i've been involved with for the last 8 years, and will hopefully have in my life for a very long to come.    I think when it comes down to it, the tattoo needs to be something that actually means something to you. Even if I get out of the animals that I'm getting the tattoo of in the years to come--they were a huge part of my teenage years, and were "who" I was.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	Yes.  Yes and no.  Yes and no.  20 something and 40 something.    The first in my twenties - loved it at the time, and for years later.  Now, I've been divorced from her for 12 years and want it covered.  The second in my twenties, a year after the first - the eagle is still looking for a place to land.  The third and fourth in my forties - I love the tats, but wish the reason for them didn't exist (death). The one on my forearm is a modified military tat, in honor of 4 KIA in Iraq. One of the names listed is my son.  The one on my back - 3 wolves, howling at a graveside bearing a military headstone. Junior's.|`|GGoidtHVaa	Yes  Yes  Yes  18    It's 3 stars that are the color of my mother, father, and brother's birthstones.     I don't regret it at all. It has to do with my family, which will always be a  part of my life.|`|iFj7cDCNaa	Yes, I have two. I love them both. It was my 18th birthday when I got my first one. And I got my second one 5 months later.     The only reason you would have regrets is if you get something just because you think other people would think its cool or its popular. Get something for you. Remember that its permanent. And it will last a long time. Get something that you would like to see everyday and not wish that it wasn't there.|`|vDky5V15aa	I have numerous tattoos and got my first one when I was 19. That tattoo is now covered and is part of my back piece.     I love my art. I intend to continue adding to my collection and have never regretted any of them. I just out matured my first one and had to make it into something that works.    I get a lot of questions about my tattoos and I always say the same thing. Pick a design and an artist. Put the idea aside for a minimum of one year. If when you come back to it, you still want it, then you are probably safe. Never put the name of a lover on your body as this is the most regretted tattoo out there. Safe tattoos are your kids, parents, grandparents, pets.     hope this helps.|`|klu1sCpraa	Yes Several   Yes   Yes   65   I do not regret any of them
6H3zI2bKaa	Yeah, I guess you can!|`|NDEDBvcSaa	you will only be allowed to exchange|`|annOPoQJaa	yeah, you'll probably just get store credit for it though, rather than cash (or however you paid for it)|`|EpZfJPG5aa	i have done that before. yes u can. u just need to have the receipt and u'll be fine =]
SqI4CEtnaa	okay i have never tried this but maybe you could put a rubber band in the bottom of the pants and just roll them up so you cant see the rubberband  that is probably a bad idea huh  i tried    or you could cut a hole and sew a button on them if you want them to stay better|`|bEypuYJ0aa	ya roll em up.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	Rubber Band!!!  just use it to hold  ur sweat pants up  i doo dat all de time!|`|usxeet5vaa	If you want, you can cut them, so that they go a little bit longer than you want them. Then you can roll them up to where you want, so the cut marks don't show. I do this with jeans all the time, so it might work with sweat pants.    TIP**** When you cut, you might want to draw a line with a ruler first. And use fabric scissors! The can be VERY useful.     Hope this helps!!!|`|NDEDBvcSaa	my cousin was a cheerleader and she always used a rubber band|`|nOVSf06Raa	you could cut them where you want them to be and leave enough fabric to fold up make sure that you sew with the machine on where you want to cut them this way the fabric will not stretch when you fold them up , you then cut 4 pieces of 2" each and sew the side turn them inside out and sew them on the sides you can sew them on permanently or add a snap on or a button to hold the tag up I will look if I can find a picture to give a better idea.     here it is     http://www.gap.com/Asset_Archive/GPWeb/A...
NOV4CBO3aa	no its not the best idea    but if you really must go ahead    you have to be comfortabke right    wear a cute short dress mtch the colours of your dress with your shoes    good luck w/e you choose|`|uB0QueSOaa	THATS A GOOD IDEA...I WOULD SAY WITH A CASUAL DRESS OR A JEAN DRESS...|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Um, no i don't think converse would be appropriate for the occasion.

Its like wearing converse to homecoming... bad, bad, bad.|`|JLmUdJwpaa	OMG I DID THIS!! :O cause who says i can't wear converses with my dress!!!! :D GO FOR IT|`|22pxRi1Laa	so cute i did it before with a black and red pouf dress and it looked the bomb-diggity.|`|1e081453f84a42a2a6c4b14afb6eb740aa	it's a nice idea and all but in my opinion, you should dress formally.  for my eighth grade graduation i wore high heels.  they hurt like hell but at least they looked good.   but maybe you're not like that though.  if you're going to wear them then you should get a pair to match your dress and don't get a big puffy prom-looking dress if you're going to wear simple shoes.|`|nE5nyzDcaa	Yes =)  And:    http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/n...    Any of these =)|`|MGOmVeMfaa	no i dont think its cute  no offense but it looks kinda cheap  i didnt like it when bella swan or demi lovato did it either|`|240196f7d6a1fc2f0753fb8357ab2c18aa	I don't think you are allowed to|`|98ftTISiaa	well dresses that would look cute would be really poofy tutu looking(but not) because if its just straight then it looks weird.

Yeah all you need to do it change to a protein And moisturizing shampoo plus conditioner and I kid you not your hair will transform.  ever since i discovered the cure for frizzies and the poof I have never had a problem with my hair :)
WSctujf5aa	I think you should try to work through it, because you don't sound very old. Granted I'm only 15, but even still.  And don't get upset about me saying this but 5 months seems a short amount of time to be in love.  I've been there.  And I thought I was in love after like 4 months and I wasn't.

5SiFjlBGaa	I like the dress! It would look nice with a smokey eye. You can do it in chocolate browns, charcoals and black, or do a natural eye. Taupes and nudes.|`|ydZrs0JRaa	brown|`|cYRZpGkqaa	neutral browns that compliment your skin tone and eye color|`|N5sfCg87aa	On you eyelid you should do a dark red but lightly, then put a light shade of brown on starting from the crest of your eyes. It will look good.|`|oNwKGO4Uaa	I think a Brown smokey eye or a black smokey eye would look great with that dress. :D|`|wWbE3YKcaa	gorgeous dress!  i disagree with the brown..i think a smokey black.|`|vUsByh1Naa	Your dress is pretty dramatic so try not to overdo the eyes.  If you have blue eyes a light smoky eye would be nice,  silver shadow,  black eyeliner and a light coat of brownish black mascara (yes it it a shade you can get).  For brown go brown of a very light shimmery gold.  Hazel eyes like me go well with greenish brown and deep brown liner.  Have fun going to wherever your going in your dress!|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	brown or black|`|7sRusjE6aa	go to a professional...they will know what to do~        or you could use a lot of neutrals and that will look good like browns and blacks.|`|2TEDmxPXaa	I would line your eyes with a deep bronze liner....use a softer brown on the lid 3/4 of the way into the corner n into the crease of the lid....use a taupe on the inner corner and haul it up over the rest of the eye....then use a pale rosey color just under the brow n over the taupe in the inner corner of the eye....then blend them all together well a hint of whatever blush your going to use with powder so that its soft n natural looking. Finishe it with blackest mascara several coats. And for a little more drama a few added lashes, but if you opt for the killer eyes, go with a neutral soft skin tone ish looking lip with gloss.|`|M8f4BorPaa	like white in the inside of ur eye then then dark brown on outside of eye. sparkley shadows. whatever compliments the dress n makes ur eyes POP! lol pssst. i like ur dress~!   hope i helped :)|`|RvJElelaaa	dark brown?|`|d7OswsvMaa	yea. what they said..|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	black or dark gray smokey. if you aren't good at doing make up with a dress like that I think you should get it done professionally.
hHSsMyNpaa	Exactly - tone what you have, keep the same weight.  Start by doing some low impact exercises with a body ball.  You can get one in your size at any good sporting goods store.       http://www.amazon.com/Valeo-Body-Ball/dp...    and some exercises and videos    http://exercise.about.com/cs/abs/l/bl_co...    http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=bo...|`|DmPDt4aDaa	you dont need to lose weight. just do excersises to tone your muscles.|`|zb0vZXZfaa	ur hot, ur fine leave ur self alone and just keep working out|`|9Jam6lCKaa	you don't need to loose weight.

Everything else is fine. Practice doing squat thrusts or do the exercise where you kinda sit in an air chair.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	none but if u want to tone ur but and stomach do leg ups at the gym or crunches and squats|`|P5CyGvZuaa	You don't need to lose any weight, you have a nice shape.  Just do some light weight training exercises, crunches, and lunges to tone up.|`|RFCcWPliaa	I think you should gain about -5 pounds.  You don't need to loose any weight, just tone up if that's what you want.|`|GGoidtHVaa	Ok first off your 17. You shouldn't be posting pictures like this of yourself online honey. 2nd You don't need to loose any weight, just tone up a bit. You in no way are fat. To tone your legs, butt, and hips do squats. Make sure your doing them correctly, otherwise you won't see results. I do 100 squats in the morning. To tighten your stomache muscles do sit ups, side bends, and crunches. I usually do 75 of each of those a morning. Also running is great for your legs. If your not used to running start with a 20 minute jog every morning. For arms just do push ups, OR if you have a gym membership the machines show which muscles it will work, so you could do that.
zkovxRseaa	forehead|`|M9o5WpOqaa	This might sound crazy-but when I decided to get my tattoo,I wasn't sure where I wanted it.I had my husband poke me (ouch!) with a straight pin in several different areas of my body to see if I could handle the pain.I ended up getting a fairly large tattoo on my left shoulder,above the blade.That was 3 years ago and it really didn't hurt much at all! I love it and want another one! The next one will be on the back of my neck.|`|Tj94JEMJaa	On your wrist, or where ever you feel better with it at. Someway you'll always remember him. over yo heart.|`|jFpaKZ2Baa	Usually the "feminine" places to get tattoos are considered the foot, ankle, lower back, and back of the neck. :)    With the way it sounds though, I think the back of the neck would be a good spot.|`|hjcHkNSfaa	I say at the bottom of your wrist. That sounds like a really good tattoo. Or, if you want, you could get it on your upper arm or ankle. All good places! But please, no forehead.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Feet or ankles for Women! Those places are subtle and sexy.    The small of the back is likely to be labelled a 'tramp-stamp' as it's been done to death and has become synonomous with..erm..'party girls'.    Arms and hands are just wrong on Women. Take into account that as it ages the  tattoo is going to spread as the ink disperses under your skin and anything in plain view could impair you in getting a job as well as look awful if it's too small to maintain detail.    The back is a fairly good place aswell, as you can control when it's on display.

You are marked for life. People will think you are trash. I'm sorry, but that is just the way our society is.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	If I remember rightly its a Hindu inspired Henna/Mehndi design.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi    Don't just go out and get a tattoo because you saw it in a film though, you'll regret it. Also, if it is a Mehndi design it has symbolic meaning, so to have it tattooed for vanity purposes would be a really poor thing to do.

Thats what i did when i was about 13, and now i'm 15.|`|N7OQhGDsaa	first of all  you cant just go asking your mom for "A PIERCING"  you need to figure out which piercing you would like and do alot of research on it too. to find out the side effects the pros and cons of it and aftercare etc...    then how you approach your mother makes a big difference as well,  be polite and respectful. dont scream at her if she says no, calmly ask her what she has against the piercing and the exact reason why she doesnt accept it. they you have to give her a reasonable answer of WHY you want the piercing.  and DO NOT  i repeat DO NOT say because its cool.  she will def. say NO then.     also  dont give up if she says no the first time.  parents take a long time to break in but if you keep bringing it up casually and calmly she should eventually come to a compromise with you.    AND it also depends on how old you are.  if you're too young, your mom wont let you get it pierced.  i would say 15 - 16 would be an okay age for mothers to allow piercings.    hope i helped :)|`|wtpbA43aaa	peiring is ugluy|`|dOM1tpX0aa	just prove ur responsibility.        duuuudes, help me with my question.|`|J388J29Waa	do what makes you happy, but like considering she wants to disown you, you might wanan take some precautions lke trying to hide it, but only if that is safe like u dont wanna hide it and then get an infection  good luck  im diong the same thing actually|`|CGJ68TIXaa	my mom said no piercings too. but than i got my ear and cartilage pierced by my gf. and she doesnt say anything about it now. she didnt even yell about me piercing my ear.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Line up all the people in the USA in one line.. put the dumb at one end and the smart at the other.... which end would have the most piercings and tattoos....

9yvthwx6aa	If you wear liquid foundation, first rub moisturizer into your skin. This will thin out the foundation, which will also make it look closer to your natural color. If you wear eyeliner, try brown to enhance your eyes without being obvious, or, if you want your eyes to be the focal point of your face, use something like purple [looks great with green]. For eyeliner, line the top eyelid from inner to outer corner; for the bottom eyelid, start at the outer corner and stop in about the middle.|`|ydZrs0JRaa	go to youtube  type in : natural makeup   go to ricebunny 's video on natural makeup tutorials

UzqYQf0Jaa	1. Shampoo and condition with products formulated to improve your hair's texture and flexibility.     2. Towel dry your hair so that it is damp, not dripping.     3. Apply a firm hold styling aid from the root area to the ends. Hair Gel or Glaze is usually better for heavy hair and Styling Foam or Mousse usually works for fine hair. You may have to experiment to see which works for you.     4. To dry your hair, you will either use a diffuser or let it dry naturally. Either way, you must be patient to not rush the drying process.       5. Grab a chunk of hair, squeeze and push the ends up toward your head, causing it to 'crinkle'. If you are using a diffuser, direct the air flow toward the chunk of hair you are working with. Drop that piece of hair and grab another chunk. Repeat the process until you have worked with all of your hair. Go over it again and again until your hair is dry.            * Grabbing small chunks of hair and working more slowly will give you more curl.            * Larger chunks of hair will give a larger wave effect.        To save time, shorten the process by:  As soon as you get up, get into the shower.  Follow step 1  Immediately upon getting out follow step 2.  Then grab chunks of hair, wad them up and clip them to your head loosely. (The clips to use are similar to those used with hot rollers. Only without the rollers!)They must be loose enough for the air to circulate. When you have all of your hair up in clips, it will be messy looking.    Then have your coffee, breakfast and continue getting ready for work. Your hair will be air-drying at this time.  When you are dressed and have your make-up on, check your hair. If it is still very wet, use the diffuser on it.  When it is almost dry, carefully take out all the clips. Continue scrunching, using the diffuser until your hair is completely dry.  To get rid of any frizz, finish your style by scrunching some hair creme into the ends and adding spray shine.|`|bFWhuJbuaa	1) Put some gel in your damp/semi-wet hair and make sure it is evenly distrubated. (be generous with the gel)    2) Take your finger and twist your gelled hair into little wringlets and leave them in that position until fairly dry.    3) use  hands and scrunch hair into little crinks     4) DONT blow dry    5) let hair air dry, then spray with hair spray                                (or)    1) Put wet/gelled hair into a messy bun and put multiple hair bands over the bun into a scrunchy bun      GOOD LUCK AND HOPE I HELPED!|`|NH1cPd3saa	scrunched hair looks awful in my opinon, dont do it|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	It doesnt look scrunched it just looks like she used way too much hair spray, mousse, or gel|`|wKZlrJAjaa	so you can do this with dry or wet water you just put hair mouse on  avoid putting to much on   and pantene is the best to use|`|b6945e47a104c6ade14ab73fc302e5e5aa	it doesnt really work for people with straight hair i have curly hair so its really easy to do;im gonna tel you how i do it but idk if it will work for you since you have straight hair    YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AFTER YOU SHOWER when you get out just drie it with a towel dont competely dry it just so that your hair stays moist  brush your hair how you want(staight line no line or a part) once you brushed it use some mouse but make sure you put enough so they can stay and apply the mousse to your hair first i do one side then the other to make sure my hair has mousse it should look wet and you schunch it and mess with it and let it air dry or you can blow dry it but really low and for like 2 mins.

2b4cf122bf028b6f310138970448a801aa	I have this exact same problem. I forgot the technical name for it. But it's actually pretty common. Chances are you're just wearing regular deodorant. I use Certain Dri (The roll on kind, no Certain Dri AM) It's a special kind of antiperspirant, even better than the other "clinically proven". You can buy it at more drug stores or Wal-Mart. Be sure you read the directions!! It can be harmful to you, but really only if you use it right after you shave. Also be sure to apply it at night and then wear a regular deodorant in the morning. But this works wonders. I don't sweat period under my arms anymore. I also used to buy Maxim, which I could only find on the internet, but it seemed to have stopped working for me after a few months.|`|M8f4BorPaa	get a new deodarant i use secret asain pear && it works, for acne i use neutorgena n it works like really (green one with microbeads), and i have ur anser for back acne its CLINIQUE: acne solutions, body spray. and it really does work i used to have hella bad backne but not now. trust me n its cool cuz it sprays in all directions n really easy  good luck, hope this helps... but i know it will lol please try this or at least the last suggestion.|`|yStgi71jaa	botox injections?|`|4793dc3cd4fd80d46ddf53b18e344fabaa	They will probably tell you some different kind of soaps and anti-perspirants to use. Shower more, that kind of stuff.|`|DnhrYzJhaa	I have the same problem, but luckily it died down a bit after I turned 20.  But there's a prescription strenth roll-on anti-persperant called "Certain Dri" that you can get at the drugstore, grocery store, Walmart, or wherever.  It works very well, but at least on me it took a few weeks to get used to.  Don't overuse it, follow the instructions, and do not put it on broken skin (or like after you shave, which is a no no for any deodorant but I know that rule is broken a lot).  If you do use a product like this, you should also choose a mild deodorant.  Dove deodorants are a very good choice for sensitive skin.  Good luck!

mX0qaX3Eaa	Perhaps try an electric that applies a balm or emollient as it travels over your skin like one of these:    http://www.shavers.co.uk/shopping.php?pr...    You'll never get the quality of shave with an electric shaver that you do with a razor (ideally a straight razor), most people get acne and spots more often, rashes and tired skin around the stubble area.    So it's a toss-up, convenience over quality; what's it gonna be?    :o)

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Your plan will not work.    It takes much longer for a cartilage piercing to heal enough for you to leave the jewelry out for that long. 8 months to a year for it to heal fully. I wouldn't leave jewelry out for more than an hour or two until after that.    Soaps are bad for piercings, as is moving the jewelry. Both will make the healing process take longer and can cause scar tissue to form.    You should only take medication when you need it. If you have swelling, it's ok to take an over the counter medication like ibuprofen for a few days, but you don't want to take it all the time.     Camp is certainly not the best place to try and heal a piercing.     Either get your parents permission or wait until you're old enough to pay your own way.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	You can't just take a cartilage piercing out and put it back in repeatedly. It will cause you problems and might even get infected.     Some people take 6 months for a cartilage piecing to heal fully.    Don't twist the jewelry. It heals quicker when you touch it as little as possible. ?|`|KKx8Mb63aa	Never twist it. That will irritate it and it will take it even longer to heal.  Don't touch it unless you're cleaning it.  Anti histamines won't help it heal faster, they'll make it swell less.    And no five weeks isn't enough to take it out for an hour a day.  That will irritate it too.
AA11609679	Absolutely, the key is to make sure you get one that fits correctly. Another tip for pushups is to get one of the convertible bras where you can detach and reattach the straps. Reattach the straps so that they cross in the back, you will get even more lift.

And if you're wearing them for cleavage you can often look slutty. And if you wear them all the time eventually you'll start having low self esteem because you'll think that people only think you're hot because it looks like you have big boobs when you really don't and then you won't know if people will really think so if they saw you in your normal state. So not worth it...

DhExpMlnaa	Guys cheat. Not every single guy, but most. I have a friend who seems to really love his girlfriend, yet we had sex the other night. So it seems that guys don't care. It's instinctive for them to want to be with lots of girls. He might like you. Ask him.|`|oil8ALh4aa	He's a teenage boy who sounds like a typical flirt    if he's single he's gonna have some fun, hell even if he's dating someone more then likely his curiosity will get the best of him and he'll cheat. So don't be upset that he made out with some chick. If you like him then get with him and be like that lucky girl that made out with him. Its not like he's dating her, so either she's not interested or he's not interested and it was just them having a little fun.     But honestly, keep in mind that you could also just be one of the girls he enjoys flirting with.|`|E2oH02h8aa	Well first off, it's technically not cheating if you guys were never officially going out in the first place. Second of all, he probably has feelings for you too, but since your  guys relationship isn't official he's just being a free man because he doesn't need to be committed. If you like him ask him if he wants an official relationship and see where it leads.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Okay.. so you're going out with a guy.. but.. not really going out with him and he made out with another girl.  He sounds like a flirt, which is expected of some teenage boys I guess.|`|V9mYCag0aa	if he cheated on you than he doesn't like you
7Dpz81d5aa	The updo hairstyles from 2009 medium haircuts are also great hairstyles that give the right length cut to your hair. The hair is kept loose near the earlobes just falling over the shoulders. You can also go for the pinned-up hairstyles or the wavy curls if you frequent the ramp.            Side swept bangs from medium haircuts 2009 are also great. If you have thin and lanky hairs then try out the layered medium haircuts 2009 as layers adds volume to your hair and is considered very feminine. Next on the line is the rare V cut and curl if you want some thing unique or you could try the eternal U cut that suits all lifestyles.    The mid-length bob from 2009 medium haircuts is still a hot hairstyle. To give movement to this cut inverted lines, volumized crowns and textures are used. The vintage hairstyle with its retro curls from medium haircuts 2009 are back this season and is going to make news. This hairstyle gives a fresh and funky look to your hair. For the young and rebel at heart with a thin face the bed head hairstyle is a good choice. This hairstyle from medium haircuts 2009 keeps your hair at shoulder length with the ends thick and heavy and voluminous.     Another great style from 2009 medium haircuts is the medium shag hairstyle. This is a mid-length hairstyle that looks sleek and has a multi-layered cut. The defined ends and the split front bangs give you that sexy yet adorable look. If you want a good change that gives you an easy look go for the simple multi-layered cut. This hairstyle will definitely enhance your facial features.|`|hZ9omSataa	mohawks are always in style and will never go out..|`|7nrhPCf0aa	side bangs are really in and blunt bangs are beginning to come back in style|`|cBMwHdn4aa	well, there's alot of emo/punk junk being worn, but I prefer sleek and sexy.  it looks like the long hair with loose curls are in, still...the Farah Fawcett look but a nice bob never goes our of style.

My hair stylist also said not to cut them. my hair is down to the middle of my back and so are my bangs.    I would take a picture of what you want, or look in one of those books they always have there.  Or if you know an acttress that has the bangs u want, mention that to her.  Good Luck to Ya
mX0qaX3Eaa	About 200 for the tattoo and 100,000,000 for the time-machine to go back to 1990 when people thought they were a good idea.    EDIT    Sorry for the sardonic reply. I really don't think you should get a barbed-wire tattoo though.     A) It's been done to death.  B) It didn't look good in the first place.  C) It's artistically banal.  D) Tribal (T-Moko) designs are unique in Maori families and stealing a design when you have no connection would be the worst thing in the world.

But if you are looking for something a bit more modest I would suggest you get some very dark/black skinny jeans that fit very well to wear under it.   If you are adding some accessories I would go with gold! Think gold flats with gold bangles. I think this would be very cute and comfortable!

AA11609679	I like this pen. I think it is easier to apply than regular liquid liner because you don't have to worry about over wetting the tip and making a mess of your eyes. It doesn't smudge at all. Using any liquid liner takes practice and a steady hand to get the best results, but if you have already used liquid liner, using the pen form should be a cinch.|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	well i think liquid eyeliner is harder to apply then a pencil but once you get used to it its beter cus it makes a thinner line

The rings would be different so you might be better off going to a shop and having a look|`|T0ALtDw7aa	a Monroe is normally located above your upper lips and off to the side like a beauty mark. a lip ring is a lebret.

VZ880EG6aa	Lineur(sp?) Intense by L'Oreal, in carbon black. It's a liquid with a pen-like applicator so it's really easy to apply. This does not fade or flake off, and has all day wear.    ColorStay by Revlon, it's a pencil that is self advancing with a built in sharpener. It really does stay on all day, just like the package says. it doesn't fade, run into your eyes or anything like that.    I wear the 'cat eyes' style every day pretty much and have tried so many eyeliners. These are the two that really work for me, hope they do the same for you!    (edited to add)  Um why was my answer rated badly? I don't care about getting points, I just wanted to recommend good eyeliner to the person who asked the question. I have been wearing black eyeliner like this for about 10 years and tried so many, and these two don't fade. Everything else I've tried does, no matter what condition my skin is in. Some makeup is good and some isn't, that's all there is to it!)|`|2TEDmxPXaa	when you put on your foundation extend it up over your eye lids too..and make sure you set everything with a translucent powder. If you want things to remain fairly dark all day you might need to layer your liners.    I use a angled brush made damp and rubbed into the color shadow i want for liner...putting it on with a damp brush makes it darker n thicker...and really work it into the base of the lashes (lash line) it also helps make your lashes look thicker. And if i need a really dramatic look i use liquid liner and the powder in layers.|`|YJCG2kn1aa	dont put ur eyeliner on the inside of your eyee  do it like right under ur eyelash  it looks pretty if u do it nice|`|yWRTrnR2aa	Apply the pencil liner as you usually do, then set it with black matte eyeshadow using an eyeliner brush(angled or traditional).|`|JqDkLWeTaa	Okay, ik this sounds crazy but if u heat the tip of ur liner with a lighter and then let it cool down it really makes it stay on all day and i highly reccomend urban decay liners and make sure ur not touching ur eyes and dont apply it too much on ur water liner cuz it wheres off more when its there|`|KjF0p72naa	Well ladies like to "freshen up" for a reason. Sometimes it's to re-touch. You can try another brand or you can just stop lining the bottom. It will open up your eyes more to just have it on either the top or bottom.|`|5SiFjlBGaa	I just use a black shadow and I apply it with an angles brush. It lasts longer than liner and doesn't smear like liquid when it gets wet.|`|y5WPZ8dJaa	I do the same. My liquid remains intact but my pencil always fades very quickly. I've used $1 eyeliner and currently use $35 eyeliner. It makes no difference. It's because it's so close to the eye and it gets moist so it fades. You'd have to re-apply all of the time, sad but true.|`|V8UW2Ucyaa	Permanent eyeliner surgery or keep reapply.|`|9yvthwx6aa	If you get powder in the same color [eyebrow or eyeshadow power], you can put the eyeliner on and then put the powder over it [by using a brush or the eyeliner pencil]. You just have to be precise with a brush, otherwise the line can go really thick|`|zDh2Qw9eaa	Put powder both under the eyeliner and over. Just a dab of it over the eyeliner will help set it. Also, maybe try an eyeshadow primer both on the lids and under it towards the area where you apply your eyeliner. Also what I do sometimes, is using eyeshadow as a bottom liner. Use a small angled brush and apply any color of your choice to under the eyes. There are very black eyeshadows out there that would do the trick if you use black. Many browns and an array of colors.|`|chbXXJ0Eaa	I recommend using Urban Decay eyeliner in "Zero".  (NOT liquid eyeliner, the pencil)  I use it and it lasts all day without fading on both top and bottom lids.|`|6nqSyISTaa	Becasue the moisture from your eyes is so close to the place where you're applying it, sadly, you must re-apply. It is a pain in the butt, but beauty is pain.    Hope this helps.|`|QwXIsKAhaa	Try putting eyeshadow/powder over it.|`|2t1Py4MMaa	none do a very good job of staying. you have to just keep redoing it after it fades.
zDh2Qw9eaa	You can use pigments straight out of the jar without pressing, although that is an option many do as well. You don't have to use a mixing medium to apply pigments, but I think they are more intense if I do.     What I do is dampen the brush, dip it into the pigment, and pack it on. Make sure, though, that you don't dip the wet brush straight into your jar. That will make your pigments damp and will introduce bacteria into them. Plus make them gunky. Sprinkle just a bit of the pigment into a separate container. Just a little bit goes a looong way with pigments. Using a mixing medium will reduce fallout as well. Also you want the brush damp, not soaked. Like one spray from a distance will mostly do.    As for shine, that really depends on the pigment. There will be more of a sheen with them then a regular matte eyeshadow, in general.    You can use it as a lip color. Use Vaseline over lips, pat on pigment and then cover with a lip gloss if desired.    Pigments can also be used as blushers and even in your nail polish!    If you plan on using them as eyeshadows, I recommend looking into an eye primer. Urban Decay Primer Potion and Two Faced Shadow Insurance are awesome. I prefer Two Faced more due to it being less drying. You can also make your own by applying concealer to eyes, and then rubbing a bit of facial moisturizers over the lid until it is a very light paste and then rubbing it in. Oh and you can't forget Mac's paint pots, they are amazing as well. Using a base or primer or even both will really make the colors pop!    Pigments are great, have fun!     PS. There are other great and cheaper alternatives to MAC pigments, like NYX Ultra Pearl Mania and even the mica powders from Coastal Scents.    PSS. A cheaper alternative to buying expensive mixing mediums (like Mac) is using Visine as a mixing medium. There is also the solution of mixing one part glycerin and two parts water, shake and use. Glycerin can be found in most drug stores for around three bucks and lasts forever. I've been doing that for months now.|`|7sRusjE6aa	look on youtube they have all the answers!|`|6nqSyISTaa	http://www.macpro.com/templates/products...      Hope this helps.|`|sGhgJHjhaa	when you use a pigment, it's always better to apply it wet since it's a loose shadow. with the mixing medium, put a few drops of it on to some kind of surface, like the lid of the jar or even on your hand. if you dropped it in the lid, tap a little shadow into the lid and mix it with your brush. you want a thick, kind of pastey consistency. if your put it on your hand, did your brush into the drops of mixing medium and then then dip the wet brush into the pigment jar. then all you gotta do is apply it to your lid. but make sure you put a base on your lid before applying! good luck! =]|`|MiyuKZ7vaa	For MAC pigments you need a thick natural base underneath them to make them hold, and shine amazingly...  I use paint pot base.    Use a stiff eye brush and dab it in the pigment container. before applying it on your eye, shake off the access of it.     make sure you have a base underneath though!
aClEgPgMaa	I think it would look cool.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Totally!    it would look so nice on you(:|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	With your skin tone, I'd go for a honey blonde with white-blonde highlights, but not all over bleached.

Because your complexion needs hair that's darker than it to actually appreciate how much it glows, try to photo shop your face, put brown hair on it then watch to see how your complexion glows, it's really amazing once you think about it! And even if you want to shine even more, then you should get black hair, just to show your facial features more.  I hope that that answers your question.|`|bgWHvucHaa	keep your hair color or go darker, blonde with you skin wont look as good as dark could|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I would not bleach your eyebrows. They look fine with your hair and its just another thing you have to worry about maintaining. I think you should not do your entire head that color but instead do about a little more than half.

I never think people look good with all white blonde.|`|DuPAkdkxaa	i don't see why not (;|`|4RtHz65Qaa	It wont look good with your skin tone. the stuff called white out will turn your hair orange bc you have so much red in it. if you want it all done white go to a salon. but i would suggest just getting streaks bc all over will look bad|`|6nqSyISTaa	I dont think it will look all that great; sorry.

L4SSw0Ahaa	Use a product such as John Frieda straightening products (their serum or spray work well) and make sure you get it all over your hair. Just using a bit on top of your hair won't work. As it is drying, make sure to keep brushing your hair to pull out any waves that are forming. You may want to let it airdry about 80% and then blowdry the rest, pulling it straight with a brush or a straightening brush. Using a straightener will undoubtly give you the sleekest look, and you could try using a heat protectant spray to help prevent damage.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	fisrt using heat protects in a balance is just fine but ill still help ya lol    use straightening shampoo   when hair is drying make sure it is not up in a towel make sure it is brushed  Constantly brush  use a straightening leave in conditener|`|dXDroPtfaa	Afraid of getting split ends?

Good luck.|`|fDElc7Qhaa	Okay, so when you hair is wet [you should shower at night] put it up in a ponytail/bun type of thing. and when you wake up your hair will be straighter (depending on your hair, probably not as straight as if you flat iron it)    I don't know if it works for you, but my hair is pretty straight naturally and that works|`|yje6VNCpaa	i don't think you can..  sorry ):|`|qvDVgwrpaa	flat irons, contrary to belief, do not make your hair have split ends. You have to use spray with it, such as Aussie spray. Good luck!|`|jKA8SovQaa	how can split ends form from one time , theirs no other way to get it pin straight unless a magical fairy comes and straightens you're hair, blah i straighten my hair and i do have split ends but that was after the 20th time maybe? and i already had frizzy/curly hair  i use bed head straightening products (shampoo and conditioner , leave in conditioner) and some silk and non frizz products, and after you're hair gets split ends all you do is buy treatments and start scrunching you're hair no other way to put it  give me thumbs down if you want  but no other way to explain!|`|92fyzJkcaa	i dont think you can unless you have naturally straight hair|`|ouvvS1Ylaa	well, thats almost impossible.  i have really curly hair and i use a flat iron.  there is a product called easy straight, but you still have to blow dry your hair.  if you have naturally straight or wavy hair,   using a smoothing serum might work.  otherwise,  i would use a flat iron but also spray a heat protector on before using.  if you dont straighten your hair often, you wont get split ends.|`|PnJYGIneaa	Well you could air dry it by using a blow dryer it all straight

DhExpMlnaa	Oh no.. Never get anything pierced with a gun! They can build up bacteria.  Anyway, yeah. If it's healed you should definitely be able to.  Any gauge, though I would recommend upsizing it gradually.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	18 gauge would be best, a 16gauge  works too but that ill be harder to get in and it hurts a little more

s0ENa2Pvaa	Newest photoshop does that mean you have Cs4? I have that too. xD  Well you'll have to learn about these things, try reading some tutorials that's how I figured out how to use it.  However I'm more of a on hands learner, so I basically just tried out everything myself. As for fonts and textures, there are a lot of sites where you can download these things, for free.   Try Saruna.net or   http://feel.zeroexposure.net./    This is kind of hard to explain really, try just searching up how to use textures/ fonts and stuff on google. It's really helpful.    For the font, after you download it you'll have to put it in the font folder.  http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/fonts/f/i...    You should read some tutorials as said before for the basics of how to use it.  The text tool bar should be on the side, and looks like a T.
QGPTu5RNaa	Go to camoformal.com  They have the most selection of any online camo dress store.

YEd9Q5KZaa	My sister used Jergens Natural Glow, it's a daily moisturizer and that did help darken her skin. You could also use a bronzer on your face.|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	First of all love your self the way you are. we just live one time remember, if you one a fast tanning recipe just use olive oil in your body and face live it overnight and then wash it out in the morning about in one week you will notice tanning effect your skin will dewy and kiss by the sun good luck be happy.|`|hYohgOcAaa	u can use a darker shade of make-up  or go to cvs or to the drug fair they have some good stuff|`|5hb6VUglaa	At ulta there is a lotion that you put on to make you look tanner. It is called bronzing lotion. I use it because I am really pale too.|`|iNPO8q0Laa	Yeah you can use Jergens Nautral Glow in cream or foam. My sister uses it and it works great.|`|6f8cd878fe31d3872b5f0b81d6d6fa8daa	First of all, don't change for other people. Love yourself for who you are! Even though people's words can really hurt make sure you look at the positives. Focus on all the good things about you, love your pale skin and make it work for you. If I had to give you any advise on getting tan i would say use Jergens! make sure you use it every day and that you spread it very well so you dont look streaky.|`|C8zrNMRjaa	spray tan.

rVWPRYoEaa	It's free with purchase of the stud, but if you get your cartilage done their it will probably get infected and be sore for years, you really should get it done with a needle not a gun.|`|hxJouZgTaa	the peircing is free but claires like tricks you out and the earrings are like wicked expensive i would go to walmart..i have 10 ear peircings (5 in each ear) and i went to walmart for most of them its so cheap and my people did a good job there i mean its not like it that hard anyway..they do it in the jewelry dept.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Do yourself a huge favor and do NOT go to claires for any piercing. Find a professional piercer at a tattoo shop and they will pierce you the correct way.(needle)  Piercing guns are not healthy for your ears. Believe it or not you can get HIV and other serious diseases from piercing guns.|`|iNPO8q0Laa	I think ear piercing is free but I could be wrong. Maybe around 5 or 10 dollars then.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	its freeeeeeeeeee|`|VKLdqnpBaa	its free, u just have to pay for the studs  i would suggest not getting ur cartilage pierced there  go to like the piercing pagoda in the mall|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	Piercing is free but the actual earring costs some $$$|`|Sn8a9a49aa	deffff get it done by a real professional. also, claire's has cheap jewelry that many people are allergic to.

0LygKYZ3aa	This hairstyle can be clipped back with cute stuff to make it girly, flopped in your face for carefree, and teased to the hilt for some sass:  http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/gal...    If you don't mind spending a lot of time on your hair, try this one:  http://z.hubpages.com/u/273544_f520.jpg    This style is UBER cute, but requires a lot of teasing:  http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p104/...    The good news for you is that, since you have an oval face, almost any hairstyle will look good on you.  It's true, read any beauty book! :)|`|bgWHvucHaa	i really like the first one!    perhaps  http://www.female-fashion.co.uk/wp-conte...    idk who that is, but the hair is good|`|4J2NGAMyaa	i think u shut try gttin ur hair permed ...like cur it tht looks gud on oval face but if u want a cut out of these three the third one is da best :)|`|sidRlOL9aa	First off, if your going to do something dramatic with your hair, you need to go to a good hair stylist. Get their opinion. Short hair cuts look really good with oval faces. So, if you have an oval face you can pull it off. BUT if your face is on the chubby side then its probably not going to look that good. I hope this helps. And I like the third pic the best|`|4RtHz65Qaa	since you have an oval face pretty much any hair cut will look good on you! i have an oval face too and i asked my hair dresser what looks good on me and she said about everything expeshly short hair cuts.|`|NO9qfLhlaa	I think Katie Holmes short haircut was a good way to get versatility and it looks great on an oval face.|`|ss48BEk5aa	I have an oval face. Some days I am in love with my short hair and other days it would make me feel super chunky (lol) It's hard to say. I just risked it and had them chop it before I changed my mind. I am letting it grow back but I go through my moments of wanting to chop it again, ahhh. Indecisive Libra.    I would say go for it though! (I like the first pic) you'll never know til you try it! It's only hair! It will grow back, and if you absolutely hate it, Buy a super cute hat!|`|pOx6vwMwaa	this is what i have and its lots of fun to  do different things to-  a bob that is chin length in front then gets shorter in the back with tone of little choppy layers in the back so you can spike them and on days where you dont want to do anything with it just leave it alone and it looks like a normal bob
bAYVSfdJaa	Do you mean a hip piercing? Because you cannot put a ring there, it would get torn right out.  Also, your piercing will reject if you just plan on using bellybutton ring or a regular earring or something in it.  You need a surface barbell for surface piercings.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Enjoy your rejection scars.    Surface piercings take a lot of skill and knowledge. Even professionals have about a 50% rejection rate.     Go to a pro, get microdermals done, you'll stand a much better chance of healing the piercing.
z3uUtr33aa	industrial is painful, let me tell you... i'm glad your not stuck on wheather your going to get it just because of the pain factor and for the reason of it being awesome! but anyways, i'm not sure about the nose SO much but i do know it hurts because i attempted to do it myself and just couldn't go threw with it it hurt so bad but now i feel bad and wanna get it done so good luck!|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	it depends on your pain tolerence but     nose  like a 2/10 but your eyes will tear up since its so close to your eye    and industrial is probably about a  4.5/10|`|QKW3aHGUaa	Those will be more painful than piercings in fleshy places like eyebrow, lip, navel, etc.|`|QAQHJFI9aa	Industrial for me was like a 3 or 4. Way less than I expected. I even decided not to record the moment on camera in case I ended up crying my eyes out and then my family would embarrass me with the me! But I ended up just laying there, no weird reaction.
5SiFjlBGaa	Use brown shadows, and mascara. Black mascara might be a little to dramatic for you. Good luck.|`|g2BQhmmqaa	you can use colored contacts to make them more blue you have pretty eyes|`|5hb6VUglaa	There are 2 ways...    1) If you need glasses, get colored contacts, get them in blue.    2) You can wear really bright blues, on some people it makes there eyes brighter blue.|`|s0ENa2Pvaa	Try wearing colors to bring out your eyes to make them seem bluer, makeup would help as well.  Try colored contacts as well.|`|D2IapzLtaa	Im also blond and have blue eyes. I know it's really hard to get the blue out so what i use is a blue eyeliner sometimes and black mascara. It really works.|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	almay has a great selection dedicated to bringing out the colors of eyes|`|t8gWcBaeaa	color it. duh.
xT8Sk426aa	Nothing. Basically everyone owns a pair of those, so they probably won't think anything of it.|`|kogfFMgmaa	a lot of girls wear ray bans its like a huge fad.  wear them if u wanna fit in.|`|o4LBt2QVaa	i personally think its super awesome. its my style and i look great in them(according to the comments on facebook). but it makes a person look like a wannabe if you dont look good in them.|`|ngyieY6laa	It is okay to wear 'em.|`|c23b3ee77030a348379e2063741235b8aa	Wayfarers are classic. Audrey Hepburn wore them. Tom Cruise wore them in Risky Business. Wayfarers can do no wrongs. EVERYONE looks great in them!|`|1eRuZjOraa	A girl wearing Wayfarers is just plan sexy if it looks good on them. Check out this blog post of girls wearing some Wayfarers: http://shadesdaddy.wordpress.com/2008/09...    Its sexy for sure as long as you have the face for it.|`|Wpq4qUllaa	if mary kate does it then you know it's gonna look cute :)
iZf62jacaa	i have this lotion that it called euceren its for really dry skin. i dont know if i spelled it but its like u-ser-in. thats how u say it. it works really good for dry itchy skin:)|`|OvsgyxxDaa	jergens ultra moisturizing one (or pretty much any jergens). it's really good. or olay body quench.  you can try aveeno,vaseline,eucerin, and goldbond. those are really good ones too! :)    try going to the stores and pump a little lotion on your skin and test which one feels the softest and gives the best results! hehe|`|LhGlOmI4aa	St. Ives.
5SiFjlBGaa	Don't pull your lid. Get a really sensitive eyeliner, so sensitive that once it touches skin it leaves a marking. Take that liner and just place dots along your lash line (starting from the inner eye to the outside). Then take a thin angled brush and smear the dots on your lid. Hope this works out for you.|`|1brMbc8Daa	I never put eyeliner on my top eyelid because it's such a difficult task. So I just put a bit of eyeliner/mascara on the bottom eyelash/eyeline and then a shade darker mascara on the top eyelash to give the illusion of a dark lash line.|`|WC4XTU4Daa	Pull it sideways (like you're doing the asian-eyes thing). Tehn get as close to the lashes as possible. You can always wipe some off if it smudges. I find it useful if you tip your chin up so you just squint.|`|LO7arkbIaa	it takes time to get good at it|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Soooo... when you look in the mirror your head is a "normal" angle. Tilt you head up put keep your eyes looking downward. Then take your pencil and go as close to the lash line as possible.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	when ur applying it angle upwards so ur like on the bottom of the top lid ( if that makes sence|`|rVWPRYoEaa	search it on youtube, there are lots of tutorials|`|sidRlOL9aa	make sure you have liquid eye liner, that works better and easier then the pencil. start at the inner eye and work your way out. A thin line willl look nice so make sure your not putting it on bold
rwVJ72Dwaa	haha. since the scar doesn't lie on a smooth surface, the curad scar therapy sheets won't stick as well and could fall out of your bra/shirt which would be unfortunate, since that stuff is not cheap.    there's a cream/gel they sell called Mederma which gets rid of scars pretty quickly! i've been using it on the corner of my nose to treat gross acne scars and they've cleared up within 2 weeks (even though the tube says 3-6 weeks!) it sometimes got a little flakey, but flaking on your boob is better than a semi-sticky sheet!  =)
QiVWyKsJaa	Tell your best friend how you feel and go out with the other girl.Don't be afraid to tell the truth and date different people. She is going out with your best friend so tell her its weird for you and you need time to adjust to the new situation. Tell her you would love to go out with her friend but as a double date with your friend and his girlfriend. I hope this helps.                                              Gossip_girl|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Just make other plans for that day.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Hey...if you are not into that chick then that is IT...Game Over.    Tell her that you appreciate her help and that her friend is hot...and you know some guys who may want to go out with her. (this will kill it...trust me...no girl wants to be introduced to another guy by a guy who rejected her).    That way you come out on top with zero enemies...    Now, back to you and how you are going to find a girl...hmmmmmmm....PlentyOfFish.com is free and is the largest dating site in the world...more members and it is international...Input your favorite traits and hit "Search" and see what happens.    As far as being nervous goes...I understand that...I am very shy and I get totally nervous if the guy is Cute! The cuter, the more nervous I get...making him think I am a total nutcase. With uncute guys I relax, act like myself and I can be charming...but then I can't get RID of them!    You need to find a guy friend who is outgoing and hit on girls together...you won't go for the same girls anyway so what is the harm?    Another option...find a really shy girl you are hot for and hand her a note providing your name, phone, facebook, email and IM...let her know in the note that you are shy with cute girls like her so you thought you would try a note in case you got too nervous to ask her out.    In the end...everybody likes a quiet person...it gives them space, they can blab to us, we are low maintenance, and they aren't jealous because we don't like meeting people and certainly would not flirt. Plus...we are funny.    Good luck!!!|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	Tell your friend's girlfriend that you're into another girl right now, or that you just aren't interested. She'll pass it onto her friend.|`|g6tku4aVaa	I have done this before...I swear..go out with her and be yourself..if you don't like her like after u get to know her ..tell her u don't think it will work..go out to dinner.talk about ur life.  it works..just depends on you  good luck!!  |`|HYw0YE7Gaa	try it out and do a couple of things with her and if you find that you kind of are into her than ask her out i guess depending on how much you like her when you are done handing out with her.|`|Q0CfRoZ5aa	if you dont like her than dont go out with her!!!! duh.  just tell her nicely you arnt ready for her.|`|92yiQo7uaa	Tell her you are a woman trapped in a man's body|`|60ApQsGOaa	just.telll.her. its not that hard|`|qbbkaucbaa	There's no harm in going on one date. Just go out with her and see how it goes. If you still feel the same way by the end of the date atleast you can say you gave it a shot!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just tell her you sort of have your eye on someone else and just say you don't want to ruin your chances.|`|NO9qfLhlaa	Tell your friend's girlfriend that you are already interested in someone else and you want to see how that goes before you get involved with anyone else.|`|C8b3KsrGaa	Tell her the truth, say it with me, "I am just not that into you" Hey isn't that the name of a new movie coming out. I dunno, tell her that you guys should start as friends and see what comes out from there, starting there never hurt nobody.|`|WTf0caplaa	If you go out with her, there are two major possibilities:     1) It doesn't work out, you guys are still friends and it's not so awkward--because it wasn't anybody's fault, sometimes it just doesn't click.    2) You like her more, she likes you more... it works out for the better.    Of course, there are possible variations on those two scenarios... but I think they are the most likely.|`|Dn6xHIIRaa	well, just tell her that you think it's better to be friends. that way, when she comes over, it'll be like you're hanging out with one of your girl-friends instead of a girlfriend.|`|OuQJYm4zaa	youve just got to be honest,  start initiating to hang out with groups of your friends  and tell her you know I think we'd go better together  as friends but be as nice as problems don't patronize her or anything but  talk to her like friend to friend you know? Be nice about it|`|K0jBt9umaa	well just act friendly and talk and stuff but just give hints. she might not be very into you yet either she might just want to get to know you better. good luck though|`|fw8qNhEfaa	You should just tell her the truth, if you just want to be her friend, she should b ok with that    it shouldnt matter, whether your dating or not|`|9Jam6lCKaa	maybe you should go see the movie "hes just not that into you".  then just tell/hint to her that you dont want a relationship.  =]|`|YRsCMVvnaa	Get her to talk about herself.  Keep the conversation all about her, and off of you. That should help with the whole nervous problem. As far as telling her you're not into her, that may be difficult. I suggest you get her to lose interest in you and get her to be "not into you".
cuR7T3praa	They have only been in existence since 1993 which is not too long.  Use the site below and ask them the questions you want answered and if all of them are not answered to your satisfaction forget them.  However, if you decide to go with them make sure you have made a copy of the information you got when you contacted them and keep it on file and also put it someplace in your computer.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Do your research. I haven't had any dealings with them but there seem to be a lot of people asking if they are a scam, which is a worry. Also google them + scam to see what comes up, read everything, then make up your own mind    But remember, a legitimate agency will never charge you anything upfront to get started - not for classes, competitions, photography, registration or anything else. If you get signed by Ford, Elite or any other top agency, your only expense is your transportation to their office. The agency covers your portfolio, comp cards, and even hires coaches if you need help with your walk or posing.
ouvvS1Ylaa	crunches will work eventually,  but to see abs you have to lose fat on top of the muscle,  which you can do by cardio, like running.  also try doing obliques, bicycles, and plank.  i would suggest buying some dumbells to work on your pecs and arms.
73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Definitely the 1st one. It's gorgeous!|`|aQT37RaKaa	1st one FOR SURE :) have fun!!|`|CVQa88Ujaa	I had a person on this site email me my advice on this same exact dress.   1 is the best choice.

Excellent choice.|`|GmDwOhwZaa	because of your brown hair i say the first one because it will make you stand out. on the other hand, the last one was BEAUTIFUL. i think the blue though, its pretty and classic.|`|sidRlOL9aa	I like the second one|`|Re524Otfaa	I love the second one, but they're all fabulous!      |`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	I say the first one, with your dark hair and tan skin, it would be the most flattering.|`|JINK3IHiaa	The 1st definitely, but the 2nd wouldn't be that bad|`|o4LBt2QVaa	first deffffff...the second and third just looks like lingerie. XP|`|iDAeBNA4aa	second one|`|1brMbc8Daa	I actually don't like any of them because...  The first one is too formal breakfast.  The second one matches your skin tone too much.

re31gLMqaa	I made that dress! LOL i am a perfossenial Fashion designer. It  is $5,000,000,000 sorry :'(|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	Miley is a multi millionaire    these dresses costs thousands of dollars!|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	this is probably a designer dress so it will be very expensive|`|cxVmq2kraa	Don't do that to yourself.|`|SEUg7HIXaa	Please don't wear that to prom. That dress is NOT made for dancing or having a good time.
F3FblS6Haa	i've heard that zapzyt is very effective. you can buy it at a drugstore or ulta and it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide! needless to say, you can't put too much on your face since it's so concentrated, but i bet it'll get the job done|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Clean and Clear works for me, but I don't know what's in it.|`|8THz1sp9aa	None.     Drink lots and lots of water. Change your diet, no more junk food, fast food, fried foods, etc.    Buy unpasteurized apple cider vinegar and mix two teaspoons every night and morning with a cup of water. This clears out the toxins in your body and really helps clear up skin. Trust me I tried everything from topicals to herbal remedies, & so on. Look up all the wonderful benefits of ACV if you don't believe me. (i know it sounds disgusting but it works wonders!!) You can also dab a tiny bit of ACV onto a qtip or cotton ball onto the red areas on your face and it'll help reduce the redness. good luck!|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	clearasil and clean and clear works great!|`|BLQsD0w5aa	AcneFree. It's cheap at drugstores. People say it's similar to Proactiv, but just like you, i hate Proactiv! AcneFree works a lot better, plus you'll save money!|`|hbIG2C3Taa	neutrogena skin id?  some of its products from skin id has salycylic acid, while others have benzoyl peroxide (depending on the id you get)  its worth a try.    for proactiv, i think its too harsh, but its lotion comes in handy for spot treatments of pimples, so dont totally ditch it if you have it.    acne.org has good product reviews, tidbits on acne, etc.  so you should take a look on that site    xanga.com/ricebunny has good tutorials on the side links for acne treatments, skin care, etc. (as you scroll down you'll see lots of links on the left side for masks, face cleanser, etc)
fMPyLqW4aa	Cute! I love it. I think it's totally apporpriate... finally, a girl that knows how to dress her age.|`|NoZAofgOaa	yes, i think its really cute    best answer?|`|FQuuztpQaa	Either it's fine because you like to show  your body or it's bad cause i't shows the roll section, the design sucks.|`|8cP8tSNyaa	it's a bit risque for a 13 year old (i'm your age but I wouldn't wear it... I would look kinda wierd) but if you look mature enough and have the right figure (which i assume you do) you can pull it off :-) (just no boobs hanging out)|`|CruxCjIraa	yeah thats adorable i like it alot|`|qog0Yd72aa	ehhh..  its okayy, but not my style. i like two pieces betterr.  good luck thoo =)|`|qE5XIAsYaa	it's actually cute for a one piece. I would buy it and i'm 22 y/o|`|l9lBWiR1aa	Yea! That would be cute or the red stripped one is cute tooo. Pacsun has really cute bikinis too, if you wanna look there|`|MIfgWW7Eaa	yeh thats cute!
OpdHN6Ivaa	I love Great Lash by maybelline! I think the curve brush is awesome i can get all my lashes with only one swipe so it's the best for me!    I think you could do with dark brown or brown because black is too harsh for people with blonde hair. YOu should definetly try great lash. it's only 4-5 dollars, last time i checked.|`|aCLqYRtEaa	use brown mascara or like theres black with bluish tint i like one from clinique from macys its amazing i forget what its called if u wanna know like ask another ? but yeah.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I think you should wear brown mascara or navy. I think black is too harsh for blondes. My favorite is Neutrogena Healthy Volume.|`|f36589e6e79860b7c91907c99e22a735aa	Maybelline Colossal!  I love the thick brush and yellow bottle!  It's cheap and works great.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	my fave is DEF great  lash by maybelline    the thing is though, you HAVE  to know how to apply it right. because its really clumpy    so put the wand as close as possible to the rims of  your eyes and do a clean, quick swipe|`|JtcWfQ1uaa	Intense XXL extensions its gold and black  and if u ever go to sephora get givenchy (ball wand some have issuse with it runnig)  and at mac there plush   also the extension tubes red and white     BTW i heart mascara too!!!|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	that one with drew berrymore on the commercial..with the orange bottle..|`|Q80RH1UAaa	I use Maybelline Great Lash Blackest black. Brown is best for blondes and blue eyes. Maybelline Great Lash was voted as  1....  http://makeup.about.com/od/splurgesandst...  On here it was rated  2...out of all of them its probably the cheapest though for about $4. Also try a curved brush or a clear mascara. I also like Loreal Voluminous
kCdISEGqaa	It's pretty bad, I would give it an 8.  I am heavily tattooed, and the thighs hurt pretty bad.  There are a lot of nerve endings on the thighs, and the skin is very sensitive, so don't let anyone tell you it won't hurt.  I had to take a couple breaks during my color session it hurt that bad.  Don't let people lie to you and tell you it doesn't hurt, they are usually the people who quit after the shading, and accept a black and gray tattoo!!!|`|htMOl3c4aa	like a 3. the only tattoos that really hurt are the ones on the bone.|`|8THz1sp9aa	My artists apprentice just recently got a large piece on his thigh and he said it hurt pretty damn bad. But he said it was all well worth the pain.     Just remember that everyone takes pain differently though. I've been told countless times that tattoo's hurt more on bone, and it's actually the opposite for me, it hurts worse on the more fleshy areas.     You will just have to find out for yourself. But I'm sure you will be fine. :] good luck|`|yM5otDoLaa	I heard that ANY tattoo hurts, but I'm afraid of needles. A thigh tattoo might not hurt as much as other tattoos, though.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Yes, they can be painful, but pain is temporary. It will certainly hurt less than your foot.

I would personally wear it with some nude skin tone platform heels with a peep toe, or some strappy gold sandals. I love it. Most people will say wear silver shoes... but thats just plain tacky. Gold is now totally acceptable, and looks puuuuuurfect with pink.    ( I really don't love that you have a Capitol letter at the start of every word... )|`|BZewDqNMaa	Well whatever you do, don't do anything cheesy or cheap with it. The dress already has barbie written all over it. So if your gonna do it, do some heels that will make it look more chic.

U0ae2atdaa	aww i love that shirt! and pac sun haha!  well what ive seen a bunch of girls do in my school with those shirts is pair it with a white/or black tank and leave a few buttons open and then also buy the shirt a little bigger and put leggings under it with those boots everyone has. it actually looks so cute.  but otherwise if the shirt is too short for leggings or you dont like that look i would wear it with skinny jeans and black flats with my hair down and a cute headband. Good luck! you'll look great!|`|DEMQR8piaa	Try these!   http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat... A wonderfully girly ring that matches your top!    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...

If your hair is really that colour(of your avatar), that shirt will look great on you. Wear it with skinny jeans and boots, and pull your hair into a high ponytail. Mascara your eyes heavily and plain lipgloss on your lips. And hoop earrings(silver) will add a nice touch - unlikely, but it works!|`|t09RDgGfaa	Where a colorful cami under neath   the shirt buttoned just under your bust  skinny jeans in a dark wash  furry boots!  and hair up in a pony tail|`|BsifmqzPaa	http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=62813...    hope you like it!|`|dkqlW0A0aa	Just make sure u have makeup on!
58c66f5d9f176307f4eed106c93a25d1aa	If I were you i'd wait a few more months. It might seem like it's ready to be changed when it's actually not... changing it too soon might result in ugly scarring that can't be reversed. I know you're excited but wait a bit longer... :D|`|Qta1HgWCaa	We always recommend 6 months, just to make sure there are no infections and it heals completely.|`|2vxbvZ7Paa	You can change it after 3 months as long you don't put in a bigger piercing in it. If you do put in a bigger piercing in you have to wait for about 6 months.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	yeah i'd imagine so..
dxeb0BfBaa	ONCE. Hair should touch hair only once, ever! Some people might colour their hair 10 times without it breaking off at the root but not all hair is the same & no matter what colour seriously damages hair. It is extremely risky to colour hair more than once. Use a wash-in colour like L'oreal Paris Colour Pulse which lasts 6-8washes to keep your colour looking fresh. It is ok to retouch your roots.|`|a1esFJ53aa	I reccomended it earlier in another answer and i think it could benefit you if you wanna dye your hair every now and then, it's called naturtint. It's made out of vegetable Ingredients, it also has no ammonia, resorcinol or parabens and it doesnt damage and dry the hair like usual dyes so it can be used regularly!  I used some of the stuff today for the first time so I gotta wait and see how it works out, it didn't sting when it was applied either which was great.    http://www.naturesdream.co.uk/naturtint/...|`|k0SES81qaa	i used to dye mine red every 6 weeks or so and my hairs fine and healthy,you've just got to look after it once you've dyed it.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	As long as your hair is healthy, don't worry about it. I do root touch ups on people every 4 weeks and their hair is fine. If it makes you nervous, just find the same color in a semi permanent. It has no ammonia or peroxide in it and will not damage your hair in any way. It will gradually wash away and you can do it as much as you want.|`|GKJEgidzaa	You could probably dye it again now.   As long as its a henna dye (a darker color) then it won't do much damage anyway. Its really dyes with bleach that make your hair go lighter that really damage your hair.|`|F5mDT0Kiaa	no thats about 5 months ago you you should be fine. make sure you dont wash your hair for two days then dye it as your natural oils reduce damage.     hope this helps|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Dying your hair darker adds to your hair, it will nourish it, especially if the colour you use is red based. You will probably only really have problems with the condition of your hair if you bleach it over and over again..    Of course if you keep dying your hair different colours in quick succession it will end up all different colours...    Hope this helps...|`|cz9fRO6zaa	no you should be fine - i get my roots done every 6 weeks, i use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner for dry and damaged hair. used it before i started dying by hair though. i also deep condition it every 6 weeks as well.   as long as you condition and keep as much natural vitamins in your hair it will still look healthy and nourished.|`|cOuRQQPfaa	I would say it is alright to dye it and has been for a while lol, obviously your hair will eventually begin to get damaged but as long as your condition it and such and try not to straighten it often and stuff it will not be too bad but it will not get extremely damaged unless you let it so don't worry to much about it. =]    xox|`|oCaLXFyOaa	I dye mine every 6-8 weeks and have done for ages, haven't had any problems I can complain of!

bdaaAWW0aa	Eyelash curlers work best on clean eyelashes. Make sure eyelashes are free of mascara. If necessary, use eye makeup remover to remove old mascara. With your blow dryer on low heat, blow air on the curler for no more than 5 seconds. Touch the metal. If it's hot, let it cool for a few seconds. You don't want to burn your eyelid. Or just get a heated one :) Open the curler, clamp lashes near the roots. Hold for a few seconds. Never curl lashes after you apply mascara , because the mascara dries, lashes can stick to the curler & be torn from the roots. Don't bother curling bottom lashes.|`|CN4e8sZZaa	dust face powder over your eyelashes before applying mascarra x|`|WKA1rBa5aa	yeh use an eye lash curler on them before putting any mascara on. you can also get mini- eyelash brushes that will separate the lashes when u brush it through. Then I would use a good mascara that doesn't have a thick brush that defines and separates lashes. try max-factor they do some good separating mascaras that i swear by! you could also try applying a clear mascara before putting a coloured mascara on to help define and straighten the lashes. hope this helps x

vlOnBMaVaa	Honey, your hair is gorgeous! It looks so healthy and taken care of! The shine and highlights are lovely. I understand that you're sick of your hair style though. I feel that sometimes, too. What you need is layers and texture in your hair. That will make it feel lighter and give it body and volume. You don't necessarily need to take length off of your hair. Just ask your stylist to give you face-framing layers and tons of texture. I hope this helps!    This is what I mean by layers and texture. Again, you don't have to go short. http://www.thehairstyler.com/images/Amer...    http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...|`|pIMXHktGaa	why dont you get highlights and side bangs.|`|n7hw8cdRaa	um...i kinda like ur hair like that  but, side bangs that are right above ur eyebrow..and layered hair   :)|`|98b0f5c88f96b33aece809a195cf67f9aa	I Completely agree with the side bangs and some longer layers starting a little bit above your chin.|`|C6m2RTZjaa	maybe a little lighter color like this:  http://www.food-force.com/images/drew-pr...    and maybe a style like this:  http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/p...    hope i helped! :)|`|sGSv8Nzjaa	curl ur hair and get bangs and it will look WAY pretty!|`|1QpigqCNaa	get heavy layers and side bangs:)if you are allowed to color it then do dark chocolate brown!email me for anything else|`|1ehUQH9Oaa	aw what every you are so pretty.

ZyQFd6NVaa	Sexy Bedhead hair: Don't wash it. Sleep on a satin pillowcase to prevent knots in the morning. When you wake up, your hair's natural oils will give your strands pretty separation and movement.     Try a paddle brush. Ditch the big round brush when you blow-dry and grab a paddle brush instead. Lightly run it from roots to ends as you dry, but don't pull hair too tight  you want strands to have an undone texture.     Use a spray wax. Spritz all over, then twirl random sections around your fingers  the wax will give you that awesome piece-y look.     Try: Sally Hershberger Genius Spray Wax, $13, Walgreens stores|`|OSD5by7Oaa	mmmm curl it!!!  hahaha jk lol but do it
akiJ1zJ3aa	Pull your eye down like your going to do your waterline and just right above the lashes. Or sharpen your eyeliner really good and try pulling your bottom lashes up. Then fit the eyeliner right under the lashes and draw. I always go right below the waterline but still pull my eye I just point the eyeliner down towards my lashes and draw. I hope this helps and I am not a cosmetoligist so don't expect a miracle. LOL :P|`|GQD7B01Vaa	Try putting a waterproof like mac fluidline with the 266 brush on you waterline not your lower eyelid it works great and they come in a lot of colours! :)|`|x7Tt8WwGaa	I have Urban Decay eyeliner as well, and it is very waxy and thick. I suggest buying a liquid eyeliner and using that on your lower lid. Then there is no way for it to get caught in your lashes.

It's just your body shape, and bone. You could lose all the weight and your bones could still make you look heavy. Don't worry about them. Next time your standing next to them think ' Yup, I'm the one with a booty!'  Guys love butts.|`|mp8XgvFDaa	anorexic is out  i would say your the perfect size.  in my math class theres boys that sit behind me, good looking boys.  and whenever we aren't talking i hear them whispering about how they think muscular legs on girls are sexxy and chicken legs are gross.      be proud of what you have!
qE5XIAsYaa	the same size you are in men is the same size you are in boys or kids. It wa be 5y for (youth) not "c" for (child's size) just pointing something out. I like in NY try going to a store like "station"

yeFZzstvaa	I have the same question- like Free People but cheaper.    Our best bet is thrift stores- you'd be surprised. And you can pick and choose at places like Urban Outfitters, if you want to go down that road.
fDUCEX3Haa	Try the giovanni brand for hair. It's really good, and organic. For makeup you could look into mineral makeup. Everyday minerals is natural and claim to be organic.

1SIXXye4aa	I don't know why your skin seems darker.  Maybe its because when your in school the lighting is different.  At any rate you should embrace your dark skin color as many people have to "fry" their skin in tanning beds to make it darker.  Don't be ashamed-be proud of it!    As for removing facial hair- bleaching is not going to work for you honey because BLONDE OR WHITE hairs will contrast with your dark skin. Duh!    Try waxing, tweezing, or maybe even nair.    Good luck.|`|oil8ALh4aa	In the mourning people can seem a lil pale cause their still tired but during the day they start to wake up a lil bit more
18f999ab165f7d95224dcdb1f5f871a2aa	Nope. Your hair matches your eyes and that is like "WOW"|`|X2lesqhRaa	You might want to think about it. It can be very damaging. Also your hair colors not so bad.  Ok so at your side, recomended hair colors.  Darker:  Chocolate brown  black  Dark Auburn (a red-like shade)  Dark Red.    Lighter:  light flame red  Cornsilk (very bleached blonde)  Sun Bronze    highlights:  Cornsilk  red medium  chocolate brown    Once you do get your hair died, try biosilk's, damaged or color treated hair collection. It will keep your hair healthy and stop the color from losing its strenth!  Hope that helped|`|6tRN09Sdaa	yeah i say dye it darker. you look pretty.

The first for America's Next Top Model, which obviously was full of skinny girls. You think, yeah they look okay, but the next advert was for that Playboy Mansion thing.

You're super cute!|`|FSpL3s1raa	I wouldn't.  It looks like you're naturally cute, so I wouldn't mess with that with hair color.  I guess I agree that you might have a tiny bit too much eye make-up on.  You could probably solve that problem by changing from black eyeliner to brown.  This might look better since you're fair skinned.     Telling you not to wear mascara is crazy.  You can never have too much eye lash.    I also wouldn't part your hair in the middle, like some have suggested.  A side part is more flattering for almost everyone.|`|VYJp1Tifaa	no ur really pretty  i don't get how the really pretty girls ask these types of questions on yahoo because u r really pretty|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	No way!! your so pretty!!!!|`|TffovEkXaa	no, i htink that u r very pretty!!!!!! i like how u do ur makeup!!!!!! but mabe u shoul dget side bangs!!!!!!! thoughs would look cute!!!|`|d3ctyNxRaa	You look fine the way you are, you don't need to change a thing. :)|`|faVvldMeaa	your very pretty  If you really want to change your appearance i would suggest dying your hair a diferent color  but other than that you look fine :)|`|u7o75zipaa	You're pretty like you are..

Or-  Just be really super good for like a week, then be like "mommy, Ive been really good and I really want to get my navel pierced"  Ask her what specifically she hates about the piercing, then discus it.  Tell her you could be doing worse stuff, like drugs.

If they still say no, then wait until you can do it without their consent.  Nagging them about it won't help you at all, it'll probably just make it worse.

Just take some of your hair (the hair on top and by your ears) and pull it into a ponytail. Then just leave the rest of your hair down under the pony.    Sorry I couldn't find any pictures.

2nGa3N38aa	first think about what you are doing before you do it then you wouldn't have the problem remember we have choices|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Surgical dermabrasion or laser treatment. Both hurt a hell of a lot and laser treatment will be expensive.    If you try and remove it yourself you could end up dead from blood poisoning and anyone who tells you there are creams that can take a  tattoo off is trying to con you out of money or mock you.|`|hXwX8dwsaa	Wrecking Balm|`|AA12142423	if you remove it yourself, you'll just have a scar there anyways. your choice.

Right. Just go get it lasered, it's the safest and most NORMAL way. Wtf seriously, hot iron?|`|6BPcL1ruaa	Go to the Tattoo Parlour, there is a remover he has. It's just like getting the tattoo put back on but less pain. There will always be a scar, but not color or details, well as much.|`|zw1jSDkQaa	Dude dont iron your arm, nor sand it well you could try sanding it but itll be painful; best advise would be going to a local tatoo parlour and ask how it could be removed also try different ones to find a cheap price    good luck and i guess your paying the price of your tatoo now lol|`|JzgzvPxvaa	do to a tattoo artist and see if he will tattoo you with lemon juice. it eats the pigment away. if its a "ghetto" tattoo it will proabably work well, but if its professional, probably will only lighten it, but this will help if you want to get it covered up with a different tattoo. it will hurt, but alot less than a belt sander.
4OiovFdSaa	oh, just do it yourself. its pretty simple. you could use a semi permanent dye that comes out in a month but i don't know if you were thinking of natural or artificial punchy red, but if you were going for natural looking color you should get clarol natural instincts. a punchy artificial red would be harder to find. i myself have no idea where to find that in a semi permanent dye. or if you wanted to go with the permanent dye you could just do it and then go with a new shorter cut to completely change your hair. although i don't know how long your hair is. But good luck! hair dye rox! :)|`|JQSwpstwaa	hey so yea i did that at one point  so u can buy a package @ the store and b very careful and it works lik MAGICCCC!|`|oil8ALh4aa	gah your school is retarded
laUWZapIaa	Ok it sounds like you have done your math on it,and you have presented every thing to your mom,  but she still say's no. This time try a different way, sit your mom down and ask her to tell you exactly why she will not allow you to get the piercing. Then talk to her about it while adding a little bit of information like reminding her you are gonna be 18 in just a year and then you would be able to get it on your own then, but let her know that you would rather get it now for your 17th birthday and share the experience with her. You may have to remind her that you are a good child and you do get good grades. And that she has raised you right, But that this is something you would like to have for your birthday, and something you would like to share with her. Let your mom know you would feel alot better getting it now with her permission than when your 18 without her permission. Let her know that it would mean more to you if she would agree to the piercing, and it would show that she does respect your likes and dislikes fro your self. Really sit down and talk to her, don't argue or debate, just talk! Sweetie, I hope you can get it! It will be nice to enjoy it now while your young. Then if you decide you want to close it up, you can.|`|WUwdDxWMaa	Just say at least its not on your face for example (Mom why cant I get it its not like its on my face like my lips and its not my tounge its for empowermant no one will see it but me unless im in a bathing suit and none of your friends have to know|`|K0iFV73Gaa	I AM APAULED!!!!!

It sounds like you've gone to a lot of work already. Maybe now it's time to tell her that you're going to get one when you're 18, her opinion or not. Explain that you can save the money and go out and get it legally in a year. I'm not sure what else you can do. If I was your mom I'd just let you get it already!|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	i tink if your super good shell give in also question why she dosn't want it  and see if you can tell her why her worries arent relevant|`|4Hr1gjxgaa	well i think uv done more than ne teen would 2 get it done lol but just b like its just like an ear piercin.if it it gets infected (wich rele doesnt happen alot) it wont take much 2 treat it.she wont have 2 c it cuz ur shirt will cover it.and its easy 2 clean.u just need 2 clean it with anti-bacterial soap and it only takes a month 2 heal.trust me i know what im talkin bout.i have done many piercins in my life i know the facts and i have it done myself lol
lIDCEiWuaa	Hello  One good tip is always to wear mascara, magazines say it brings out your eyes....wear it on your top eyelashes(special occasions on your bottom eyelashes). Makeup depends on what color eyes you have....i have blue(green/blue/hazel works for this), light eyeshadow that matches with what your wearing(dark doesnt look good for these color eyes)....Lipgloss(shiny lips), light cover up and light blush! Eyeliners the best (my oppinon), sumtimes it looks good with it dark but normally it looks better with only a lil on(make it look natural)....and glitter on your eyes is really pretty just make sure not to use it all the time or it will seem like your covering up something     Dont forget to take everything off at night or eventually it leaves rolls underneath your eyes|`|kKPT2VCfaa	I included links to two girls that do really great makeup tutorials =D|`|4Hr1gjxgaa	ppl say keep it rele simple but srsly just use some mascara and eye liner and blush and mayb eye shadow but not alot of eyeshadow cuz that looks tachy and mayb lip gloss|`|RHtFUsgjaa	A really hot look is using an angled eye brush.. it gives the looks of ..Angelina Jolie eyes if thats what you want to call it    its very sleek looking when you wear it. :)
vlOnBMaVaa	I think the blue tint would look better with your skin. Blue is so flattering! Good looking glasses, by the way.|`|0U53vlhEaa	tinted blue!|`|0mrbE0Qbaa	blue|`|Re524Otfaa	Blue, I think.      
AA11404742	Radiation, whether from the sun or a tanning bed damages your skin.  And it IS radiation.  The "UV" they talk about is ultraviolet radiation.  It comes from the sun and from the bulbs in the tanning beds.      A suntan is evidence of that damage.  And the damage is cumulative - the more radiation you are exposed to, the worse it gets.  So if you want to look like a prune when you're 40, jump in there and soak up that tanning light.    On the other hand, if you want to look good at 40 while all your friends look 50, stay away from them.  Use sunscreen, stay covered up, and realize that a suntan looks good is a lie that the people in Hollywierd have sold to the public.    And if you go - you will spend all the time lying there in the tanning bed thinking about what I just said, and you won't enjoy the tan.|`|3Dhacs6caa	occasionally... wont hurt.   but my friend  went tanning a few days ago(shes 13) and she said her arms and legs were soar + she was red on her face and close to peeling. idk its ur choice but im not sure its too safe.  also, remember it depends on the person and how they react to sun.|`|w0BkU2czaa	I'm fourteen as well, and I was literally the whitest out of all my friends. I started tanning in a tanning bed when i was thirteen, But you have to be sure to wear some type of lotion or sunscreen, just to be on the safe side and other than that you should be fine, just don't go in for more than 20 minutes on your first 2 months or so.|`|1ehUQH9Oaa	i'm fourteen and i have been to tanning salons. for me i'm fine. People say you could get skin cancer and stuff from it isn't true or else my over protective mother wouldn't let me do it.. Just make sure you dont go for to long    start at like 8 next 12 next 16 and just see how you react. Plus the poeple that work their will help you alot.  and if you decide no to you could always go to the store where they sell like the jergens natural glow. that stuff works really well

I wear eyeliner....sumtimes a lil dark but most of the time very little(make it look natural), everyone says my cheeks are rosy so i dont have to use blush but if yours arent id use light cover up and light blush    Also in magazines say that wearing mascara all the time brings out your eyes so i would use mascara on the top eyelashes and for nice occasions on the bottom eyelashes....Also light colored eyeshadow !!!  Hope it helps :P  good luck!!! :P|`|kpaDamciaa	if you want to not to OVER do it, you can just wear mascara and curl your eyelashes.     Blue eyeliner can sometimes look trashy with blue eyes depepnding on how much you put on.   Black or Grey would be pretty just lightly put it on on the bottem.   I'm told brown eyeliner can be pretty with blue eyes, you could give that a try. just play around with differnt colors and differnent things and im sure you'll find something you like.   hope i helped.|`|zDh2Qw9eaa	Never use a heavy foundation, maybe just a sweep of some powder. I recommend mineral foundation. Use soft brown eyeshadow, perhaps a brown or light charcoal eyeliner if desired. A very sheer and light blush, perhaps pink, and mascara. And don't forget the lip gloss.    If you have great skin I would just recommend some sheer pink blush, mascara and lip gloss. Perhaps only add the eyeshadow and liner on your flirty days.    Pretty much just whatever makes you happy. If going without makes you happier, do that. Boys are attracted to confidence. If you *know* you look good, they will know you look good as well.|`|LwbxOT9jaa	use soft colors that make your eyes pop! never ever use pink! use blues, greens, maybe even grays, those would look best

Usually I dont play the aging card with tattoos, because who gives a crap what you'll look like when your 60. But if it was just designed to look cool only, then it wont really mean much to you when your older, and you wont really appreciate it. Whereas a tattoo with symbology or some sort of meaning will still represent something.

idhcqr5Daa	Make sure you wash your face with a cleanser.   Gently massage in a face moisturizer while your face is a little damp.   Apply mineral powder foundation so that your pores don't get clogged.   Apply blush to your cheeks to add dimension.   Use a soft-colored eyeshadow for your eyes to keep it simple.   Since eyelash curlers hurt, i would prefer using a brow/lash comb.   Apply a natural-colored eye liner lightly   Apply clear, brown, black mascara to your lashes depending on your needs.   Wear your chapstick to keep your lips looking and feeling healthy   If your lips need color, gently blot on a little lipstick.   Apply a layer of lip gloss over the lipstick or for a little color and shine.   Most guys don't like heavy makeup, so keep it very simple and very clean.   Keep you eyebrows groomed!   It is important to look healthy. If have acne, buy a product to keep breaks-outs under control. Too pale? Get a little sun, but don't overdo it.Find a face wash that works for your skin type. Not every face wash works for everyone.   You should only wash your face two times a day: in the morning and before you go to bed. If you wash your face too much, your face will get really dried out.   Keep your hair off of your face whenever you can to avoid making your face oily.   Avoid touching your face at all, the oil on your fingers will get on your face and make your face very greasy. Always, always, always wash your hands before touching your face.   Always use a new face cleanser for a few weeks before you decide if it works. Changing your face regimen may result in acne, so don't judge quickly.   Check your makeup in natural sunlight. Some bad mistakes girls make are too much rouge, globby mascara, dark lipliner, penciled eyebrows or overplucked eybrows, strange-colored eyeshadow or foundaton that is the wrong color - all because it looked fine in their crummy bathroom light.   Get good lighting. Natural light is often best so try to have a mirror next to your window in the bathroom. Your makeup will probably look better because of this.   If your Mom or big sister wear too much makeup it doesn't mean you have to. The natural look with good skin is so much pretter.   Don't feel that you need to wear make up...especially to school!     Things You'll Need  Face Moisturizer   Foundation   Pink blush   Soft-Colored Eyeshadow   Lash/Brow comb   Eyeliner   Mascara   Chapstick   Lipstick   lip gloss   Makeup Brushes     x0x0_LEi|`|AA11285960	just get some basic black mascara, a little bit of dark grey or black eye shadow and a small bit of eyeliner... dont put it on too heavy at first, or it will look unnatural.|`|MjnXUBTaaa	ummm in 6th grade you dont make true friends. al the people that you think are popular got that way by making jokes about the teacher or a kid with bad skin. dont worry about being popular. use the time alone to discover yourself and then when you have real friends that dont give a crap if you have on make-up that is when you will be happy.   a bigger problem would be putting on to much make-up and getting attention from that. if you start to dress like a slut in 6th grade than by 8th you will be one.     just wear alittle mascara and a light nude shadow to make your face glow.|`|lIDCEiWuaa	Hello,this is what i started to do in 6th grade  i didnt wear eyeshadow often tho  One good tip is always to wear mascara, magazines say it brings out your eyes....wear it on your top eyelashes(special occasions on your bottom eyelashes).

All you need is a light light coat. The last thing you need is to go to school like a hippy.you could use a mascara  a brown eyeliner to finish of the eyes.    i love one of my powders i use from clinque its not really heavy duty so if you need like cover up or something it wont work, but if not it makes your skin tone nice and even to finish it off a gloss and maybe some bronzer or blush for color      hope this helps 8 )|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Natural beauty is the most attractive, you should just enjoy being a kid right now. Trust me, once you hit high school, it goes too fast!!!!!  But...............For when you want that more "polished" look, try using vaseline on your eyebrows and lashes to make them darker, also curl your lashes, which really opens up the eye.  A little gloss never hurts, and maybe some body glitter on your lids or cheeks.  Blush is pretty, but its definitely grown-up, so if you use it, go lightly so you don't end up looking like a clown!!!!!|`|DvDjij1jaa	You Should Try To Put On Some Mascara and Maybe some eyeliner and bronzer.|`|sn9T7nfraa	until you know the name of the products you want to use, i suggest you don't wear any.|`|n7hw8cdRaa	well, first of all, make up sucks  (take it from me, kinda-popular 7th grader)  its clogs pores and everything  but if  u rlly want 2:  mascara  stay away from like foundation and blush (bad for skin)  eye liner?  eye shadow  light stuff|`|NCvX4I0baa	You're only in sixth grade too much make up isn't so great for your skin. Wear some mascara and eyeliner. Keep it natural. If you're skin is pretty flawless than dont wear any "skin colored cream stuff". if you put that on the wrong way it could make you look like a pancake face. Use light color eye shadows, and don't buy into the idea of matching the color of your eye shadow with your shirt. go with more neutral colors that you can rock with anything.    good luck :)|`|SS87lbOCaa	EYE LINER AND MASCARA. SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT WILL BRING OUT YOUR EYES! :)|`|EjTV7SQdaa	Well, when i go to school (im in 9th grade) i wear Covergirl lashblast mascara. It works really good!  I wear it on both top and bottom lashes, but since your a little younger it would be best if you wear it on the top. I also wear eyeliner but only on the bottom. i hate wearing eyeliner on the top.  I sometimes wear eyeshadow, but not all the time. If i do then it is sparkly eyeshadows, with sparkly eyeshadow  it doesn't matter if you put to much on.  I don't usually wear concealer or face powders but i wear bronzer.  bronzer makes your face glow and it's sparkly and you just brush it all over your face.  I hope that helps you. and if you have questions just email me!!

The simplest line is usually the best one, like "Want to go to the formal with me?"  Boom, done, like the others said, the worst that can happen is that he says no, oh well, you probably won't even remember when you get older.  And if you go to an all girl school, you won't even have to deal with him being around all of the time if he does say no.  If he does say no, go anyways, I find that at school dances people usually hang out with their friends more than their dates anyways, you'll have fun.|`|AA10137059	Go for it!!  I say ask him!

At least you won't be asking yourself 'why didn't I do that?' in the future. Good luck! But if he says no, then just shrug it off and go by yourself.

JzgzvPxvaa	very much normal. it being itchy means there is new skin growing, just as when you shave and as the hair is coming back its itchy. just dont itch it. if you relaly have to just go wash your hands and then rub it. make sure youwash your hands though. the itching means your close to the end of  healing.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	My nose itched SO bad i wanted to rip my nose off! it's normal.|`|0i8XxXG9aa	I'm not sure. Itchy wounds is a sign of infection though, so just make sure you're keeping it clean and checked.|`|BDboz1eAaa	Yes, every new piercing gets itchy while it is healing.  :)|`|laUWZapIaa	Yes, as your nose starts to heal it will itch. And itching is a good sign, just don't scratch it to much. If you scratch it a lot you will irritate it and it may take longer to heal correctly. Just rub it a little if it itches.
vlOnBMaVaa	Unless your dermatologist tells you otherwise, you probably shouldn't use Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide together. I use Clindamycin and it can be a little bit harsh and drying. Benzoyl Peroxide can also dry your skin out. Try using the Clindamycin in the morning and the BP gel at night. If your skin becomes irritated, only use one or the other. If they just dry your skin, adequate moisturizing might solve the problem. Good luck!|`|vvDMpoMCaa	different times... i have benzoyl peroxide and using that you can't overload your face with other stuff because it can dry your face out.
F3FblS6Haa	keep it to 2-3 times a week max! don't do any more than that, or you'll continue to scrub away the first layer of skin. after a while, your skin will become raw and shiny since you don't have the first layer anymore. trust me, i've tried exfoliating more than 3 times a week and my skin looked 20 times worse than when i first started|`|hLu2j6IMaa	No, it's okay to exfoliate 2-3x's a week just not twice a day. It is very healthy for the face, I love to use natural food. Like oatmeal, or sugar.  GL|`|kogfFMgmaa	nope. ur supposed to only do it 2-3 times a week  othrwise ur face'll get all red nd raw

I've actually never heard of it before.
bAYVSfdJaa	You need an autoclave to sterilize it - neither alcohol or peroxide will kill all the germs on it.     Also realize if you screw up, you're friend can sue you for damages.  I really would rethink this whole thing.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	NO WAY!!!!    You should sterilize the needles, jewelry and tools in an autoclave. Clean the skin with Benzalkonium Chloride.     Oh, don't forget to do a piercing apprenticeship to learn how to actually do the piercing without messing it up.|`|jxtNodu2aa	If you don't know how to sanitize the nipple (not sterilize) than I would recommend NOT PIERCING IT!  Go to a professional please, I don't want your friend to lose a nipple because of you.

If it's very meaningful to you, and always will be then do whatever you want.     "Love Life"  "True Love Never Dies"  "True Love"  "Love Kills"  "Love Hurts"|`|qm9xrYiqaa	lifes a risk|`|C8b3KsrGaa	Made ya look|`|Sq7LvFHbaa	yes if you get it low, the needle for an epidural is a llot higher than everyone thinks..  as for the quotes......

xtrdlyJHaa	Use "color remover" first to get all of that dark dye out.     Have you two tried on wigs at a wig store to see how you look in the new colors? I did that and since I look terrible in any color other than my own, I didn't ruin my hair with chemicals.    If you insist upon dying it then at lease use TEMPORARY COLOR...this will wash out in a few weeks and you can either continue it or not...no harm no foul...    Go to the Revlon or Lloreal site and ask your question to their 24/7 colorist...but I think you will find the answer on their website first...it is very informative.    Good luck you stylin' girls!|`|ss48BEk5aa	Well, personally, I have dyed my hair 2 days in a row before and it was fine. It really depends on you. You risk your hair becoming thin or coarse but hey, mine came out fine! If anything, you can do a strand test in a spot no one can see and check to see if it damaged your previously dyed hair. I think you should be okay... if you want, wait a week, that will give your hair a chance to build up its natural oils and such.|`|98b0f5c88f96b33aece809a195cf67f9aa	As a cosmetologist i have seen more than enough girls come in with orange hair from trying to go blonde with box color. But if you must  you can re-color it right away, the hair is already damaged, waiting a week or 2 isn't going to cause less damage.

It's pricey but it really works.  I've had the same tube since last winter because I don't have to use it as often as I do Chapstick or Carmex.|`|64O0ydUfaa	I definitely recommend Burt's Bees.

AA11452842	My question is............If you lose, just how would that help?    I think you should work on your self confidence. Stop comparing yourself to some hyped media image..............|`|Qzx8CAkoaa	i dont think that a beauty contest would help you. those can be pretty competitive and if there are prettier girls it might make you insecure. you need to find things within yourself that make you feel happy and good about you. you are very pretty and you dont need a contest to show you that.|`|b4fc8fad0af48578cc360601a67e88d6aa	your really pretty, but i dont know if a beauty contest could help someone's low self esteem.|`|p9t0Xpm3aa	First of all, beauty contests don't help anyone with their self-esteem. They tend to do the opposite. You are a pretty girl, and I'm sure you would do fine in a beauty contest. Just don't do it thinking that if you win you're beautiful and if you loose you're ugly. That's not a good reason to enter into one and you are just setting yourself up for disappointment. Good luck!|`|MbFS6XFQaa	Beauty contests don't help self-esteem. If anything, they make it worse, especially if you lose.|`|iDAeBNA4aa	Come on Honey  you do not have low self esteem.  people who stand with their hands on their hips are full of confidence.  You are just fishing for compliments.|`|JnuU4c5raa	go for it but i agree with the other answer|`|fhVj1fMUaa	ur pretty but dont participate in a beauty contest.. cause tht wont help ur self esteem at all  u will feel really sad if u loose even though u dont deserve tht|`|BSWAkgCvaa	you and low self esteem do NOT mix...  you are sooo beautiful...and it's natural beauty too.  you have a rockin bod! your so lucky.!  be happy because your super pretty and your not conceded about it either.  good luck with a beauty pageant im sure you'll be able to do it.  =]]

5SiFjlBGaa	1. Skin stain foundation (1/2-1 shade darker than your natural skin tone). tap it out lightly  2. Concealer. Blend it in with your foundation.  3. Translucent powder.  4. Fill in your brows if the foundation or powder took some of its color away.  5. Line your top lid with a thin dark liner.  6. Sweep a nude colored eyeshadow over your entire lid.  7. Take a medium-chocolate brown (depending on how dark you want it) and sweep it on the outer corners of your eyes, then bring it up thru the crease. Don't go passed the middle of your eye.  8. Take the nude shadow and blend it where the medium-chocolate brown hits the eye. To soften the outer line of the medium-chocolate brown take the nude and lights blend it on the outer line.  9. Curl your lashes and apply mascara.  10. Add a little blush (looks like a peachy-rose kind of color)  and I'm guessing she has a simple lip but you can't really tell. If you have even skin then you can skip the first three steps.  I hope this helped.|`|zY6WXobEaa	Step 1. Your going to look beautiful so get ready!   Step 2. First off you will need liquid eyeliner, light and dark brown eye shadow, and non-clump mascara  Step 3. Start with the liquid eyeliner. If your not great at applying eyeliner that's okay you just have to keep your hand steady. Now don't apply it too heavy on your bottom rim but on your top apply just beneath your lashes (this is sometimes difficult).  Step 4. Now take the light brown eye shadow line your lid with it. Then take the dark brown apply it gently across your whole lid. Take the light brown again and apply underneath your brow and above what you just added gingerly.  Step 5. Now apply the non-clump mascara  Step 6. If you really want the red carpet affect (and the Eva Mendes look) you will want a nice blush and lip stick with gloss. If you have fair skin you dont want to make the blush too red and too brown a nice imbetween will work but lipstick usually works for all skin colours. For medium skin tone you will want a more redish brown blush with a brown lip. For dark skin tones a deep red/brown but no lip stick just a juicy gloss.  Step 7. You are now beautiful.|`|d7RxeNJbaa	hi you can try this one:  beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|lIDCEiWuaa	hello  i see that she wears eyeliner but its very very thin, which makes it look natural, also i see that she wears mascara on her eyelashes (top and bottom), she also is wearing cover up (it looks almost like a tan or a beige), she also is wearing blush(looks like rose or boysenberry), and last but not least, i really cant see but it looks like she is wearing a dark shade of eyeshadow :P  hope this helped

4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	Has anyone told you that you have a big butt?  There is always a person out there that will mention the obvious even though it is rude.  If you haven't ever been told that then it is probably normal size.  Kids are also good at telling you the truth.      Stand straight up and drop your arms to your sides.  Do your arms hang straight down or bow out a bit?      Turn to the side and look at your butt hump.  Does it look like a place where a cat could lay there comfortably?|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	Simple. Post a pic of it in the Yahoo Answers under poll, I believe, and let the guys decide weather you have a big one or not. No face necessary. You will find it rather useful. lol|`|yw0amT5daa	it is probably average sized like...it will depend on what you wear whether it looks massive or not|`|J5Msx6Cnaa	get naked and look if that don,t work try sitting on it|`|bOgvUEzvaa	Well, when your sleeping, big butts generally sneak away and terrorize the town.

And you want your clothes to be tight to show off your body.Since i'm guessing it's for a photo shoot. I'd go with the pink long sleeved hollister tee with jeans.

LJkPRqN0aa	you can wear ANYHING with uggs. and i disagree with the answer that says they only look good with your pants tucked in...thats totally not true. and i also disagree with the wearing with a dress comment....if you are going to wear a dress get different shoes for that. but other than that they are very casual and can be worn with anything.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	skinny jeans and a cute tee  or  skirt with leggings  stuff like that    :D|`|yuHV59Yhaa	I would wear something like this ~    http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=62803...    or this  ~    http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=61699...    lol im random i know|`|ALh5R37jaa	Uggs are pretty versatile.  You can wear them with jeans and a t-shirt, but you can also wear them with a nice shirt, and leggings.  As long as all the colors are right, uggs can make the perfect outfit for anybody!    hope i could help :)|`|747jw9LIaa	The only thing they actually look pretty good with are skinny jeans. Do NOT wear them with sweatpants and tuck the sweatpants in them. I hate when people do that. Don't wear them with leggings with a skirt either.|`|crPcHNEsaa	wear something like jeans and a tee from like hollister, aeropostale, abercrombie or american eagle but for a more relaxed look you can a a sporty suit from aeropostale and go like that i've seen it done several times and trust me it looks really cute|`|hPoXUHGhaa	boot cut and skinny jeans so its easy to tuck in  (they only look good tucked it)  flares won't look or work good with uggs.  any top and accessories are fine with it :)|`|AsiKL6laaa	Uggs can be used in so many ways!  First, you could use them with a skirt and no leggings, and then wear high socks under them so a little bit sticks out. It looks really cute.  Next, you could wear it with a skirt and leggings, and make sure the leggings reach under your uggs  Finally, wear them with jeans! Nobody can go wrong with a floral short dress over skinny jeans and uggs with a gray cardi thrown in!|`|nJeLOoUIaa	jeannns.    for the short oness::  skirts  shorts :)  dresses|`|jodsLXRiaa	sweater or simple dress|`|SyUeecsBaa	skinny jeans derr !
NKIY8Y6iaa	I don't know much about morticians, but I do know that they prepare the deceased for their funeral then burial and often take part in the burial service itself. Through research, morticians make approx. $50k yearly, on average in the United States.|`|zG08FjxUaa	Mortician|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Watch Six Feet Under.|`|kWYsXwnWaa	That is exactly what I am going to be. ^_^|`|eytlIKITaa	Mortician|`|2xa4414maa	That's a mortician.

cR8UZdi1aa	Yes, I would & Do.  I am very sensitive to chemicals, & there's some nasty stuff in make-up, so i pay a lot for good make-up, if I can't find "organic" then I go for "Bare Minerals" & "Illuminare" make up. They don't have anything extra added to it (including scents/fragrance which is also horrible for skin). I would pay whatever I had to pay too!

ALh5R37jaa	Why do you want to hide your body?  But if your looking for baggy skinny jeans, get the jeans from wet seal in 1 size too big. The waist is small, but they legs are big, so they would look alright.    hope i could help      and p.s. my best friend is exactly like you except she's a 00 and 5'7, so you can see how thin that is. She used to be self conscious about her skinniness but she's learned to accept her gift from god. She's going to be a model now, so don't hide your body, it's all right.|`|Sd0V2Sd9aa	My sisters the same size as you and when she wears size 3 skinny jeans their baggy on her so i think size 3 is what your looking for.|`|CN4e8sZZaa	Im The same size as you but 5'4 go to new look and get some 'boyfriend fit' jeans there amazing x    http://www.newlook.co.uk/navigation/Sear...
sHUnctqIaa	It does not hurt at all and most are a cream formula so as long as you don't glob it on you shouldn't have an trouble with it getting on things.     Bleaching facial hair is a great way to conceal unwanted hair until it is long enough to wax off. I used bleach to lighten my dark eyebrows a few times and found it be safe and effective, just as long as you follow the directions and use a formula for the face.     I like Sally Hanson, you can find it in most drug stores.|`|tP2lPrH9aa	I wouldnt use it it sounds like it would hurt and would really sting if it got in your eyes 8o
MX3wOs1vaa	You have to put yourself on a good regimen.  First I am assuming you are not using moisturizer because your skin already is oily.  If this is correct, this is a misconception.  If you are not using moisturizer on your oily skin, you are making things worse.  If you do not use moisturizer, your sebaceous glands which are your oil glands start secreting more oil because it is lacking moisture.  I would suggest putting yourself on a strict skin regimen.  Use a water based cream cleanser followed my a water based moisturizer in the morning.  Use the water based cream cleanser at night followed by a toner which removes the residue left behind by the cleanser and brings the skin back to a healthy ph, then use a moisturizer again at night.  Make sure you exfoliate the skin once a week.  Do not use foaming cleanser because it leaves a thin film of soap on the skin which can actually dry the skin out making the skin produce more oil.  If you follow a good regimen, your oil should start to balance out.|`|qyYYrIdmaa	Me too. It's just something you will have to put up with for a while. For a start, try not to eat too many fatty foods and carbonated drinks etc.  Also, do not use too many facial cleansers, they will actually make your face worse. Don't obsess about it, stress will also make it worse. Use a cleanser in the morning and evening and also just rinse your face with warm water every now and then.

SJLgRqgSaa	half up half down, put the top half into a massive quiff and then put a dimanonte tiara on top and then a veil down the back xx|`|pbVPS24zaa	I think your hair should be up but with your bangs down to the side to give a little edgy look. I think it should be up cause it may show off your choker and if you put in a veil it stays. I think you should get a veil because it gives a very classy look to your dress. A cathedral length veil will compliment your choker (a veil that reaches all the way to the floor).|`|gT80ocBwaa	Your hair should definitely be up in order to show off the choker and your shoulders in a strapless dress.  You can wear a veil if you want,  it will look fine,  but I don't think it would be necessary.  I'm sure will be beautiful, with or without veil.
1sfYOZNbaa	definatly uggs. uggs are more popular and emus are basicly just copying off of uggs.  uggs are much more comfortable because of the material inside|`|sA763neGaa	i personally really like emus, everybody has uggs and not like there is much of a difference, i just like to stand out a bit more that all the ugg people, they are practically the same price, so yeah! good luck|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	I don't really like either ones style. If you're going by popularity then I've never heard of emus before. But I'm not an expert on the style of those shoes so I wouldn't be able to tell you the quality, I'd probably buy UGGS if I were you     Hope I Helped!|`|7nrhPCf0aa	they're both cute but uggs are more in right now, emus are less expensive though  answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|pbVPS24zaa	UGGs are made of real sheep and are seen every. You would be such a copycat if you wear those because of popularity. EMUS are better because you don't see EVERY STUPID GIRL wearing them. If you want shoes because of boys no one cares. I say EMUS because UGGs are overused and seen to much. You would be the same like everyone else.|`|YCDS4Am8aa	i have personal experiences! i recommend buying uggs! although they are more expensive they keep their form better and their sole doesn't wear out as quickly as emus|`|hPoXUHGhaa	Actually Uggs are much more popular,  EMUS are like copys of uggs.  uggs has better quality and i think better look   so i would get uggs :)  make sure you take good care of them though!  they can get damaged easily.|`|Ul1OCP8Iaa	Uggs are more popular than Emus, but by quality, I'd say to purchase Emu's. They last longer in the cold and snow and rain, and are a better buy for the price.|`|vnOz03Aaaa	uggs, but in my opinion, both are pretty ugg-ly. try this link. http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...|`|GHsrjnYHaa	it depends on what style of clothes u wear. if youre skater, i would get emus. if youre preppy, uggs. theyre the same, just different brands. at pac sun, theyre having a huge sale on emu boots    http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-boots/...    uggs are muchhhh more expensive. short ones are $140 and tall ones are around $200.     good luck!|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	get neither. theyre ugly and expensive.|`|1ZDcq1zpaa	uggs|`|IwaaSQZcaa	I don't really know what emu's are, uggs are definately more popular!

qOKFuXfLaa	Use any pencil, but use very light strokes   You can even use an eyeshadow - Anastasia of Beverly Hills is a good eyebrow brand.    If you're not an expert in drawing even eyebrows, you can also use eyebrow stencils. I believe there are Brow tubes(they look like mascara tubes) that allow the brows/color to stay on without smudging or fading.|`|1Uon2sYhaa	i use revlon eyebrow pencil it works good!|`|vnOz03Aaaa	just use your regular eyeliner pencil.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	reg pencil not much|`|l5zJ1bldaa	any eyebrow pencil will work.  just get one to match the color of your hair.|`|gU4zcPAaaa	first of all, YOU SHAVED OFF YOUR EYEBROWS, WHAAAAAAAAT?    second of all, YOU SHAVED OFF YOUR EYEBROWS!

Benefit has some called She-Laq that works really well (I think it's actually made for eyeliner, but oh well, it's multi-tasking). You can also make sure to look for waterproof pencils because it'll last longer. Good luck!|`|WEhtWnl2aa	Any pencil should work fine, what you need to do is apply a translucent powder over the eye pencil to finish the look.  That should keep it longer.|`|m6umnjLtaa	I love Brow Zings from Benefit.  It comes with a wax and a powder and is very easy to use.

(where part of your hair is in a 'pony') do that a a beehive style with the rest curled. It will look gorgeous!  Good luck and happy styling. xx|`|Hvp96yKzaa	With your dress and your hair I would do something Miley Cyrus did. Curl up your hair in gentle spiral curls.    How to curl:    Take velcro rollers and roll them into a damp section of hair. Blow dry and take the rollers out. Mess them around with your fingers.    OR    Take a curling iron and take a section of hair and twirl your hair so it stays together. Roll your hair up and leave in for about 30 seconds. Take out and loosen the twirled hair with your fingers.    The low ponytail-bun (looks like taylor swift's in her music vid love story):    Take your hair and tie it into a ponytail (let some curly strands fall on the sides of your face, it looks really cute). Pull the ponytail up and give it one twirl around the band holding the ponytail up. Lift up the end and pin it in place with barrettes or a claw clip. let the ponytail down (if it won't hold in place try again) and let the rest of the hair fall over the clip/barrettes. Slide on a black headband or pin a cute clip on the side of your head.

MX3wOs1vaa	If you want it to shrink in size, put a thick layer of preparation H coolant gel.  Yes its for the butt LOL but it works wonders.  Everytime I see a zit coming to the surface I put it on and it never comes to a head.  If a pimple already emerged, the minute I put it on, it starts to shrink.  What I like about it is that it is not drying like other products.  It also works for puffiness in the eye area!  Good luck|`|wKjxESbBaa	pop it or medicate it with some cream or something if its got a white top on it just pop it, if its like all read or whatnot just wipe it with some cream eight er way keep it clean and don't touch it|`|F3YoOgh7aa	Neutrogena Microclear   visible results in just 4 hours  complete results in about 4 days!!!|`|4UhSsISBaa	get over it PLEASE  its just a pimple, its natural. wash your face daily. geez.  and don't pick it, that'll cause it to scar =/|`|91bdf399cb054ba840217064159ff93daa	tOOtH PASt3 ..

Shampoo and condition your hair as normal. "Blow-dry using a large round brush or paddle brush keeping the nozzle following the brush down the direction of the hair. This closes the cuticle and ensures you start with a smooth, clean canvas," explains Nader.     2. Apply a thermal protector (such as TCI Thermal Protector, $19.95). Tip: avoid oil-based products as they can weigh your hair down.     3. Section your hair, leaving the pieces at the nape of your neck out  this will be your starting point.     4. Take a two-centimetre piece, and place the iron as close to the roots as possible. Slide it through the hair slowly in a downwards motion, simultaneously turning the iron . "The work is all in the wrist," says Nader. "[Ensure] the movement is very fluid and in one long sweep  not too jerky." He also gives this good advice: the quicker you slide the iron the looser the curl, and the slower you slide the iron, the tighter the curl.    5. Continue working on the rest of your hair, one section at a time from back to front. Remember: the thinner the section of hair, the more intense and longer-lasting the results will be. Once you get to the front, be sure to wind the sections of hair towards your face (to avoid an '80s style). And don't curl shorter fringes  blow-dry with a large round brush instead.    6. To finish, use your fingers to comb your hair, raking them through to separate the curls. "Use a good flexible hold hairspray to keep the curl longer," suggests Nader.    Still struggling? Adopt the old adage: "If at first you don't succeed, try again." Once you get the hang of it, you'll be wondering why you ever thought it was tricky!|`|82niQjyCaa	make sure you are using a ghd protector spray as it will define the currls better x  also make sure you are leaving the straightners to heat up for a while as this will not help and you may need ghds if they are just straighteners as they reach a higher temperature thus improving the curls x  you may find instructional videos on youtube x|`|P7UgonvNaa	Maybe they aren't good enough? You need a really good pair to curl hair as well... it's also quite hard to do it yourself.

4DgEnlKZaa	Paul Mitchell is great.   http://www.my-hair-tools.com/paul-mitche...|`|YkN9VOOpaa	If you prefer thinner plates on a flat iron so you can curl your hair with it too, I would recommend the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium Ultra Thin 1" Flat Iron.    It works 40% faster than other high quality straightening irons and it reaches up to 450 F to give you shiny, smooth and moisture-rich hair. The extra-long plates allow for wider sections to be straightened, so it takes you less time to straighten, and the slim design makes it easier to handle while increasing styling flexibility.    It retails for $160, but I found one for cheaper on this site:  http://www.simplystraighthair.com/Straig...|`|tDaU7eYXaa	conair|`|4tHZunfUaa	CONAIR!!|`|lMoUQY1Jaa	babyliss pro elegance.  they are really good with great value  they can also curl hair really good.    highly recommended!!!|`|bvnzv923aa	Get a CHI.

5RoYyprkaa	Eh. It's not a good idea to take out and put in a stud every few hours on a fresh piercing. It irritates it and makes it harder to heal. I left mine in for three months before I took it out.    If you can get a stud with a flat top, then get that, and get some bandaids that closely match your skin tone, cut off a tiny piece and cover your nose piercing with that. You're not supposed to apply makeup directly onto the new piercing, so if you cover it with a bandaid and apply a little powedered foundation on it, it should be less noticeable.    It's better than taking it out and putting it in constantly.  Just make sure that you keep it nice and clean if your going to cover it like that.    You should also try to find a nose retainer too. it's flat and clear and barely noticeable.|`|STjfxYfDaa	well when i got mine pierced they told me not to take it out at all because it would close up. And I had a friend that took a nap and pull it out while she was asleep and by the she woke up it was closed.. she was asleep about 2 - 2 1/2 hours.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	At least a few months. If you take it out anytime before that, the hole will shrink and start to close. If you force the jewelry back in you will just end up with scar tissue.

3UQrUNMSaa	Vitamins are participating in metabolism process. Shortage of certain vitamins or minerals always lead to health problems. Especially it has a big influence on the hair and nails conditions. The main vitamins for hair loss are B vitamins, as well as A, E and C. Besides multivitamin complex you can receive these vitamins from food. Please find a list of the products, that are strongly recommended as a source of forementioned vitamins: fish oil, dairy butter, eggs, vegetable oils, nuts, groats, fruits and vegetables.    Minerals are the part of the human body. They take a part in ferment and hormonal processes and are necessary for uptake of vitamins and other nutrients. To prevent a hair loss you should check if your diet contains all the mentioned minerals: zinc (oat and buckwheat groats, walnuts, shrimps, beans), iron (liver, nuts, egg yolk), molibdenym(kidney, pea, cacao), sulphur (garlic, liver, fish, beans), silicium (whole grain products, root vegetables).    Another way is to deliver the vitamins and minerals directly to hairs by applying it with hair mask. You could apply it at home 1-3 times per week. Here are some compositions. Mask for strengthening of dry hair: 50 g of vegetable oil and 10 drops of lemon juice. Pour it into the cup and heat it by placing the cup in saucepan filled with hot water. Then rub the liquid in hair roots and wait 2 hours. Afterwards wash the head with shampoo and rinse with liter of water with 1 tablespoon of apple vinegar. Mask for strengthening of oily hair: 1 egg, 1 ml of liquid B1 or B6 vitamins. Rub in hair roots, wait an hour and then washwith shampoo plus rinse with water with vinegar|`|o1V9qdTuaa	Hi,    I've read that a major factor in hair loss for women your age is hormonal changes. If there's a possibility you may be pregnant then that may be the cause.    Stress can also be a factor - are there any new events or circumstances in your life that might be stressing you out?     You also may want to check to see if hair loss runs in your family - heredity is definitely a cause as well.    I did a Google search and found a lot of useful, third-party info on the site below - check it out:|`|KppM3VzAaa	Men and women shed at least 100- 125 strands of hair per day and have it replaced after 2- 3 months with new hair growth.     Although it is a natural occurrence women do not want to accept it as normal because it is expected that they have thick, luxurious, healthy hair. Hair health really matters to women.     It is well known that women of all ages should take vitamins for their health however it seems that not all women know that a lack of vitamins can affect the health of their hair. Lack of iron, zinc, and B vitamins may cause hair loss in women.     A standard multi-vitamin or natural supplement designed for hair loss can provide the correct amounts of these vitamins that may be missing from many women's diets.    There are lots of different products on the market place.  Do not simply waste money on what is known as 'retail' supplements, designed for that purpose, to make the shop money!  You need 'pharmaceutical' supplements, there are higher quality and proven to give your body what is actually in there.  For hair loss and control I recommend the below site as they contain a  great balance and are high quality.    Thanks hope that helps|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier.

Wait til ur an adult 18 and make ur decision.|`|FR68ucvxaa	show her your mature enough but i personally think 15 is much 2 young b cos ur taste is going 2 change and u mite not like it 10 yrs from now|`|fa146d75521edadff4773cc4bde69473aa	Until you are old enough to put at least one period in a paragraph, I would say maybe you should hold off on making a big decision like that for yourself. Sometimes moms do know best.|`|LCcW7KSsaa	If you truly want to get your lip pierced, just tell your mom she is right. Because I am sure she thinks and knows you are just going through some phase and you want one because everyone else has one. Remind her of when she was younger and she wanted something. And also remind her of how even though you are going through this phase (which you will probably see as not a phase until you get older), you really think it will benefit your social status. Tell her your friends will think she is the coolest mom ever for letting you get it done. She will budge and please make sure you go to a professional piercing shop that has employees that will tell you and her the process.     I remember I wanted to get a snakebite when I was younger. Mainly because it was cool at the time. My older friends got theirs done and I remember going to a show where there was a smoke machine and it burned the crap out there piercings. Keep in mind the upkeep, unless you want your lip to fall off. And also keep in mind in 5 years when you are out of your phase, do you want to have a hole under your lip? Not many people, including my friends I was envious of, keep their piercings in for more than 3 years anyway.|`|fCDnysAdaa	U may think it's "cool" now, but when your older you'll regret it    and u may think right now, oh i'll just take it out when i want some office professional job.  But that hole will still be there.    And guys don't like kissing lip rings,  and its hard to talk    don't do it.
hLdIO43Xaa	I love to use Rimmel Precision Eyeliner, it's creamy but doesn't smudge, and comes right off without pulling off eyelashes lol. And it comes in great colors. I use eggplant to bring out my brown eyes. I'd suggest using gentle L'Oreal eye makeup remover, of course! Maybe you should try using that to remove your revlon colorstay liner. I love L'Oreal's make up removers!    Rimmel is also pretty fancy for a drugstore makeup line. My friend's aunt loves haute couture and upper-scale make up, but once she was introduced to Rimmel, she was hooked! She used Rimmel all the time now instead of paying all that extra for designer brands.  http://www.rimmellondon.com/US/products/...  It'll be a teeny tiny bit pricier than other brands, but not much and totally worth it!  I'd also invest in the L'oreal eye make up remover.  I hope I helped!  Good luck and have fun!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Both of my daughters use Clinique pencil eyeliner.|`|cgmBEvHIaa	i swearrr by mac stick eyeliner|`|QiVWyKsJaa	look at the object on the link i have it and it really works.|`|DdEJRX0saa	i use this Clinique liquid eyeliner.   works really good(:|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Covergirl pencil liner is great. It doesn't do a dissapearing act during the day, but when you want it to come off, it will. It's like $4.25 at walmart for 2, plus a sharpener, and it comes in about 7 different shades.  Plus, it's very natural and safe for sensitive eyes or contact lens wearers.
080iXsSfaa	put some neosporin on it and it will clear it up pretty fast|`|RMppfinbaa	put Polysporine or Vaseline. They both prevent scaring as well.    Toothpaste dries skin out. If it's a scab, why would you need to dry it out?|`|giyLM0VOaa	easy...  use lemons  or toothpaste overnight|`|WKW17nLPaa	Use tooth paste to dry it out over night|`|TSJIupGWaa	I'm really sorry honey, but scar tissue is hard to fix. Using lemon juice or toothpaste will improve the scar but won't completely heal it. I wouldn't worry too much but will power will prevent it from happening again. And trust me, I've been in the same position before and it is SO annoying. In fact, I have a scar (yes from acne) that has lasted for two weeks so far. Try using Neosporin next time you have a scab, it will heal it faster and help stop you from picking at it. Best of wishes!
kCdISEGqaa	Very normal, and as it heals, it might look a little peaked.  Don't worry about that either, it's all part of the process.  I like Aveeno Baby lotion for my tattoos, very mild and keeps the skin moist longer.|`|8THz1sp9aa	It's just healing, keep with the unscented lotion and it should look good in no time.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	wrinkling is normal.  part of the healing process.  pretty soon it will scab over do not peel the scabs it'll pull the ink out of your skin
pumHU9s9aa	I had the same problem when I was young. I was a chubby kid and it all kinda stretched out into the right places as I entered adolescence, but my breasts were always on the sagging side...even when they grew in!  Unfortunately, for me, it turned out to be hereditary. Shop for a good supportive bra and maybe one that uses a little push-up technology to help.  Don't be hard on yourself, though.  You have no idea of what little importance this will actually be in your lifetime.  You can also try some weight resistance exercises for your pectoral muscles.|`|QiVWyKsJaa	try a push up bra or a water bra maybe try wearing the bra with a tank top that is tight around the the chest the pull your boobs up higher in the bra to make them look bigger and not saggy.|`|tsdHndRhaa	i think it's cause your weight fluctuates like you said, and sometimes it's just genetic and theres nothing you can do about it but wear a supportive bra, just don't be so hard on yourself cause we all have flaws and a person that loves you will not care at all about this.|`|4AnOHrAPaa	Have you been wearing a supportive bra? If not, what you can do is invest in a few good push up bras and start wearing them to bed at night. Eventually, the ligaments which hold up the breast tissue will shorten a bit, and you'll have a more rounded appearance. This is what works for me. I am 40 and have breastfed 3 children, so believe me when I tell you to get that pushup bra. This may take a little time though, so be patient and diligent about it.HTH
sn9T7nfraa	find your local wholesales. they have all the makeup needs. it might come under hairdressers and beauty supplies. I use Alley Hamilton Powder as it is is a wet dry foundation.|`|ty5rdLqPaa	make up forever's HD liquid foundations are amazing
oXiWuhz5aa	Buy Blue and Brown Hair Dye and use blue first and if it looks stupid, use the brown.|`|qKMQkahyaa	if you want to, go for it! i beat it'll look really cool and i don't see how anyone would find it girly. i've seen some ppl with blue hair and it looks really good to me. **sometimes depends on what shade tho. but since blue is darker than red, it should dye just fine but then again, it depends on what shade of blue. anyways, i'm sure it'll look good :T|`|Po4Lljjwaa	Blue isn't girly.  My boyfriend used to dye his hair every color under the sun.  Red which eventually faded to Pink.  *LOL*  Purple.  Blue.  Black.  White.  Yellow.  Green.    The only time I wouldn't suggest it is if you work or are looking for work.  Your boss might not appreciate it (or it could be stated in the handbook/dresscode that it's not allowed).  And you certainly won't have much luck finding a job with blue hair (unless you're looking at a very casual place - i.e. tatoo parlor, record store, teen clothing store, etc...).|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	go ahead?
kWuzKDiraa	they are noticeable, Id wear a Bandeau|`|rAAHHYEWaa	push ups are noticeable|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	Well ofcourse they are.  They dont look like regular ones at all.    Triangle.|`|TkxWfKjsaa	noopeee. just dont look to ridiculous.|`|R6tdHob2aa	yep.|`|VSadTGgUaa	very noticeable! they don't look nice on small breast. triangle is cool.|`|DeRRNCvnaa	I like to wear a strapless halter type of thing.     It goes straight across your bust with a tie up around your neck.     Ive heard good things about push-up bikini's.    I heard there is this one brand that puts a gel thing in the bust instead of pads and its really comfortable!    For patterns and colors,    If you are tan, wear light colors like white, yellow, pink  If you are average, go with bright colors  If you are pale wear dark colors or things with patterns.     Hope that helps!|`|KYU2Yl8Waa	Yeah, kinda. But wouldn't you rather get noticed for something other than your body? Do you really want that kind of attention? Do you want boys to respect you, or see you as just a body? You know what they say, modest is hottest! Don't degrade yourself, your worth sooo much more than that! Respect yourself!|`|52fae6c98244f7e80f10e43758923c9faa	i wear triangles and my chest is super small! and never a pushup because to me it looks like a bra. if your in a swim suit try to look natural because you are putting it all out there to begin with so why not go the extra mile and put it all out?!? it will make you feel better because your not trying too hard and you'll look amazing!|`|VFKn8Vqbaa	It depends on where you are deciding to get your bikini. If you are going to look at the victoria's secret ones be careful because obviously those models have big boobs with or without a push up bathing suit.  go for triangle bikini tops|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Find one that doesn't look obvious! That's my advice!:D|`|qE5XIAsYaa	i would figure a push up bikini is the same as a regular bikini just makes your boobs look bigger.|`|47BmzHbKaa	yes thats true   wear like one piece bikinis

2dtyiFcLaa	Sleeping obviously helps a lot ! but if your looking for a quick fix your can put slice of cucumber of if your short on cucumber , put two (metal) spoons in the freezer and wait till there very cold ( ten minutes does the trick for me ! ) and then just let them sit on''affected area'' till they're room temperature :) it should really help :) GOOD LUCK :)|`|TOAFYeOTaa	cotton balls soaked in milk, or cold spoons under each eye|`|UJUEn2GZaa	sleep|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	getting a good nights sleep or putting cucumber slices on them|`|SS87lbOCaa	You can get more sleep or try putting a spoon in the freezer and when its cold hold it against your skin, below your eye. This always works for me. :)|`|niorawFRaa	concealer
TRYHLIibaa	Listen, I've had bad pimples too, and it's a habit to pop it.  So what you want to do, is take 2 cotton balls [or something else] and put alcohol on them. Wash your hands. Then carefully take the cotton balls and put them on both sides of your pimple, and squeeze, when it ALL gone, rub the alcohol on it. It should be better in a couple of hours/days. I mean, you want to get the bacteria out, and clean it. So try it :]|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Don't touch it, it will make it that much more noticeable if you mess with it!!!!!!!  Put some zit cream or witch hazel on it, then after that sinks in, apply a dab of moisturizer. This will make the surface smoother and less noticeable under makeup. Next, apply foundation to the area with a damp sponge, blend well, and then put on a dab of green concealer with your finger, followed by a bit of regular concealer, then put some powder on top to make your coverage last. Be sure to take extra care when blending, you don't want to irritate the area any more than it already is.  Now, put on some fun gloss and just smile! Who CARES if you have a pimple??? It may change your face momentarily, but it won't change your personality. :-)|`|Ehgn3ZvFaa	pop it and cover it with makeup|`|RMppfinbaa	put toothpaste on it. this will dry out the oil from the pore and get rid of redness. Make sure to use the paste and not gel toothpaste.|`|SS87lbOCaa	toothpaste....DO NOT POP IT...IT WILL LEAVE SCARS
iJZ5Efb0aa	nah it doesn't.  they can do it as a regular hole in your ear.  small enough to put nose studs in there.  which nose studs i believe are 20g, probably smaller.  and 20g is the standard size for ear lobe piercings.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	The usually pierce it at a larger gauge (thickness) than a regular earring to avoid something called the cheese-cutter effect.  You could do whatever you want after it's healed, but a larger gauge (even if it's just slightly bigger than a regular post earring) is better.     And you can get pierced with a ring, ya know.|`|cgmBEvHIaa	wen they pierce it, they put in a small gauge like 16. no big deal|`|gqopFVeyaa	"Gauged" as in stretched, or gauged as in pierced at a slightly bigger size?     The standard size for an ear piercing is either 18g or 20g, though usually 18g. Now, no body piercing other than ear lobe should ever be a size 18g- have you ever heard of the wire cutter effect?     Imagine those old ladies who wore earrings and now have a line from where the post seemed to slide through their ear, similar to wire through clay. Smaller sizes slide through flesh over time much easier, even in cartilage.    That is a bad idea, needless to say, especially in the tragus, as it is small area. 16g is not even a millimeter bigger, but makes all the difference. You would not be wearing a regular piercing stud in it as jewelry anyway, so no worries there.     As for rings, you can find small hoops in any gauge, and if you ask the piercer they can pierce with the hoop initially, so you never have to worry about changing the jewelry or anything.
SohrsIBoaa	you should pluck. when you cut your not getting the root, meaning it grows faster and its darker and heavier each time.|`|IZKBRqp7aa	plucking it is much more effective. if you cut it, it might come back worse/...same with shaving.|`|ev353FQMaa	worse to cut..........grows back way faster|`|l2E9xlwiaa	It depends on the gender.|`|ygTr3fvVaa	Pluck, don't cut.

Cutting is better because your not pulling it out from the roots.|`|wS6U3DbKaa	plucking helps  shaving makes it grow back thicker.  u can also wax|`|pIMXHktGaa	definately pluck over cut. but waxing is even better than plucking.|`|C6m2RTZjaa	im pretty sure ur supposed to pluck the face. hope i helped! :)|`|ZEmSSsjUaa	Plucking is better, NEVER cut or shave.  Unless you want your hair to grow in thicker and darker.|`|ebdc422563024b934f866c45a9986c4faa	I would say cut but at the same time if you pluck your hair to much, it could stop growing.

Hope I helped|`|Zmlfu7xeaa	Go to a doctor, more than likely somethings not right. If you;ve already been to one then I would try biotin.|`|2pQdA3sRaa	Well, you can try using a good salon quality shampoo & conditioner, maybe even Nioxin which is meant for thinning hair. You can also try taking prenatal vitamins, there known to make your hair stronger and grow faster. The most common reason for hair loss is stress and medication. Switching medication or starting a new medication is known to cause hair loss. Hope this helps! Good luck! =)

Make a trip to Hot Topic.|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	Tight clothes, make up and a blade to cut yourself.  You can't pull of an emo look without cutting yourself plenty of times >_>    Why do you have to dress emo? -.- If anything schools probably discourages being emo.
24Xy8qWtaa	I think you're really pretty. (:  For the love of god, please don't wear black eyeliner.. you don't have the coloring for it. Just throwing that out there as someone suggests it on this question every time someone asks it.|`|ZCUhGc48aa	goshh why is it always the gorgeous people that always ask this question?  ahaha you are beautiful.  love the eyes!    &&i'll say like 15?|`|824Md65waa	You are actually super cute and have great skin, be happy with what God gave ya|`|a3HnZAkZaa	you look 17 and you don't need to change your appearance because your really pretty|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	you look around 15 years old.  i would suggest growing your hair out and dying it a little bit of a lighter blonde.  i think that'll look really cute on you and compliment your eyes as well.  you look great without makeup also, so don't put a lot on.  and if you do, put a little bit of clear mascara on, and light eyeshadow.  nothing too dramatic.  especially since you have blue eyes.  consider yourself lucky. :)|`|AYTfxt63aa	Wow. You are actually really pretty. I mean, if you want to shake things up I would get my hair layered. But you are really pretty. Don't change anything about yourself.     =)|`|ENXfwDVBaa	your awesome the way you are.  You don't go overboard with makeup or anything. :] which is great.  most girls put on wayyy too much coverup  you look 16 or 17.|`|bBu28xuQaa	you look alright and you look about 16/17

They get in the way a lot and if you don't take care of them they get infected really easily.    But, it's your body. If you think it's going to look good, do it. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, as long as you'll like it.|`|V2gxQEIAaa	honestly.. i think a septum would be too harsh on your face.. i think a monroe would probly look super cute.. if you're set on getting a seprum make sure you get something small so it doesnt look misproportionate..|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	No.  I dont think piercings would look good on you honestly.  Your face is really young looking.|`|zoTdLkJTaa	ehhh    i say get the braces off first then get a septum    i can't see a monroe suiting you     so get braces off first and get the septum|`|C33jsdydaa	No, Septums look good on Wide noses or Jewish noses (not being racist)  But a monroe might look good on you|`|vwZvxNevaa	You're never too young to have what you want so don't listen to anyone who says you're too young. If you want one then do it!|`|hLTl3KHiaa	In my opinion, septum not really. But maybe a monroe, I think I could see that. :) Hope this helps!|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	would look totally dorky|`|zR0Dcdevaa	You're totally cute, so it's no personal reflection, I just think those types of facial piercings are gawdy, unattractive, tacky, ugly, and begging of negative attention.  I wouldn't do it, but if you're into that sort of thing.|`|5FEVLTufaa	personally, I think the monroe would look better....|`|zRZKdH1Zaa	No, no, no!   You would not suit a septum piercing.
eDySIDPQaa	Yes most states do allow you to go to work in the salon before graduation, but the clients are told you are still a student and its up to a salon to take you on...its done all the time.    And, after graduation, before you can continue working in a salon, you must pass your cosmo test with the state of NYC to get a licence...    So, if your professor told you this, it's true, they have to abide by all the state laws........they would not put you in that situation if not true and salons there would not hire you, if it were not true...    good luck|`|K6fasl6kaa	some shops like the one i go to, have entry level jobs for while or before you go to school.  the owner at my shop hires young people as apprentices.  they do odds and ends jobs, like shampooing or cleaning and stocking; while observing the trade.  he loves to teach and has been a barber/stylist for 30 years.  the apprentices stay with the job and start school if he appreciates talent.  i am sorry that i can't answer your legal question for NYS but in Georgia there are such programs and certificates to be had.
oHO0XOQVaa	Dude they aren't they're usually fat girls. It's just the myspace angle. 90% of scene girls I've seen in real life, I would not use the word "skinny" to describe them.  A poser is someone who's doing something because they want other people to think they're cool.|`|FhOL7UUZaa	I'm 24 and I have no idea what a "scene girl" is. Wow I guess I'm getting old!|`|vL6Lm9Szaa	yeah **** the ppl who call you a poser, who cares what other ppl think, and lol if you wanna be skinny I guess just run and exercise and eat like salads and stuff instead of like a cheesburger lol|`|VKmCXK6Baa	you have the freedom to dress look and act how you want. just because you like the way someone looks doesnt mean its a crime to dress like them.  & theyre not ALLL skinny. i guess theyre just naturally like that?|`|3BQaAPhKaa	Well first of all, if you tell them, "OMGSH! I so wanna be a scene kid!", they'd really think you're one huge POSEUR. Here's a tip, if you wanna follow a fashion trend, don't show that you wanna be one. Take it step by step. -______-    And how they're super skinny? They're either naturally like that, oror PHOTOSHOP. >|`|a3HnZAkZaa	some are naturally skinny while others are on a diet.. if you can to have a scene style get the hair cutt and wear their type of clothes|`|eQENZXz1aa	dunno but they sure are hot|`|5IA9Qe2aaa	well i'd take it your experimenting with styles and stuff, a poser is to have a look but not follow it's social guidelines or something; IMO it's very stupid, you should try making up you're own style and follow whatever makes you happy. They are just clothes and makeup, some people are just too stupid to look past that.  you can basically try the scene look if you wish and let nobody stop you. As for the skinniness, some are annorexic; some are just naturally skinny and you should be more confident with your weight i guess.|`|FX16By1Xaa	Yeah go for it, be what you want to be. forget about the idiots.  + not all scene girls are skinny.  some of them are naturally that way and some diet.  but also, never trust a scene girl's internet photo, as many of them use photoshop and can make themselves look much slimmer than they actually are. so BEWARE! lol.  and btw, im probably what you would call 'scene' and im not veryvery skinny. Im about average i think. :D|`|YGuYw3moaa	Ok well. hi. Lol. I'm a scene model and if you want to be that skinny, the honest truth is most of us don't eat hun. Sorry but that's how to be scene. Makes you sick but in my mind being 90 lbs is perfection and I'd rather be happy with that and get over the hurting.
0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	No, Sue, it doesn't mean your coat has to die and go to down heaven.  What you need to do is check all the stitching inside the coat - including the sleeves - and fix any gaps that are letting the feathers through.  Just turn the coat and sleeves inside out and get to work with a needle and thread, and it will be fixed in no time.  You may not even find any gaps in the stitching.  The small feathers can work themselves through very small openings, just with normal wear.|`|gv7oIHXmaa	Yes, it is the end of your coat.    Fur is murder, though :[

Silk dresses by designers in the MbMJ range like BCBGMaxAzria, Juicy Couture, etc are generally are $200+ -$500 if they're more expensive so that's a good number to keep in mind.|`|FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it on ValueJockey.com.

It's not worth paying for a modeling school - they will do nothing to increase your chances of becoming a model. No school in the world can change your height, facial features or body type - which is all an agency is interested in. If an agency signs you, they will teach you how to walk, pose, put together a portfolio, etc. -- all at no charge to you.    Classes are fine if you just want to have fun, meet new people, learn how to do your makeup and pose, speak in public, dress for your body type, etc. And you get to do a little fashion show for your friends and family at the end. But it won't get you signed by an agency.    I worked for a top NY agency and not one of the models on our books had ever attended modeling school.  And in most cases, if someone wrote that they went to modeling school, they were immediately thrown out because the agents thought their poses and walks were too pageant-y and not fashion.|`|3VizNJV8aa	no you don't need to loose weight!! you sound super skinny(but that depends on your age a little too.  but you sound pretty so i think you should go for it!!  |`|VKmCXK6Baa	you dont need to lose weight but typically modeling agencies look for girls that are taller, around 5'7 or 5'8|`|JtefbdQOaa	you...5'3"    models..6'0"      resemblance? i dont think so.|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	You really need to grow girly, you are too much of a shortie for most modeling. I am 5 foot 6 and have been accepted into an agency, but I am on the short side, I was looking through the other models profiles and most of them are like 6 foot which makes me sound like a shortie. :P    I have completed my course and am waiting for 9 proffesional port folio pics to come through. Most courses are at least a thousand dollars but do include about 2 or 3 pics just to gest you started, for a complete portfolio though you are looking at over another thousand and some agencys have a joining fee of a couple of hundred and to get your pics on the website over a hundred too, so it is quite pricey. Hope this helps. :]
Irr5ftN7aa	Michael Kors makes beautiful, high-quality shoes, and they can be purchased at Nordstrom, Macy's etc. They last for quite a while, and are always stylish.... I am pretty tall (5'8"), but still insist on wearing heels instead of flats because I think they are more professional looking. Jell insoles are for grandmas..... get her some MK's and she will be in shoe bliss :)    Now of course, if you are looking to splurge, and I mean splurge..... Jimmy Choo shoes are great, and so are Manolo Blahnik. But I'd suggest buying the MK's, and spending the extra $$ on a fabulous dinner with some flowers :)|`|eal4vU6Taa	i like flats or cork wedges
rRceaE4Maa	Okay...this may exclude the whole cleanly thing ( hahah). Anyways, they will stay easier if you don't wash your hair one night. I know sounds disgusting, I used to always have to wash my hair, but now sometimes I skip a night! It really works, the buildup in your hair ( ew, I know) keeps the styles in better! I also read that sometimes fashion designers do that to their runway models! Hope I helped :)|`|vcWuPlOyaa	After you curl it spay a lotof Spitz on it, andspay it with some Ultra Sheen|`|nbCniQVqaa	moose|`|gaQzqBb2aa	after you get out of the shower, put mousse in your hair and don't blow dryer.  it'll stay amazing, and then of course add hairspray after you curl it|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	in addition to hairspray before you curl your hair you can use a heat protecting spray, these protect your hair and are a little sticky to make curls stay better. make sure you buy one that is specially for curling hair because there are some that are for straightening, some for curling|`|idhcqr5Daa	Let the curling iron heat up for several minutes. (Do this in advance if you know you won't have time to wait.)   Open the curling iron by holding your four fingers around the handle while pushing your thumb down on the moving part of handle.      Stop at the root.Clip the curling iron onto a half an inch strand of hair at the top part of your hair, the part closest to the root, by lifting your thumb.Then slide it down to the tip of your hair. Be sure to stop before it completely slides off. Pull iron down to the tip of your hair.]]Start curling your hair in the direction you want it to curl in, for example curve it under if you want an inward curl.      Curl your hair upward toward the root.Continue to curl your hair until you reach the top part of your hair and hold it there for 10 seconds.   Slowly and gently start to uncurl your hair until you reach a point where you can press your thumb down again without your hair holding your curling iron shut. (The slower you let it come down, the longer the curls will hold.)   Open and close the curling iron until you ease it out of your hair.   Repeat the steps on all of your hair that you want curled.   Use fingers to tousle hair. Also use hairspray and a comb to slightly tease hair to create volume.   Naturally letting the hair fall, with no brushing after, and tousling with your fingers, leaves the best result.   It may be necessary to tousle hair throughout day if curls combine to create big curls and not curly hair.   It may not work the first time but don't give up. Try again.   The smaller the hair in the curling iron the smaller and tighter the curl.   If you curl each strand for longer than 1 minute it will cause heat damage.   Curling Creme Applied after shower will help hold the curl (not mouse too heavy for the curl to hold :])   The curling iron is hot. It will burn you if you touch it.   These directions can work in two ways: achieve fabulously kinky natural looking curls, or cause your hair to frizz up like a ball. If your hair frizzes clip the top half to the crown of the head using a barrette.   Don't plug in your curling iron near water. It could fall in and hurt someone nearby.   Curling irons get extremely hot, so be careful not to burn your head, ears, fingers, or neck, and watch out not to scorch your hair.   Don't leave in curling irons for longer than the instructions recommend.   Make sure to always unplug the curling iron after you're finished.     x0x0_LEi

Last Year my friend had the same problem.    She had her mom sew on dark silver ribbons on each side and tied them on her shoulders.     As for you hair.    If you have dark hair I would keep it down.     If its short, straighten it  If its long, (and curly) leave it  If its long, (and wavy) straighten it    If you have light hair    I would put it in a loose bun at the bottom with side bangs.

(Y)  depending on what your hairstyle is.. depends on the type of earrings you should wear (curly and volumized hair= hoops BUT straight, sleek hair= long earrings) also, since you're wearing black dress, you should NOT go with black shoes.. silver shoes is ok, but you could find cheap red high heel pumps .. and this would be a better choice. finally, the cardigan does go well.. i dont think you should sew straps because the dress is meant to be strapless and additional straps may ruin it.   hope i helped :) goodluck.|`|ucZOCMyAaa	it looks good. Everything you posted to go with it will look good, as long as it is in silver. Those earringd NEED TO BE SILVER!!!  the shoes, NEED TO BE SILVER!|`|PQBEqS8Caa	wow...i LOVE the dress. Yes the sweater is very cute also. I would def. go with silver shoes and fun accessories. Since the dress is kinda formal, I would suggest fun, funky accessories.

WO68RZdIaa	They are not safe to take if you do not have a medical need for them. They are a diuretic & if misused can lead to severe dehydration, medical problems, even death.    Here is a list of common side effects:        * Frequent urination. This may last for several hours after a dose.        * Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm)        * Electrolyte abnormalities- Blood test monitoring of electrolytes is important before and during the taking of these medications.        * Extreme tiredness or weakness. These effects should decrease as your body adjusts to the medication. Call your doctor if these symptoms persist.        * Muscle cramps or weakness. Be sure that you are taking your potassium supplement correctly, if prescribed. Contact your doctor if these symptoms persist.        * Dizziness, lightheadedness. Try rising more slowly when getting up from a lying or sitting position.        * Blurred vision, confusion, headache, increased perspiration (sweating), and restlessness. If these effects are persistent or severe, contact your doctor.        * Dehydration. Signs include dizziness, extreme thirst, excessive dryness of the mouth, decreased urine output, dark-colored urine or constipation. If these symptoms occur, don't assume you need more fluids, call your doctor.        * Fever, sore throat, cough, ringing in the ears, unusual bleeding or bruising, rapid and excessive weight loss. Contact your doctor right away.        * Skin rash. Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor right away.        * Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting or muscle cramps. Be sure that you are taking your potassium supplement correctly, if prescribed.      Just start walking, get some exercise, watch your ratio of how many calories you take in versus how many calories you burn off, cut down on foods high in carbs. Unless you are morbidly obese, there are safer natural ways to lose weight than to result to fad diets, diet pills, etc- all of which can cause you more problems than they help.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Okay first of all, typing in all caps is like yelling at us, and we have done nothing to you. We are here to help yet, you are yelling at us.    As fast as your question. I am on a diuretic per docs orders. It sucks. I pee more than when I was pregnant. I also have to watch how much fluid I drink becasue drinking a bunch and taking a diuretic is counter productive.    The best way to loose water weight is to watch your sodium. Try to stay at 2,500 miligrams a day. This gives you a little over 500 mg per meal and a snack or 2.    Stay away from prepacked foods, broths etc... Soda's even have a good amount of sodium. Gatorade has a LOT of sodium 110 mg per 8 oz. Powerade however is only 55 mg per 8 oz.    Eat fresh veggies, and so on. Help your Mom shop if you still live at home. Buy Tyson skinless/boneless breasts. But look at each package, they range from 40 mg per serving clear up to 180 mg oer serving, and there is no way to tell by the packaging.    Everything does have some sodium though. This includes egg, carrots etc, but it is a natural occuring amount so it is okay. Just keep track and read all lables and serving sizes.     I also get wicked foot and leg cramps, usually they come in the middle of the night and keep me up for a long time. I also take potassium suppliments but it doesn't always work. One left a bruise on my leg it was so bad.    I also can feel weak, sometimes-so yes I drink a bit more water and then I feel better.    P.S. Typing like a grown up 18 year old not a 12 year old helps us take you more seriously as well.|`|L2pkns9maa	Wtf.... Theres a water pill?  Go exercise...|`|UYvgIazcaa	I'm not entirely sure what a 'water pill' is.  Sounds like a fancy name for an ice-cube to me.    But I'm going to wager that it is designed to make you lose water not gain water.  In which case it is a diuretic.  Diuretics work by making it so your kidneys can't re-absorb water when filtering out the refuse that makes your urine yellow.  So you dehydrate faster because you urinate more water than you need to.    Long story short: it's a really stupid way to lose weight.  And abusing it can cause kidney damage and you don't want that.    Caffeine is about the only pill that will help you lose weight, and you can cause heart damage by taking too much of that too.    Sadly, there's not yet a true weight-loss pill.  Eating less food and getting more exercise is still the only way to do it effectively.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS EVEN BETTER?  Getting off your lazy *** and exercising.
YdhwzITUaa	Sally Hanson has really good nail growth & nail strengthener products, like "Hard As Nails" and "Miracle Growth Treatment".  They worked incredibly for me, my nails were long and strong in THREE days! :)  Its cheap too, you can get it at any drugstore.    I'd also try painting your nails, because you won't want to bit them if they look pretty! :)  Also, look for a nail polish/treatment that is specially made for nail-biters. You paint it on your nails, and it tastes HORIBBLE, so you'll stop biting right away!    Hope I helped, good luck!!|`|5VrnSYqbaa	Usually this is used on children, but there's a product called MAVALA Stop that helps to stop nail biting. It's just a bitter like taste so everytime you think of doing so, you'll want to pull away. A nice plus is that you can put it over nail polish =]|`|1KVnuc7vaa	put duck tape over your fingers! I had this problem too, and although I didn't use the duck tape I was just able to stop on my own. or put bandades on your fingers. but just do something that will make them taste bad or make you realize what your doing.|`|ZvoN0Knvaa	if you have like a Walgreens around or a Walmart  theres this clear fingernail polish and it helps stop your biting cause the taste of it is horrible.trust me i had the same problem and this help i never bite them anymore and if you like a color coat just put your color coat on then the clear coat after. A good brand is the sally hansen clear no biting (:|`|LCcW7KSsaa	I bite my nails and they are abnormally short. My fingers are so gross but I can't stop. You probably bite your nails because you are subconsciously thinking about something that makes you anxious or nervous. I always thought I wasn't. Since it it such a pattern to bite my nails every time they grow I just tried to keep my fingers out of my mouth. Every time I caught myself I would just stop. Or I would keep my hands very very dirty so I wouldn't put them in my mouth. I hate that. It works. My nails sucked but they grew. I even got some fake ones put on which rocked because I would have broken my teeth trying to get those things off! I eventually starting biting them again...around Christmas time of course. When I was younger, people always told me to try hot sauce. Try something you really hate on your fingers you will never put them in your mouth. I have even tried using thick nail polish because if I bit that off, it would get stuck in my teeth and that would be embarrassing.|`|GnG5TM1qaa	I used to bite my nails but I stopped by getting acrylic nails. I get them done every 2 weeks. After a while, you can soak the nails off and wear your own, but if you're anything like me you'll bite them too :)  I usually keep mine really short because I'm still not used to I nails. You can also get really pretty designs on them too (I do lol)|`|hneetSf2aa	band aids or dip your fingers in jalapeno juice haha|`|OtjXWzOZaa	they have nail polish that you can put on them and it tastes sooo gross. or i quite by telling myself that i could.|`|GXrHjEgvaa	why do you want to?

If they aren't done...I am constantly biting them and don't even know it.    THUM doesn't work....after one second the taste goes away and you can bite them.  :)))    Nail polish doesn't work either...I bite it off...I just get mine done...then I don't bother them.|`|IZKBRqp7aa	put nailpolish on them, that way if you go to bite them you will get mouthful of polishy nails. you could also put bandaids over your fingers. or  use willpower:P|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	stick em in your ears instead...who wants to taste ear wax|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Bite your fingers off, problem solved.

Whenever you bite your nails or even think about it, pull the band back and let it snap!  It'll hurt but after a few days you won't want to bite your fingernails because you'll think of the pain.|`|WW59n5Lqaa	dip ur fingers on lemon juice   put on fake nails    just forget about biting ur nails and think of something else 2 do  i no its a bad habit :(|`|kogsyGAPaa	i had that habit my whole life!

I never thought it possible! Once and s while I'll find myself nippling if they are unever or something but I never actually bite them down anymore.    It's seriously like a miracle.

Many experienced piercers won't perform them.     Most women go for a clitoral hood piercing, which is possible to do for yourself. Do a lot of research, hang out with piercers and learn what you can. You will also need access to someone who can sterilize your equipment and jewelry for you. That said, genital piercings are not the best place to start with DIY piercings.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Wow.  Do you mean the actual clit or the hood?  Please go to a professional!

kCdISEGqaa	It's pretty bad.  I am heavily covered, and my wrists were some of the most painful tattoos I have.  Not as bad as my feet, but my wrists were bad.  Don't let anyone tell you it doesn't hurt, because all tattoos hurt.  I have seen big men come in and get tattooed, and pass out or ask for breaks.  Everyone tolerates pain differently, so it may not bother you as much, but, it hurts.  Honestly, I hate getting tattooed, but the end result is very worth it.  The closer you get to the fold near the palm the more sensitive it is.  Go for it, you won't regret it!!!|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Not very,its only midly annoying,and somewhat creepy because when I was getting mine the big vein in my wrist moved over when the artist was pushing on it,didn't hurt or bleed,was just gross. On a scale of 1-10(10 being your leg being sawed off with nothing to numb it) id say a -2|`|IwaTzQqxaa	mine didnt hurt at all.. neither did my husbands.. he said the only time his even stung was when they went close to the palm..    then again it has everything to do with your pain tolerance..  i have 28 stars going from my shoulder wrapping around ribs to my hip to my stomach.. and i fell asleep for that tattoo.. so im not sure if you can really go by me lol|`|UV6K1mqtaa	It honestly is a personal experience and depends on your tolerance of pain. No one else can decide for you. Some say it is nothing, while others say it is the worst. It truly is a personal experience, and you will never know truthfully unless you do it yourself. :) I want one too,so I have been asking the same questions as you.|`|m85emlXyaa	I can imagine quite painful. Your wrist is where your bones meet. I got a tattoo on my shoulder. Imagine if someone had a very sharp coloured pencil and was etching into your skin with it... that's the way it feels. Because your bones are so close to where you would be getting the tattoo, it would be very painful.|`|GHsElxN4aa	Actually it's not that bad I just got one on my wrist saturday and it wasn't like killer pain I'm gonna die LOL it hurts but not killer it sorta goes numb after... I got mines all the way up my wrist and I survived no fainting LOL... I guess is depends on how you take to pain .. I don't take pain that well but getting it wasn't that bad I actually want another one on my opposite wrist|`|5FEVLTufaa	It all depends on how you can take pain, if you faint because someone flicked you, then a tattoo wouldn't be a good idea...|`|od3cDlqSaa	I have tats on both of my wrist..its actually not that bad. I mean its gonna hurt thats for sure but its not unbearable pain.You get a little used to it.. but I think it hurts alot more when they are doing the shading cuz your almost done but your not quite there haha and then it starts getting sore..but honestly just breathe and try not to focus so much on the needle jabbing your skin haha..talk to your artist..or to your friends it'll take your mind off of it a little.|`|JwdU9nVBaa	My sister got a little flower tatto on her wrist and she fainted. But she said it wasnt that painful, it was just the thought of her getting a tattoo.|`|yPcv3VLPaa	haha, ive got full sleeves and when my artist got down to my wrist it was more annoying than painful. if you go in to the shop thinking it is going to hurt.. your mind is going to be racing and you could possibly feak out and faint.. but once they start.. you realize that its not as painful as its worked up to be.
V3zx1Fm2aa	I'm a make-up artist and you can do both.  If you want to apply them to your bottom lashes, there are mascaras that have a small wand that gives you a thin coat without looking too dramatic.  Applying mascara to your bottom lashes makes you look more flirty.|`|3LWI3qfhaa	i put it on both   it just depends on the look u want  more natural then id say no  but i like tons of eyeliner and mascara so i do both|`|SRBC2Y8eaa	i wear both|`|3m4YrL8qaa	nope just top|`|zDqlHcGSaa	I never wear mascara on bottom, and I usually only do liner in the bottom corners, on the rare occasion that I take time to put it on!! I really like the natural look best, and trust me, when the mascara on your lower lashes start to flake and clump, it's anything but natural(or attractive!!!)|`|8cDd70dSaa	I do both because I rarely wear eyeliner.|`|Q2MTQxZoaa	you can wear it on your bottom lashes too, but just a little dont go overboard|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	yea eyeliner works because mascara looks clumpy and gross. yea don't do it.|`|EjTV7SQdaa	I wear mascara on the top and bottom lashes.  I think it looks better then with none on the bottom at all.  I also wear eyeliner on the bottom, because i hate wearing it on the top.  you can do whatever you think you look best with though.  just experiment with it!|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	its better if you dont wear eyeliner on ur lower lash line, it makes ur eyes look weak and it wears them down. eyeliner is fine!|`|xZW4XjnOaa	I apply mascara to both because i have naturally really long and thick eyelashes and it brings them and ur eyes out more=)|`|fHRgmJdNaa	i don't like to, but i learned a trick to make your bottom lashes stand out a bit more. kinda in between little bits of lashes, make lines with your eyeliner.
