And also tell me what i can do to make it better. thanks                I sat in the back seat of my mom’s Mercedes, thinking. The windows rolled slightly down, just to trap enough air to breathe. My mom always kept the heat on, even though it was already 75 degrees out. Just think, in 2 days I would be in London, England, a very rainy place. Nothing worried me more than a new place, a new life. Just the thought of it made me shiver. I shifted my weight to see my mom and step dad better. They looked so happy. Not a care in the world. I looked down and their hands were twisted together, I sighed. My mind went back to the scrambling thoughts in my head. I stared blankly at the seats in the car. Memorizing the pattern, Black, white, red, brown. The seats became fuzzy, blurred lines after a while. The silence was torturous. I laid my head back on the seat and closed my eyes, breathing in and out softly, to keep from screaming.             "Alyson,” My mom said cutting into my concentration. I slid one eye opened to look at my mom. Her beautiful hazel eyes stared at me through the rearview mirror. "You seem depressed."    "That obvious, huh?" I rolled my eyes and put my head on the side of the window.   "Aly," My mom repressed a sigh. "I know this isn’t where you wanted to go. But can you just try to be good?" She looked at Rob, love in her eyes. It didn’t make me feel any better. Rob and I never really get along at all. He’s a dad I never had, or wanted. I was perfectly fine when it was just my mom and me. My dad died when I was only four, from a motorcycle accident.  It was Rob’s fault we were moving to London in the first place. My mom stopped at a near by gas station. It looked run down, and deserted for the most part. A sign on the far left side of the building announced it was the "Aro" Gas station. Rob jumped out of the car to go fill the gas tank.    "I know your upset with Robert right now Aly. But can you at least try to like him?" She gave me a pleading look. I looked out the window to where Rob was standing.   "Mom, I guess I could. For you." I sighed and looked back over to my mom.    "Fair enough." She leaned towards the back seat with her arms wide open. I gave her a big hug, and she kissed me on the cheek.   "It will be fun. Just think of this as a road trip." She smiled.   "Only we aren’t coming back." I whispered under my breathe. She heard me, and her face fell.    "Aly, I’m sure you will make a lot of new friends. You are a very pretty girl." She smiled approvingly.   "There was nothing wrong with my old ones." My voice got ruder.    "No. But you know Robert needed this job, Aly. We all needed more money. Please.. for me?" Just then Rob opened the door. He got in and gave my mom the left over money from the gas. She put the green bills in her pocket and hurried out of the gas station, I could tell she was just as freaked out about the abandoned area as I was.   "So what were you guys talking about." Rob said out of awkwardness.   "Nothing. Just girl stuff." My mom joked as she turned right on the long narrow road.    "Oh. Well how about a song?" Rob looked back at me.   "Please, no. I already have a headache." I got out my Journal and pencil, and started writing.   "I see." Rob reached for the radio and clicked it on. I sighed and went back to my writing. It wasn’t long before my mom and Rob’s bad singing filled the car, along with the already-bad-enough music on the radio. Only two more days, I thought to myself. I took out my Mp3 player and put the headphones in my ears, I had a feeling they would come in handy on this long trip. Somewhere in between the bad singing and the sleeping pill I took, I fell asleep.    "Wake up." My mom nudged me. I slowly sat up and let out a loud obnoxious yawn. It was pitch dark outside, and the clock on the dash board said it was eleven at night. I didn’t want to get up, but my stomach said otherwise. I leaned to the front of the car to check my reflection in the mirror. I looked like a mess, my makeup was smeared and my hair was going in every direction possible.   "Holy cow." I took the brush out of my black and white decorative bag, and combed it thoroughly before I threw it in the back seat.    "Sleep well hunny?" My mom said, trying to hold down a laugh.     "Ha. Funny mom, you should be a comedian. Now can we go? I’m starving." I took both their hands and dragged them along with me. When we got inside the smell of French fries surrounded me, I licked my lips.   "You act like we haven’t fed you in forever, Aly." Rob commented. "What do you girls want to eat?" I looked over to my left and saw two very familiar faces. They were from my old school back in Florida. I was hoping not to run into any old friends on this trip. Obviously, my luck wasn’t very good today. The line was moving, I turned my back to Lauren and Jack and headed forward, knocking two chairs down in the process. Lauren and Jack jerked their heads up when they heard the loud

20090219182142AAerkwL	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem, titled, Relations?	Falling so fast, never knowing the slightest    Falling so right, it’s real, at your surest    But hitting the ground is like dying    The words finally trickle in, crying    Am I to know my emotion on the spot?    I must fall, think and question    My ever last and truest thought    But who is to say I be wrong in judgment    When I pick and chose with personal perception    To never know I’m wrong, or right   But to follow her view is deceitful   Down the path to my most brutal bite    I feel cross in my opinions, but right   I Cheer and laugh, in the highest of mood    But like the hourglass spilling its last spec    I hit the glass and die, to realize days…   Through the pupils of your eyes….    It is just as true…. just as right….   I wish I could see it better,   Without death in my life.         thank you

20090219180919AAIU7dG	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Idea for art class project?!!?	okay so in my art class at school we're supposed to make a positive-negative mirrored art project. so if you folded a peice of paper in half and drew a black circle on one side, there would be a white one on the other side.      we have a black/white background to work with also. We can have the object that is mirrored be anything      i don't really know what i want to do because i don't want to draw something really simple, but not too difficult because we only have a few days to work on it.      also i'd like an object that only has one color touching the background.{with the designs enclosed in it} i dunno if that makes since, but like the white circle again, only have the white outline of the circle touching the background, otherwise ill have to have a black and white background aswell.      i don't know if this makes much since, but just ideas on what i should paint would be nice.         thanks.

20090219182125AAyMNJR	Arts & Humanities;History	Romanov survivors rumors?	I know that rumors that one or more of the Romanovs survived the shooting over 90 years ago are very strong and still persist to this day.      One person I am interested in concerning these rumors is a one Larissa Tudor. She was the wife of a one Owen Tudor of England. I know many focus on Anna Anderson, but I am fascinated by Larissa because of a few reasons: more than 60 years after her death, her neighbors were shown pictures of Tatiana Romanov and claimed Larissa was Tatiana, when Larissa died, she left Owen a huge inheritance (remember how the Bank of England supposedly housed $$$$$$$$$$ belonging to the Romanovs? Larissa and Owen lived in England) If you pay attention to the names "Larissa" and "Tatiana," you'll notice that there are a few similarities. Both have seven letters. Both end with an "a." Both have an "i" as their fourth letter. While her marriage certificate gives her name as being "Larissa Haouk," on her grave it says "Larissa Feodorovna." For many years after her death, Owen Tudor has flowers sent to Larissa's grave on June 10th. June 10th was the birthday of Tatiana. In "No Resting Place For a Romanov," the author writes that, in June of 1998, Larissa's gravestone was cleaned and polished without the permission of the Tudor family, and that the black railing surrounding her grave was removed. What's eerie about that is that June of 1998 is when the rest of the Romanov remains were laid to rest. June is also the month in which Tatiana was born.       Does anyone else think there's a shot that Larissa and Tatiana are one and the same?      Here is a website about it:       http://www3.telus.net/mtnclimb/pers/fami...       Also, when asked about Larissa, her English neighbors said she was tall, very thin, and very beautiful. Tatiana was all of these things.

20090219183855AAiA0UA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good story?	So i have a essay i need to turn in. is this good?       Here are a few things to look for:   A good hook(the first few sent. gets u interested)   The story must be about a unexpected moment   Good Vocab   Details      Story:   "We have bad news" Father whispered tearing a white envolope open. I knew what  was coming up. I bit my lip and clenched my hands. "Our family is in danger" My mother weaped. I knoew it, every year our family is in danger. I lost my brother, Kenan, and my sister, Jenae already. However, we never knew what the danger was, it was just left for us to find out and I am going to do something about it this time.                  A splash of cold icy water hit my face. "Sara!" my mother yelled with panic in her eyes. "They are coming! Run Sara! Run!" I was confused and I just wanted to bounce back in bed but my mother pulled me out of bed and threw me out the door. Through the side window, my mother signaled me to hurry up but I had no idea where to run and why. I turned around and right in front of me were some white folks. Oh no! I was caught dead. They circled me and teased me from head to toe calling me names. Not much longer, a big white truck pulled up with some barrels. My heart beated fast as they picked me up and clumped me in there. They roped the lid on and left. The truck started roaring off into a totally different town. I yelped but no one cared to hear. My heart melted into a puddle as I thought of my mother and father. I had lost them and they had lost me. I let them down, now I wonder what these white folks will do to me. All I have to do is just wait until I am there.                    "Get out!" a large man grunted, het turned the barrel over and my head hit the scarched cement. It scratched the top of my scalp and it was bleeding badly. Tears came out by I held them as much as I could. Me and a few other blacks stood in a straight line follwoing oreder from the big white men. "You are with us now!" they laughed. "So don't  try to run away you blacks!" I felt as if he just punched me and the other people. The bulky man snarled at me, he had wide shoulders and bumps on his arms called muscles. I listened carefully as I put my hand on my head tryingto  heal the bruise.       That is all! please think of an ending and if i need to change anything! THANKS SO MUCH!!

Is it only because one has more money than the other? How many of those rich people got rich at the expense of the poor?      Just imagine the humiliation that a homeless person suffers.

Why didn't the US get into the war much sooner than later? I have heard rumors that many US manufacturers were supplying Nazi Germany with parts and raw materials. Like the Pope during that time pre WWII, many Americans believed that Hitler was defending Germany and Europe against the Russian communists, who later took over half of Europe after WWII.   Why didn't the US use the atomic bomb on Berlin as they did in Hiroshima?

20090219183019AAgeZnC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm looking for a Childrens book about a girl with wings and a dress of moss.?	The book is about a girl a was raised by adoptive parents  and when she started to develop wings, her parents bound them which made her sick. Her parents were supposed to give her to the witch lady in the forest when she turned a certain age but they didn't and the girl's family and house (with the exception of her) turned into stone. She went into the woods to get help for her family and she found the witch who nursed her wings and taught her to fly. Then the girl flew to a far off island that had a field with a magic tree, the tree gave up its limbs for firewood, then its moss for a dress for the girl, then it's body for a harp for the girl. Its ends with the girl flying over her town to go home. I don't remember the author or the title of the book. I know its oldish though because I used to read it about 10 years ago. If anyone can help me find it that would be great! Thanks.

20090219184511AAkca3j	Arts & Humanities;History	Which Christian Bible is the most accurate and/or original?	Hey Yahoo! Community!      I want to purchase a Holy Bible that is as accurate or original as possible but I don't have much money either. I am just a young college student hoping to become closer to my faith. I was raised a Christian but half way through my childhood, my family stopped attending church and yet they claim to be the most moral and ethical people alive yet they are full of greed, jealousy and aggression. I need to become more in touch with my faith and be able to understand why my mother thinks being racist is something the Bible does not discourage. She even claims the Holocaust is not a genocide to be frowned upon because they killed Jesus yet I read in history class that it was a roman soldier that accidentally speared Jesus.      Now how can people who are so religious and claim to be moral become so closed minded and ignorant? I want to believe not everyone religious is mentally unstable and thick headed so I want to know more by reading the whole Bible in as pure of a form as possible.      Warm Regards,   Jason Xiao

20090219192924AAkDfoG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Short story I wrote a few years ago... opinions?	I wrote this a few years ago when many of my family members were passing. I just looked at it again and wondered what you thought. I know it's long, but please do read.              “Ready to go Granddad?” Erin grabbed her coat. They were getting ready for the everyday walk.     “Ready when you are lass!” Chirped the brogue that could only belong to Granddad. He came down the stairs slowly, taking each step at a time. He was an old man of about 87, with gray hair and bushy eyebrows. He had wrinkles on his face, like a crinkled paper bag, but that didn’t make him look old, it made him look wise and understanding as Erin knew him to be. “The usual route today I presume? Or does my lady want to explore a bit?” He shifted his wait, looking uncomfortable.   Erin watched him intently, and realizing that he must not feel himself, she said, “No, that’s ok granddad.” A small trace of relief crossed his face, but disappeared just as soon.   “Then out we go! Grab my coat for me, would you lassie?” Granddad indicated to the coat on the back of a chair in the kitchen. Erin walked over to the chair and grabbed the coat. She smiled as she picked it up, so many memories in this old thing, she thought. There was the time she broke her leg on a jungle gym, after which he picked her up and wrapped her in the coat. Then there was the time that granddad came to the barn for the first time and left his coat hanging over a fence. While he was looking around, Joey, one of the horses in the pasture grabbed it and ran off with it! When granddad realized he marched out into the pasture to get it. He said that he wouldn’t come out until the beast let go of the coat. About three hours later, he came out of the pasture, cold and wet, but happy because he had his coat. Granddad never could admit to defeat, Erin thought. She handed the Jacket to him and they were off. Erin didn’t know it, but this would be her last walk with her grandfather.   It happened in the middle of the night. Erin’s mom, rushing around, woke up Erin who had fallen asleep on the couch.   “I’m going to the hospital; your dad is asleep in the back. Go back to sleep so you can get up in the morning.” She said as she hurried around.   “But mom, what’s-“Erin didn’t get to finish, her mom was already out the door. What could have happened? She really had no family around here, except for a few cousins, and Granddad. She immediately ruled out her granddad. He is rock hard, why would he need to go to the hospital? She walked into her room and smoothed out her bed before climbing in. That’s it, one of her cousins had broken an arm or something, and her mom was just going to help. She convinced herself of this before she went to sleep.   The next day she found out what had really happened. It was Granddad; he wasn’t as hard rock as she was hoping. He had had a heart attack, but he was alive.    “Can I go see him?” She asked.   “Sure,” said her dad, “Finish your breakfast and we’ll go. Ok?” He turned to finish washing the dishes in the sink. Erin ate as fast as she could, got dressed, and was ready to go.   “Ok, let’s go!” She was so worried; she wanted to get there as soon as possible. They got in the car. When they arrived Erin ran to the front desk.   “Where is Brian O’Malley’s room?” She said out of breath.    “Are you family?” said the receptionist. Erin’s father came up behind her.   “Yes we are” he responded, placing a hand on Erin’s back gingerly.   “He’s in room 113.” She looked down at her desk and continued her work.   “Come on dad! Let’s go!” Erin said practically sprinting. As she walked into the room she saw her granddad, lying in the hospital bed, hooked up to different machines. They bbeped and chirped, as if to say “We’ll keep him alive! Don’t worry!”   “Hello Erin!” He said in a weak voice. Erin went over to the side of his bed.   “Hi Granddad. How are you feeling?” She tried to smile but ended up looking sad instead of happy.   “Oh, lass! Don’t look like that! You know me, I’ll be out of here tomorrow! But I hate all these stupid machines!” He glanced at the heart monitor sitting by his bed. They sat for a while and talked as if they were at Granddad’s familiar house which smelled of pipe smoke and peppermint.    “Ok Erin, Granddad is tired, I think it’s time that you let him rest.” Her mother suggested as she took her by the arm. “Why don’t you go get something to eat?” Erin and her father went down to the hospital cafeteria. There weren’t many people there. Only an older woman with no teeth, and a young man who looked tired. Her dad and her bought food and sat down. Erin ate about half of her sandwich then pushed her tray away.   “You barley ate anything!” Her dad said, looking at her tray. “Are you sure that you are done?”   “I’m just not very hungry. I don’t know why, I just don’t want to eat.” Erin stared at her food silently.    “Well, I was talking to the doctors. My mom and I have decided to tell you what they said.” He looked uneasy. “They said that Granddad probably won’t

20090219194227AAepFC9	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How could I improve my lines of verse?	Cosmic Jest      So what is life if not a jest   played by the gods in far-flung realms?   While mortals strive and are hard-pressed,   enduring that which overwhelms   if they'd but let it, and not try   to lift themselves from out the dust.   Far better to press on than die,   'though day's reward be but a crust.      For man, one day, shall heights attain   and sever all that ties him down;   that treasured prize shall surely gain   and wear himself a cosmic crown.   For in the image of the gods   was man created that great day,   and destined to be more than clods   of soulless, lifeless, worthless clay.      So on man strives towards his goal   when he shall reign one day on high;   the triumph of the human soul   which just will not lay down and die.   Remember then, from day to day,   and to one's heart this great truth clasp -   don't let one's limits bar the way,   man's reach should e'er exceed his grasp.      And when that day is here at last   and man himself is like a god,   he then shall rule, both firm and fast,   no more a creature of the sod.   Who cares if life is but a jest   which at this time does sorely chaff?   Man trusts one day to pass the test -   then his shall be the long, last laugh.
20090219194241AAirKDv	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is there any way I can improve this poem?	Halcyon Days      The time hangs heavy on my hands as I think back on bygone days,   When in fair childhood's far-off lands I played beneath Sol's golden rays.   I thought myself immortal then and never spared a thought for death,   For I was just a lad of ten, but now I'm old and short of breath.      With little time in front of me, my gaze turns backwards to the past,   And days of glory do I see of happy times I thought would last.   But Time, the one who mocks us all, will have her way as years pass by,   We are but captives in Time's thrall and 'tis appointed that we die.      But in my mind I'm young once more, surrounded by my childhood friends,   And things are as they were before in mystic time that never ends.   There's Tom and Jim and Joe and Bill, restored to youth once more in dreams,   We play again upon that hill which rang with laughs and joyous screams.      They all grew up and went their way; to wars, to jobs, to live their lives,   They gave their all in work and play, they knew the joy of loving wives.   There was so much I meant to do, but never seemed to find the time,   And now I sit here whilst I rue that I'm no longer in my prime.      But then as if freed from a trance, my reverie comes to a close.   In looking-glass I catch a glance and wonder if that old man knows   When he was young he had it all, the whole wide-world lay at his feet;   He should have conquered and stood tall - but now I stoop low in defeat.      My friends are gone, dead many years, and I am left to face my fate.   I try to hold back burning tears and know I've left things far too late.   I should have made more of my life and not just let it slip away,   And raw regret cuts like a knife for things unsaid I meant to say.      Regret for things I meant to do, but sadly, madly, left undone.   The woman that I meant to woo, who might have borne to me a son.   I sat and watched life pass me by as I was left upon the shelf,   And then it was to late to try and all I had left was myself.      So one truth now I realize, that life is like a bitter pill -   And as I dab tears from my eyes I dream once more of that green hill,   Remembering with poignant joy the happy lad I was at ten -   And wish I was a little boy, if only for one day again.

I feel very positive as i try to think only positive thoughts. But i don't   understand what makes us the way we are? I've only been this way for almost 2 months now. It started when i couldn't stop over-analyzing myself and why people were different from each other, why are people faster and why were some people just plain retarded.      I'm a 16 year old Homeschooler so i'm always alone but i'm not depressed. My dad told me to keep thinking positively, but it seems that all of my reactions, and everything are now on autopilot. I dont feel like i have a life, i'm confused at why i'm here... I really don't know who i am...

Loretta was adopted by Carol's half-sister Donna(Carol's father was Curis Neue, Donna neer knew her father). All that I know is my mom (Loretta) was born in Hood River, Oregon on 11/24/1958. Joseph Brant worked for a loggng company in White Salmon/ Hood River, Oregon in the 1950's. Supposedly Joseph Brant was German and Native American. The name may have been changed from Brandt to Brant. Joseph Brant's parents are burried in Hillsboro, Oregon, but I don't know their names. I believe Joseph Brant died in 1965.
20090219193423AAUyPpU	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will somebody review my prologue? Thanks!?	It was a cold winter morning and she woke up in a tangle of his sheets. She climbed out just enough to grab her notebook and then hurriedly scrambled back to the warmth of the covers. His eyes opened and gazed at her ever so gently.     “You never put that damn notebook down.” he laughed rubbing his eyes. He pulled the worn book from her hands and playfully kept it out of my reach.     “Give it back!” she shrieked rolling on top of him, grinning.     “Or what?” He challenged. She sat there for a minute, gathering the covers to shield her from the cold.     “Or….or…. I’ll do this…” and as the curiosity sprang into his eyes, she leaned down and kissed him.     “Is that all you got?” he snickered. He loved the thought of provoking her.     “Of course not.” she poked him mischievously and then I stood up. The covers fell from her lap revealing the skin of her bare legs. Shivering, she picked up the pitch black comforter and dragged it off it the bed, but she didn’t stop there. She hauled it all the way across his loft and watched as the surprise took over him.     “Jesus!” he hollered as the cold air drifted over him.    “That’s not my name.” She shook my head and placed my hands on my hips.     “You know what I meant. Now get your *** back over here, and bring the cover.” He looked at her, seriously this time, but she knew better. Suddenly, he was standing, covered only by his underwear. She admired his lean body and perfectly chiseled abs. “Don’t make me come over there.” He shook his head and his shaggy brown hair swayed from side to side. Careful steps he took, as he came toward her, as if he was a hunter and she the deer. When he got close enough he leapt forward, tackling her down onto his couch. They laid there for a minute with his arms around her. She kissed his shoulder and he closed his eyes. Then, just like in a fairytale, he picked her up and carried her back to his bed.     “So you really like writing in that old beat up thing?” He asked as he retrieved the covers. She sat against the headboard, the notebook in front of her.     “Yes.” She tucked a piece of her hair behind my ear, suddenly feeling defensive and vulnerable.     “Have you ever written anything about me?” He made himself comfortable on his side about halfway down the bed.     “Why do you ask?” She picked up the notebook and held it to my chest protectively.     “Well, my brother had a boyfriend, ex-fiancée actually, really sweet kid who loved to draw. And um, when my brother was sleeping the kid used to draw pictures of him. Really detailed pictures… like naked.” He scratched his head as he remembered the sketches.     “I don’t draw pictures of you naked. If that’s what you’re asking.” She giggled.     “I mean, do you write about me? Do I inspire your work?” He put his hand out and she cautiously gave the book over to him.     “Just a little bit of poetry.” She admitted. She smiled down into her lap afraid to see his face. When she looked up, he was watching her, skeptically. “Okay, a lot of poetry.” He continued to watch, as if he knew there was more. “And I tried to write kind of a story or something… That was back when we first met.”     “A story or something? Did you finish it?” His mind jumped at the idea.      “No… I didn’t.” She watched as he flipped through the tattered pages.    “Why not?” He lifted my chin with his finger, staring intimately into her eyes as if she was about to tell him a secret.     “I just wasn’t sure… about where it would go. I wanted something a little bit more solid.” She looked down shamefully, remembering the days in the beginning of their relationship, about what a mess everything was. “Do you want some breakfast? I ‘d love to fix you something to eat.” she changed the subject.     “That would be great.” He touched her hand thoughtfully. “But first, I’d like to ask you a favor.”     “I’d do anything.” She held his hand. She was just so lucky to finally have him.     “I want you to write.”     “That’s simple.”    “Maybe not as simple as you think.”     “I write all the time.”     “This is different. I have a request.”     “What do you want me to write about?”     “Us. I want you to write about us.”    “Us?” She asked. He nodded shyly, almost embarrassed. And with that, she took the notebook from his hand and pulled her favorite pencil from the binding. She glanced over at him and as she did, he leaned in and kissed my jaw. As he settled next to her, his eyes closed and his arm draped over her thighs, words bloomed onto the paper like never before. On his bed, while the world whirled around outside, she began Our Story.

20090219202434AA6noBQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	I was bored one day so I decided to write a story. This is only one tiny part of it so I know I need to add more detail and change it into paragraphs. Please don't be rude because I'm only 12 but answer honestly.                                         “Cassie!”my mother yelled. “Cassie wake up!” I pretended not to hear her and tried to go back to sleep. I was having a wonderful dream that was back in Chicago with all my friends and I wanted to get back to it. But I was unsuccessful. My mom charged into my room and turned on the light. “Cassie you better wake up this instant or you’ll be late for school, “she threatened. I groaned and practically fell out of bed. I was swamped. I had stayed up all night worrying about my first day of 7th grade and being in a new school. My parents had divorced when I was 3 and Mom and I have spent most of my life moving around. Dad wasn’t around much. He lived in Virginia with his new wicked wife, Diane, so it was just me and Mom. Our newest home was in  Miami, Florida. I really kind of liked it here. There was sun, surf, and lived right by the beach. Plus there were a lot of hot guys roaming around. But it still wasn’t home. I looked over at the clock and realized what time it was. My mom was right. I was going to be late. I quickly threw on the outfit I had planned to wear the night before (a t-shirt that say Abercrombie and Fitch on it and a pair of jean shorts). I put on my blue converses and headed toward the bathroom. I yanked a brush through thick ,tangled ,brown hair my hair  until it was smooth and hastily brushed my teeth. I quickly washed my face and put on my lucky bracelet. By the look of the mirror, I was presentable. Grabbing my book-bag, I walked into the kitchen where my mom was waiting for me. “You need to eat something,” Mom said. “There’s no time. I’m already late.”I replied. “Well at least eat this,” she said handing me a piece of toast. I accepted and nibbled on it before throwing it away. Mom looked at me, but let it go. She grabbed her keys and I followed her outside. We got into her Sedan and started to back out of the driveway. Oh God, I thought. What will it be like? Will I fit in? What if I embarrass myself in front of everyone. I tried to push these thoughts out of my head as we headed toward the school. I had a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach something bad was going to happen. I didn’t know until later that day how right I was.

20090219203232AAVeO4k	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why Does Everyone Think They Can Write A Book?	I asked this a while back, and got mauled for "being so negative about people's dreams".      But I ask again, in true curiosity: why does everyone think they can write a good, memorable book?     Being honest: most people have neither the training, time, or talent to write a solid and publishable novel. However, it's become a common assumption that everyone should "publish a book before you die".       It is this attitude, frankly, that has led to the publication of so many bad books, and helps vanity presses thrive, all of which devalues the artform of writing. It also leads to the assumption that a published book is a good book.      What does B&A think?

I am 34 years old and have a pretty long story to tell about growing up as an only child with divorced parents.  I have lived a life overflowing with truly EVIL actions, words and circumstances surrounding my step-mother.  She hides behind a curtain of Christianity, yet fools no one in our entire family how horribly wrong things can take place when my father allows her to continue to torment my life and now my two little girls.        Most step family self-help books I've seen are focused on how the "step" can become able to cope with the child.  This happens to be the other way around.  How can I get my story out there?  What are the legal matters surrounding a memoir when the things written target another person?  These are all true, witnessed, even documented in a couple of rare aspects.  Also, how should I begin a topic that encompasses 25 years?  Thank you for any guidance given.

I'm writing mine about Edgar Allan Poe because I've always been a fan of the Dark Romantics. My main points will focus on the sin in man, insanity, and death. I need to use quotes from Poe's work. I know just about everything he wrote could relate to all three of these but could you give me some specific stories or poems of his? I need a few that really exemplify one or more of those points.       I also want to use a quote for my opening sentence. So maybe something from one of his stories, or something he said. Or maybe just something someone said about him? That would be really helpful too.       Thanks!         ~FireStarter

Four years out   From the egg    And now   A rain    Of stones and scorns   From others    Who could not bear   Or would not   The sound   Of almost too much love.   The boy? He sings   Less often now,    The stones are different,   Harder.    They all have grown   They all have flown   Away.   The song lives   In a different throat   That does not know   The freedom of   A child’s swing   Or the comfort   Of a cushioned nest,    Yet still sweetly trills.

And maybe there was a kid who becomes friends with them? And I have a feeling that an elevator in the apartment was mentioned, if there even was an apartment?      Okay, talk about vague.

So it's a short story where a guy goes into a bar, and wins some dangerous, wild cat from a mysterious man.  The cat ends up bringing up closer to a waitress he has a crush on.        He doesn't end up with the girl for good, but they at least spend some "quality" time together.  When he loses her, he gets depressed and tries to confront the cat.  It ends a little ambiguously.

20090219192946AAFUAg0	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	One of my favorite poems, am i good?	This abyss is in my soul forever,   Suffocating the walls of solitude,    Swallowing the sorrow of the past.    This abyss of my life is like the panting;    The panting of canine breath,   Always struggling to find the air.    But, alas, I am the chosen son.    My father has my faith wrapped up,   With all the sparkles filed up in white.    The folder of my likeness took,   The knowledge never gained, never believed,   Not known to be written in any book.    However, no matter the graveness,   Imagination gives the power of gods.    Had I to believe in such despondency   I would love the lord, savior, and chosen one…    But what is there to believe, but you, yourself.   Am I just another page to be burned,   Or the product of family times wealth?    I do not want things to plague my existence.   I do not need the golden doors, white walls,    Nor any sort of picket fence, Truth!   Give me truth and I will show you me;    Give me lies and I act like a stapler,    Squeezing your lips together so tight.    The words spit blood, not to come out.    I do not need your empathy, or good grace,    Give me honesty and originality,    And I will show you my truest face, I say!   But where is the light in this abyss?   I still see these shadows piling up the sides,    As they sing, “Hello Child, Here we are,   Hello our leech and food for all.”   I their food for all the lonesome nights,   Fidgeting madly, never asleep, never here,   Never there, never anywhere, but dead…   Dead with the numbness I do have, joy…   Joy to knowing, I be safe, Safe in the caverns,   Safe in my longing, longing for truth,   Longing for what’s real in this terrific place.

20090219191929AAju4pl	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you let your life happen to you or do you live?	And how do you feel about this question? What do you think of it?      Personally, I believe up to age 18, many let life happen and claim to live. By age 18+ many spend so much time trying to figure out how to live with the (illusion of) freedom they have that instead of living, continue to let life happen.   I say this as a person who believes I am going day to day letting a lot of things happen  because I think it is the only way to have the future I think I want.      Also, if you believe you live instead of letting life happen, I would like to know how.

You sit patiently as she speaks   Although your mine is someplace else,   But she does not notice this   If she did, her face would melt.      You think her stories have no reason   Why is she telling them at all?   Why should you care what happened in the past   That was 60 years ago, after all.      Then she shows you something new   A picture of her at your age,   She asks you what you think   No answer- your eyes are engaged      Blue eyes, brown hair, pale skin   Thin lips and a crooked smile,   A fragile delicate figure   Behind her, daisies for miles.      She noticed you looking blankly   How confused she must be,   She asks what’s wrong- you say,   “That’s my face looking back at me.”         :::My Treasure:::      My strength and my weakness,   if not for you   I'd be lost, adrift      Whenever my body inhales you,   I quiver with bliss   with fire, peace      You heal my pummeled soul,   making my heart free   pure delight, pleasure      Thoughts of you cloud my mind,   you are my priceless prize   my treasure, the apple of my eye

Never forget though   that  fearsome thing   which makes this a search to die for   with the hair of fire   and eyes of stone.

20090219193527AAIS9Mk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm looking for a book I read some time ago... Children of the Flame series?	When I was in middle school my parents bought me this amazing book and I've since lost it; I believe it was the second book in a series and the series was named something like "Children of the Flame".  I'm trying to find it again!  I can't remember the title or the author, however.  I read it about 5 or 6 years ago.  It is of the fantasy/sci fi  genre and has a clear connection with the Norse gods.      I remember there being two women, one a hardened warrior who was pregnant.  The other was having twins, one twin from the king and the other twin from the main character (who was an assassin?).  The main goal of the book was to gather shards to put together so that the curse of infertility would be lifted from the land.  Once all of the shards were collected, the elves did some kind of enchantment, and the book ended with the main character realizing he could communicate telepathically with one of the girl's cat, and the cat was pregnant (so the curse was lifted?).        I remember the book cover looking like a bunch of elves (I remember thinking that they looked kinda weird) in a trance around an opening portal, all of their mouths were open because their powers are done through singing.      There was also a section where they went into a land of spider-people, and the pregnant warrior's baby's soul was sucked out of her by one of the spider-people.      Does anyone know what book I'm talking about?!

Lemme know thanks               Teen years   At times the world is dark   Then the sun shines and brings hope   Your body grows to fit the shape of your soul   Your friends are there but their hearts have changed   Confusion is a factor   An identity is emerging   People recognize you as a person   Your pain becomes visible   No one can help you   Loneliness and companionship cross your mind   School disappears from sight   You’re on your feet and have no where to go   Pressure is building   Envy flows in your veins   People crowd you and you can’t break free   The love off your life becomes your greatest enemy   Tormentors of the past become your soul mates   Your mind can’t focus   It becomes harder to breath   There is no escaping what might happen next   You realize what is out there, but are too scared to check   You dream of the past, and try to eliminate the future   You lay still in bed   Counting the ticks of time   Your life is ending sooner and sooner   Your only hope is the Lord   Being a teenager is hard, and you are stuck in a time capsule until your twentieth Birthday   Start counting the days

First, is this book appropriate (it wouldn't really matter to me, but I want my teacher to approve of the book). Also, I've heard it is quite long. How long do you think it would take to read on average? Do you think this book is too hard for a high school student to read and do a report on? And I have heard that there are different versions of the book (un-cut and original?). Which version should I read, and how can I tell if it is either one? And finally, is it really as good as everyone says it is?      Thanks for taking the time to answer my question

20090219190810AAkvPI1	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Interpretation of the poem "Bedecked" by Victoria Redel?	Bedecked   by Victoria Redel      Tell me it’s wrong the scarlet nails my son sports or the toy   store rings he clusters four jewels to each finger.      He’s bedecked. I see the other mothers looking at the star   choker, the rhinestone strand he fastens over a sock.   Sometimes I help him find sparkle clip-ons when he says   sticker earrings look too fake.      Tell me I should teach him it’s wrong to love the glitter that a   boy’s only a boy who’d love a truck with a remote that revs,   battery slamming into corners or Hot Wheels loop-de-looping   off tracks into the tub.      Then tell me it’s fine - really - maybe even a good thing - a boy   who’s got some girl to him,   and I’m right for the days he wears a pink shirt on the seesaw in   the park.      Tell me what you need to tell me but keep far away from my son   who still loves a beautiful thing not for what it means -   this way or that - but for the way facets set off prisms and   prisms spin up everywhere   and from his own jeweled body he’s cast rainbows - made every   shining true color.      Now try to tell me - man or woman - your heart was ever once   that brave.         What do you think this poem means? how would you interpret it?   -Thank you-

Sarah and Kinley are considered the two fastest girls on the team. They've always had a friendly competition going on, and they're about even in running.      They both have a crush on Grant Hallinger, who also runs track. They know that they both like him, but never worried about their friendship because he had a serious girlfriend, Olivia Johnson. But when Olivia and Grant break up, Kinley and Sarah start trying to impress him.      They do silly things that make the each other look bad. He goes on a date with each of them, and there is some heavy flirting. It all comes down to the State track meet, where Sarah and Kinley are both running the 100 meter race.

Whenever I come by some success, (after breaking my back on the down-low) my mum always says I should 'thank God'. But when things go belly up, she's all sympathetic, but she never says 'blame God'. Why the disconnect? If god is somehow to be credited with my success, why not with my failure? How about I go through life taking no favors and making no excuses? No thanks and no blame?      Because really, they are opposite sd'. But when things go belly up, she's all sympathetic, but she never says 'blame God'. Why the disconnect?

XCVIII    by Emily Dickinson   Part Two: Nature            IT ’S like the light,—     A fashionless delight,   It’s like the bee,—     A dateless melody.        It ’s like the woods,     Private like breeze,   Phraseless, yet it stirs     The proudest trees.        It ’s like the morning,—     Best when it’s done,—   The everlasting clocks     Chime noon.

20090219200814AAgbK1e	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Historical, interracial romance?	Hi everyone, I'm writing a short story that is yet to be titled which tells the story of a young black violinist who travels to Italy for a classical music symposium over the summer where she meets a young village boy who falls in love with her violin playing and most importantly...her. Theirs is a brief romance where she returns home to the USA and he stays in Italy and they keep writing letters to one another, only to discover heartbreak and love's flame die down.       I'm thinking of setting it during the 1940's WWII but I don't know how realistic that would be, should I make it modern instead of a "historical" romance? I just got inspired by listening to some classical violin right now...so I'm kind of on a roll..      any suggestions? Would you read it? Thanks for the replies...

20090203102317AARa6TS	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	It seems the scales of love are tipped   To favour those whose hearts can flip   Our steadfast hearts have battled, fought   For hearts that sail away,leaving us at the port      It's fine and fair for hearts that falter   To leave the hearts that cannot alter   They sit there, puzzled, then leave it to fate   We are condemned to our love; we cannot wait.      A changing heart can make a choice   Whilst faithful hearts can only hear their voice   The echos of a loss unknown   By hearts allowed to run, to roam      What can we do?   What must us hearts pay?   To win your love,   To make it stay?

City of Love      City of love, I remember walking on your empty streets   Homeless love, is in need for some treats   My missing smile, will be found when we meet      Now, as I’m leaving you, walking on fire   Step by step, going back is now a desire   Baghdad... if I say I will forget, then I’m a liar      I’m waiting at a door, waiting for an answer   Thinking of you, why has it become a cancer?   Going back to you, how has it become a danger?      I wish to give you hold some flowers, not this necklace of sorrow   Walking in your streets is a joy even if they become so narrow   I ran out of tears, help, from where can I borrow?   My people, my country, my passion   Stop blaming destiny, our grudge has become aggression   Is it us that caused this? What an obsession

Well, I'm planning to write a book and I want to know what you think of these titles and plots and tell me which is the best.      Titles:   The Incomparable   Breathless   She's A Dead Giveaway.   Within Reach      Karma   The Sparks In The Blaze   Perfection Up In Smoke   Hot Spot         Ok, well I have two Plots in my head so far so here they are..         The first one is about A girl who is a complete outcast at her high school, no one likes her, shes made fun off all the time.  She is constantly depressed and you can see it in her appearance, she wears baggy, unappealing clothing. Yet, she is love with the captain of the hockey team. Her mother passed away only 2 years back, when she was 14. she was extremely close to her and looked up to her.Alls she has is her father and a stepmother who is constantly on her case and tries to be like her mother, but never compares. On a snowy, icy day, she was driving with her father to the hospital because her step mom slipped on ice and broke her arm. on the was there, a huge, 1inch think sheet of black ice, was on a corner. no one expected it a as they turned, they spun out of control into the Telephone pole on the corner, it flipped over a few times too. the girl begins to see a bright light and then her mother, she knows she is dead. she is ecstatic to see her mother after all this time. but the image of the hockey captain she was in love with burns in her head. she cant live without him. so, she goes back to Earth and watches him everyday. since she is a spirit, he cant see her. but he can feel her around him and it freaks him out a little, her mother helps her overcome all these things, and tries to make the captain notice her. when he finally gets the idea, they communicate through letters with no addresses. he falls in love with the girl she really is on the inside, the beautiful girl inside.    i just need to come up with an ending for that one.         the next on is about the opposite, the most popular, beautiful girl in the world, everyone loves her and she has the perfect life, boyfriend family and all. But, her inner self, is mean and rude, she makes fun of people all the time, she is never nice to me parents, she controls her boyfriend, and her friends follow her every move, of course she loves it this way though. But she never thought that karma would catch up to her. Bad things start to happen to her, first, her older sister who has a two year old, gets cancer at age 25. next, her parents get into a car accident, her father passes away and her mother, is in a coma. he boyfriend leaves her and her friends stick up for themselves, her world is falling apart. she only has her older sister now, but she continues to not change, when her sister passes away 6 months later, she is forced to take her daughter., as they are struggling for money, living in a motel, she starts to change her attitude, but now that the daughter is 5 years old now, she is off to school, when she brings home a bad report card and the girl cracks under all the stress, her and the daughter were sitting in the motel room when the fire alarms go off and there neighbors room goes up in flames. they are stuck in the room when  they are rescued by a handsome, fit, and caring firefighter. it was love at first sight and then, he disappears. they meet again 7 years later, at a high school reunion, She finds out that he was a nerd that had the biggest crush on her in high school, but he was invisible to her, they leave together and live a perfect life after.

Also, what does the form and structure of its lines suggest?      The last animal                  ------------------------In the Sarajevo Zoo      A bear      ------------Died of starvation      Because the leaves      ------------------------Had fallen      From the trees      ---------------Because      The air was                  -------------Getting colder      So the snipers      ------------Could more easily see      The few remaining people      --------------------------Who were trying to      Feed it.      --------------------------------------...      The dashes are there to show the structure of the poem or else   it would be all a space apart and that's not how the poem goes.

20090219195450AAkWPbG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Story Ideas??? Would you read it?	Okay, so I have this  story idea. I'm only 15, so I was just wondering if it was any good. It doesn't read like a flyleaf, just so you know. Just rough, very rough, plot.      Karen and Shelly are irish twins and share a close bond. When they are seven their parents divorce. Dad gets custody of Karen and moves to L.A. to pursue his rock-star dream, and Mom moves with her mother and Shelly to Russia to study ballet. But when the mom disappears and Shelly's  grandma suddenly dies, Shelly is sent to a Russian orphanage and forced to give up English to learn Russian. Meanwhile, Karen is being neglected in L.A. and is constantly beat and molested by her dad's band mates. Years later, at news of her father's death, Shelly treks to the U.S. for his funeral where she meets Karen. The two reconize each other, but are unable to communicate. Sadly, Karen has gone bankrupt and will soon be homeless, and Shelly is dying of brain cancer. The two race against time to try to communicate and prove the bonds of sisterhood can overcome any obstacle.      would it be something you would read?

20090219200011AAkgRYW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good start to a book?	Is this a good story that takes place in the 1800's in London and about a child and a Pirate.      Years have passed since this story was last told, and many more will go by before people realize the extent of it. But either way my life should be remembered even by those who don’t want to listen. For this is the story of how I lived, and how I died.    The lights of London, once glowing remained dim tonight. Every shutter was shut and every door locked. Not a sound echoed across the cobblestone streets of London tonight for fear they might miss what little warning they may have. For tonight was the night that he came. Tonight Captain Tory would come. Nobody slept on this night for fear of what was to come. And hiding behind shut windows and locked doors did little to ease that fear. For everyone knew what would happen if Captain Tory’s weathered eye caught sight of you. The torture and the suffering that would surly follow was rivaled only by death.   Nobody knew what had made this man so twisted and cruel. Some believe that he had made a deal with the devil of the sea, Davy Jones, to bring fear to the eyes of the millions that had forsaken him. Still others thought that he was simply a man, forsaken by his gods and standing on the edge of madness. But I did not care what had made him this way nor of what plans had he for the people he took. My only concern was staying out of his path of destruction and listening for the first shot.   Darkness had engulfed the world that night. Nothing could be seen that wasn’t directly in front of you, and as I sat there hidden among the scraps of cloth and bags of garbage, I wondered what was happening outside the confines of the little alley way I found myself hiding in. Not a sound could be heard except the monotonous pounding of the waves on the beach. Suddenly a glowing orb of light moved passed the entrance to the alley. I froze, unsure of what to do. The light cast a luminescent glow towards me, but its carrier did not seem to take much interest in the child hiding amongst the filth of the London docks.

It's raining love   And I'm hoping to catch some   But it just slips through my fingers   like a snake slithering out of it's predator's talons   I'm drowning in something that dosn't even exist   I'm choking on my own sorrow   And every second it's tightening its grip around my heart   feeding my soul to the devil   And when the sky clears   I know my love will never blossom again      See it   See them   See what they see   Hear it    hear them   hear what they hear   feel it   feel the voices   crawling down your back   Feel it all come true         I'm that leaf that's hooked to a tree,   The tree is my home until,   the wind comes by and sets me free   At first I feel like a bird   But then the wind is my new parent pulling me where it ants me to go   When the wind ceases,   I fall softly into the water   At first i feel like a fish swimming free   But the water is my new parent pulling me where it wants me to go   Just like the leaf I'm never free,    nor are you.      Each day   I count the steps you take away from my heart   And each minute, eaach second,   I think of things I wish I said   But it's too late   to hate   I still love you   But your fading from my heart   I miss you   But I must move on   Each day   I wish I smiled at you   but now that your gone   whats the point   Each minute, each second,   I think of things I should have said         Every time we touch   My heart burns   And my mind shuts down   You make my soal fly higher   Than any bird has gone,   I want you to know,   That my mind spins like crazy when you smile at me,   And what word can fit?   Love?   I want you to know,   That I'm in love with you.         Beutiful face   Sour heart   A face from heaven   a heart from hell   Eyes so blue mind so cruel   A walk so strong   Yet it takes you nowhere   Beutiful Beautiful   sour sour

20090219203751AASgNmE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Im writing a book and this is a passage from it tell me what you think.?	"So today we are going to try and climb a tree, not by going up, but by bringing the branch down to us" said Professor Botania. Rayna and Keira went to the trees next to each other. Keira went first, she was so good at it now it took not more than a couple seconds to bring the branch down. she grabbed it and it lifted her up to the top. "oh, yes, very good that's what im looking for, everyone come see Miss Grimwood" said the Professor. Then something strange happened. The tree started to jerk up and down like a bucking bronco. people started to gasp and Keira started screaming. "Aaaaaahhhh" she screamed. It then jerked so hard it threw Keira into another tree which then bizarrely used its branches like arms and grabbed her around the neck. "oh my god its strangling her" screamed Cassandra. Rayna rushed up to try and pry the branches off her, but the other tree batted her away. Keira started to turn blue as she struggled for breath. "Whoosh" came a sound from nowhere. The branches holding Keira suddenly snapped off and spiraled away. embedded in the tree were two bright white, five pointed, shurikens. Rayna turned and saw a figure behind her with a couple more of those shurikens. "Mom" gasped Rayna in relief. the other trees were gonna grab Keira again but this time Professor Botania came to the rescue. "Creature of Nature, bend to my will" she said in a hushed voice. The trees suddenly stopped moving and let go of the captured students. Keira regained her breath and ran up to Rayna's mom " Thank you, Professor Clearwater, you saved my life" she said. " It was nothing but we have to find out why these things are happening" she answered. " OK students, youre dismissed" said Professor Botania. The two teachers rushed to the castle to tell Professor David. "that was a close call" said Rayna. "Ya, good thing your mom came to save us" said Cassandra. They headed back to the castle for lunch.

And you can skip the dates/details. I can check that up anywhere.       It's just, you know? Frustrating. When you think you know all the facts about the Industrial Revolution for AP History, you find out that Revolution started a World Economy, creating the Great Depression, creating World War I.

20090219203817AApFwRp	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I Need a Title for My Poem.?	The lightning torn the dark clouds apart   Its forked ending reaching low towards the earth   Where I stood, blinded by the light   The thunder shattered the atmosphere   Sending the birds panicking in flight   Its sound left me in a state of shock, frozen in time   The end is coming      There you came   With an umbrella in your hands   Running towards me in the pouring rain   Occasionally slipping in the mud   Your shoes were stained with mud and dirt   Your clothes stuck to your skin, drenched    Your hair matted on your forehead, droplets of rain rolled down your face      But you ran toward me   With a smile that could light up a whole room   Your eyes connected with mine   A rush of warmth in my veins   What is this feeling?   I almost didn’t recognize it anymore   It was hope.      As we both stood in the rain   The umbrella in your hands   We looked up toward the sky   Through the rain   Through the clouds   Through the mist over my eyes   The sun blazing, radiating its heat over us   I did not realize that tears of joy rolled down my cheeks as the clouds parted      All these storms and blizzards   Are just sprinkles of distractions on my way.      and constructive criticism :]   Thanks~~
