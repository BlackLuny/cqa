Unless the amount of tips that you receive on credit cards is higher than 8% of your total sale., Then you should claim at least that amount, because there is a paper trail to that. But in general, no, waiters DO NOT claim 100% of their tips, with good reason, in my opinion.|`|cWLEe3CSaa	helllll nooooo<br>  <br>  i was a server and i only reported like 30% of my tips (or whatever was realistic)<br>  <br>  its not fair.. servers shouldnt have taxes on the extra money customers decide to give them for their good service\<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  whoever gave me thumbs down has never been a server! so they dont know how its like.. dumb asses|`|8963a1e982fc70801b854c147dff31b6aa	Hell no!  You are only required to report a minimum percent of your earnings, and the less you report, the less taxes you pay.  So, why would you want to report 100%?<br>  <br>  
oZ5dy6oraa	O.k. First of all, remember: you can only do one thing at a time. Next, try to prioritize. Think about all the things you need to do and what needs to be done first. Lets say you have a new table that needs to be greeted, another table has been waiting for their bill and are in a rush to leave, another table wants drinks refilled, and another table's food is in the window. At this point, try to save your butt if you can. Those ppl who are ready to go, grab their bill first. They are already getting crabby. The table that just got there will need a second to settle in. Next I think that I would rather refill drinks, because going back to the kitchen is going to take longer, and they are liable to want something else once you do bring the food out. Plus, they don't know the food is ready (hehe). Sometimes the drinks are near the kitchen so you can bring those refills out with the other table's food if you have a tray. I just try to keep in mind whats the quickest thing I can get done, and do that first. <br>  But hey, really a lot of it has to do with how you handle yourself to the customer. Where I work, the kitchen is constantly running behind, but no one ever complains to me, even though all my co-workers get complaints. You just have to make the customers confident in you. If they see that you have it under control, and you know what needs to get done, they won't mind waiting, because they know that if their food was ready, you would bring it. And if someone is starting to get aggravated, just head them off before they get too upset, and before they even get a chance to complain. Tell them, I was just checking on your order. They're pretty backed up back there but it looks like its getting closer. If you can, get them a free drink while they wait or dessert later, and tell them u appreciate their patience. Tell them there's a new person in the kitchen, heck, whatever it takes to make you look like you rock, even if its all because you screwed up.<br>  But in those moments, when its totally crazy, just take a breath and do one thing at a time. Remember, some things buy you more time too. Sometimes you can grab a drink order and even if you can't get it right away it will buy you a couple extra minutes before you have to get the whole order.<br>  Oh yeah and practice too but thats no fun|`|yYbp9hSLaa	I relax and take a fifteen second mental break and close my eyes and breathe deeply... then im ready to rock!!! i had that issue today, it was so stressful then had my boss on my @$$ on top of that! it was frustrating. oh not to mention someone dined and dashed on me and i had to pay for it out of my tips... i posted a question about it if you feel like answering|`|GiBUKFJYaa	Take a deep breath and go for it

When we get there it like 10 but had to go early because it was NYE and we knew it would get packed. We asked the bouncer how much cover charge was ad he said $25 each for VIP and $20 for regulars...so we got in the VIP line [[there were two lines going]] we waited outside in the cold for 50 minutes before they could get the "crowds under control" *remind you we are the FIRST people* in line. After nearly an hour they finally let us in and we get to the cashier and she said $40 each..we told her that the two bouncers said $25 each for VIP, she said not on holidays. So we paid the damn $40 each and asked her to point us to the VIP section, she said "we don't have a VIP section" we offer VIP "service". VIP service entails when you go up to the bar and you hold your wristband in the air you get waited on first. ha. yeah right never once did I not wait in line less than 20 minutes for a $6 beer and VIP service also includes your line getting in the club first. what a freakin joke. SO the room has a huge mirror and about 100 butterflies that are made of paper and crayons colorings taped to the wall. So ghetto. It has a huge fish tank that has 3 dead fish in it and 2 bottles of beer. Me and my boyfriend were the only 2 hispanics there everyone else was black which is fine but I felt out of place. The music sucked, they had only ONE bathroom. OMG ONE bathroom, it took me 30 minutes to get in and out. No drink specials...it was so packed you couldn't even move, no joke. I went to the other "dance room" and they were twin babies in a stroller..swear to God. The bartender said they were his kids. They were just chillin in the stroller..WTF?! Oh and I looked at my phone to see what time it was so they could do the countdown for 2009 it was 12:44 pm. They didn't even do a countdown until 12:50 because the DJ said he forgot because he was so "in the zone" with the music..[[his exact words]] overall it was so lame. Im dead serious. GO somewhere else. Oh, and parking was $20.<br>  <br>  * oh and Butterfly High that she was talking about is closed, and they said its not re-opening soon *
