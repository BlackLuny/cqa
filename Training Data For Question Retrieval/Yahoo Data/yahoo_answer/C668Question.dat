20090304154544AAyAeKw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Typically, does a young teen relationship grow closer once they move out together? Please read my situation?	Me and my boyfriend are 16 years old. We have been together for 3 years!   Now, me and my boyfriend are the type of relationship who is so devoted to each other that we dont even /want/ to have friends of the opposite sex. we think its dumb to do that because we have each other. we are also both very down to earth, very very mature, and pretty quiet. we both love video games and guitar, etc.   We have the kind of relationship where we are very sweetsie and polite to each other, and also are so close we couldn't imagine being without.   We dont have a car yet, but we're getting there soon. Lately, although we dont dream of breaking up, we are feeling like theres nothing much to do and we need to both get out- together!      so my question is, once we get a car, and eventually move out when we're 19 or 20, will our relationship spice up? i feel like once we get our car and move out we will be free to do whatever we want together. was this true for you or someone you know/heard about? :]

20090304154655AArFfcG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Losing it and emotions...Help?	Okay. So I am engaged to a wonderful man with whom I truly love. Thing is, I will be 25 by then and I am still a virgin. He knows, as we have not been able to have sex due to a gyno issue and of course respect for our beliefs (we attend a pentecostal church). The gyno issue is being worked out, as I have found a very helpful doctor, and she is certain I will be able to give myself to my guy for our wedding night. He has had one or two previous partners several years ago, which doesn't bother me since at least one of us will know what to do.    What I want to know is what is the emotional impact of this going to be? I am a sensitive person, and nobody has every really talked about the emotions that happen afterwards so I don't know what to think. Any ladies out there, please answer, will the dynamic of the relationship change? Guys, what would you think if the first time your lady had s3x was on your wedding night? Why doesn't anybody talk about this? No church type answers please, real life experience.

20090304154818AANNlEv	Family & Relationships;Family	How much money to send teenage nephews for their birthday?	I have 5 teenage nephews I am fairly close to and usually send them $40-50 in a card on each of their birthdays every year.  Someone in my family recently said, "That is not very much," when the subject came up.  So now I am wondering what you are supposed to send a teenager these days?  When I was a teen (not even 10 years ago) I thought even getting $20 in the mail was decent, but now I am confused.

20090304154754AAhRKlm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need advice about my dream guy,please?	Alright so there is this guy who I have had the biggest crush on all year. He is perfect, and is just right for me. we like the same music, both play guitar, he is funny, kind, understanding, and he gets good grades. I can't find a flaw. I know all this from my friends, who have friends that are his friends, ha sorry, i don't know how to explain it any better. Anyway i think about him all the time and i really have a hard Time concentrating in the classes he is in with me. I can't help but glance over at him. He is so cute, his eyes are gorgeous and you should see his smile. He never leaves my head, and really wish that we talked. That leads me to my problem, I can't get myself to have a conversation with him. I don't want to say something stupid, and this will most likely happen because every time i see him my heart speeds up and i can't help but smile. I have said talked to hm when i sat next to him in my math class, but are seats got changed, so there is no opportunity to talk to him. I never had a chance to become friends with him, so i think that it would be weird if i just walked up to him in the halls and start talking. uuhh i like him soooooooooo much. please give me some advice.

20090304154854AAlBe4F	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I be concerned that my boyfriend and I don't travel well?	My boyfriend and I went to Cancun, the resort was beautiful and perfect.  Most of the time we laid on the beach or ate.  Yet, he was upset that in the evenings I didn't want to 'party' as much.  At the clubs, when we did go, he just stood around anyway and wouldn't dance.     In the end, I have to say, it was a little boring being there alone with him.  Is this a normal feeling to have?  Should I be concerned if me and my boyfriend can't have 'fun' in Cancun?  Do you and your partner have 'trouble' traveling but still have a happy relationship otherwise?

20090304155118AAbMUGN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I admitted something sexual to my husband, now what?	I threw all my shame out the window, and admitted something embarassing and sexual to my husband.  It's really sick, but basically I told him that I like to make him angry because its a huge turn on for me.  He is such a passive person, and I do love him, but he changes when he is angry and I love that person too.  I don't know what the heck is wrong with me.  But, the madder he gets, the more excited I get.  I feel totally screwed up, crazy, stupid, psycho, whatever.... But sometimes I dream up ways to piss him off.        Maybe I need psychiatric care...  Anyway, I went too far the other day and really hurt his feelings, so I decided I better tell the truth about why I did it.  He hasn't really "said anything" about this admission of guilt... What do I do now...???
20090304155025AAcnlvb	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it rude to ask someone not to bring a certain guest?	I will be mailing out invitations soon and I have a guest dilemma. My fiance and I are friends with some people at work that used to be a couple. We had planned on inviting them on the same invite until they split. we still want to invite both separately but I don't want him to bring his new girlfriend. Now for the story behind why...They were together for 6 years and she found out a couple of months ago he has been cheating on her with this girl for almost a year. He is now with the girl he was cheating with. I don't want her there. Is it going to be too rude of me to say that I would really like him to come but I would rather he not bring his new girlfriend due to my friend (his ex) coming and I don't want any drama? I don't want to tell him the truth that I really don't want her to come because I don't like her. How would you handle this?

20090304154934AA3zwfK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my relationship failing or progressing?	I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months and we have known each other for almost 2 years.      We have been happy throughout the entire time and have very similar interests (both short term and long term).  We communicate well, but have the occasional petty argument (but who doesn't?).      But over the past week or so, I have been feeling very distant and neither of us can really think of anything to talk about much of the time.  We still enjoy being together, though.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   About us:  I am 20 and she is 17.  We are from the same city.  She is in high school and I am in college in the same town, so we can see each other every few days.  One or both of us may have some mild depression, but neither of us have been diagnosed.  Another stresser is that her parents announced a couple weeks ago that they are getting a divorce and that has added stress to the family.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Does anybody have any ideas what is going on?  Is our relationship starting to fail OR are we just getting through the so-called "honeymoon phase" and just starting to settle in.      I realize that it is hard to judge a relationship that you know little about, but what are your thoughts?
20090304154924AAKHfMN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this be weird? please answer?	ok well our school has a turnabout dance coming up late march like march 20th. i really wanted to ask this one guy that i have liked for over a year. but i dont want to ask him because i dont really talk to him ,and i think he might think im weird if i ask him.      like is it weird to ask someone you dont talk to? hes been in my classes last year he was but not this year. so he knows who i am its not like he doesnt have a clue. i suspect he might like me but im not sure.      im so chicken to talk to him because he has been over by my locker a few times(his friends have lockers by mine) and its a lot easier said than done.       people have told me well just talk to him. well hes not in my classes, and i cant just go up to him in the hallway and be like "hey havent talked to you in a while" because ive never really had a convo with him. i tried facebook. i added him and was going to talk to him on the chat thing but hes never on there, like ever.      what should i do? i know i will regret it if i dont ask him and its been bugging me and ive liked him for so long. i decided i shouldnt but all my friends are dissapointed and theyre all like well you should because youve liked him for so long..            im running out of time though

20090304160120AAbH3tL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it normal for men to stop being Intimate with there pregnant wife?	My fiance and I don't have an active bedroom life, (not by my choice) I am 25 and he is 42. I am 9 1/2 weeks pregnant and the last time we were "together" was when I got pregnant. He doesn't even touch me now, unless it is to give me pecks on the mouth when he leaves for work and when I wake up.       To say the least I am getting pretty frustrated. Is it normal that it went to non existent when we found out I was pregnant? Could it have something to do with his age? I think he is getting bored he has never been in a committed relationship. So what can I do?          ADD: Please don't say anything about the age difference, he lied about his age when we first met, he said he was 35, and he looks it. By the time we moved in together and I found out, I loved him.

20090304155347AAvOlyd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He likes me .... and now he doesn't?	Okay so I'm 13 and this guy likes me (well I'm not sure anymore..) and he is 14. So things were kind of akward between us. But before I even knew that he liked me, he started asking for my facebook, msn, phone number, etc and if he couldn't get it he would ask his friends. Not so long ago (a week ago) I found out he liked me, through his friend. I didn't mind it, really. And since he found out that I knew that he likes me he is acting different and basically running away if I look at him, lol. He does stupid/silly stuff infront of me ... and kind of talks diffently towards me now. His friend told me that he is shy and would like to go out with me, I said no because I'm not ready to be in a relationship. He always smiles when we look at each other and stares at me for the longest time when I'm not looking (I caught him doing that many times.) Okay so this is what happened (on msn)      Him - hey can I talk to you about something?   Me - yeah ...   Him - Someone told you that I like you: I don't    Me - Okay   Me - good   Him - yeah ... okay   Him - anyways, so everything's good?   Me - I guess so   Him - kool   Him - how did you find out?   Me - what?   Him - Nevermind   Me - you mean how did I find out you liked me?   Him - kind of? ...   Me - Jonel    Him - well, then he's lying   Me - okay lol   Him - lol   Him - what's up         [That's all the information I'm giving you guys]   I know that his friend isn't lying because Jonel and I are REALLY close ............. so yeah.   Jonel also told me that he even told him that he likes me.    Do you think he's lying to not let things to be akward? Or do I have to just accept he doesn't like me and is telling the truth?

20090304155831AAvKIPA	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do? (Long)?	So, my "friend" went out with this girl and, at the start of their relationship they become very mad at me. He and I get in a fight and he becomes very 1-sided and swears his head off.       After talking to them both I still have no idea why they are mad at me.       Months pass I ask if they are still mad...no. I say alright thinking of leaving the convo at that. She then sends a message saying that all the pain I caused and how i'll never be forgiven. STILL, doesn't say why.      I don't really care about renewing any friendship never asked pro bally never will. I guess you could say it was "toxic" and ever since we have stopped talking, life has been great.       I do however hate it when people talk behind my back...guess what they did. Unfortunately, the people that still talk to them are also my friends. Even more so then thiers. So they told me and, I don't know how to handle this.       I find it hard to ignore them because, they hate me and I don't know why. I also have learned they are pushing people away. She has lost 2 of her old best friends. For him.       This is in Middle School so I don't know how they will coup when they break up.       Sorry it's long.       Overall: What do you think I should do.

20090304155527AARtKEv	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Tungsten vs. other men's rings?	I've read up on the pros and cons of both and the difference in weight, shine, durability, etc.       Tungsten seemed like the best bet because my bf works as a chef and I don't want him to scratch it.       But today we were at Kay jewelers picking out my ring and while looking at the men's rings he was trying on a tungsten ring that he liked, doesn't mind the weight and color, all that. Then our salesperson told us that tungsten rings are very durable but are also brittle so they will break if dropped.    That was kinda a bummer, I don't want that to happen but it's also something I've never heard before.    Is this true?

20090304155744AAgMNmA	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm having some friend issues.?	I need help. I have this friend that I have known for about 4 years now, but sometimes she completely gets on my nerves. We've argued a lot ever since we met, but we also had a lot in common. I hate when she acts like she doesn't care about nobody in life. Like she asked me if I was pregnant and I got into a fight, where would I rather get hit, in the face or in the stomach, I said in the face, but she said in the stomach. I thought that was so mean because you can kill your baby, like how can you be pro life, but not care if someone hit you in the stomach when you were pregnant. I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks like that, but I'd rather get hit than let the baby die, its my fault that I'm pregnant in the first place. And sometimes she get really annoying it makes me just want to slap her. She has low self esteem issues really because she always calls herself ugly, but she never takes the initiative to make herself look nice. That's not my point, the point is if you feel like you want to upgrade your looks you would want to take advice from someone who actually cares about their looks and looks nice every time you see them, but every time we give her advice she doesn't want to here what you have to say. I'm not saying she should be worried about her looks but if she is than wouldn't she want advice? Its like shes completely careless. I don't want to hang around someone that doesn't care about anything. So tell me is it worth being friends with her or should I just forget about her, and if should, how do I tell her? HELP!!!!

20090304155855AAUubU0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	First honest answer-10 points.. (to meet him, or not?)?	So, here's the thing.. I've been having this friend-pal for 4 months. It all started cause we both just went trough a break-up. At first, our past relationships was all that we've been talking about, but soon, we started to share our most intimate thoughts.      When you spend so much time writing to someone, you really get to know this person.. And, somehow, in between all our words, I started to like him.. We've decided to finally meet, but I am having serious doubts about it..      You see, he showed few pictures of his ex .. And she really is special, there is just something so beautiful about her. However, I never saw his pictures, nor did he mine.. And I'm afraid that he will compare (in physical way) the two of us, me and his ex.      So, what should I do, try to keep it this way, or go for it, and maybe lose him?

Anyway, today we were using books, and he wanted to share with me (I said no, cause I said no to someone else, and I didn't want her to hate me;later I felt so bad for him I gave him my book, and shared with someone else) also; I was talking to my friend, and he was listening in, and interrupted what we were talking about. I could of sworn he was staring at me last week, and I tried the clock trick (it worked, he was starting)    I really like him, and can't stop thinking about him! I'm not sure if it's just another middle school crush or what! (i'm in 7th grade)   I really don't want to ruin our "friendship" even though i have only known him for 5 months, and had a huge crush on him for 2. I keep thinking he's looking at me, and we sit right across from each other in 1st block (tables are in squares)    He always makes jokes, and completely shows off. He makes fun of me in playful type of way (he does that to alot of people, but it seems kinda different to me)   He says he might go to military school next year, and might not go to my high school cause he lives on the other side of town.       We were talking about what we will do when we die at lunch, and my friend asked him if he would be upset if I died, and he said "I wouldn't cry, I don't even cry when my grandpa died, but I don't want you to die"          wierd huh? (sorry I have so much, IM JUST SO CONFUSED)      Should I ask him how he feels, or wait?   I can't ask him out though, thats WAY too wierd!   I just don't know what to do! Please help me. I really like him and can't stop thinking about him, and my friend says she thinks he likes me, but HOW CAN I KNOW FOR SURE????????????????

20090304160241AAySIoE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do men say things like this when you dump them?	I told this dude i went out with a few times that i was finished with him because he had a REALLY bad attitude and was a total pervert and it was ridiculous. So i told him not to txt me again and why i was so sick of him. (the being a pervert part was the worst) and he came back with all this crap about how ugly and pathetic i was and that i wouldn't know what to do with a guy if i had one and all this mess, trying to hurt my feelings i guess.   When i know that stuff aint true, or else he wouldn't be bothering me all the time trying to get me to go have sex with him. (EVERYDAY he would txt me begging me to go get a room with him)      So WHY make up stuff? I don't get it. Does it make him feel better?

Alright so yesterday and Friday and today I talked to this girl that I haven't talked to in 5 months. Ok friday she kept eye contact with me, and smiled a lot and seemed a little nervous (I'm not sure) but we were alone with no friends around. Yesterday I talked to her and she gave me only 2-3 seconds of eye contact even though I talked to her for a minute and her friend was with her. Also she was walking faster than usual, again I could be paranoid. Today she was just like she was on Friday. Wtf was that about?
20090304160809AAbnROq	Family & Relationships;Family	So, my mother died today, and I do not really feel anything. Is this a bad sign?	My father called me today to let me know that my mother finally died from lung cancer. As corny as it was, my reply was, "Sorry for your loss." This of course resulted in a bit of anger from him and apologizing on my part.      Still, I really did not feel anything upon learning of my mother's death. We were perhaps only slightly less close than a mother and son should be, but I never resented her for anything. I knew for a couple of months that she would die soon, so I guess there was simply no surprise when I was told she had passed. So far as I can tell, I am not sad, depressed nor mourning. If anything, I just feel than an inevitable conclusion that had been long foreseen has come about. I thought that her death would have some emotional impact on me though. So did the rest of my family. Is it a bad sign this did not happen, or is it something I can expect to happen at a later date? Perhaps during the funeral?

20090304163130AAkD6oU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My sex life sucks! Need some advice to make it better !!?	I've been with my fiance for 3 years. At first we had lots of "just okay" sex, but lots of it so I didn't complain. Then after we got more comfortable with each other the amount of foreplay before sex started to decrease dramatically to the point where it was non existent. We talked about it and it improved for maybe a week. I've never given him a ******** (he;s never even mentioned it) and he's never gone down on me either, which sucks!!  Now it's to the point where we have not good sex once a week! And we have a  baby on the way ! I;m almost positive I can't live like this for the rest of my life. I've even started watching porn to make up for the lack of sex in my life. Any suggestions?

I guess you could say I am in a rut   Wake up   Dress up   Eat up   Shut up (Class starting)   Puke up (Lunch)   Sit up (Resuming from lunch)   Shut up   Suit up (Soccer practice)   Get in (Go home)   Do homework (Couldn't think of a good up to go with)   Go to sleep   Repeat      With not all to much fun in between.      I am seriously stuck in such a rut (Mainly with school) that I can't think of anything to do.. I'm starting to sleep in class, I hardly take notes (In my classes I have A/B's in) I feel as if I am going to punch the next person who rubs me the wrong way...      So what can I do to get out of this rut?   WHAT CAN I DOOO......?
20090304161323AABfpFi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	BF problems....Someone help?	I started dating this amazing guy on February 6th. I like him a lot, and he likes me for who I am. The only problem is that the relationship is causing problems for him and his friends. Two of his friends like me as well, and they are all getting into fights because of me. One of his friends threatened to not be friends with him anymore if he didn't break up with me, and is now trying to make my boyfriend feel bad because he's dating me by saying things like"You guys are too opposite...I'm better than you" and offensive things like that. His other friend flipped him off several times the other day and cusses him out a lot. I really like this guy, and I don't want to cause any problems for him...Let alone loose his friends because of me. Someone please help me...I want to do something before it's too late.

20090304160530AATf6pm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me & my bestfriends ex?	My bestfriend absolutely HATES her ex boyfriend. She didnt even really like him before they dated (which she hooked up with him once, they didnt have sex but they did other stuff) and they only lasted like a week and a half. During and after they were dating she would always say "you can have him!" or "i effing HATE him!". So i met him about three weeks ago and have been texting him and stuff and i like him. When she found out she said "well you can have your crush but you cant date him and blah blah blah". Which doesnt make any sense to me because she was always telling me i could have him. So my question is: If i was to hook up with him once or something and didnt tell her, would that be being a bad friend? Cause i dont want to hurt her feelings if she found out.

20090304160537AA82mte	Family & Relationships;Friends	I dont know why my friend is hated by everybody in her grade?	Wow I just realized how weird my school is. I have a friend that is a junior in highschool (I'm a sophomore) and she is sooo cool, I look up to her!! she's really pretty, she is so crazy and fun, she's a party animal, she's out going, and she's really friendly. Did I mention that she is a top athlete? Yea she is the fastest cross country and track runner in the school!! She's so pretty I'm jealous of her. yet I just found out that almost the whole junior class hates her!!! In choir today somebody came up to me and asked me if I was friends with her, I said yes and then I heard a couple of people snickering and laughing. I asked them what they were laughing about and they told me that nobody in her grade likes her and she is literally hated by everybody. I asked why and they didnt really have a good reason. They all said this "uhm well we just do, she's such a dork and nobody likes her". some other girl said "she has a weird face" which is untrue because I think she is so pretty. She also has like a better body then anybody I have ever met. Also she's not American actually, she's Greek. In my school people hate the foreign. I personally think she's just too cool for those losers anyway. I mean come on she's so nice and friendly and outgoing, and she is a top athlete. Why does the whole junior class despise her guts so much. I have asked other juniors if they hate her and they all said yes, even guys hate her. why is this? why does everybody hate the talented? why do guys hate her? I would think that she would be a guy magnet.       Also I have known her for a long time and she never did ANYthing to ANYbody. Its just random hatred.      I hate my school...the popular are weird and the unpopular are awesome.

20090304163325AAOIoBC	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm just curious............?	I am getting married in three weeks and even though my family and my fiance's family are very excited and very supportive I think they are still a little worried. My family (especially my mother) absolutely loves him and have expressed that they have never once thought anything bad about him or us. The same goes the other way for his family about me. However, I can tell that both of our mothers are a little worried and my mom has fully expressed to me that she is not ready for me to be married. I don't understand fully why though. I am 18 and he is 21 (we are getting married just a month before my 19th and soon his 22nd birthday). He already has a degree in law enforcement and is a police officer. I am currently a junior in college and still earning my degree. We have been dating for about a 1 1/2 yrs. and before that we worked together every day for almost two years and got along perfectly and we were best friends. Even farther back then that we went to the same school together and had a class together my freshman year. I don't think anyone on either side of the family is worried that we are making the wrong decision, but I think that they might think that its too early. That or they are just worried because they are mothers and their children (I am the first born daughter) are going away. I dunno...anyone have any idea whats goin on or have a similar experience?

20090304160418AAVzSua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help deciding on birthday gift for a complicated friends with benefits relationship?	Hi :)   I have been in an exclusive friends with benefits "arrangement" for the past six months and realized that my guy's birthday was coming up soon. The past few months have been really intense and dramatic for a lot of reasons, but basically, I wanted to casually date, he wanted to be able to hook up with other people, now he wants to date and I don't at the moment because I have some trust issues with him. I told him I needed a break from hooking up and have some time to myself to get my act together and he said that he would wait for me. Now it's a couple of weeks until his birthday and I feel like I should do something for him. A gift or going out is out of the question because we aren't dating but at the same time he means a lot to me and I want to be able to show that even though I'm upset at him at the moment, I still care... Please, any help would be much appreciated, I have agonized over this for such a long time and am still not sure what would be appropriate!!      Thanks :)

20090304161228AAIkJXz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	GIRLFRIEND ISSUE..GIRLS NEED HELP ASAP! 20 points to best answer.?	My girlfriends and i had a heavy argument the other night and she went to a very sensitive subject that made me cry and at that moment she didn't even feel sorry.. she really hurt my felling and she didn't care. then a couple minutes later she regrets its and apologizes in tears.. So anyways today she felt like she had to tell her best friend what happened that night. I asked her not to tell her cuz i don't want her friend knowing a personal moment of weakness that i had..so regardless she went out and told her.. and i got upset cuz she went against me. so the question im trying to ask is am i over-reacting or should i be rightfully mad that she cant respect what i am telling her. (by the way this isnt the first time she has done this went against my back & word knowing how i feel and that i am a very personal person and to open up to her is hard for me, and now i want to end it with her.. so am i in the right or wrong?, am i just being overly sensitive) O by the way the thing she said was mean as hell, never expected her to say **** like this.. cuz i thinks she is pregnant and she is scared... so i jokingly told her that she was and rubbed her stomach and that got her upset, then she tell me that if she is pregnant with my baby that she will kill it and mine alone.. so basically if she was pregnant by another guy she would keep it. but not mine...she said she wouldn't tell me she was pregnant. Thats a really fucked up thing to say or am i alone in this? is it something to cry about? i feel foolish.. need help.. im 19 and so is she and been together for about 3 months.

We have been friends for a while now and like, he's really protective and stuff, but i try and pay attention to the girls he hangs out with and he treats them way diffrent than me! Like i will punch him, and he'll punch me back, but when some other guy punches me he like goes off on them, seriously going off. and when i feel like doing something insanely stupid, he will keep me from doing it because he knows i will most likely get hurt doing it... i asked him once who he liked and he said " i dont know who i like." and i said "why not?" and he replied, "because, i probably like someone, just that if i like someone then it will take work, and i dont like work." and i said "well, it takes a poopload of work to keep me safe from myself, but you do that anyhow" and he said "...."       so, what does this mean if anything?   could you be so kind to give me a detailed explination?   if he does like me, i need to space myself a little bit away from him, im not ruining what i have now. but i would like to know.   i really dont need personal comments about me, only him.   & please, no judging here.

OH, i am 17 and she is 11   and i think some of you will agree that anime is not appropriate for little kids   and then if i tell her not to put my music on her ipod she tells my mother, who yells at me! and i think of taking the songs off her ipod when she aint around but that will just get me in trouble (she is the BIGGEST mammas girl of all time!)   how do i tell her to get a life of her own? or am i being immature...

Under these conditions:   1) wife has much lower libido, and not much interested in sex,   2) porn watching is done discreetly,   3) husband gets relief for his higher libido, and no one else is involved.

20090306163724AAy84JA	Family & Relationships;Family	Looking for any help/advice.. please?	So heres the situation.. A lot of it started over this summer, in july, my grandma passed away. She was like the glue of our family, held us all together, she was my mother figure, she raised me.       Well she had been sick for a very long time, so everyone saw it coming. At the time it happened, it seemed like we would all get through this together as a family, but things didn't work out like that. At first we tried to keep things going as a family, but things so stupid as money got in the way.       My grandpa, the greatest man i know, recently started seeing someone else and getting serious right away in October. She is a great woman though, very cultural, very nice, and most importantly she gave my grandpa life again. I seen him after my grandma passed away, he was so lifeless, so sick, like he was heading right there with her. Now he looks and feels alive again.      My mom, and her 2 brothers, my uncles, have so much anger though, they're still grieving i understand that so am i. They say so many mean things to him and his now fiancee, how could they be so mean? After everything my grandpa has done for them, my 2 uncles mainly, they are potheads, they can't keep a job, always lived off of my grandpa. He was always there for them even though they treat him horribly now, if they needed 20$ here, he gave it to them. Most of all when they went to the hospital which is 2 hours away from our home, he payed for their gas/food/hotels. My grandma was the same way with them, they always took care of them even as adults. Now they say mean things about him, act like they can't trust him. My mom isn't "as" bad, but she is still just as mean, she is more independent when it comes to money, but when it came to babysitting my grandma and grandpa always watched my 2 little sisters, and me when i was younger, just so she can go out and get drunk, they were all raised better than that. Now all they do is say stupid things like calling her a gold digger, saying she is living off of grandma's money, and she can't stand anything that was grandma's and hate all the grandkids. All of that is so untrue, if she couldn't stand grandkids why did she welcome me to live with her and grandpa and be a part of their life. She talks so openly about my grandma with me and my grandpa. She respects her so much.      I have lived with my grandpa and grandma much of my life, and currently live with my grandpa once again, and his fiancee, and now i hear things that make me sad about it. When i lived with my mother, things were horrible, all we did was argue, i was so depressed i didn't even go to school. Now that im living with my grandpa and his fiancee, who i am close to calling grandma, i am back in school, also feel alive again, i get all A's and B's in school and have a future for the first time i feel so good. Yet, my mom tells me i'm back to "living off of my grandpa." Why would she say that i am only 15 years old. She says i am being brainwashed and getting an attitude, only because i am finally speaking my mind and telling her what i don't like about her. I love my mom dearly, but she hurts me so much. Even as a kid, she never showed affection for me, and we never talked much.      Why are they being so mean to my grandpa? why do they hate him so much right now and don't want to get over their stupid anger towards him. My grandpa has been through enough why the **** do they think he deserves not only his own pain, but theirs too. He will never forget grandma and tells me that often, he tells me that him and my grandma talked about this long before she was even sick, when my mom was small even, they talked about if anything ever happened to either of them, just to move on, and live life. He loved my grandma, he loved her for almost 40 years (and they were both only in their mid 50's when she died.) So why do my mom and uncles not want him to be happy?       I hate this so much i want everything to be ok it makes me so sad when i think about it. I know i'm going to do well in school and in life, i promised my grandma that right before she passed away and i live by that promise. It murdered me inside to see her take her last breath, and now my mom and uncles think i didn't care as much as i should have. Just because i moved forward in life just like she wanted me to means i didn't care? what is going on in their minds please help me.       I apologize for the long long question, and thank you all so much who read it all. I deeply appreciate any answers and advice, thank you

20090227083312AA3xiek	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	TEN POINTS!!! MY EX TEXTED ME YESTERDAY...?	its gonna be a week on monday, since we've broken up...we were together for 3months. and it was a long distance relationship, since we both live in different cities. he's 24, im 20.   the reason i broke up wit him was becuz in the beginning, he would call/text me every single day. it showed me that he cared, and was serious about me. however later on in the relationship, that kinda stopped. we weren't talking as much, actually barely talking, rarely texting...i mean, we would go days witout much contact....i mean, if im ur girlfriend, and that a long distance gf, i think i have the right to know wats going on in ur life, how ur day was, how work was, etc...and the only way i can know, is if we were in contact, in some form. his bday was last saturday, and i sent him a text saying Happy Bday, love u, etc...i wouldve called but we kinda had a argument, the day before, so i thought it would be best to just send a text. anyways, so i sent him the text, and he doesn't even reply at all, thru out the day, so i have no idea what he did, how he celebrate, etc. i thought that was pretty effed up.       anyways, so yesterday, he texts me (i hadn't texted or called him after we broke up), saying "im sorry to bother u, but i just wanted to say i missed u"       and we kinda texted back and forth after that, it was only like 4 texts, thats about it. i sent him, "hey mike, wats up"   and he told me "nothin much, just getting ready for the *big day...u?"...      *he's getting out the military on march 19th      so yeah, thats about all the texts we sent back n forth.       wat does this mean?   idk why he would even try to contact me now, when everything is over practically.
20090227081512AAED7WC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why so pissed off at me?	My long term exgirlfriend and I split up one year ago, when she dumped me (I was overseas on work for a few months) via the phone and married some other guy, some ex of hers 5 months later. It hurt so bad, and still does. I still dont know what happened, she later told me she thougth i had no intentions of marrying her (we were together 3 years) and she got desperate. I tried to get her back when she split with me, but she never changed her mind.      I was cleaning out my closet and found so many things of hers that she left with me, stuff like cosmetics, books,etc Instead of just throwing them in the trash, I was still so upset and sad, I decided to mail them to her parents house (I dont know her address). I didnt mail flowers, just her old possessions.      The next day, she called my 2 best friends on the phone (she didnt call me) and they told me she was so pissed off at me, that I should have just trashed them, etc. Then her sister called me as well, yelling me, etc. I was the one who was DUMPED in a terrible way when she married someone else, I NEVER called her since she was married (but she called me several times) and never mailed her anything before. I was too upset to even talk to her (but she called me and emailed various times since she got married) Why was she so angry? She is married to some other guy, why even care what I did? One year after her marriage, why? I still feel terrible over this, it is too hard to describe. I do love her, and wish I didnt but I do.

20090306160334AAYHPAI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When a Woman Truly Loves Men (Mystery Spot)?	I found this on craigslist on rant and rave       questions is do agree or not and why      To love men is to delight in their company, whether    you have a romantic relationship with them or not.       Do you genuinely delight in men, or does the thought    of men only bring to mind your romantic woes?       A woman who truly loves men is a special kind of woman.    You can spot her by the way she dresses sometimes, or by    the way she interacts with men. She enjoys the company    of men - even in casual conversation. She never forgets    that a man is a man.       Unfortunately, this kind of woman is often instinctively    disliked by the women who don't love men in the same way.    They consider her a threat because she doesn't play by    their rules. She doesn't agree to underplay her feminine    charm as they all seem to want to! And they definitely    don't like that.       It seems like many women decide at an early age to stop    looking like women - it was just too much trouble anyway,    they seem to say. They were looking forward to getting    married so they could retire from all that hassle.       I think that's a shame. A woman can be beautiful and    appealing and feminine at any age.       Some women maintain - "that feminine stuff - that's just    not me." Well, we all have to be true to ourselves. But    some women have short-changed themselves and their men    by avoiding showing that they are womanly. Somewhere along    the line they were discouraged from being appealing and    the idea stuck with them.       There's an often repeated idea that most women tend to    dress for other women than for men.       Does what you wear play up the fact that you're a woman,    or is it something that a man could wear just as easily    as a woman? The answer to that will tell you a lot about    where you stand with regard to truly loving men - and    reveling in your womanhood. (And this does not require    wearing a super-short skirt or showing half a foot of    cleavage.)       Some women constantly gripe about their lack of success    with men, and put down men and women both. They are    looking for someone to blame instead of looking for    solutions.       It's very possible to love men even if you have had some    very bad experiences with men in the past. You can decide    to blame all men for the bad experiences you've had with    some. You can decide to make the good guys pay for the    mistakes of the bad guys in your past. But all that does    is make more sadness and more distance from the love you    truly desire.       Women who love men like being near men, talking with    men, hearing them laugh, hearing their views, and being    in male company.       Many of us were raised with the idea that we should    minimize the differences between the sexes rather than    celebrate it. Women who truly love men will always    recognize and celebrate the difference when they talk to    and spend time with a man. Men and women are both all    the happier as a result.            http://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/rnr...

20090227083139AA43JCu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was he abusive verbally?	We have taken a break from our relationship, however I need some advice. We had gotten back together for the 3rd time. This time I thought it might be different and it was in the beginning. However there were times when he was angry with someone or something else and I would ask if he was okay, only to get the reply"do you think I am okay". There were times when something wouldn't work in the house and he actually threw it out of the front door breaking it! Even his dog would run behind me when he go on these tantrums. Then it was our vacation, I wanted him to go with me to see an ancient ruin, however he did not go and stayed back at the resort leaving me go with two of his friends feeling like the odd man or should I say woman out. On the way home he mentioned that he saw his ex in another woman and I asked, " when are you going to stop talking about her?" only for him to get quite. On the plane we weren't sitting together because of late booking of which I understood, however before the plane took off - he got up, got his things and said to me "Baby I am out of here" and proceeded to the front of the plane. He later came back and told me he did this to let a family sit together - I said so that family that you don't know is more important for them to sit together than for you to be as close as possible to me? When we got home my car wouldn't start and he started to blame it on me. We got back on track when we got home, however angry spurts continued. Was I just his punching bag!

20090227082952AAcpmQb	Family & Relationships;Friends	My ex-girlfriend and supposed old "friend" is being terrible to me! What's going on?	She broke up with me in early December. Then she started being very emotional and suicidal (about other things, not me) a couple weeks later and she called me and we were back to how super tight we were before we went out. She told me she'd always love me no matter what, just not like that.      Well now it's two months later and she's treating me like a piece of crap. Ignoring me, making fun of me, insulting me.... What's going on with this crazy girl?

20090227081943AAusKEE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has anyone ever been dumped because the other person wanted to get closer to God? What should you do?	I was recently left from a one and a half year relationship on valentines day, four days after having a wonderful valentines day i was left because she felt it was a spiritual calling and that she needed to get closer to god. We have had premarital relations of adult nature, and we felt we where even ready for children. I am so confused how she can say forever, and wear a promise ring and continuee to do so, but say she wants me to wait for and her as she finds god. I was a catholic and began to question religion so this hit hard for a lot of reasons besides her just leaving. My beautiful  love also was catholic but was put in private school. From this school she has meet a a bible leader who in my eyes is a radical christian. She believes Obama is the antichrist and that abortion is bad, and those who get it done or do the deed should be killed as well. Very opinionated with no forgivness or liberal thought. I am afraid that with the space being given to my sadly recent ex, she will drift further and further from me because of this woman. What should i do? how should i go about talking to my love of my life again? what do i ask? how do i get her back... im torn up inside, and it has been a week since shes left me, and everyday seems harder then before. Again we had our fights but eventually got over them. I understand there might be deeper feelings for the fights, but when she put the obstacle that she needs to get closer to god, and she has a strong leader (the radical) im so confused on what next? PLEASE HELP!!! only real answers dont be a jerk and give stupid advice. I am in need and want serious people not jokes.      PS. I used to suffer from depression, i stopped while being with her. I am going back into my depression harder and faster. It sounds stupid but she was the medication i needed. What now?
20090227082537AAJkea2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I got my husband fired for cheating with a manager?	today and now he's MAD AT ME?!  Long story short my BF clued me in that he was going into HER boss's office (a woman) during his lunches a few days a week.  So yesterday I decided to catch him.  I went into his company at lunch time and hung out with my BF in her cubicle.  She has a great view of her boss's office and noone can see her.  Anyway, I waited for him and sure enough he walked right into her office.  I waited a good 10 minutes to give him enough time to hang himself and then I got my BF to knock on the door and announce herself.  I heard some shuffling and a "one minute."  Well I didn't give him one second I burst through the door and there they were half dressed.  My moron husband forgot to lock the door!!  I turned around and to a floor full of people I said "So this is the kind of work your managers do for the company?  Soliciting married men for sex!!"  And I stormed out.  I got a call from him a few hours later that he'd been fired and he'd never forgive me.  And I care why?  He cheated?!!  I forgave him the first time a few years ago but not this time.  I know I did the right thing leaving him but do you think I was immature for my outburst at his work?      Oh and they fired the manager too!! Stupid whore!
20090227081955AAlU95k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sex with husband, not what it used to be....?	So we have been married for 4 years and have, well, had a great sex life. Lately though we havent had sex as often as we used to. Went from about 4 times a week to maybe once a week. And now, its like he is a one minute man. We used to  have great sex sessions at least 30 min. Now I'm lucky if its 2.       So my question is, how does he build his tolerance back up, and why is this happening?      We are both 31

20090227082232AAF9azU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend not being very supportive...?	My boyfriend and I have been trying for a baby for some time now and just recently we found out I'm pregnant which we are thrilled about and we are due in November.      My very dearest and closest friend is also pregnant and due in April.   She was the first person (obviously apart from my boyfriend) that told I was pregnant and her first reaction was "well maybe you're not really pregnant and its false pregnancy" WTF!    She is constantly texting me with all her worries and concerns and like a good friend I listen and and offer my support.      She knew I was finding it hard when I found out she was pregnant as I had been trying so long and she was the last of my friends who wasn't either pregnant or a mum...I am thrilled for her.      Since I told her I'm pregnant she was hardly spoken to me and hasn't once congratulated me....what is her probelm? have I stole her limelight or something? I haven't even made my pregnancy public yet...

It was silent for awhile, and I told him, "What is it??" And then he told me he was going to have a surgery to get a cyst out. I asked him why he made a big deal out of it, and all he said was, "I didn't want you to be worried." WTH?? Why did he do that?? Why did he freak me out like that??

20090227081353AADSpL7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he shy and interested?	okay theres this guy at school. i dont really have any evidence that he likes me, but he just gives off the vibe, you know? pheremones i guess. :P   anyways, hes really very shy, he always seems uncomfortable...and if he catches my eyes, he looks away real quick...or sometimes in the halls hell pretend not to notice me, but i know he has noticed me.   oh and he tries to be very nice. like, during PE, i was stuck playing with a bunch of guys, he was one of them...and i wasnt exactly good compared to them. XD but he kept encouraging me, and being nice and smiling at me and he high fived me on the bus back to our school. other than that, he hasnt really talked to me tho. but like, if i ask a general question, usually people ignore it, but he does pay attention.   of course he could very well just be sweet. but could he like me? hes really shy.
20090227082519AAiMLiS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does he play with my heart ? what is the future of such a relationship?	He 38,   - masturbates from porns films and did not satisfy me sexually    - Never came to visit me because he said my apartment is not nice enough   - Did not stay long on the phone with me. (by doing it against his other friends (women or men).    - Felt stifled if I had to spend a week at home.    - Did not believe in me. accusing me of not taking control of me because I have a lot of debts. and doubting my knowledge as my skills and my professional future.    - I was too plaintive. he has forbidden to talk about my money problems. He helped me write a job application. I have much appreciated, he occasionally helped financially to his level.    - he tells me I'm everything he get most dear in the world. because he claims that he has no family. Then he threatened to leave me, if i run out of consideration for his ex or her son.    - he told me that our relationship was moving too fast and too far for him. I have already spoken about marriage and child after 5 months. and live with him already.    Considering the situation, i (27) took steps. I helped myself and got help. I grew in my way of seeing things.    - I did not put more pressure about the future of our relationship. I stopped talking about having a child or get married. no more think about it.    - I do not reproach him when he will spend all day on Sunday with his ex.    - I keep my problems, especially the financial one for myself. (I have finally found two other jobs to settle my debts).    - I visit him twice a month at most. I handed him his keys.    - I'm as short as possible with him on the phone    - I've cheated once to fill the gap. I don t have the intention to tell him or start over. and I am fighting to stay without thinking sex. Because with him it's always me that takes the intitiative, except when he is drunk.    Then now that I am tired of speaking, being patient and hoping, thinking it is better that I focus on other objectives more promising, now he start trying to be attentive and sweet to me.   - Ready to give up his leisure or to his beloved solitude to spend the weekend with me in my miserable apartment. ready to apply for two days off to spend time with me.    - Ready to take a long time whith me on the phone and even asking me if I have any problem.    I find it strange that he can be nice. I kill myself to conquer him, then it is only when i turn my back, that I get a positive sign from him. why love should not be natural and spontaneous? If this is love I am disgusted

20090304170612AAR8YK1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does He Like Me After All?	Ok, so I have this friend of mine. He's a senior and I'm a sophomore in high school. I've been friends with him since last year. He's really nice to me, and he goes out of his way to say hi to me in the hall and things like that. We are constantly on the IM talking. Problem is, he's dated one of my best friends. She obviously thinks he's a creep now, and she tells me I'm making the mistake of leading him on. I've asked him how he feels about me, and he says he doesn't like me that way. His actions don't seem to match up to what he told me. He and I ride the same bus, and he touches me on the knee and tickles me and stuff. He's given me a pet name, and my friends inquired about my new "boy friend" when we were first seen hanging out together. It seems like he's out for more than just your standard girl-guy friendship. And I don't mean sex by that, either!!! Maybe I'm just reading too much into this, but I'd love to have some input      Serious advice/input ONLY!!!!      Thanks!!! :D

I've looked everywhere and no where and I mean no where near me is hiring. I do however volunteer for a hospital and my hopes are to get in there and hopefully get in there soon because it's a good paying job. However, they recently froze the jobs for two months so this means at least another two months before getting in there. I'm not broke or poor so it's not like I wouldn't have money for a girl and I'm not being lazy either. Do you think this will effect me when looking for a girl? This is one of my reasons I'm afraid to take chances because she might think I'm being lazy which isn't the case.

She is gone all day with her friends, she smokes and drinks, and she doesnt really take care of Sadie.    She recently was kicked out of her apartment and has been looking for a place but she basically forced my brother to let her stay in his room. My parents couldnt say no - she was homeless and she is the mother of their grand child. (Sadie stays with us full-time).   My brother has been meaning to leave Andrea but doesnt want Sadie to be left without a mother! He's a great guy and only wants the best for his daughter.   How can we get Andrea out of our house! Should she be kicked out of Sadie's life all together? Help please!

Here is what we are looking for...some place outside of the US, someplace warm, some place where we can work. English doesn't have to be the primary language but we want to be able to communicate without a lot of trouble. We are looking to party and meet girls so that would be a plus. It would also be nice if it was a place that we could travel from. thanks
20090227081411AA3vgHn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I REALLY trust this guy and give him second chance?	I met this guy on facebook about two months ago but he's in the other side of the world from the same place where I came from.He told me that he loves me a week after we chat and of course i'm not too stupid to fall for that too fast.Until I portrayed to be another girl online to test him and he said that it's better for us to be just friends because he's in love with another girl(and that's me that he's referring) but I found out that he lied to me about his work and school matters. He asked for my forgiveness and told me that he did that lying because he wants to impress me because he loves me so much. I felt that he was sincere because he would sacrifice his health and sleep very very late at night although he has school and work in the morning just to talk to me everyday and assure that i'm fine. He even told me about girls in his school who likes him and ask for my advice on how to avoid them. He told me to just trust him because He really love me so much.
20090227081430AA4uvco	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I ended our casual relationship....?	I had a friend with benefits for almost a year and I finally ended the casual relationship about a week ago. I had to call it quits because he disrespected me a few times and my feelings were getting involved...Which caused a lot of jealousy everytime I saw him with another chick. When he notice how serious i was.... he wanted to talk to me. I told him everything. He knew i was falling for him deeply.He said sorry for everything. i do forgive him but i can't go back to where i was before. I miss him dearly....he called me the other night and i didn't pick up. I knew what he wanted but i just cant do that. I met another guy  and there is a possibility he would treat me way better than my old friend. He is more sincere and a great listener. However, I still think about my other friend, I love him but not in love...   what should i do????

20090227082334AAq4eAq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you do with a crazy ex-wife?	My husband's ex wife will not leave us alone.  They have 2 kids together who are both 29+ years old, married and have families and kids of their own.  Nevertheless, the ex wife is persistant that since they have these adult children together she has every right to contact my husband as often as she wants to and plans on continuing to do so.  In addition to using the adult children as excuses to call him, she also calls him for whatever random stuff she can think of (i.e. her pool cleaner broke, she found some old friend from school, wants to know what gift we got someone etc...)  3 weeks before her adult daughters birthday she psycho dialed his phone every 10 minutes for 5 hours straight to find out if he would be attending eventhough she was unsure what they were going to have yet.  She has made progress since the days she was steeling our trash but nevertheless this ongoing harrassment is getting very old.  My husband has told her many times to leave him alone and not to contact him.  He ignores her phone calls and avoids her as much as possible yet she continues anyway.  She even showed up at his work about a month ago to confront him about some stuff.  He has told her to stop calling, I have told her to stop calling and all of our family members have told her to stop calling but she says that all her friends have adult children and tell her that they talk to their ex's all the time and that she can too.        In addition to the phone harrassment the woman is obsessed with our lives, constantly digging for information from others, going to a family websit that I have daily (I have since added a password), constantly asking questions about jobs my husband and his son do (beyond just making small talk), she does crazy stuff like speeding by my car when I was dropping off one of the grandkids at MDO and then driving up and down a side street afterwards while calling family members and telling them she's not a stalker.  This type of stuff has been continuous for almost 3 years now.        She tells everyone that she is not causing problems, she has moved on, she doesn't like him, he's ugly and old, it is me who is wrong and acting imature and that she just wants to "heal" etc...  I swear you either cry or just cry laughing when you hear this stuff.  She's too busy beleiving this crap to see that everyone around her knows she's full of it.  They have just all quit saying anything to her because over the years it has never registered.      Is there any hope for my husband and I who want to be left alone?  Self medicating myself is an option I guess.  Moving out of the country would be awesome!  I could record it all and start a reality TV show.  Any suggestions?

20090227083350AAg4nGe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need some marriage advice please!!!!?	Over a month ago I found out that my husband has been talking/texting several different girls for a while.  He also at this point was going to the bar every Friday night for at least 6 months or more.  We are not on the same phone plan so it was really hard for me to get his phone records.  When I found out I was crushed and hurt, I confronted him about it and at first he started to lie and then he got all mad. He said they were just friends and most of them were texting him for his single friends, I asked him how many girls he gave his number to and he said he doesn't remember.  He swore he would stop and wouldn't ever do it again, but guess what he has!  I confronted him again and he said this girl text him and was asking why so and so didn't return her calls. WHATEVER RIGHT?  Well, we got into this really big fight and he said he didn't seen anything wrong with talking/texting other girls because they are his friends and he was not going to live in a box.  WHAT?  I am so hurt by this.  I love him so much we have been together for 12 years and married for 10, thankfully we have no kids together but we both have one child from a previous relationship.  My question is what do I do?  How do I find out the truth?  I have called the numbers but they also go straight to voice mail..I am going crazy.....PLEASE HELP ME!
20090227083432AAFvdKU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question for mature ladies.Regarding being in a serious relationship.?	Ladies,if you and your man were going through things.Things like the two of you weren't seeing eye to eye on things, and he tells you that not only did he get attached to someone else,but you let her take him away from you. Would you personally believe that you had some part in that,or realize that a man can't be stolen,he must have gone along with it?What's your personal opinion?
20090227084416AAvP5UA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm a married woman with a family who has a crush on my professor?	I know how horrible this sounds already.  Lets get one things straight though...I have never in my life cheated on anyone that I have been in a relationship with.  I'm 25, been married to a wonderful man who I do love with all my heart for 4 years...we've been together 5., and our daughter is almost 2.  All I do is go to school full time and take care of my daughter and house for now.  I never go out anymore.  We never do things anymore just me and him.  We both use to be big in the local music scene and hit up all the shows around town, and party...all that stuff.  Of course all that changed after my daughter was born, and I'm okay with that.  I guess my problem is sometimes I feel like I'm not entitled to do anything else other than what I already do daily, while he is still able to do things occasionally,  All this I guess brings me to my real question.........I have found myself having a crush on one of my professors this semester.  This has never happened before, and the more I think about it the worst it gets.  This is an innocent crush...he's said nothing or done nothing to provoke it.  I just find him to be attractive.  I think part of it is he is a younger professor.  He can't be that much older than I am.  I feel like this may stem off my "intimate" life at home.  My husband and I are rarely intimate.  He works nights and when he comes home I am sleeping and then I have to be up b/w 6 and 7 for our daughter.  He works all the time.  I guess we don't know how to make time for each other really, and then when we are intimate I find myself getting bored b/c at one point in my life I was into trying new things so to speak, and he is just so ordinary.  When I ask him about spicing things up some he doesn't want change.  I don't want to be mean and be like "I'm bored."  So I just don't know what to do.  I have found myself thinking about my professor in an unprofessional way if you know what I mean.  All though I love my husband I feel like something is lacking.  Even though I believe in my heart that if I was put into a situation where I had the chance to be intimate with my professor that I would not do it.  I love my family and don't want to jeopardize it.  I just don't know if these feelings are normal.  I keep fighting them off and they get worse.  Has anyone ever felt like this before?

The two boys nearly knocked over the car seat much to the horror of my fiancee. In the car if our daughter cried the six year old would try and hold her nose. My sister isn't the cleanest of people either. She stayed over for a month whilst my fiancee was pregnant and she left her clothes everywhere, takeaway boxes everywhere and the guest room was a disgusting mess.

I'm feeling depressed and neglected and have no one to talk to about it. I need her to change and I have no idea how to show her how wrong she has been acting. How can I make her see how she acts?

20090306173007AAFyd4W	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents and I are in a fight, but seriously who's side would you be on?	Okay so, the story goes:      I see a psychiatrist once every other week, I have some problems yada yada. Anyways I was just talking to her about how my week was going and told her I started seeing a nutrionist (bulimia)... and she asked me how that was going. And I said it was fine, I just feel like I've really messed up and its costing me like $300. And then she said she didn't realize I had to pay for it (she was the one who referred the nutrionist to my parents) and that she wanted to talk to my stepdad. I asked her about what? And she said just about me paying for the nutrionist and stuff... I said alright.      Anyways, next day (today) my parents are pissed at me for "complaining" to the psychiatrist that I have to pay for my nutrionist. Theyre mad because theyre having to pay like $1000 a month for all my medical bills and they think I'm being a spoiled brat for getting upset that I have to pay for my nutrionist. My mom's exact words: "Oh poor Shay, you have to pay $290 when we're having to pay the rest. I'm gonna just cancel your psychiatrist if your gonna keep complaining about us to her."      Should my parents be pissed at me? I WANT TO RUN AWAY I HATEEE THIS AND HOW THEY ARE.

20090306182310AAjmuMn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend is mad at me because....?	I recently got engaged in Oct. and have been planning my wedding ever since with my fiance. My best friend who I have known for 8yrs is pissed at me because I never hang out with her anymore (she blames it on the engagement) I have tried explaining to her that I am trying to get everything for the wedding out of the way, right away, so I no longer have to deal with planning. On top of that I am unemployed and looking for a full time job, and my fiance and I have put a bid on a house which were waiting to hear from. A few weeks ago she responded back with, I don't care if you are unemployed, have a house, and are planning a wedding. Then she mentioned that she has abnormal cells in her cervix and went for testing. I asked my mom about it, anoud she said she should be fine. When I called my friend to find out her second test results, she was pissed I did not call her the first time when she first went in for testing (honestly, I forgot). Finally after weeks of calling her to try and hang out numerous times, I am finally doing something with her tonight. What should I tell her if she starts another rampage. Please note she is also supposed to be standing up in my wedding, but if she continues to aggrivate me, I may tell her she is no longer invited.       What would you do in this situation?

I had tons of friends, could have had a wicked hot girlfriend, and I always had fun there. Recently I moved 3000 miles away to the Caribbean. That completely ******* killed me inside. Everything inside me fell out my *** and I sank into some form of depression. I still talk to them, but it's so different not being able to hang out with them everyday... Every night for the past two moonths I've had dreams about being back home. Not necessarily the same dream, but things we would have done/did do. Whenever I smile, my back shivers, my jaw clenches, and my smile fades as more thoughts of being home rush into my mind. I don't know what to do. I CAN'T live here. It wasn't meant to be, it won't work. I don't know how much longer I can stay sane... please help...
20090306171631AAdMJBO	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is wayyy to into herself..?	My friend is super obsessed with herself. She brags 24/7 about how much she works out and isn't ever going to get fat (even though she is a little pudgy). Then she brags about how much money her parents have, and the worst, she sends me millions of text messages saying that hot guys are looking at her and checking her out. Really, not to be mean, but she isn't the prettiest girl on the block. And sometimes, she gets so into herself that she sends me pictures of her "abs" it's weird as hell. why would she do this? is she insecure or overly confident? it's bothering me so bad. I want to tell her to stop, but I know she'll get mad.

20090306171329AAurTyf	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I get these girls to leave me alone for good?	Before I used to think they would turn out to be really good friends because they were nice to me and everything and then they both just turned into little witches and doing and saying mean things about me.       They have been calling my house all night leaving voice messages on blocked and private callls pretending to be doctors telling my parents that my pregnancy results were in and that I can come in to the clinic and my parents belived them because they sounded like real doctors to them and got mad at me for that even tho It was not even true.    Today while I was sitting down at lunch by a tree drinking a smoothie they came up to me and said that I look like a loner sitting there like that and that even nerds looked better than me right now. And then I said "why would you call my house and say things like that that were not even true" and then they told me I need to shut up and quit being a baby about It and then I asked then I asked them If they would just stop doing that because they made my parents really angry and their even going to take me to the doctor to get test.    And then they said they never liked me they just pretended to be my friend because i was a weird girl. and I told them that that Is fine if that is how they feel then thats fine and if they could just leave me alone for once. And they just laughed and then about ten minutes later when I thought they were gone and would finally leave me alone they both came up with this tall guy and he just kicked my smoothie down and spit In my face and told me If I mess with them he will get these girls on me monday then they left and I just got up and went to sit in my next class and study until lunch was over..   I was confused I had not even done one thing to them at all and yet they continue to bother me! I really do not like drama and I want this to end now? but I dont know how.

20090306165003AA5X2jO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Boy girl "party" - 13 year olds?	my friend is having a "party" (more of hanging out) thing tomorrow and I'm kind of a co-host. its kinda last minute, but i think 10-15 people will be there. its not like a "put out snacks and dance" kind of thing. we are all gonna play capture the flag and then watch a scary movie. however many people are going to be late and not get get there until about 6, whereas it ends at 8 or 9. any ideas how we could schedule this, like what to do from 4 - 6 until more people get there (there will be maybe 5 people [probably more] there from 4-6) and then after everyone else gets there at 6, about 10 more people will arrive or more?

(his stepfather owns the house), he will let the truck get reposessed and pretty much leave me homeless.

20090306165651AApCstT	Family & Relationships;Family	I told my Dad that he was awkward and now I have received a bad punishment, what should I do?	I was texting a girl and he began questioning me about her. Because of previous experiences I know that he would just use the information to make jokes about it later; so I told him that he was awkward to talk to about it. He then began texting HIS girlfriend, who shares his same point of view on almost everything, and proceeded to ask me why I thought he was awkward. I didn't really reply to him and then he started rambling off punishments:   1. He takes my phone when I get home from school   2. I must tell him where I am at all times   3. If I'm not home by 6:30 he will call the police on me (not sure on what grounds...)   4. Internet is his, electricity is his, and water is his so I must ask him to use any one of those   5. My bedroom door is always left open.   6. Less significantly-no video games      What should I do????

I have a friend who I am always telling things that I learn and asking if she knows it already and she always does. I don't know how, but she does. I learned something on TV about what they use to naturally color red velvet cake, which I had never known before and I'm sure a lot of people don't, but she oddly enough did! I am looking for something that will really, really, REALLY stump her! At least today when I asked her if she had a real genuine cinnabon she said no, so now I have something to do with her when she comes here haha.      If you could help me out by providing me with a couple to a few really hard questions (with the answers please!) I would really appreciate it so I can finally stump my friend!!! :D Thanks in advance!
20090306171503AAIWDqc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I even bother with him anymore?	My guy friend was really nice and sweet to me and he acted like he truly cared about me.   Well he’s been treating me like crap. He want talk to me and he acts like he doesn’t care. I always have to talk to him first. I confronted him about it last weekend, but it was through text cause neither one of us have time to talk a lot in person cause we don’t have any classes together.       He’s the main part of the conversation:   Me: Whats happened between us?   Him: What do you mean   Me: oh don’t play dumb. You know what im talking about we hardly talk anymore, things are different now and I don’t like it at all   Him: well don’t look at me   Me: your part of this situation and its like you don’t give a crap about me but you probably never did to begin with   Him: don’t even say that   Me: well that’s how it seems and how it feels   Him: sorry   Me: whatever you don’t care   Him: yeah I do but its not like you talk to me and when you do you always get mad at me so idk what im suppose to do. Keep talking and keep making you mad   Me: its just like I always have to talk to you first. Its like you don’t care if I talk to you or not. And like you don’t care cause you act like you don’t if you actually acted like you cared for once I wouldn’t get mad but you don’t so I get mad.   Him: Sorry   Me: when are you not sorry? All I hear us sorry sorry sorry. Act sorry for once.      He didn’t text me back.      Part of me doesn’t want to loose him but another part of me is tired of all this crap.   At school when I see him he stares at me like he’s sorry but he want talk to me. It’s been a week since that conversation and I don’t know what to do..
20090306172036AAQcY0d	Family & Relationships;Friends	So there's this guy that i like but?? please read!?	So i like this guy, who is in my english class, and i sit in front of him. i think i have had a crush on him since the first day of school( i'm new in this school, and also a freshmen). so anyways i don't think it was until 2 days ago i realized that i really like him. I don't know what happened, but l ately i can't stop thinking about how pretty his eyes ,are and how he has such a nice personality. anyways so i told my friend that i liked him, and she is also best firends with my crush. she got really excited about it. I was just like I don't think I am going his ever going to like me, and that you better not tell him, because i don;t want things to be weird between us. and she was like, he won't be freaked out and of course he willl like you are pretty, smart..... etc So like today i saw him in the hallway he was coming form french, and i was coming form gym, we had like eye contact for likr 5 seconds, and then i looked away. later after lunch my friend was like " alex was asking about you", and i was like why? she said he was asking if i had talked to you lately, and i said no, because i didn't want him to know. so then again at the end of the day i was walking out, and just when i was about to open the door, he did, i got really nervous, and just sorry. he said, it;s okay, but i was like perfect timing, maybe i'm just being to dramatic. and also one day while i was passing the paper back in english, he randomly goes " your a good person", i just like ummm thanks, u too. so i am really happy that I talk to him, and stuff because i have never gotten to talk to my previous crushes, and we are kinda like friends, but i just really want to have a good realtionship, even if it;s just being friends. like i want to be closer with him. SO the question is how do I figure out What he thinks about me, or if he likes me? Without being to obvious. PLease help me

How do I get him to do things? He leaves everything all over. I am constantly cleaning and doing housework. I just can;t take it anymore. Right up to him opening up a yogurt container and leaves the paper top on the counter! He comes in from work and has his dinner on the table waiting for him. He doesn't even have to add the condiments its right how he likes it! Please help! How to I get him to step up and do somethings. He is in school as am I and we both work too. I am understanding of that but still he does nothing.
20090306173601AAxAqHF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Confused 26 year old married woman of 2 years?	I need help. My issue is my husband feels like we don't have sex enough. I know sex comes along with marriage but he wants it ALL the time and I don't. He whines and complains ALL the time because he says I never give him none. I don't want to have sex every second of the day. I appreciate all the affection, but I don't even look at it as affection anymore because he it always leads to him asking for sex. I walk past he grabs my *** everytime or squeezes my breast, or grabs my vagina. I like the fact that he is attracted to me, but every free second I have he thinks is supposed to be having sex. I don't feel that way. Not saying tat I don't like it, but my mind is on several other things that need to be worked out in our marriage. Our main problem is finances. He has not worked for 1 year and has made no attempt to look for a job. I complain all the time about how hard it is with just me working carrying all the weight by myself, but all he does is cry and say sorry I put you through all this and don't worry, we wont have to go through this much longer, but damn its been a whole year, So me trying to be the good wife, I try to help out and pick up the applications for him. He does not fill them out right away, they will sit weeks until I finally say something, then he has an excuse as to why he didn't do it. So knowing we are financially in the hole, I fill out the applications for him and return them to the companies for him. I do everything except go to the interviews for him. We are so behind in EVERYTHING!! He gets upset wit h me because he said I don't let him make any decisions, but that is the whole reason we are in the hole now, because of him and his stupid decisions. So by me being the only one working paying all the bills, who else will make them. We have gotten evicted, car repossesed, law suits, etc. but I'm the only one doing all the doing. I am always willing to pick up a second job because I have gotten so frustrated because he wont pick up his slack, but he gets mad and says that a woman should'nt work 2 jobs, but damn, what else am I supposed to do. We live paycheck to paycheck and our bills exceed my check each week, we are currently living at my friends house to get caught up on bills, but its still rough because its only one income so we still broke. He eats like food is going out of style, has a smoking addiction, everytime we go somewhere and I want to buy myself something to treat myself he runs this guilt trip as to how unfair I am because I didn't buy him nothing, and we also have a 9 year old son (his biological son - my step-son, I have no kids of my own) who has needs and wants as well. Its so much going on. Also he has a problem with me doing anything outside of the house with my family and friends. It's always an argument as to I always want to do something with other people other than him. Thats not the case. Mind you, I have a work at home job, so since he don't work, I look at him 24-7, we don't have a car anymore, so I'm basically just stuck in the house with him all the time. But if one of my girlfriends call and sayy hey lets go some where, I'm cool with that because I'm tired of being under him all the time because he is so controlling. I tell him we spend each day together all day long. I told him I don't mind going places with him, but I don't have the money to take me, him, & our son out, but if one of my girlfriends call to say lets go, they are offering to treat me, I'm not paying for nothing, but if I go with him, I gotta pay with money we don't have. So 99% of the time I just stay in the house to avoid an argument, but  feel horrible. I feel like an old *** lady but i'm only 26. My mind is focused on trying to get out family out of the financial hole, I think non-stop because we are in somebody else's house, we got judgements because of him, we trying to save for another car, he got a big child support debt for his other kids(total of 3 by other women), trying to save to get our own place again, pay off past credit card bills that we had to live on to help out where he was lacking, out of all that on my plate he has the nerve to complain about sex. Sex is the last thiing on my mind. I get so disgusted when he constantly ask. It's always a battle of sex or oral sex. I don't mind, but he doesn't even give me a chance to ever ask for it or want it. So many times i just do it, but I'm really not into it, I just do it to shut him up, but i want to enjoy it as well, but with all the problems we have it's hard to get past that and cover it up with sex. He makes such a big deal out of it to the point I don't even want it anymore. I'm sick of feeling like a prisoner in my own home by a man who wants to be called a king, but don't nothing to live up to it. I try so hard to honor my marriage, but I'm stuck between a rock and hard place now. He feels my whole everything revolves around him and thats it. Please help... I just need a second opinion because it's pointless talki
20090306173727AATspY1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I bother having a relationship with my Dad?	My Dad left when I was 6 years old and I never saw him again until I was 11.  He acts like he is not into being a Dad and seems cold whenever I call him.  My step Mom is cold as well.  I feel like a dog who keeps running up to a mean master to be loved but does not get the proper care.  He calls me about once a year and I have never received a card or call on my birthday, but I send them cards and gifts all year round.  I also have called frequently.  The last time I called my step Mom was so cold and distant that I felt stupid for even trying anymore.  Should I just wash my hands of them?

20090306174559AApmErc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guys are confusing, a little help please?	I added this guy(let's call him steve) on a social networking site, who's my best guy friends brother(Let's call him Jack) Both of them are friends with my one girl friend(Lisa). So, Lisa and I got into a fight this year, and she talked badly to Steve about me. So now he "hates" me, whether there are reasons unknown or that's his biased opinion on me because of her. I added him on a social networking site, two times. The first time he was debating on adding me, but it took too long so I declined. I resent the second and he accepted. So, a few days ago he tells Lisa that he didn't add me on that social networking site and that he hadn't been on in two weeks. So I asked his brother Jack if he was on Steve's account or whatever, and he said no, that he wasn't. It also seems that he tells Lisa bad things about me, or how he doesn't like me, but he tells Jack neutral things about me. I'd love to be friends with Steve, but, I'm not sure if I should talk to him or not. I believe it could go really bad, or really well. It also seems that Steve can be very.. bi-polar, if you will. Help?      Ps. Sorry for all the so's. :\
20090306174836AACL3hx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I deal with his ex-wife?	My boyfriends ex-wife is selfish and a manipulator. She uses the children as messengers and calls him names in front of them. On HIS days she will make arrangements without consulting him ahead of time and then spring it on the children. They get their hopes up and he feels like he can't say no, because then he's the bad guy. She called tonight like she does every night, but this time she made the son cry because of a rumor she heard. We respect her time with the children and try not to interfere, especially with things that can wait, like the rumor tonight. Personally I feel like they're both parents that need to go to mom and dad boot camp, just because you are a parent doesn't mean you're a good one. We're trying to be the bigger person by letting go of the anger but she can't keep treating people I love like this. What advice can you give me that will make her knock it off. In case you're wondering, she left him, for his best friend. So there shouldn't be any jealous feelings on her part, even though I'm pretty sure is.

Ok I am going to be completewly honest and I need some opions because i have nothing left to figure this out:      My ex and I have been dating for 2 1/2 years. We have two beautiful little girls 16months and 6 months, The oldest with a heart transplant due to congential heart defects. I also have a 3yr old son from a previous relationship. I am 21 and he is 25. At first like most, our relationship was a blast and we had gotten along so well and were happy, We were doing very well until we moved in together, He started staying on his computer All night long and most of the time he was awake was spent playing anarchy online games. I started feeling neglected so i started talking a "friend" online, it seemed like the only time my ex wanted attention from me was when he wanted sex, then he went straight to sleep or straight back to his games. He wouldnt come to bed until nearly 7-8 in the morning sleep his day away then wake up and go right back to it. My conversations with my friend started getting to serious and we ended up exchanging personal photos of eacfh other online. Well me and my ex started fighitng because of what i was doing, when i found porn on his computer i was enraged and felt like i had to watch him to cover up what i was doing. I felt horrible about it but i loved him. Well we soon found out when i was 7months pregnant my daughter had a heart defect and then things got even more intense. I got into several fights about stupid things like my son making a mess, or the neighors being loud or just because i was lonley and leaving rude remarks on his computer after finding porn pictures on it. When we had our daughter we spent 3 months a3way from home making things worse, we didnt fight as much during that time but we did have some very heated fights when we did. After she was released and we came home we moved into a trailor , and we started fighitng even worse about how he was always sitting on the computer and not paying attention to his daughter or me. He wouldnt get a job and he absolutly refused to clean if my son mad a mess, instead he yelled at me to do it even if i was busy trying to do something else. Well we moved again and this time we moved into a temp house that turned out to be a total bug fest which made matters 10x worse, we fought to the point id cry for hours. I was already pregnant with my last daughter and we would fight because of how my son would make a mess or color on the floor with chalk, or how centipedes kept finding themselves in the dump. So we moved into his sisters and thats when the fights esculaded. He found out that i had been talking to my friend the entire time about sex and saw the pictures, and how i talked about him and how he wasnt doing what she should have been doing. Thats when i found out he cheated in me a couple months into our relationship, but didnt go all the way and have sex. By then i was furious. I felt like what i had done was not as bad as sitting in front of someone naked in real life. So he started spying on me, even went as far as putting a program to watch my every move on a computer and who i talked to and what about even got my passwords and read all my personal things. I couldnt handle any more so i went to my moms with the kids, the fighting just got worse, at one point we fought so bad in my van he punched the windsheild and left it with a huge crack on the drivers side, and i at one point was so furious that i busted a few dishes. So finally a week ago i got the nerve to break up with him. Since then he has been beggin me to come back and beggin that he has changed. He keeps saying i choose my friends and cell phone over him and my kids but everyone that knows me knows that i adore my kids and i love them to death. It really bothers me that he wouldnt get a job and it took him 2 1/2 yrs to even get motivated to get a job. he has a very nasty temper and when he gets mad i can honestly say ive been scared. I love him but my heart has had enough and i dont know what we should do seeing as we have kids together. And to include, For the past week ive been talking to a guy who seems to be really cool, and i like him a lot and id love to get to know him and see where it could go to........ Can anyone help me orhave ideas or been through we i have been? Please at this point im desperate.

We use to communicate with each other everyday either at school or on the internet. But then I started to like her as more than a friend. But then one week she started ignoring me and when ever i try to start a conversation or a question, she shrugs it off saying "I don't know." I really miss talking to her because I always liked her concept of the world around her and the way she speaks about subjects. What should I do? I just want it to be back to normal and talk to her again.

20090306214526AAOjsb2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it normal to think about an ex from 14 years ago? Does everyone wonder "What if?"?	I just can't stop thinking about an ex fiance from 14 years ago. We dated for about 2 years while he was stationed at a NC base near my hometown. I ended up breaking up with him because I was young and scared.  Six months after that, he showed up at my house and told me he had just been medically discharged from the marines but wanted to know if we could still have a chance before he left for his hometown in Texas. He ended up leaving...then 2 years later he called me a month before I was supposed to get married. When I told him, he begged me to call it off and move to Texas to be with him. He mailed me some pictures and a love letter, but I got married anyway.  It is now 11 years later and my marriage is over and I can't stop thinking about "what if". He was so kind and good to me. I have looked him up, but am terrified to call. I thought about mailing him a card, but I have no idea if he is married or what...I am still attractive and have a great career as a successful nurse practitioner and have a good life. Am I just being crazy?

20090306212007AA7qX2N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm worried about my girl....help?	Okay, I am seventeen. Let me just start off by describing my girlfriend's personality. She's quiet, sweet, and a preppy girl (lol). But she has a great personality, and its one of the things I love about her. Physically, she's quite small. She's about five feet tall and weighs under 95 pounds (I'm not sure of how much exactly.)       So I introduced her to my friends a couple of weeks back, but ever since we've been around them as of late, she's become really clingy and doesn't want me to leave her alone with them. Now, when I'm there, I never notice them picking on her or teasing her, but that's only when I'm there. She's shy, but I've never seen her this shy. From where I see it, it seems like something was said or something was done that she's uncomfortable with. First of all, how can I ask her in a sensitive way? Second, how can I ask my friends without seeming like a jerk? And third, (and this is for personal reasons), does asking this show I care for my girlfriend or is it just natural?
20090306213945AAHVx6r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is SO annoying, ):?	Luke used to like me, for the longest time ever!

20090306203621AATPeFk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My fiance talks to someone else about all of his feelings..?	My FH and I have some communication problems. I am the type of person that likes to say exactly what I am feeling, pretty much all the time, and he keeps everything bottled up. This has caused issues in the past because I would never know anything was wrong, until its been wrong for so long that it is a major issue, not just a slight annoyance.      My FH has a friend, who used to be a mutual friend, but it seems that my FH is talking to HIM about all of our issues, and even if I ask if somethings wrong he says "No, everythings fine" but he tells this friend all of these things, that he never mentions to me.      I really don't know what to do! Communication is key, and I just feel like you should be confiding in your partner, not your friends. Help!

I'm a really good kid, with a good head on my shoulders, I don't talk back and I don't disrespect her.   I just have a feeling she gets angry easily because I annoy her with my presence.

Opinions please.
20090306214058AABqFEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy do this?	OK I am seeing this guy casually.  He used to always be the one to start the convo/send the first IM/ ask me out.  Now he doesn't anymore.  I am not sure if it is because he wants me to make the first move or he is just not into me anymore.  When I send him texts and stuff, he responds, but sometimes it is like a very quick response, like he wants to end the convo, and sometimes it is a more flirty response.  Also sometimes he just doesn't text me back.  so IDK if he is still into me?  any insight?  And I don't want to be constantly calling if he is not into me, but then again if he is waiting for me to be the one to ask him out this time then I don't want to just never contact him.  What should I do?

20090306205313AAoGTA2	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do if a bi*ch is ruining your life?	ok so there's this girl and back in September we were best friends but then just drifted apart when we moved to seperate groups but still remained good friends untill about a week ago. I knew from the start that she was a liar from the start but this week I really took the heat of it. So in art on Monday she asked me a question that was none of her buisness and very personal and I did not want to answer it and she started and moaning and whining and finally threatened to tell the person I like that I like him so I was forced to tell her. On Tuesday she texts me and said you will be happy tommarow. I said y like 1000 times but she wouldn't tell me but she said it was about the guy I like so I thought he was going to ask me out. Then later I found out that she made the whole thing up for absolutly no reason! Then on wedsday we found out she was dating someone but she wouldn't tell us who so I guessed like every single guy in our grade and she kept saying no and I got mad so I jokingly asked her if she's lesbian and she got really really mad and wouldn't talk to me yesterday but then she finally apologized and I forgave her and everything went back to normal but then like an hour ago one of my friends asked me if I like a certain person ( who is the person I like) and I said who told u that? and he said the person who you like told me! omg the only person that knew was the bi*ch so she would have had to have told the guy. Wat would you do in this situation?

20090306212010AAn1n7s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long can one not talk to their significant other before they decide its over?	Me and my bf had a fight about his ex gf IMing him and then he throws it in my face that he doesnt talk to his female friends anymore bec of how I reacted when i saw some facebook and myspace comments. Petty, I know. But I wrote him and said I will give him time to catch up with old friends from back home and that I will not be online. Basically, I wanted to get some space and give him space as well. I didn't talk to him all day today and I really do not feel like talking to him yet..for a while... I'm thinking a week, maybe more..just depends on how I feel. I just don't want to speak to him... I need some space.  Anyways, the question is, how long can one not talk to their bf/gf before they think that maybe they dumped them? Would you think your bf/gf broke up with you if they dont talk to you at all for 5 days??? Thanks a lot.
20090306212653AADP4lS	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do when someone is always telling you secrets?	So I know someone who is a total blabbermouth. I don't ask to be told anything at all. But she just can't stop herself. We have a mutual friend and this friend told her over and over again not to tell me something. So the very next day she couldn't wait to call me and tell me about what she had been told not to tell. I didn't even want to know and it's stuff that I would never do so it makes me angry to even hear about it. What would you do?

Right away you might think I look like a dumb jock because I'm 6'7" and workout a lot, but I'm actually extremely smart and nice.  I used to be shy but I'm not really anymore, once I get to know someone I can talk forever with them.  I don't think I'm that bad looking, but I can't get a girlfriend for anything and I'm starting to think it's because I'm too ugly, what do you think?       http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...

20090306212303AAPrUFg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do all men fall for the wrong woman at least once in their life?	ok i know i'm generalizing with the word "all", but is it really so hard for perfectly intelligent men to choose an upstanding girl to love on the first try?  or do they absolutely have to fail at least once to get it right?        my bf fell for a slut before he started dating me, and yes you guessed it, the slut turned out a cheater.  she was his first gf, and knowing that, she still went and cheated on him.  i feel bad for him, but then i remember that it wasn't some "accident" he suffered through - after all, he CHOSE to love her.  women are born sentimental and allow feelings to cloud their judgment, but i thought men were creatures of reason?  he is not a player who chooses sex over love, he was genuinely in love with her. but why the poor choice?  i know this has nothing to do with intelligence.  so what's with all the foolish and wasted years?

20090306213507AAER4pE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok, so me and my friend who's a girl have been friends for about a year. She's in 9th grade and I'm in 8th. We text a lot everyday and I go over to her house at least once each weekend because she's a pretty busy person. So, we watch a movie almost every time we see each other and I've put my arm around her almost every time but she doesn't do anything about it. Last weekend, she came over to my house and after we watched a movie, we just started fooling around on my bed. We just started play fighting for each others phone. This time, we watched the movie with my arm around her and then got something to drink and went to her bedroom. Then we started play fighting over stuff and we were always rubbing against each other. I didn't really mean to but because she was wearing these short shorts, I saw her underwear a couple of times. Disregarding that, I was on top of her and we stopped and just laughed and looked at each other. Then we heard our moms talking because my mom was a little early so we just got up and went.

20090306211210AAj5rgR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Complicated with Parents. Need some way to stop their fighting! Any ideas?	Well..   I'm 13, I have 2 brothers ages 12 and 17. Our parents have been married for 16 years from February. 2 years ago is when our parents began arguing ALOT. Well.. alot in front of us. This was in Kansas City suburbs. At the end of that year, I was 11, and we moved to Chicago to be near my Dad's family. When my dad got a job, we stayed there and he left to go to Addis-Abba, Ethiopia. He was there for 3 months and came back on Halloween, 5 days after I turned 12. About a week before his coming home, my mom told me and my brothers that our dad wasn't moving back in with us. So, Halloween we went trick-or-treating, then went home, and waited to be picked up by our dad, grandparents, and cousin. We went out to dinner and just had a good time. It then got to the quesiton. Where are you staying. The answer we got was "For now, with Grandma and Grandpa. I don't know where else yet. "   All I could think is how is this be happening to us?   While he wasn't living with us, it was just so different.    After about 2 months, on chirstmas day, we were planned to be with out dad from noon to 7pm. But instead, my mom called us downstairs to tell us that he was moving back in.    I later (fairly recently) found out that it was only because we couldn't afford the rent alone. That april we got evicted from there and moved again. That house was Cahos and we got evicted from there thanks to the landlord lying in court. After a while, my dad got another job, the one he has now in Memphis. So that summer, just this past summer, in july, we moved here. Both of our parents working, only one home at a time usually, it gets lonely here. In the evenings while dad's home and moms usually at work, our dad sometimes flips out. He screams, yells, insults us and insults our mom. He feels the need to argue over everything and prove he's right no matter what.    Even this week. I think Tuesday, we had GS Cookies. I had one of the Caramell ones and he asked what it was. I told him Dulce de Leche.   He got way too defensive over something and started critizing me on how I think I'm all that and know it all. HE FIGHTS OUT OF SHEER BOREDOM!   It's even worse with parents. He screams at our mom and uses things she can't control against her. He uses her having Bi-Polar disorder against her. He just loves to make his family cry and then talks about how he's only here because he has to be. At the SAME TIME he talks how he wishes he could try to save the marriage.       IT'S TOO CAHOTIC! PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW TO STOP IT!      ((I'm really, really sorry it's so long, I just need help))

20090306202246AAJSuXz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am in love with America, Do you love America too?	I am a 30  year old Iranian woman who went to UK 7 years ago and recently came to USA. I just want to say that all my life even when I was 9, starting to learn English, I fell in love with America from movies, so much that I did everything I could to go there, but visa for Iranians was very hard, so I had to be careful, if once my visa was getting refused, there was no other chance, so I started planning, playing it safe, at the age of 17 I went to University to do a degree and told every one in the Uni that I am gonna be a Geneticist in America, people laughed at me, telling me all the impossibilities, anyway I chose England first because visa was easier, got the student visa, did my Master's but all the time, I was thinking about America. I worked for a couple of years, married an American, waited 2 years for green card process, and at last, recently moved to America, with PhD scholarship in Genetics, which I have just started 2 months ago. And I converted from Islam to Christianity 7 years ago.      I just want to say that all my efforts are paying back, all my dreams about America was true, it is exactly what I was looking for, even better, I totally love American people, culture, language, accent, the land, the air, the sun, the freedom, opportunities, it's amazing. Today I was attending a christian fellowship student group ( all Americans of course, because I only intend to be with them to learn more about this amazing culture), and I was just amazed with people, how energetic, how hospitable, how positive, the way they express their feelings, I just want to say that I think America is the greatest country of all, and American people are blessed. In 3 years, I am gonna be a US Citizen and a Geneticist and I am already proud to be an American.      What is about you American people? Why are you so stunning? I have seen many cultures in my life, but Americans have it all, God bless you people!!!! America is wonderful.

She wonders why this guy who she knows keeps saying that she can stay with him and his family (his wife and three children).       He told her his wife is fine with this. Probably total BS.       He said that he will make a room for her downstairs to stay in. He keeps suggesting it to her. She can stay with them.       He knows that she has been abused. He told her that she could always stay with them.       Is this a concerned friend or someone who wants to cheat on their wife?
20090306200045AArs1lt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband keeps lying to me?	look I know, they're little lies, but they all add up. It sucks. I don't know why he lies, I'm the last one he should do that to. I never gave him that insecurity, but he lied about taking the laptop into the bathroom and whacking off to porn. He was in there for quite some time, and i was worried if he was having a hard time in the bathroom. He said he was fine and i heard the laptop fan turn on. He said that was the sound of the window open. I went in there, and it smelt like d*ck, not crap. It's not that he looked @ it, it's the fact that he lied to me. And him and I had an argument earlier today, and he only told his family that, and I didn't want him to tell his mom, because they'll think of me as an overemotional wreck (im pregnant! I WILL be emotional!), but he lied because he said he didn't tell her, but she got home, didn't say two words to me, didn't look at me. I can't even be emotional without any BS, because I'm pregnant...I'm not acting myself, and I can't help this, I'm going through so much. Please no nasty remarks, I'm getting enough as it is.

20090306213435AAXSteY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get a girlfriend?	Lol! This is a serious question. I've never really had a serious relationship before. Im 19, I've probally considered "going out" with 3 girls in my life so far. Not my girlfriend, but been on more than one date event type. The last one I had, she was my first and only kiss thus far, and we completely hate each other now as of a week or so ago. We hung out for 10 months, and I asked her out on Valentines day and she rejected me.      I don't see why I don't have a girlfriend? Im not that a bad looking guy, Im average. Im funny, very considerate, and just a blast to hang around with. Im also very friendly.       I wanna know I can get someone to be my girlfriend. Friends tell me I try to hard and am to clingy. I have to agree with this. but this is how I look at it. Every girl that I considered "going out" with, everyime I asked them out, they said they didnt wanna ruin our friendship. So i figured to stop being so friendly? But then if Im not myself, they start to realize that and they start to worry and ask whats wrong and such. Then they become upset, and Im a person that HATES it when someone is upset with me.      Ughhhhh, so confused and lonely.      As of right now, I am talking to this one girl that I semi-know. We're talking online. I was suppose to meet her at the movies with a friend, but she couldn't make it, so I sent her a friend request on myspace. Said hi and who I was... and gave her my phone number and my screen name. Is that pushing it?

20090306215635AAPJ4XI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i stop being such a jealous girlfriend?	LONG EXPLINATION: (sorry lol)        1 year ago i was best friends with a girl. we're still friends, but i really don't like her because i'm someone who likes to be different, and all she does is copy every move i make to fit in.        after she found out i was going out with this boy she insisted on being best friends with him and his friends. they all hate her and think she's really annoying for copying them, except my boyfriend. he's so accepting of her and it makes me so mad. i want him to myself. everytime she talks about him i want to rip her face off! and i don't want that feeling, because in general i'm a very happy person.        They don't do much together, but it's really obvious she has feelings for him that she won't admit to. all she talks about is him! and that really frustrates me. How they text all the time, how he walks her home, stuff like that. this shouldn't make me mad though because they walk with a big group of people, and her house is on the way to his best friends house that he stays at every day.        about a month into our relationship my boyfriend admitted that when he asked me out he did like this girl, and that just made me explode. ever since then the last 4 monthes i've been asking if he likes her, and it really irratates him because i know i can trust him now because we're a lot closer. how can i stop being so jealous?!?!? i really want to because it's eating me on the inside.
20090306211727AAEPIGi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This forum is the center of human failure. Are you lying to yourselves?	This fourm is full of sad young people desperally trying to optain human effection. And I have said this once, and I will say it again!      Why must people here have to be strung up on trying to find a mate, or try to emotionally/sexually please them, is this what they thought when they were only a child?      I thought humans are better then this, I thought we were more enlightened with our science and philosophy then to fall into the perils of having to have a relationship.      We can have reproduction of the human race through a lab if we trully cared about the survival of the species. Why do women even need men if in the future society is completely automated and the population is in full regulated control.      Sex it is (in my view) only used as a social construct. A expectation we as society are geared towards in order to try and gain acceptance, materialism, depression, and a sense of worthlessness are not uncommon.      I feel we in western society should rise above this if we really do care about the emotions of humans.
20090306211547AAYWV7p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Fixing to go through a divorce, want to keep house!?	I need to keep the house as I live next door to my mother who I help take care of. I have been in this house 5 years and my husband 1 1/2 years. I doubt he'd want to live next to his ex mom in law, but he threatened me with having to sell the house to "buy him out"??? What does he mean by that? What do I need to do? We are both on the mortgage loan at the bank because we refinanced the house for home improvements after we married. What is the deed of trust?

My parents filed for divorce about 2 years ago and it is just coming to a close. the weird thing is it never really phased me. I kind of just rolled with it, no tears no anger no blame just nothing.    My parents don't really have a good relationship any more (lol duh). It's all spite and hatred that they just dump on me because im the oldest... but the real question here is why don't I feel? Why don't I care that my life is crumbling down around me? If anyone has any answers or past experiences their willing to share please leave them.   Thanks.

20090306215141AASa3wd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stick it out or just leave him?	I am dating a military man.  I love him more than life!  I am pregnant with his twins.  I found out in October and planned to tell him when I visited him over Christmas but he dumped me on Christmas Eve and became unavailable.  When I finally talked to him after New Years I told him but he was very cold and indifferent about it stating he couldn't have a baby right now.  We continued to talk as friends.  We are now together again but I am having a lot of trouble trusting him.  He talks and texts with many girls when I go and visit him.  He still talks to his ex and told me just the other day that he still cares for her deeply.  He wants me to move where he is but I am having a hard time believing that we are going to last.  I am having many difficulties in the pregnancy related to the stress of our in my opinion unstable relationship.  Should I stick it out and hope for the best or cut all ties and move on?  I did meet someone right after we split that wanted to adopt the babies and raise them as his own.  I told my boyfriend and he was all for it until he decided he wanted to get back together.  But he is different now.  Probably because of all the other girls......sigh....Oh and when I went to visit him for Valentines day he met a girl while waiting for me to arrive at the hotel who took him to run errands.  He got her number and now they are talking all the time too.  When I got upset about this, he said I was being unreasonable because he is allowed to have friends.  He just met her and talks to her all the time now.  Am I being paranoid or should I be worried?

20090306213740AAvhAbX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: Would you think about the situation?	I really like this guy! I've known him ever since the beginning of last school year! We use to talk a lot last year. And last year he first began talking to me but by teasing me because my body was very mature and he use to tease me about that. And soon we just began talking like friends. And one time I asked him if he thought I was ugly and he said "If I said I though you were very very fine then you would think that I liked you." What does that mean? Anyway we have first period together and we talk a lot and sometimes I catch him looking at me but with a sort of gay (happy) look on his face but then when I look at him he'll look at me for like a second and then he just looks in the opposite direction. Or sometimes when I begin to talk to him I see like a small smile on his face that he tries to fight. I really like him! He's really funny! But I think that because I'm not really that pretty he may be ashamed of me! Like today we were talking in the hallway and I notice that he sometimes moves ahead of me and I asked why and he's like I'm still listening and then I'll ask him if it was because i'm not cool and he said I didn't say that. Last year towards the end of the year he told me that he liked me and always had. But then five minutes later he went as sat by one of the pretty girls. I'm ugly so yeah! I feel as though he likes me but I don't know! But his friend likes me so yeah! His friend is a real jerk! Do you think that he likes me? Is there enough information? What do I do?   We're both sophomores!   Today when he looked down at me when we were walking his eyes were so beautiful! It made me very happy! It was like we were meant to be! :)   Today when he looked down at me when we were walking his eyes were so beautiful! It made me very happy! It was like we were meant to be! :)   And one time when I was sitting in my seat when he walked pass me he gently touch my chin and it was purposely!. What does he mean my that? He seems as though he likes me and he always smile at me (or he's holding back a laugh!)     But then this happens:   On monday I asked him if he wanted me to walk him to his second period because we have first together and he said no and i said no and he said yes! And I was like why not and he said if i said yes to everything it wouldn't be good if I said yes to drugs that wouldn't be good! And i said that i would never offer him drugs and he said no and he continued with how he didn't want to hurt my feelings and how he thinks i stare at him in class and began talking really loudly and then he just stopped walking so i could walk past him! He hurt my feelings! What does this mean? What do you think? I've seen him look at me in class! It's friday and we haven't spoken to each other since monday! He'll smile at me but I think it's more of a laugh! What do you think about the situation? Does this mean that he isn't interested? I really thought that he liked me? Do you think he does?    I know he was upset with me because I kept talking about this guy who is really really cute! He's like gorgeous! And he knows him so I ask questions about him! Is that bad?
20090306213205AAUGRr0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies do you regret dating badboys?	Im talking retrospectively. Now that your all grown up and in your late 20s (and probably single mothers) do you regret dating those lieng cheating arrogant bad boy types. Has it altered your perception of men in general.       Im curious to know because a lot of women in my area are about this age and most of them seem to be single and all they do is whine about how there no good men around. They are all still hot and im sure they fell for the bad boy thing at one time.
20090306200951AAmGRx4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he like me? why not call me?	I really like this guy. I think he likes me too. Whenever he sees me, he comes over to me and talks to me. Long time ago, I got he's number because from him. But I called for the first time yesterday, he didn't notice my voice. So I just told him, I got the wrong and he said maybe you do have the wrong number. I saw him at the store, he came to me and said "Hey." I said "I called you" and he said, "When?" I said, "yesterday, the girl that told you her fake name" and he started laughing. He said, "Oh, that was you. I was like I never heard of that name before."      so anyways I called him today, he says, "I'm working now. Do you mind if you text message me?"      So my question is, does he even like me? I'm the one who first talked to him. I'm the one who first asked for he's number and I'm the one calling him. If he likes me, doesn't he suppose to call me?

20090306205800AAMjD9b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think im losing her!! What should I do?!?! I cant rlly get over her :(  ?	Okay so there is this girl i never really talked to, but then i started and we really started to like each other and then i accidentally said something to piss her off but she says shes over it now. Its like she has lost all interest in me, and all I said was that she acts a little different in public than in private.      I keep trying to get her alone to talk about it but every time i get a chance she has "Homework" or she has to call one.. its like she is avoiding me for some reason i dont get. I see her in the hallway and make eye contact and smile but she like looks away really quick and i dunno what it means.      She liked me before and we got over the awkward stage so it was all going ghreat.. but since the problem i havent felt like im connecting with her, she wont answer any serious texts and wont talk on the phone. Im seriously about to give up but i just dont know what the issue is and i kind of want to know before i drop her... or get dropped by her.      I just cant figure it out.. but i asked a good friend of hers a while back and she asked me if i liked her... at the time i was confused and i said no, so I am thinking maybe she said something and now she is afraid to talk to me because she doesnt want to like me??      what do you think I should do? Or what do you think her problem with me is?

20090306200509AAJHvdG	Family & Relationships;Friends	WHY WOULD SHE LOOK AWAY EVERYTIME I PASS HER? PLEASE ANSWER?	We're in high school in New York. We talked for hours and 500+ text messages since we met on the phone by a friend - but that was weeks ago. One time when we were on the phone she invited me to her house like 5 times sorta kidding, I was like, "sure." i had a nickname. we flirted i guess. Right after we met we went somewhere, me, my friend (who introduced us), her and her other friend. She really really wanted me to go i mean really but we didn't say anything because i was mad and she was shy that day. but that's old. everytime i pass her in the hall or something she sorta glances away and avoids eye contact, Why? she said she's shy before. maybe shes embarrassed that i think she likes me, (see below). so basically we still didn't talk in real life.      a few weeks ago her friend Kim asked me if I liked her, and I said no because I thought she had a boyfriend, and she said, "No she doesn't have one," seeming as if i should ask her out, but i never told her yes. she was mad at Kim, her friend for a while for asking me that (and me too but then apologized immensely) when i told her that. everything slowed down after that between us. She practically begged me to add her on facebook before that, i did. she texted me first like 3 times within the past 2 weeks or so. i have zero times, i want to just forget about her. her other friend (NOT kim) liked me before too, was obvious. but that's old. im a grade above her.
20090306210933AAgfLk9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was I wrong?  Should I have apologized?	Okay, I am seventeen. My girlfriend is normally a very quiet and sweet girl, and she means so much to me. A couple of weeks ago, though, we got into a really big fight at a party of a mutual friend. She said that I never gave her any attention and was too busy flirting around with her friends. This isn't true. She and I both screamed some really hurtful things at each other, and it ended with me telling her that she didn't mean anything to me (again, untrue) and her leaving in tears. Today was the first day that we've spoken to each other since, and it seemed to be going well. Then, just as I thought we were getting somewhere, she asked if I was going to apologize. I felt like this was kind of a shot at me, so I told her that I refused to apologize. Well, this led to another argument, and I was wondering: was I wrong for not apologizing? And am I horrible person for what I yelled at her?

20090306215757AASeYFT	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How were you proposed to/did you propose?	This is my personal story:      My fiance asked my parents first.      Then, when we visited my family next, he and I played against my Mum and Dad in 'Articulate', because I love word games.      It's one of those games where you have to describe a word within a certain category within a time limit, without saying the word itself, and get your partner to guess it.      He waited 'til the game was almost finished, so I'd had time to enjoy it, and then when he landed on the right category, he got down on one knee, pulled out the ring and asked "Will you...?" and I got to complete the sentence for him, with "marry me?"      It was so sweet, especially because he knows I'm a total feminist and don't think men should always do the proposing. Plus, it fit in with the game.      So that got me wondering how other people got proposed to?      Plus, I was just thinking about it (it happened 3 weeks back) and, to be honest, wanted to share.      But seriously, I do want to hear your stories too :)

His penis looks like one of those mini vanilla tootsie rolls, and that is when he is erect.   His mom told me that when he was a baby they were throwing around the idea of raising him as a girl, but they decided not to because his face is so God-awful ugly that no one in their right mind would believe it.

20090306212310AAoJ8tK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it normal to feel hatred even if you love him?	I am broken hearted. I was careless in our relationship. I became so confident that he wud never leave me, so i became careless about his feelings. We've been together for 3years, then he broke up with me. I realized I loved him so much and never felt like it before in the past. 3weeks ago i promised myself even if his gone, that I will love him forever. Tonight i'm feeling sorry for myself for begging him to come back and I started to think that he fooled me and felt being used. I am hating him now.Is this normal?
20090306213109AACvOXz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i let her go just to be sure?	okay so my gf is graduating from high school this march and off to college. i still have a year before i go to college. so when we're hanging out with our friends they always talk about that we'll have different lives because they'll be so busy with college. i just hate it when they say that,yesterday they talked about it again i can't take it anymore so i cried (i'm also a girl, bi ).      on the way home my gf said "don't worry about it okay, graduation is weeks away. we won't be gone,were still here for you guys. I'm still here for you....And don't worry i'll let you meet my new girlfriend haha" she was joking about the new gf..but it still hurts. knowing that before we had a relationship she dates girls and guys at the same time. Now, i'm sure its just me, were totally inlove but i don't know until when she'll hold on cuz she'll meet a lot of college guys soon.       so when she starts college i was thinking of letting her go. is this the right thing to do?

20090227090545AAUbWt7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is it so difficult to find decent friends?	I have had very bad luck with friends over the years, Most of them I don't have any contact with them anymore cause they were too inconsiderate, incredible mean and selfish- they were the type of people that just take but never give anything back. Maybe it was my own fault for being too nice a person with them and they just viewed me as some kind of push over and tried to take advantage of my kindness. I have learned the lesson and now I have to keep all my friends at a safe distance.
20090227090034AA4Q7aE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a relationship problem,,, is it love that i feel?	if you open this please read it and reply please i need help         i have known this girl for 8 years, in that time we have become really good freinds. about 3 years ago i came out and told her that i liked her more then a friend, she didnt know what to say at the time so she just froze up, we have been really really good friends. i have asked her out straight to her face i dont even know how many times, i would say about 25. if she hadnt changed her mind so many times i would have already asked her about 30 more times. the thing is usually she tells me she wants to go out with me and then usually the night before i go to ask her, i find out that she has a boyfriend. or i go to ask her and before i even get the question out she looks at me and says "im sorry tyler but i think that it would be better if we just stayed friends for the time being.      now we both have told each other that we love each other and its just confusing. i can not stop thinking about her she is on my mind all the time, i dream about her i talk about her, its just her. but when i think about her too much i just stop and stop for like 2 days. but everytime i am around her i feel like grabbing her by the waist and kissing her and asking her if she would go out with me, but i only want what she wants so i cant. she told me that she would tell me when she was ready. i cant stand the thought of being without her, i still have a life full of other things but she is the main part of my entire life. now i am leaving in august to go to job corps and she said that she thinks she would be able to handle long distance but i have to come see her every chance i get, she wants to see me, she wants to be with me, i can tell it in her eyes when she says she loves me.       in the entire 8 years that i have known her we have only kissed once and that was for a dare 3 years ago. i feel like walking to her house everyday, she only lives 4 houses away though. but i feel like walking there and just holding her and never letting go. everytime she does the 'i want to go out with you' rueteen it breaks my heart because she is with another man but i can not be mad at her i just cant even if god willed it.      i honestly have no clue what to do...all i want from her is for her to be there i dont ask for anything, i have bought her multiple hundred dollar pieces of jewelry, i have the money to do it.... i dont ask for sex, no attention, no anything. i clean up after her gave her everything she wishes and more, i do everything i can to try to raise my chances of being able to hold her in my arms.      i do not know what to do,, and i can hold on forever but i dont want to i want to do something about my feelings      if possible i am on aim,,, tybrandons

20090306211913AADbzgs	Family & Relationships;Family	Problems with my dad???	So me and my dad have been fighting for a while now and its getting worse.He has this girlfriend who I absolutely hate she doesn't talk to me and she sits there with her 3 yr old like she is a princess.No joke that little girl is spoiled rotten and my dad is starting to treat her better then me.Well my dad is telling me to take advantage of the time I have alone with him because his girlfriend went back to her home for a while and will come back in 1 month I asked him what if she wanted to come back tommorow (Just to see what he would say) He said I would let her as you can see he doesn't care about spending time alone with me and my sisters because he can't tell her to go home basically the way we live is up to her and when she is gone my dad doesnt care about feeding us right like he does with her he will throw a pizza in the oven and Yay Dinner! Its okay for some people but as a person whos always ate a homemade meal its different and its like he only is doing this for her I know its little things but they add up and to tell you the truth it hurts when he yells at me in my room for 2 hours and leaves my room to watch american idol with her like nothing happened.One day when we were arguing she heard me say she doesnt like me and got all mad at him and then he was siting at the table for 3 hours with his head down like as if somone died when I was gone for 4 months he never did that Im not saying he has too but he never got sad when I left and Im his own kid.Its pretty bad when the kid asks to see a therapist

Ok so I started crushing on my guy friend and my friends were like hey when are you going to tell him or if you wont tell him i will so i told him the truth but he didn't talked to me for two days. Then when I found him, and he started running away from me so my friend caught him for me and she grabbed one of his arms and i grabbed the other one but when i asked him why he was being a jerk and not talking to me he just said he wanted to be alone then i just let him go. After that i saw him again but he didn't run so when i tried talking to him he just yelled out "I just want to be alone" then i showed him the scars I had. (Yes i cut myself but plz that's not why im writing you for ok so shhh concentrate on what i need you ppl to help me on) Then he was like what does that have to do with me and then i was like dude i did this cuz when i said i loved you, you started acting like a jerk, I left crying after that. The next day he came up to me and at lunch and told me that he wasn't mad and that he was just thinking about his future...when i asked him what he ment he wouldn't tell me. That same day i asked him what his future had to do with me and he just texted me back in caps saying "GET OUT OF MY LIFE" so i started crying. The day after that this kidd who i kicked out of our group came back and showed me a paper it said "Sign if you want lola out of the group" and the guy i had confesed my feelings for had his name there even though he hated the guy. So i asked the guy i was crushing on why and he just said you were getting on my nervs. That same day one of the group members asked me if i was ok i said yes but it was a lie i just wanted to tell her "NO ****. you i can't believe you have the guts to say that" but i didn't then today another guy from the group asked me why i was mad and the same thing i wanted to say but in spanish "No lo puedo creer que tengas un chingo de huevos para decirme si estaba enojada contigo" I was so mad that i was going to cut myself but some dude took away my razor and said if he gave it back he wouldn't be my friend so i gave it to him and a girl made me pinky swear so yeah thats what happened. I really don't know what to do about this plz help me! By the way sorry for writing a hole book ? (I only have 2 small scars I'm not emo but i already stopped i can't brake a promise ok. but like i said don't focus on the cutting but on the problem plz thnx!)

We were friends when we were in the same class but after the class ended he became really shy around me but no one else...So I was wondering if I should pass him a note asking him if he likes me back. I would just ask him but it would be really awkward and he always gets this surprised look if i talk 2 him and im way 2 shy.

We've been in counseling for a long time, but I became so miserable that my wife agreed to let me start taking estrogen. Six months later,  I'm much happier but she has become distant physically.  She doesn't want a woman, but loves me very much.   Sometimes it feels like a lost cause, but other times I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground.

20090306211537AAaqDxu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this verbal abuse? Please help, details inside.?	I have a really good friend who has been in an on again-off again relationship for about 5 years. The problem is the guy. He is mean to her. he gets so jealous at the smallest things. He checks her phone after every text message she gets to make sure it's not from another guy. Twice, he has slammed her phone on the ground because she was talking to another guy. He goes to her house uninvited, and follows her everywhere and knows where she is all the time. He's mean to her friends. He called me two very harsh names that aren't true and it almost made me cry. He has done the same to two of her other friends. She has called me at least 5 times asking me what to do about him because he made her so mad. Yet, she keeps going back to him. I'm scared one day he's going to hit her. She means alot to me, and I don't want him to hurt her. What can I do? Anything?      Thanks and 10pts to best answer

20090306211604AARMplP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help with boy troubles.?	Ok, so, there's this boy and we dated for 4 months. Our anneversary was on the 23rd. And my birthday was on the 28th. But he goes through this period of time, where he acts kinda distant and its kinda strange. It's kind of like a woman's period. But, anyway. I called him and we started talking like normal, and he said he loved me and everything, but, like 2-3 weeks before he said we were kinda dwindling out, and not as fun as it was. But, we got stared talking about something and eventually I said "You know you can break up with me. You don't have to stay with me just to spare my feelings" and eventually he ended up breaking up with me. He said there wasn't a spark anymore and it's not as fun. (He is a senior in high school and I'm a freshman. Let's get one thing clear. We didn't have sex and we both agreed not to have sex, cause we didn't want to. He even told his best friend he didn't want to have sex yet. But, there's something else as to why he broke up with me. Yes, I know he sounds like a jerk, but you have to know him and be in a relationship with him to know how things work) But then, I sent him this extremly long thing on facebook and lately we've been talking alot. I've cought him looking at me, and he's treating me like he did before we were dating. When he had a crush on me. But I'm despirate to get him back and I need yall's help on what to do. I''m playing hard to get-ish. I wait on him to talk to me, but I need to get him back, so please help me. Thanks!

So my girlfriend of 10 months (she's a senior in hs and im a freshman in college) was asked to junior prom by a kid I don't know. She is pretty good friends with and says its just as friends. I know she wouldnt do anything to hurt us, but still, why would I want her to go to a dance with a kid i dont even know, right? Also, I'm pretty he likes her because he texts her like crazy. So i said no and know she is pissed because she feels bad for him, because he doesn't talk to many girls. Obv he can find another date, so why did he ask my gf? What do you think? Am i right sayin she can't go?

20090306212049AABNOHg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she actually like me at  all or am I wasting my time?	I got to know this girl for about a month now and we talk almost every day after class on our way to our dorms. We joke around a lot and talk about random things in our life.       When I first asked her out on a date she said yes at first but when I asked if she was sure she said that she "kind" of have someone and that it is "really weird" between them. When I asked her to clarify she wouldn't elaborate and just that her life was really complicated and she needs to think about it.      So I dropped it and and backed off a bit but we continue to talk as if I haven't asked her out. For the last few days she seemed to be a bit different when we talk now. She would laugh a lot more when we talk and and give me really random details about her plans for the weekend.       I'm just really confused if she likes me or not. She is really shy (so am I) and innocent so idk if her initial response was just her way of rejecting me. Should I ask her to clarify her feelings again or just keep talking to her and wait for her to make a move?

His profile however stated that he was looking for one on one sex. The profile had been opened like a week prior. I confronted him and he denied everything. What would you do in this situation.

20090306213928AANajBO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm rweally lonely... And I don't know what to do.?	I'm 16 now.. and over the years I have developed a severe case of social anxiety disorder. I'm not diagnosed.. but I know that I have it. At one point.. I completely avoided all human interaction out of fear. I screwed up my life just because I was afraid of people. I haven't noticed.. till now, how lonely I actually am. Basketball just ended.. and I'm used to coming home at 7 o'clock. But now with all this spare time, I don't know.. I've had a lot of time to think. *sigh* I've been trying to hold in my emotions so that I don't break down.. I just don't know what to do.. I'm so shy, and I've lost all friends. (I'm sorry if I'm all over the place.. I Just.. have a lot of thoughts flowing through my head right now) I've lost all social skills.. I've lost everything.. I've never been so alone, and I don't know how to pull myself out of this. I don't know how to gain my confidence back. It just feels like I'm stuck. And it's not like I have a reason to be like this.. Girls are attracted to me.. At least I think so, because a lot of them have been calling me cute lately. But whenever they do so, I don't know how to respond.. And i start shaking really bad. I guess.. Maybe I do have a reason, I was bullied pretty bad in grade school.. (Not physically) I'm still bullied now actually.. but i never defend myself.. Because most of the time, I actually believe what people are telling me. And I feel inferior to everyone else. I think I'm going to be this way forever.. And I've already accepted it. I guess this isn't really a question.. I'm sorry.. I just needed to make myself feel less alone.

20090306214048AA2ijPH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men - why the mixed signals?	I met someone who was a friend of friends, he was flirty but never asked me out. I met my now ex right after and he continued to get in touch via im, emails, etc. After my now ex and I broke up this person mentioned I should contact him when i'm in his area, told me he found me attractive, etc., then told me his type which clearly wasn't me - I'm an attractive, educated woman - he basically told me he likes townies who dress trampy??? Whom he said want nothing to do with him, since he is not their type.....I've seen hints of insecurity but jeeze. I would then tell him when I was going to be in his area, try and make plans with him and there was always an excuse, or he wouldn't show up to where I said i'd be, when he asked in the first place. I ran into him the other night - he was flirty and friendly and watched me the whole night - to later be cold again. After coming on strong then backing away. I don't get it - why bother. I told him to just leave me alone, I just wanted to be friends and get to know him better, but he obviously has no interest in that even though he says so. The sad part is we have a TON in common and we both find each other attractive.      What is the intent behind this? Why bother - why say call me, or we should get together or flirt - when you don't mean it? If he was 20 thats one thing, but this man is in his early 40s.      Is this someone with issues incapable of a "real" relationship, or someone just not interested and confused?
20090306214654AA45yEb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I dump him or not?	Not sure what to do. He was my best friend for two years before we started dating last month. yes, we are boyfriend and girlfriend. He cusses a lot, which he know i hate, but is trying not to. I love his family and just enjoy the environment when he's around. But at school ,he doesn't really act like my boyfriend. Turns out none of his friends knew, cause he didn't tell them. When we're out of school, just hanging out at his or my house or at the movies or something, he's really nice and funny. My best friend says I should dump him because he danced with almost every girl at the school dance twice and only me once, and when we did i wished i was sitting with the nose pickers in the corner. I NEED A YES, A NO AND WHY!
20090306214224AAGvL0l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does he want me back?	Let me make this brief but as descriptive as possible:   1)we've been friends for 8 years even through other realtionships   2)we always got along, barely argued.   3)he told me he always had feeling for me and always would a little and that I would too. He his flirting was harmless and thats all just words(he had a fiancee at the time and I was n a relationship)   4)our relationship ended cuz of distance not hate   5)we slept with each other at one point   6)he cried for me, like sobbing, at one point he thought I was dying   7)he bought me a very expensive laptop while with his fiancee at the time(she was the only other person he bought things like that for)   8) anytime he and his fiance had problems he would run to me for advice   9)i am with someone now and he said he respected me enuf not to ruin us   10) he always IMs me and contacts me online. I'm one of the 1st 3 on his top ppl   11)he recently broke off with his fiancee and invited me to a party(including the person I'm with). I told him that I couldnt go at 1st but now he's begging me to find ways to go. He's returning home next month but has been talking to me the whole time.   12) we've always been both physically and mentally attracted to each over all the years      What do you guys think? Its my ex over me like he said? Or could h be lying for my sake? My intuition is telling me theres more to the story...

20090306214522AA6ThtM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or is he playing?	I like this guy, I've known him for a while but only recently have we been becoming better friends. We sit next to each other in a class, and I've been noticing some vibes that he might like me, but I'm not sure if this is how he acts around all girls.      Before class sometimes he comes up and talks to me, and I feel he remembers a lot of the things I say to him because he'll bring them up later. He's called me hot before, but he also talks about other girls sometimes. He's always willing to help me, but he can make fun of me and I can't tell if he's flirting or not. Sometimes I catch him looking at me.. but then again I look at a lot of people that I don't think are attractive. Also, one time he visited me at work but I think it was just because he was passing by.
20090306214527AAYiQr4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does He know I like Him?	Okay. So this is about the same boy that I wrote about in my other question that no one answered. :P I'd appreciate if you would answer that one as well. I NEED to know.   Also. I know this is pretty long but I want you guys to get the most detail. You guys are my detectives. :] Please and Thank You!!!!       So heres the thing. I told my friends that I liked this boy. And they tell him I liked him and quickly he's all. "I dont give a ****."   And looks away. I get really embarrassed. And then,BAM. He tries to talk to me more often now. And whenever I talk to him,I get real shy and I talk in my normal voice with him. I usally talk in a different voice like ALL the time in school. But when I talk to him,I dont know why but I talk like a normal girl instead of like a squeaky voice,Lol. But really. Why is he talking to me NOW? He smiles and grins allot at me but then again. He does that to everyone. And then..I took his candy and he didnt mind? o.o He teases me too..And whenever he's talking to me..He's not as outgoing like he is with everyone else. And Me and him are like the most funniest in our class. So why does he hesitate to talk to me when He knows Im friendly?He's super friendly too though.

20090306215058AAb2jQ8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just think this is funny (it's about a guy)?	I had a boyfriend for about 4 months. This guy (my age) whenever he saw my mom he'd be like "You're daughter is dating a dork." His brother would always say, you're just jealous. I've known him since I was 12 (I'm 18 now.)      And now when we see each other we can barely speak. It's so ridiculous.      I always thought it was funny that he always told my mom that my (now ex) bf is a dork or a loser.      Would you fellow answerers think anything of this?      And I might mention he has the most amazing body I've ever seen a guy have.

20090227085937AApIzhZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What shall i say to him?	He is not the boss but one of the managers in my workplace. I dont work in his department so dont have to speak to him on a daily basis but we do cross paths and see each other often.    I really fancy him - i am 19, he is 26. I know there is a spark there already and everytime i saw him today (3 times) he'd walk past me, give me a smile and a wink and say hi. But thats how far our conversation always goes - i often see him looking at me and i always look at him too...we're both very aware that we like each other. Today i think he was going to say something else to me but i was with someone else and i don't think he wanted to approach me unless i was alone.    HOW DO I TALK TO HIM?? i.e. start a longer conversation. I cant ask him any questions really about work because we work in different fields and i dont just want to jump straight in there and ask him out for a drink or anything - i want to start to get to know him. Does anyone have any ideas about what i should say to start a chatty conversation next time i see him? (baring in mind the limited time limits we have together). Thanks.

20090227120623AADAUFt	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about a mean, and hurtful cousin?	I have a cousin, in which we are the same age. We are 26 now. We grew up together. When were younger, she would always brag about herself and I always ignored it because she was my cousin.      Now that we are older, the bragging tends to get worse. We do talk as friends, but recently, my fiance and I broke up. I am heart broken over it, and she tends to rub it in my face about her marriage life. She send pictures to me of her and her husband. She talks about being a wedding planner for her friends. She also gives way too much personal detail about her weekend getaways with her hubby. But yet, at the same time, she always send me have a great day wishes, I love you cuz and so forth. I like my cousin, but I don't know why she has to do these things, or why she does. She is a very beautiful lady. She has a happy life, so it appears,  she even models. (Btw, I am not wanting to sound conceited, but I am a very pretty girl too.) I am totally different than her, as far as interests, style and music. Why is she doing this to me?

20090227093357AAinUh4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do? Please answer my question.?	I just asked this question two hours ago but I really would like some opinions on what to do.  This week has been hell. I overdrew at the bank $150 and this is only the second time I have ever overdrawn. Then, my boyfriend's grandma died Weds. night. One of my close friends is having a bachelorette party Sat. night. The plans were to go clubbing all night. Now I am broke. I only have a hundred dollars left until I get paid again in two weeks. And there is my boyfriend's grandma's funeral on Saturday. He is suffering with agoraphobia and really can't go without me. But he doesn't even plan on staying for the funeral because he don't think he can stay that long. So should I go to the bachelorette party? I don't know if I can even enjoy myself because of the money though. Will it be rude to go? He wasn't even close to his grandma though. I feel so stressed. I don't know what to do.   And the party is three hours away. If I don't go when everyone leaves I can't afford to drive there too.  That is why it is so expensive.  We are renting a room and using cabs too.
20090227092813AA3yzM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my bf using me for $? How can i use him back?	My bf just spent his entire paycheck on new tires for his motorbike. Now i have to pay for EVERYTHING for the week - just like last week. He was supposed to pay off the electricity bill but now he can't and it's his XboX that has double my electricity bill.  I already spent $$$ last week paying for his food, gas, liquor, party favours etc. I was hoping to get a break this weekend and next week and have him pay for some stuff but he just called me and said he's spent his entire paycheck already (he just got the money this morning) which means ANOTHER week out of my earnings. He says that if i don't want to feed and give him money then he will have to spend his time with his other friends who will give him all that stuff supposedly. So my understanding from this is that -basically i've got to pay for his company or else someone else will? When he has money, he does spend it on me but he always does stuff like this when he's supposed to pay for groceries etc.  - he goes and buys expensive toys for himself and then has no money for the bills and food etc. Don't tell me break up with him please - just give me advice as to how i can squeeze some money back out of him before he spends his paychecks.

20090227114354AA6YvI4	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to APOLOGIZE to my BFF?	We had this HUGE fight about literally nothing lately, ok I have been the one who brought it up and I've been really mean and nasty to her. I apologized and said I'd been out the line and such and she said it was ok but we haven't talked much and when we do it's just like "how're ok" and "ok have a good one" kind of stuff. She's been kinda busy lately, her bf is sick so she's taking care of everything so that's her excuse but I think she's still mad, I asked her but she said she wasn't.    I feel really bad about what I did and I want to do or say something really nice, it's just she moved away two years ago so we don't get to see each other more than once a year, we're way too far apart so the only options I got to talk to her are calling or mailing her.    I was just wondering what I could do, like I'm definitely gonna call her tonight and talk to her once more, I was just thinking maybe there's something I can do to show her how much our friendship means to me.. Any ideas???   Thanks!

20090227111847AAkf3b3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Another thing girls do that I don't understand (for the ladies)?	I have this big thing with girls not telling the guys when something is bothering them in a relationship. Especially when the guy says something about it and the girl just plays it like nothing is wrong. I have a few questions pertaining to this.       First off, why do some girls do this? I hear how girls hate that guys don't seem to be in tune when something is wrong, but then act like nothing is wrong if they are asked.      Second, what would you say if, when I asked you out, that telling me when something is up during our relationship I would like it very much if you would tell me and not act like everything is cool?

20090227112542AAvuJz1	Family & Relationships;Friends	PLEASE PLEASE ANSWER! Ten points easily!?	I'm in ninth grade and, just this semester, met another freshmen who seems pretty cool. We don't have any classes together right now but I'm shooting to be with him a few periods next year. We text and Facebook a few times, and this week, on Tuesday, I decided to ask him if he wanted to go to the movies. He said sure and that would be fun, but that he was busy this coming weekend with baseball. I figured we could try for next weekend (March 7) so I texted him Wednesday night and asked if that would be good. No reply. I tried again yesterday with the same question, waited about an hour, then got irritated. I asked him if he was ignoring me or if he didn't want to be my friend. No reply there either. Finally, I just said, "Wow. Great talking to you. NOT." He replied with, "Dude, I just got out of a freaking baseball game. Calm down." Obviously, he'd been busy, so I should have trusted him. Instead, I told him I was calm, and that if he was going to be like that then he should just delete my number and that we should not talk anymore. All night I felt bad about it, so this morning I sent a quick "Sorry for the way I acted" message to him. I haven't seen him today in the halls, but only because the power went out and the school schedule got screwed up (It's not that he's avoiding me.) What do I do? I really want to keep this friend, because I've lost a lot of good buddies over my impatience. PLEASE HELP.

20090227092116AAmoCdZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not sure what I should do in this relationship..?	My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. I absolutely love her and she has some amazing qualities as an individual. However, I feel some aspects of our relationship are not what I would like them to be or I'm losing interest on my part. For example, I enjoy exercising and doing activities and thats what I look for in a girl also, yet I'm always asking her to do something and its always a hassle to get her up and moving. She likes playing computer games, video games, and watching TV which is fine, yet sometimes thats all she does and it drives me nuts. Also I'm a health concious eater and I would like to share this interest of mine with my significant other. Yet she eats a lot of junk food, and I try to tell her to eat something healthy here and there its good for you body and so on. Also I'm an in depth person and I like conversation about deep things, yet its hard to get her to talk about stuff. Although I'm not trying to change her cuz thats not fair and its not my position to do that, but I'm beginning to realize that type of person she is may not be the type of person I'm into. I mean she very physically attractive, and definitely my type in that category. Sometimes I picture me and her down the road and what it would be like and I don't know if I want that. I mean should I confront her about this...whats would someone else do?      Thanks

20090227093542AArwhWI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make my girlfriend become attracted to me again?	We've been dating for 5 months and everything has been great.  We've recently said that we loved each other but lately she has been distant and doesn't seem to have time to see me and yet I'm only 20 min down the road.  She recently told me that she has lost her attraction for me even though I'm the best sex she has ever had.

Of course everything was going well in the beginning then out of no where he broke up with me. Then would get back together and break up again. But we act like we still we are going out. Sometimes I do wish that maybe we should just quit talking but then again I don't want to. Because just thought of me losing him makes me kinda of worried. But we are currently not together but we still hang out. But I just don't know what to do anymore?

20090227114437AAzwc7V	Family & Relationships;Family	Do we need a Living Will, or Living Trust?	Okay so heres the situation:      I live with my grandma, who is on my mothers side of the family.  She has co ownership of a house with her brother, but he doesn't pay anything for it nor live in it so he's not really in the picture.      The thing is, she is getting older, and has said that she is willing to give her part of the house to me, rather than give her half to my mom or my aunts.  We can't ask our family for help, because as soon as they find out what is happening, they will stop talking to her.  (Yeah I know, some family right?)  But so far we do not know what we need to do to get everything settled while she is still alive.      What I want to know is how would she go about giving her property and valuables away while she is still alive, so that when the time comes that she passes away we will not have to worry about it?  I've heard about a living will and a living trust, but am just not sure which one we would need.      Anything that can be done without an attorney and a lot of money would be best.  Thanks for your time, and best answer gets the points!
