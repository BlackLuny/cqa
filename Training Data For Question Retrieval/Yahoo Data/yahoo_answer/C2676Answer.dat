DFWvjolMaa	It's probably down to genetics. There are obviously some environmental influences at work, too.<br>  <br>  Basically, it's the same with people. Once person might live until 102, they might smoke and drink and another person might live until 40 and do neither. <br>  <br>  Just like us, genetics determine what risk there is to the hamster getting a certain illness. Cancer, for example.<br>  <br>  There have been some papers which have been written to suggest that keeping dwarf hamsters in a social group increases their life span. However, it is clear this is not the case with you, so I would put it mostly down to genetics.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i guess it's just a happy hamster :)|`|D75rqaihaa	well its just like people, you dont know how long there going to live for...the hamster you have now is a good age, but obviousley it was healthier or had better genes from it parent e.c.t<br>  <br>  good luck|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	depends on the hamster. same case really as why do some humans die at 60, and others after 100. big gap between them - but maybe the others had a medical condition wrong with them, and then the other might have felt lonely so might not have kept itself in a good state.|`|yT6JNMdIaa	Maybe because him living wild (not tame) has kept his brain active, and he doesn't have the stress of other dwarfs around him (dwarf family groups do experience a little stress from time to time, but living alone doesn't cause as much.)

AA12083992	All of my pets but one have been rescues, dogs and cats. I have rescued dogs of all ages, pup to adult and many mixed breeds. I have never been sorry. With proper training any breed, any age, can be a great pet. Bless you for adopting and saving a life!|`|cnZlMojUaa	My little rescue dog passed away recently, and took a piece of my heart with her. She was a beautiful, timid Scottish Terrier who was available for adoption when her first owner passed away. We shared nearly 7 wonderful years together. We found her on petfinder.org; she was being housed at an SPCA facility. She was a wonderful companion and I miss her very much.<br>  <br>  Shelters and rescue organizations have so many dogs that need homes. It is great that you want to bring one into your family. Purebred dogs are available in addition to mixes. I strongly recommend an adult dog.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I have a rescue (from a shelter).  She was 7 months when I adopted her, her name's Cocoa, and she's a boxer/lab/australian cattle dog mix, according to the owner's who turned her into the shelter.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	I have all rescue pets (dogs, cats and horses).  These re-homed animals are wonderful.  You can get mixed breed or even purebred for rescues depending on the animal of your preference. But make sure you are ready for a lifetime commitment.  As with any pet, there can be issues that will need to be addressed since you will not necessarily know the complete background of the dog.  The shelter will be able to give you an idea on the breed(s) of the dog so do your homework first to find breeds that would be acceptable to you and your lifestyle.  For instance, if you live in an apartment and don't have a lot of time to exercise the dog, you would stay away from high energy dogs such as border collies.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d8fSVX23aa	I have a rescue lab/doberman we got her aged 5 mths. The rescue was one of the sort that has them playing all day in open fields with dog wardens walking around and playing, socializing with other dogs and only brought in at night and caged. Her interaction with other dogs was brilliant and has continued to be so. If at all possible chose a rescue centre like this as they will have less problems compared to caged like jails.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is a conflicting question - you say you want a rescue because you don't want a purebred, and yet you want names and BREED?  Strange.  And some rescue dogs can actually be purebred.

He loves it so much he didn't leave.<br>  Any rescue animal will appreciate a good loving home and owner.<br>  1 dog is not quite a yr. old the other was about 1 1/2 yrs old when I got them,,,,,It's been 2 yrs now for one and about 9 mounths for the other.|`|zxxt4KZHaa	Adopting a rescued dog it's a great idea and you will find small dogs, big dogs, mix dogs, pure breeds and some of them are even house broken or trained. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have 2 adopted dogs and they are the best dogs ever, we got them a couple months ago.

9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Oh dear.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already, get your new cat fixed: He sounds like he's old enough, and is definitely a territorial little terror. Until then, keep the cats separated. If that doesn't work, ask your vet for advice and to recommend an animal behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RT8LZy7gaa	I'm introducing a new male cat into my house of a male/female pair and the female kindof accepts him (she still swats at him if he gets up in her face) and the male is totally against the idea.  I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  I've just started letting the new guy wander around the house, so his "smell" gets into the house.  (He's neutered and not spraying, just his normal body scent.)  My current male cat is 16 years old and still very very active and he's always hated any adult cats I bring home to foster.  Kittens he's fine with until they reach about 6 months, then puberty kicks in. Luckily, I've been able to adopt out kittens before they reached sexual maturity.<br>  <br>  So all I can say is keep them separated when you're not home. You don't want to have to deal with an abcess. But when you're there, as long as you don't see them actually grabbing and biting each other, they'll just have to work it out.  Keep a spray bottle handy to break up serious fights, or a pair of leather gloves if that doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|8f2e6b2b77e98982ec1a14639f6d0a1baa	Let them establish dominances. Eventually they'll realize they have to be friends, especially if you enforce it.

iJtuhLMTaa	Look for a healthy bird first of all.  The vent and nares (nostrils) should be clean, the bird should be fully feathered (though some luntino and luntino-whiteface (often mis-called albinos)  may have a genetic bald spot behind the crest.   When you are standing back from the cage and not too close it should appear relaxed and its breeding even.      Look at the environment the birds are kept in it should be clean.  A few blobs of feces on the bottom of the cage is ok but it shouldn't be piled up.      <br>  <br>  If they bird are hand fed or hand tame they shouldn't be overly nervous of you. They may be a bit nervous or standoffish since you are a new person but they shouldn't be overly so.   If the birds are parent raised and not hand tamed expect them to be more nervous of you but they shouldn't be panicked.    <br>  <br>  If a bird seems to take right to you that may be the bird for you.  If none do then all other things being equal just choose the bird you like best.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	The best way, is to let the bird pick you. In a group of babies, one (at least) will probably stand out and be friendlier to you than the others-or he may just seem to  be more like you. Its a personality thing, and birds are very perceptive.|`|MGTadJY5aa	look for bright colors and one that doesn't pick at itself all the time.  the cockatiel will pick you make sure it is hand trained  caroline o.  i had a cockatiel foe 14 yrs.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Although l do not breed cockatiels l have 5 of them of which two will come on my finger and are nice and tame and are lutinos.Even reading up about cockatiels will not h elp you as you have to trust the Breeder or whoever you go to.My advice to you is this.If you can get the bird to go on your finger with no issues re biting or trying to escape you go for it and continue doing this at home plus it must have a daily flight round the room or be around you when you are in the house as they are very curious birds and love investigating everything.it is hard to sex a bird when young and someone once said to me that the best way to get a really tame bird is to raise it yourself once it has initially had a start from the Breeder,you take over the feeding which you will need the breeder to give you the recipe and how to do this and l can assure you the bond between you and the bird will never be broken but this depends if you have the time.My first two cockatiels a split lutino and the other a common grey although a white face were assured to me from the breeder they were hand raised and would come on my finger and they were both males.Guess what one is a female and bites like hell and will never come on my finger the other does if you push the issue.learn by my mistake do not believe, test first.They are super mimics and easy to train but a word of warning do not put too many toys in the cage yet put some in and once the bird adjusts to its new surrooundings and the cage plus you introduce the new toys as its like a child in a toy shop they are over awed by all the toys.Good luck
DFWvjolMaa	Up to 12 babies can be produced. However, there are obviously variables to account for. They are more likely to produce 12 at their most fertile. This starts when they are about 8 weeks old, gestation is about 20 days and they then mate immediately after the birth once again.|`|bvIGwDzjaa	Between 5-7 Babies.|`|Z9UX0jiVaa	Around 20 or more then they eat most of them and leave how many they think they can look after what is Around 7 to 10 each litter will slowly get bigger.

I've also been told that kidney stones hurt when they pass. Again, just a thought. Poor lil' Bibi. Hope she feels better soon :(|`|djQ6UyzIaa	It may seem random to you, but there probably is a reason. If you are concerned take them to a vet but I highly doubt there is anything wrong with them.|`|lg8gqyWVaa	my hamster used to do that too, it was alone so it wasnt hurt. i don't know why they do it but its cute!|`|eZtw683maa	Awwww she is just making happy noises.

agwxFmITaa	Then they did not have cygnets to protect.  Had your dog gone near a cygnet it would have found itself in a bit more trouble.  It would have been chased off by a very angry Cob and Pen (swans mate for life) but that would have been quite enough.    As a child, I inadvertently went near a cygnet and the mother chased me for what seemed like miles!  She made screeching noises the whole time and I was told that she was running with her wings outstretched and was a fearful sight.  Like humans, birds protect their young ones.|`|eu6UQElYaa	ok.  Personally I've never seen a vicious swan.  Geese on the other hand....|`|9kTejB0uaa	Swans can and do injure people, and dogs, especially when protecting young.

mvrygTYTaa	"A division of reptiles, called chelonians, includes turtles, tortoises, and terrapins. For the most part, the difference between a turtle and tortoise is more of a rough semantic category than a strict taxonomic separation. Colloquially, both biologists and lay people use the word, "turtle" to mean all chelonians. In general, turtles live in or near the water and have adapted to swim by holding their breath underwater. Tortoises live primarily in arid regions, built for storing their own water supply and walking on sandy ground.<br>  <br>  In a biological respect, a tortoise is a kind of a turtle, but not all turtles are tortoises. Tortoises occupy their own taxonomic family, called testudinidae. All types of land and aquatic turtles come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and shapes. Sometimes the name "terrapin" refers to those animals that fall somewhere between a turtle and tortoise, because they live in swampy areas or begin life underwater and eventually move to dry land.<br>  <br>  Turtles may live in freshwater, the ocean, or brackish ponds and marshland. Their front feet might be fins or merely webbed toes with streamlined back feet to help them swim. Turtles have flatter backs than tortoises, and may spend all or part of their lives underwater. They mate and lay eggs underwater or on the shore. Some turtles sun themselves on logs, rocks, or sandy banks. During cold weather, they burrow in mud and go into torpor, a state similar to hibernation. Sea turtles migrate great distances. They are more often omnivorous, eating plants, insects, and fish.<br>  <br>  Tortoises live entirely above water, only wading into streams to clean themselves or to drink. In fact, they could drown in deep or swift current. Their feet are hard, scaly, and nubby so it can crawl across sharp rocks and sand. Tortoises often have claws to dig burrows, which they occupy during hot, sunny weather or during sleep. Tortoises are mostly herbivorous, eating cactus, shrubs, and other plants that have a lot of moisture. They rarely migrate. Their shell forms a rounded dome, allowing the tortoise's limbs and head to withdraw for protection."|`|g4lgt3Yvaa	Basically turtles are aquatic, though most of them can travel (aside from sea turtles) over land to find knew breeding and feeding habitats.<br>  <br>  Tortoises are all land dwellers but some species like to soak in shallow water and some can swim.<br>  <br>  There are some turtles that are aquatic/terrestrial species, such as the box turtle and the wood turtle which can swim very well but are more at home on land. They both are great swimmers; some box turtles are primarily aquatic, such as with many Asian box turtles. Unlike tortoises that can swim with bouyancy (like waddling across rivers and such), they can actually dive underwater. <br>  <br>  You didn't mention it, but there are also terrapins, which are aquatic brackish water chelonians.<br>  <br>  All turtles, tortoises, and terrapins do need land to lay eggs. For sea turtles, this is the only time they ever come on land. Male sea turtles never come onto land.<br>  <br>  Turtles (photos)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/world_of_turtles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/world_o...</a><br>  <br>  Tortoises and box turtles (photos)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/world_of_turtles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/world_o...</a><br>  <br>  Oh, and the tortoise can beat a rabbit in a race.

These stupid Animal Right people are taking our rights away, we should be able to own whatever animal we want as long as we treat the animal fair and give them proper care. In my opinion, monkeys make excellent companions. You can take my word because I have actually had personal experience with monkeys. I have 2 pet Capuchins, 2 Squirrel Monkeys, and a Spider Monkey. They are all darling and I would never give them up for anything. <br>  <br>  Everyone who says primates do not make good pets have apparently never owned one before.<br>  <br>  (And that Chimp only attacked because it was given Zanax which has the adverse effect on animals)|`|eu6UQElYaa	Nope|`|u1HahCoqaa	Even if you could, why would you want to?

aeonmRR2aa	First - if you want just a SINGLE quick answer, then do a 30% water change, wash your filter in the discarded aquarium water, then treat with anti-parasite medicine like Jungle Anti-Parasite Tabs.  Otherwise, read the rest of this.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what that means.  Rubbing ("Flashing") indicates the presence of external parasites or flukes.  Finrot, however, is usually bacterial but could be due to rubbing on sharp things.  If you treat, I would recommend doing the whole tank since it could have infected other fish.  It may be necessary to treat for finrot while or after treating for parasites.  In that case you may wish to use a different medicine or medicine combo.<br>  <br>  In addition to or instead of a broad-spectrum anti-parasite medicine, you can also do a salt dip - 10 to 30 minutes in 100% strength seawater (marine salt is best IMO, but aquarium salt or rock salt is also OK - ratio is 1/2 cup salt to 1 gallon water) then back into the tank - you have to watch carefully and remove him on first sign of distress (like turning over), and the water should be the same temperature as the aquarium, and there should be a bubbler in the water (I use a bucket).  If the fish is weak, just do 15 minutes max.  This will remove most external parasites.  Or salt therapy - add 1 tsp of salt per gallon, per day, until you reach 3 tsp per gallon.  Don't use medication with salt therapy - use one or the other.  You can only use medication with a salt dip.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try reading these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goldfishinfo.com/medicate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldfishinfo.com/medicate.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.goldfishinfo.com/ailment1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldfishinfo.com/ailment1.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishyfarmacy.com/symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishyfarmacy.com/symptoms.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly, be sure to take all sharp things out of the aquarium (sand them to be rounded if you want to put them back).  Test the water chemistry, be sure nitrates are below, say, 40 ppm, or else do a big water change (up to 50%).  If the gravel is sharp, replace it with rounded gravel.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dJs2s9pfaa	This is so very common. It's called Septicemia, which is a symptom from having prolonged Ammonia poisioning. The best thing you can do is do an immediate 50% water change as this ammonia is burning the fishes skin. Then go get some Lifeguard by Jungle Labs. It's a medication that is about $5. <br>  <br>  Once you've done your water change and administered meds just start doing a weekly water change of 40%. This water change only applies to goldfish because as you can clearly see they produce ridiculous amounts on ammonia unless water changes are done religiously.<br>  <br>  Here's a link:<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/blues/fish_problems/HEMORHAGICSEPTICEMIA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/blues/fish_prob...</a>|`|AA12212224	Parasites should be visible if he has them. It would probably be a good idea to separate him from the others to keep the problem from spreading and for treatment.<br>  <br>  From what I've seen in my experience there are two types I can classify; flat, green manta ray looking parasites, and thin, whitish, worm like parasites. I think it's a case of the latter. See:<br>  <a href="http://allabout-aquariumfish.blogspot.com/2008/11/aquarium-fish-disease-fish-lice-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://allabout-aquariumfish.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <br>  My dad always put the goldfish on a wet hand towel, and picked off the parasite with some plastic tweezers, and plop them back into the tank.

iVQULHqYaa	It could be stress, I'm not sure. Nevertheless he will be frustrated if the puppy is annoying him.<br>  Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs don’t want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.<br>  <br>  Please don’t expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Don’t expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly. <br>  <br>  Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dog’s rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.<br>  <br>  There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.<br>  <br>  Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They don’t want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.|`|2O58btqxaa	take it to the vets|`|NAEO3c7Laa	1st we need more info other then foaming from the mouth..<br>  are there any frogs about? usually if a dog or cat has contact with a frog it will foam form the mouth.<br>  This type of foaming at mouth is quite common and is normally a result of the dog's state of mind rather than what they are playing with. Some dogs show this phenomenon when excited, scared, or stressed. Others show it as a sign of heat stroke form lots of running around. In most cases it disappears when the strong inducing element stops and is nothing to be concerned about.

All the ones I've ever worked with or owned have squealed, head-butted and shook when I've ruffled their fur or stroked them...I think you'll find she wants you to mate her (sorry if sounds sick) and enjoys it when you stroke her like that.<br>  <br>  But, if it's something she's never done before then seek advise from your vet. x|`|CPxmHjx4aa	no thats normal for a guinea pig to b vocal when they are stroked..<br>  guinea pigs are vocal and therefore you can expect that alot..|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Yes it is normal. I would like to invite you to join our guinea pig forum. <br>  <br>  We are a guinea pig website forum, named, "CAVY GALORE". We are a rescue friendly webiste, that does not believe in breeding guinea pigs. <br>  <br>  Our members are friendly, young adults, older adults, men, and also women. <br>  <br>  We share stories, & photos of our guinea pigs. We share support, & advice based on our experiences with guinea pigs. <br>  <br>  We have contests, games, a live chat room, and we also discuss other pets as well. <br>  <br>  We are ABSOLUTELY FREE to join, just tell them "PUT YOUR OWN NAME HERE-- LILY" invited you. <br>  <br>  Feel free to come, and have a look around.

But, don`t continue doing it because, they will get stressed out at you! Hope I helped!|`|TWm5Smlaaa	animals don't like to be rubbed that way at all. If she move around fine, I don't see why she would have a back injury. just don't pet her that way lol|`|BcJpPMPFaa	she obviously DOESNT like it when you do that.<br>  Like when a dog squeals when you step on its foot or pick its paw up.<br>  <br>  Imagine if someone ran their fingers through your hair from the back of your head to the front. You wouldn't like that either, would you?|`|KQCZcSnQaa	That is totally normal!!!!!!! They are very very vocal. It might also means she likes it! Dont worry she is fine!|`|VBQowcKqaa	most animals dont like there furr to be rubbed that way. She probly doesnt like  it and it making noises because it hurts
id3yBPGfaa	maybe he just got done eating his pooh ya know that thing that they do at night so that there stomach works ok ... sorry I don't remember what they call it but it's a liquid type instead of the hard ones
NAEO3c7Laa	yes it sure does i could sit here and rave on but ill just give u a link that shows u how to cut claws it mite help u a little bit better then explaining it least with pictures u can get more of a fair idea on exactly where to cut. don't be so nervous its just like sitting your own nails in a way and think of it as a bonding between u both lol.<br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ClientED/dog_nails.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ClientED/dog_n...</a>|`|2Z4G7aXZaa	They do, and you can make them bleed if you cut too far. You should go to a vet or grooming salon and they can show you haw to do it.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Yes. You could always just file them down if you are nervous about clipping to low and getting into the quick. Might take a little longer but you're less likely to cause injury that way.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Do you mean,"Are nails nails?" YES.<br>  Do you do your own manicures? Then why are you "nervous" about dog nails?|`|9kTejB0uaa	Yes.  And they bleed just the same too if you catch the quick. But they do need attention because if left, they can curl right round into the paw - nasty!<br>  <br>  Be brave!!
0nIwKd5Uaa	1) can't stop your dog from getting dirty, but they do have waterless bath stuff for dogs. If it's cold out where your at. If it is warm out where you are at call a groomer and see how often you could give your dog a bath safely.<br>  <br>  2) If your parents allow it take the dog to obedience class. Or start working with her on commands. Sit, Stay, Come, etc etc<br>  <br>  3) Play ball, fetch, etc<br>  <br>  you dog is hyper because she can't go outside, which is a load of crap that you say the vet said she cannot. The vet should have told you to put a flea and tick preventative on her. Your dog is exercised and most likely bored out of her mind.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Without being harsh, i personally totally disagree with you having a dog at all if you won't let it outside. You need to think about re homing it and let the dog have a home with someone who WILL let it out. Its ridiculous to say the dog can't go out because of ticks.. why don't you use frontline to prevent ticks and fleas, and get a comb, you can comb the dog after going outside. I think you are being mean and cruel, its not natural for a dog to noe go out. No wonder she has behavioural problems. Dogs do NOT go to Dr's anyway, they should see a VET.|`|e0k3oyavaa	For your first question, there has to be some kind of shampoo to wash your dog with that itll last awhile so she can smell good, also ive seen like these odor killing spray for dogs at petsmart. Second question...you can just play with her inside your house like run around with her or play fetch or something, give her affection and that kinda goes for the third one too, just care for her. And dogs need to go outside...especially to go to the bathroom, strech and walk around (excersize). Just keep her away from other dogs that may have ticks, fleas etc. I definitley know that there are these products at pet stores that help with ticks & fleas, also to prevent them. Good Luck!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	I would have a chat again with your vet.  Dogs need to go outside and get exercise.<br>  <br>  We live in an area with lots of ticks, deer, raccoons, skunks, etc and ours go out.<br>  <br>  They all have their shots which include for Lyme's disease as well as Lepto (of course rabbies and distempter).<br>  <br>  Along with this we keep them on Frontline all year around since as soon as the weather gets above freezing, they bloom.<br>  <br>  .  There are safe treatments that can be used (e. g., a 50-foot radius around the dog house or the backyard).  In addition, treatments you apply once a month to small areas of the dog's skin (we use Frontline Plus) which spreads over the dog's body by the oil on its skin and kills ticks before they get a chance to inject the bacteria into the dog via the tick's saliva. There are sprays, shampoos, collars, powders and dips are often used too (in these products the chemical ingredient permethrin is more effective than pyrethrin).  Sprays, collars and dips repel and kill ticks somewhat but people feel that the tick collars containing the product Amitraz work.<br>  <br>  There are many options for your puppy.  I am not saying keep her out 24/7 but a breath of fresh air is good for all of us ;)
ZZWiUGr4aa	It's submissive urination. It eventually gets better with time. Wait until he is absolutely calm before you take him out of the crate. I ask my puppy to sit and stay before I take her out. Also, evaluate your own body language. Direct, steady eye contact and standing over him maybe a few things you're doing without even realizing it. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  how long have you had him?|`|CEgq26oHaa	Either you are leaving him in the crate too long, or he is just excited to see you.  Dogs can do this when they are overly excited or scared.  Have a leash ready by the crate and take him outside immediately after letting him out.  When he uses the bathroom outside reward him with a treat for his good behavior.  This way he will associate going outside to use the bathroom with getting something good afterwards.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Well,quit fumbling around w/the collar! Have a "KENNEL LEAD" (stiff-ish SLIP-KNOT)open in your hand as it zooms out! It'll run right into it & RUN out the door. Don't you have a yard? A pen?<br>  <br>  & ....Submissive pissing must be IGNORED-no correction,no reaction at all,no eye-contact .|`|fFtBqFB6aa	take the crate outside before you let your dog out of it|`|IVRyh0Xeaa	You can start by putting newspaper few distance from his crate before releasing him. Point to the newspaper. If he pees on the newspaper, reward him. If not, put him back into the crate. Gradually bring the newspaper further away as he improves. In no time, he will be potty trained! check out <a href="http://www.dogexpertreveal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogexpertreveal.com</a> for more useful and easy to learn dog training videos!|`|XdpBUUZyaa	Well firstly let him know he has done wrong pick him up straight away and take him straight out to the graden so he doesnt get a chance to pee every where, or put his lead on him when his in the crate then pick him up and put him down untill u get outside. give him a pen where u can quickly take him down there and u can carry him out ?!|`|RiW4tSx6aa	yea get a kennel lead they are very easy and if u got him from the pound he is probably excited to see u sence u adapted him|`|iVQULHqYaa	Perhaps you are leaving her (or is it a him) in the crate too long. Have a look and  check up on the sex of your dog. Often b1tches who are spayed develop a bladder problem, however if he or she is left in a crate for a long time try to remedy this. Take it for a long walk before you leave it, come home at lunchtime and get someone to take it out for walks whilst you are gone.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Sounds like you are leaving him/her? in there too long!!  That's one consideration.  Move the crate closer to the external door?  Carry him/her from the crate to outside or walk faster - and get a slip lead on so you don't need to be buckling a collar/attaching a lead to him/her<br>  <br>  Hope some of this works!!
pK7saLw4aa	get rats, they are sweet intellegent and they live a long time, don't get hamsters|`|jW6E3ffHaa	A Syrian or golden hamster|`|4rJYZ4JYaa	best pet to get are mice easy to look after i have female and female together|`|DFWvjolMaa	I have a Syrian hamster and they are well known for being good for first time owners, they are also known for being the easier of the breeds to handle and more docile than their dwarf cousins.<br>  <br>  As far as I understand, mice are very friendly. However, the major reason I would avoid them is because they do have a tendency to smell more than other rodents.<br>  <br>  Rats are known to be good "cuddle" pets and are very social. So yes, you will have to keep more than one. However, if you get a male/female pair then you will obviously have more than 2 on your hands! As with most of these, try to keep to same sex pairs.<br>  <br>  You haven't mentioned gerbils! I personally like keeping gerbils most of all. They are gentle, known for the fact that they don't bite often (even when they really want to!), very social and generally quite cute. The great thing about the gerbil is that you don't have to do much to keep them clean. You can change the bedding every 2-4 weeks. However, they will need a tank of about 15 gallons or more. There are always plenty of gerbils in rescue centres looking for homes.  <a href="http://www.egerbil.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.egerbil.com/</a> This site will help you find more out about them and at your own pace. Be sure to visit the forum, they're always a great help on there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your adoption, I recently took on 3 male gerbils and it breaks my heart that I can't do more for the rescue centres around here. Too many kids getting bored with their pets! I have my eye on a house rabbit at the moment, but I'm not sure my landlord would approve. ;)|`|kAdMmjZtaa	i would get a mouse or a hamster. just because they r small anr cute. but maybe, not to sound rude, but look 4 info on small rodent before u get them to see if there good for u. ps. some can be more tempermatle so choose wisly. hope i helped.|`|TOGgD7XAaa	rats, they have such a big personality adn when you look them in the ees..

They are clean (females) and get along if you get a pair.|`|UAqGhehaaa	Rats are most definitely the best pet you can get. Personally, I don't find hamsters and mice very affectionate, while my rats squabble over who gets petted first! Hamsters have to always be solitary, unless they are two females, and the same goes for mice. <br>  Rats are hardy, intelligent, affectionate and each one has their own personality! Currently, I own three: a neutered male (Simba), he is a rebellious little guy, always shooting you dirty looks, but then coming up to beg for some soy milk. (they adore soy milk, especially peach) Sue is my timid little girl, she hides often, but if you can get to her good side she'll love you forever. Lastly, there is little Peppa, my energetic baby girl. All rats have personalities and so I highly recommend them.|`|b2952b6264919c4d0478fc6d9b014e95aa	I have had mice, hampsters, gerbils and rabbits, but I have had many friends that have had rats and if I were to get another rodent I would get a rat.<br>  <br>  Gerbils and hampsters tend to be biters more often then mice.  <br>  <br>  It is good to have two females just be careful that they are not already pregnant when you get them.  That happened to me.  I got two females mice and they were both pregnant and both had 10 babies each!<br>  <br>  I would get the rats if I were you.  There are sturdier, smarter and funner to play with.|`|ndhuyDwxaa	I guess hamsters are ok, if you are willing to put up with noise from running in the wheel at night and to not be able to interact with it during the day...<br>  <br>  I would definately give a big no to guinea pigs. They should not even be sold as pets, because it is in their nature to be flight animals, and they do not like to be interacted with, contrary to popular belief. My sister has guinea pigs since she was a kid, and of course first we interacted with them like regular pets. Now she's an adult and she still has them, but she has learned a lot about them and appreciates them for what they are, and they now are living in an outdoor cage with shelter in her backyard all year round, and she never takes them out - all you have to do is feed them, and all you can do I guess is watch them. <br>  <br>  Rats are definately the best when it comes to what rodent is best to have as a pet. Rats LOVE to interact with humans - the more you play with them, the more they will show their unique personalities. Rats are very smart and can be taught all kind of tricks and they love to play a lot of games. They are funny and love to show affection to their human companion. They also can learn their name pretty quick and can come when called, just like a dog. What makes them so much fun too is the fact that they love to sit in your sleeve and go with you wherever you go. <br>  Some people though can be allergic to rats, but that might be the only thing against a rat.<br>  If you do want to get a rat though, make sure you get at least a couple of them, because no matter how much time you invest interacting with you rats, a human companion can never quite replace a rat companion for them, and they are happier if they are not alone. <br>  Same sex pairs always work, they will get along fine if they grow up with each other. Females are almost never a problem, even if introduced later in life. Males can be though, if they are not neutered. You could even get a male and a female, so long as the male is neutered. Males should be at least 10 weeks old before being neutered by an experienced vet. As long as you get them as babies (they should be at least a couple months old to be properly weaned from their mother), they should get along fine. <br>  <br>  Happy Pet buying and good luck! :)|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i love dwarf hamsters just because they are so small and they look really cute. any breed can be friendly. dont listen to people when they say dwarfs are evil because ive owned loads of sweet ones. i have 2 male rats and its upto you if you want to keep males or females.<br>  <br>  go for rats, male rats are best for first time rat owners. dont be put off by their balls as they are not as big as people make them out to be. they are very smart and very affectionate|`|RNWSAItbaa	a Naked Mole Rat xD<br>  <br>  Uhmm.. maybe a Mouse or a Guinea Pig (Australian) or a Hamster.

m16gf9mzaa	Well, my spayed female had quite the following of intact males from all over the neighborhood, back when we lived outside of town in the desert, and she was a working cat.  Her tailshake brought all the toms to the yard.  The big old tomcat who ruled the area was especially taken with her, and he would bring her mice a couple times a day.  She thought he was ok, and seemed to flirt with him a bit.  But she did not get as close to him as your lady cat seems to be with her gentlecat caller.  <br>  <br>  The thing is, the tom knows she's female.  And he knows she is not currently in heat.  But he has no frame of reference for "will never ever go into heat".  So he is getting to know her, and develop a relationship with her, hoping that if/when she *does* go into heat, she will choose him to be the father of her kittens.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Because she is still a female :)  altered animals still have a mystique to the opposite sex, even tho its not anywhere close to as strong.  Its simply boy meets girl, girl has no uterus, boy thinks shes pretty keen anyway.|`|TkbaEic0aa	he found his dream gurl on her.. sex aint everything... jus keep an eye on them not to go far.. but i'm afraid aftah he'll be fixed he won't come to her any more, and he'll leave her with a broken kitty heart X(|`|7a2Ho55zaa	Maybe its the scent.My 12 year old female cat is sprayed but she still has a boyfriend.Kitty love i guess:)
HvbIE03saa	I would suggest taking her to a vet to find out. If you "found" her and haven't had her for long, a vet can give her a good once over to make sure she's healthy, whether or not she's preggers, how far along she is, and if she needs anything else.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes they do|`|gBycDD9Baa	the nipples will remain larger but once the milk dries up her breast will shrink back down to normal .|`|UdTFJuPpaa	It sounds to me as though she is pregnant. The nipples do shrink back to normal after lactation ceases and if you think this is an adolescent cat then I would guess she is pregnant for the first time. The nipples 'pink up' when the cat has been pregnant for three weeks and pregnancy lasts 9 weeks. You may not be sure when the kittens are due but just provide her with a couple of nice nest boxes in quiet places and watch out for the mammary glands swelling with milk, which will happen just before she is reay to give birth. Once you see a discharge you will know that birth will follow soon. Feed her up with plenty of rich kitten food.<br>  <br>  When the kittens come please make sure they are all neutered and vaccinated before you let them go to new homes and make sure the mum is spayed at the same time.|`|1yNoO8SWaa	After all the kittens are on normal milk and food the nipples should shrink in a couple of weeks|`|XdHPqgP7aa	i think so
O4M6BEDJaa	I agree I think you should adopt from the shelter instead there are so many good dogs there that need a home. I have 3 dogs 2 I got from the shelter which one is a fully blooded lab and the other is a mix and my oldest dog I got from an elder women who could not take care of her. There are so many breeders out there that are just in it for the money and don't really care for the animals good and you can find pure breed dogs at the shelter, search the internet for local shelters and at least look to see if you can find one there but if your still sure that you want to buy from a breeder do a lot of research and make sure your buying one from that takes care of their animals and are highly  recommended.
m32Oq4cfaa	Take her to the vet.  Rabbits hide their illnesses so usually once you see them acting sick they can go pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  How old is she?  Has she been eating and pooping normally up to this point?

SzW9GmRsaa	First of all do not ever call them dogs - they are hounds.<br>  <br>  And it's quite unlikely that you'll be anywhere near the hounds unless you commit the cardinal sin of whizzing past the master; not only is it extremely rude it's also pretty dangerous, so stay well to the back.  It might be best to put a red ribbon in if you're worried - people will give you a wide berth and be a bit more forgiving (hopefully) if you've made the effort of digging out a ribbon.<br>  <br>  With regards to boots, a good hunter shouldn't need them because it should jump with enough care as to render the boots useless, but as your horse is a novice boots might be a good plan.  Do you usually wear boots on a long hack or going XC?  If so, put them on.<br>  <br>  You're right in saying you should be plaited.  For your own turnout, a black jacket unless you're a junior or you're riding a native pony - then you can wear tweed.  The rest of your turnout is much as for showing; long boots (or short if you're under 17), beige/buff jodhs, and a velvet hat which is up to standard.  If you want, you can wear a body protector either under or over your jacket - you will not be looked down on for it.<br>  <br>  General etiquette - stay out of the way of the hunt staff.  Offer to hold gates, don't gallop past anyone at high speeds, be polite to everyone (obviously) and at the end of the day don't forget to say thank you!<br>  <br>  If there's anything specific you're not sure of, phone the hunt sec.  They're always happy to help and offer advice to make sure the day goes as smoothly as possible.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	To the idiot who answered before me: obviously, you are not familiar with hunting.  It is no longer a "blood sport" and no animals are harmed in the process.  The fox is set free at the end.  It is not cruel and it is good exercise for the horse, the rider, and the hounds.<br>  <br>  Edit 1-In the USA, where the original poster is located, it is not cruel.  The fox is not harmed in any way.  Even if the fox was harmed, I would not find it excessively cruel- if you want to protest something, go complain about the inhumane conditions in slaughter houses.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia...<br>  <br>  In America, fox hunting is also called 'fox chasing,' as the purpose is not to actually kill the animal but to enjoy the thrill of the chase.[15] A hunt may go without a kill for several years, despite chasing two or more foxes in a single day's hunting.[32] As a rule, foxes are not pursued once they have 'gone to ground.' American fox hunters undertake stewardship of the land, and endeavour to maintain fox populations and habitats as much as possible.[32]<br>  <br>  Edit 2-<br>  Foxhunting is completely different in the United States.  The fox is uninjured and the horses are also unhurt.  I don't know anything about European fox hunting, but that's not what this topic is about, it's about the American version, which is not cruel from what I've experienced.|`|8cikAYp3aa	Been hunting since I was small. My mom was master of the hounds at a hunt in Harford county Maryland.   I assume your comming as a guest to the hunt, so you might ask the person who invited you on specific rules.<br>  <br>  But here are some tips.<br>  <br>  For your turn out: Black dress boots are traditional.  Most hunt clubs accept black field boots.  Beige or canary breeches are traditional. Again, as a guest, any conservative color should be alright.  A white ratcatcher and stock (hunting tie) should be worn.  The stock is secured with a plain gold safety pin, worn horizontally and pinning the tie to the shirt.  You may need additional safety pins to secure the ends. If you're not sure how to tie your stock, ask anyone for help.  <br>  Traditionally, one would wear a plain black hunt coat with single vent in back, sometimes referred to as a Melton.  These coats are a lot longer than a show coat and usually of heavy wool.  Most hunt clubs will be understanding and allow guests to wear show coats.   A vest should also be worn -- canary is almost universally correct -- but if the coat fits fairly well, no one will know if the vest is missing.<br>  Hat -Most hunt clubs require a plain black safety helmet or hunt cap.  <br>  <br>  for your horse :The key is a workmanlike appearance.  Keep it simple and plain and make sure everything is clean.  Any standard English bridle is accepted.  You need to use whatever bit gives you control, within reason. A breastplate is a good idea and ought to be required in hilly territory. Almost any standard English saddle is fine.  Saddle pads should be white and should be shaped to fit the saddle.<br>  <br>  If your horse really needs to wear protective boots, they should be black or brown. No pink or colors  they just look sloppy.  And dont buy them just because your hunting.  Rocks and things inside the boot can cause bad rubs, sores and bruises.  So if he doen't normally use them, then don't.<br>  Braid his main and tail, and yes a red ribbon is a good idea for a first hunt just because you dont know exactly how he will react.<br>  <br>  General-<br>  dont call the hounds "Dogs"  some people will freak,  when they are barking they are "speaking"  when chaseing a fox and baying, they are "crying" and if all are doing it then its "full cry"<br>  <br>  Some simple rules :  Don't crowd the Huntsman, Master or Hunt master.  The Main members of a hunt will wear "Pinks" , red coats which makes them easier to see,  try your best to stay out of their way.  Do your best to stay well behind the hounds, it can be hard when a excited horse is caught up in the run.<br>  <br>  Ask if there will be "hill toppers"  people who do not wish to ride with the hunt but will go from jump to jump to view.  If there are and your horse gets out of hand you can go with them to follow along but not be in the main mix of things.<br>  Tell people your NEW,  this is your first time and you'll find there will be people willing to take you under wing and help you thru your first hunt or 5.  Its exciting and fun.  enjoy|`|vwC7klVVaa	If you love animals why would you want to go on a hunt. Only a few weeks ago a local hunt never us killed a much loved family pet cat. And this is not the first time peoples much loved pets have been killed by hunt dog.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	fox hunting is banned in england,it should be banned everywhere,its a very cruel thing to do.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	You don't say where you are hunting, or what kind of ground you will be going through.<br>  <br>  Here in Galway, we have a LOT of walls, so many people use knee boots, and some use over reach and tendon boots(mainly to protect the front of the horse's legs when going over walls). Even the very best jumpers will often hit walls, because it's pretty common to be jumping out of a foot of mud and landing in stones.  It's pretty common to need to jump wire as well, and the boots reduce the chance of wire cuts.<br>  <br>  The problem with boots is that they often get very muddy and wet, and won't stay in place.  You need to make sure you are getting boots that are likely to stay on.<br>  <br>  Since it's your first hunt and you aren't sure what she will do, do stay back in the field, away from the hounds. and putting a red ribbon in her tail, just to reduce the chances of people barrelling up on you, is a good idea.  <br>  <br>  Generally the biggest problem is, the horses get used to following the field. When the field starts to move, ALL the horses want to go, and it can be difficult to hold them back. some horses that are normally wonderful, turn into raving lunatics when they get into the herd mentality. Your horse may be just fine, but don't be surprised if she gets REALLY strong.  It's common.<br>  <br>  There can be a whole lot of hurry up and wait in hunting. You may get a good gallop for a mile or two, then you may stand for an hour or more waiting for the hounds to find an interesting line.  It's not a bad idea to keep a little bottle of water and a candy bar for yourself if you plan on going out all day, and obviously, you want a fit horse.|`|u1HahCoqaa	- Make sure she is clean, but usually you do not have to braid. <br>  - Wear whichever boots you think you need.<br>  - Put a red and a green ribbon on. She is new to hunting, hence the green.<br>  - They are NOT dogs. They are HOUNDS. And yes, hunt people are picky about that. Anyways, you should be riding in second feild, or the equivalent, so you shouldn't have to worry. <br>  - Speaking of fields, ride in the back of whichever one you are told to go to, unless told otherwise.<br>  -Do not pass the people in front of you without asking permission. If you must, circle your horse. <br>  - Do not chat unessacarily, except at the "checks". (A break inbetween lines)<br>  - Call someone, or email them, and see what attire they want you to come in. <br>  -You might want to put a slightly stonger bit in before you go.<br>  - If people stick their arm out, just like stick it out (Usualy bent at a right angle) they are signalling a stop.<br>  - If you hear people saying "were hole" Or log, or whatver, that means that they saw something on the ground that you should be aware of, and avoid.<br>  -"were-staff/hound" will usually be said with "On left" or "On right". You should turn your horse to face the passing individual, although alot of the time people will not do this for hounds, keep an eye out and if people start turning, do the same. <br>  - You should find out if this is a live hunt or a drag hunt. A live hunt is what it says- they are hunting a real fox, or sometimes coyote. These tend to be much faster, over varied terrain, harder, than a drag hunt. A drag hunt is where they drag a sock or something soaked in some substance (Usually fox urine) along a path, then the hounds follow this. In these hunts they can stay on paths, and they tend to be more like glorified trailrides. Most hunts nowadays tend to be drag hunts, especially in the US. (Although some places do hunt coyotes)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ushorse.biz/breeds-foxhunting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ushorse.biz/breeds-foxhunting...</a>|`|Oc3dmkiraa	hey,<br>     first time hunting on a thourobred!! Make sure you have breaks i wouldnt want you to get galloped off with and hate hunting because it is 'scary' or what ever. make sure you have a great time so that you come back!!! All of our horses have to go at least once a week or they get really depressed and unhappy, they love it (there showjumpers)<br>    And it depends on what hunt your going with, most dont demand on being plated but for your first time a good turn out would make a nice impression!<br>    If you usually wear boots when you ride her or jump her then it is probably a good idea to. I have had a few injuries on my horses and over reach and after jumping a hedge something went in to the back of one of my mares tendon sheath, very unlikely accidents but now i wear boots. It is personal preference. i hunt with the cattistock and hardly any one wears them. <br>    As for kicking the dogs just keep and eye out for hounds. the first and most important thing i was told was to alwas turn my horses head to a hound, this should be ok if your not stuck in a small place. If you mare doesnt kick other horses then there should be no reason to put a red ribbon on her. you could but a green one on her just to make people away she is new to it and to be carefull behind you. if she starts to panic through small places and kicks out and you dont have a red ribbon on you can just put your hand behind your back :D<br>  <br>    i dont think there is much to worry about. the best thing to do is ring somebody who hunts regulaly and ask if you can stay with them and they will help you. The thought is a lot scaryier then really doing it!<br>  <br>   i'm 16 and i'm fine out hunting, i've hunted pointers, hunter, showjumpers and 4 year olds just keep out the way when they start to mess around and enjoy your self!!!<br>  <br>   and to the people who are anti hunt.... really you need to see what really goes on its not as bad as the press say it is. i think you need to go to a real hunt as it is now they need to be supported as well as a drag hun and you need to make a decision by yourself and not get prsuaded by either party (anti/for huntin).|`|YHpePjb9aa	Manners/rules:<br>  All basic rules apply when out hunting, such as saying good morning to hunt staff on arrival and good evening aswell as thanking the masters at the end of the day! If you are not riding with someone who is an avid hunter and well known to the masters then makesure you introduce yourself (especially seeing as some hunts count the riders so that they know if theyve lost anyone at the end of each 'chase'.) .    If you are on jumping country then makesure that you wait your turn before jumping and don't follow to close to the horse in front. Try not to overtake the masters ( i am always forgiven by the master as i tend to ride some crazy youngsters that will stop for no one!). Also if you are away from the main ride and you see a red coat or master coming towards you then give way and open (hold open) and offer to shut a gate for them! Also offer to get off at difficult gateways to open gates for people to save the 'oldies'. If you see someone who is on their own and having some trouble then offer to wait with them untill theyre horse has settled down...... its basically showing respect to all. <br>  <br>  Turnout: (horse)<br>   Makesure you plait your horses mane and tail (if it is not pulled) which you may also wish to roll up into a ball. You should have clean tack and a nice thick numnah so that you do not rub your horses back. A breatplate may also help as it will stop your saddle slipping back etc. You may want to put studs in depending on your horse and the terrain. Depending on the country you may want to use boots (competition boots offer the best support) or a old pair of brushing boots etc but makesure you wrap around them with tape to hold them secure as i have lost many boots going through mud! IF your horse is a know kicker then put a red ribbon in his tail.... otherwise i would put a green ribbon on his tail so that people know that the horse is a novice in the hunt field. If he starts to get a bit silly because people are riding too close behind you then take your left arm behind your back and face the palm of your hand away from you (this shows other riders to keep back). Try and use plain leather tack if possible as this is correct attire, ie no bright pink saddle pad! <br>  <br>  Rider turnout:<br>  Either a tweed hacking jacket or black jacket if it is not raining. If it is raining then you may want to wear a waterproof coat (black, brown, green, dark blue; nothing too bright) and waterproof trousers. Plain or checked shirt with tie or stock. White or beige jodhs and long boots or chaps... and spurs if needed. Hat, gloves, whip and body protector if needed. Your hair should be tied back or put in a hairnet. <br>  <br>  Try and ride with someone as this will make your life so much easier! Watch out for rabbit/badger holes, ditches etc. Keep an eye out for the field (riders) just incase they come galloping up on the otherside of the hedge and scare your horse. Do not gallop through farmers fields unless you know you can do so (you may need to ride around the edges of some fields). Put back all fencing that you may need to take down! And most of all...... HAVE FUN! don't forget your phone.... you may also want to put a drink and something to eat in your pocket as it can be a long day! Put a haynet in the trailer for your horse and have a sweat rug/cooler for him to wear on the way home. Good luck x

Shar Pei would explain his rolls and purple tongue. Ears and face look Akita to me, but then again he could easily be a shepherd breed like a GSD or a Belgian Malinois. <br>  <br>  I'm going to say Shar Pei/Belgian Malinois mix. The Shar Pei would explain the purple tongue and the rolls plus skin color, and the Belgian Malinois would explain the small feet, ears, and the face.

But I *believe* (at least I'm pretty sure) only Chows and a few other Asian breeds like the Shar pei have solid deep purple tongues. <br>  <br>  To me, based on body shape, he looks like he could be part Shar Pei. Maybe Shar Pei/ Pit Bull?<br>  <br>  *Edit* After taking a second look I think I'm going to retract my first guess and say Shar Pei/ Akita based on the prick ears and something about his face is very Akita to me...|`|AM7CgQ4daa	his body and tail shape are very shar pei,  but the ears don't belong to either a pit or shar-pei.

KvUJZa1Paa	Firstly 4 and 6 are way to young to be given pets and told they must take care of them. secondly just because a child is sick she shouldn't be handed everything she wants or crays for. thirdly two spoiled kids what you give to one you give to other one soon there is a house full of cats,dogs,mice, birds, fish and so forth. put children in separate rooms and let them scream it out<br>  <br>  I have a 23 month old grandson that has had 2 brain surgeries and his parents don't cater to him and spoil him, they are kids let them be kids and tell the NO once in a while|`|zCHnMeXbaa	Absolutely, pet dogs almost always give unconditional love to someone that take care of and plays with them.|`|Yepl4Kucaa	Get a pet that is only for her, she has full control over it, meaning if she doesn't want the other child to go near it, she gets her way.

c15rWijuaa	Yes he's probably teething, it's about the time when he will be getting his first adult teeth. HOWEVER, that lunging and aggressive behavior has nothing to do with his teething. Since you say he is only biting you, he is actually saying I outrank you. I don't have to obey you. It has to stop now. If you let it continue, he will become unmanageable and you will end up having take him to the pound (not something I'd like to see, specially when it can easily be altered at this age).<br>  <br>  First, go to the pet store you bought his bowl at and buy an identical one. This you will use to establish yourself as his leader. Before it's time to eat, poor some cereal into the brand new bowl and stand in front of him and eat it. It sounds mean, but he'll get his food soon enough. Once you have finished get his already made up bowl (put the food into before the exercise) and before he can eat his food he must sit and wait until you say "OK". When you do this get him into a sit and tell him "Stay". If when you go to put the food on the floor (which if he has no idea what "stay" is, he'll break it) pick it up and repeat (even if you have to do it for ten - twenty minutes until he is waiting for you to let him eat. Once hes staying, tell him "OK" and motion to the bowl. Higher ranks always eat first, so seeing you eat out of what he thinks is his bowl raises your status in his eyes. Try to do this at every meal until his aggression stops and he's respecting your space. <br>  <br>  As an added exercise, when he jumps up on you and uses his teeth and doesn't first respond to the "No" or "Off command. Calmly, yet authoritatively, with no more than the force needed, grab the side of his neck in a biting fashion (if you have ever watched the dog whisperer it looks like that) and roll him over on to his sides. If he's really trying to dominate you he will struggle and resist you but it's important not to stop in the middle. You must follow through. Keep him in the position until he relaxes, then let him up and play with him.<br>  <br>  It simulating an older pack member disciplining a misbehaving member (usually pups). It's another good way to teach him to respect your warnings of misbehavior. Keep in mind, he could bite you, just don't stop the exercise if he does. He'll learn that that is what keeps him in his higher position. As a plus though, it won't hurt quite as bad as an adults. <br>  <br>  Also continue with obedience training and taking him for walks, not only to you have to establish yourself, you also need to let him know that you are a beloved pack leader and not a tyrant. So make sure to form a strong bond with him.|`|jUAveZ7maa	Take him to your vet to get checked over, he may be in pain and he cant express this other than through aggression. Then get hold of a local dog trainer (ask your vet for his recommendation).<br>  <br>  The biting and growling is usually him trying to assert himself in the family pack, dont hit him but use a terse NO when he starts and praise him when he is good. Dogs need boundaries to be happy and you must ensure that yourself and ALL your family are seen by your dog as above him in the pecking order. A dominant dog will continue to reach for the top dog position unless he is put firmly in his place everytime he is agressive. He is not a child do not treat him as such otherwise you will always have problems.|`|vvP7njBgaa	my chiuawawa did this.<br>  i whacked him hard with newspaper.<br>  it didnt hurt him. but ever scinse he has never snapped yet still loves me, i strongly suggest this until he seriously harms you or your children and he will be put down|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Sounds like the little guy is teething.  Gove him lots to chew.  The aggression towards you could be because you are invading his space & he is threatened.  |`|KZy8ppIOaa	He is not teething that stage is over. He could be having trouble with his teeth maybe a chipped tooth. I would take him to a vet. My other suggestion is kind of dumb. Maybe you should praise him more and when you buy him toys YOU give them to him not someone else in the family.|`|JYIg7VDyaa	well... when a dog is teething they can get grumpy. and maybe the dog wants to spend more time with you! have some bonding tiem with your dog and see if that helps.|`|YnjScE4saa	Neglected? |`|LH54qHvJaa	he could be teething but this does not explain why he is biting or nipping. Maybe he feels threatened by you?|`|afcLu9YMaa	Buy some carrots and put them in the fridge, when they are cold give him one to chew on, they will help him with his teething, being cold it will sooth his gums and if he eats it is it good vit C.<br>  <br>  He maybe biting because he is in pain with his teeth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Additional Information:<br>  At seven months dogs already have a complete set of definitive teeth, so they have passed through their worst period of Puppy Teething. The upper incisors push out at fourteen weeks of age, when the definitive teeth are in eruption.  <br>   <br>  The lower incisors change some weeks later, and also the fangs (at eighteen weeks). Normally there are 28 milk teeth and 42 definit|`|SDqpUSXQaa	He is probably bored stiff and just wants to play.
58J8zchAaa	i used to give my baby hamsters the milk i drank which was whole milk and it did them fine. just make sure you put it in and stick ur hand out quickly.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you dont touch any of the baby's until they have full grown fur  because your human odor can get in their skin and the mom would kill them.
Rw7gi86Naa	Because cats are nocturnal and they want to play and get attention when we want to sleep.<br>  <br>  First realize that you cannot make a cat sleep when you do, but you can change their behavior. Many times in the morning they will meow like crazy because you get up and feed him, (hoping that will make him shut up) and go back to bed. They meow, then you get up and feed them, pet them or play--whatever you think they want. This is why they meow again later, because they know they will get a reaction from you. This is called conditioning.  So, you need to stop reacting; just ignore it.<br>  <br>  More info:<br>  Felines are nocturnal, (naturally more active at night or early morning hours).  They sleep a lot, (16 hours) mostly during the day.  When dusk or dawn sets in, their instinct tells them to hunt.  It is also the most productive time of the day to catch prey.<br>  <br>  When you compare the cats sleeping habits and human sleeping habits, it’s actually no wonder when some felines are perfectly happy to wake us up at 3 am and ask for food or for entertainment.  We probably don't appreciate it as much and it can become quite a strain when those early wake-ups happen regularly.<br>  <br>   Schedule a vigorous play session, (at least 15 minutes) before you go to sleep, then feed the cat. Several play sessions throughout the day will help also. A cat that is all worn out from playing, and has a full belly will be less likely to bother you when you're asleep. Also provide toys that your cat can amuse himself with alone. Make sure to rotate toys so he doesn’t get bored.<br>   Don't be tempted to get up and play with your cat in the middle of the night when it demands it.  If you do, he will make a habit of it and won't understand when you suddenly refuse. Remember, consistence in your behavior will be more effective in changing their behavior.<br>   Don't feed him as soon as you get up. Do your morning routine, such as make coffee, pet him and then feed him. This way he won’t think you got up only to feed him.<br>   If ignoring doesn't work, invest in an automatic feeder that opens at the requested early time, the cat will help himself and won't bother you as much, or, if you're feeding dry food, fill up the bowl just before you go to bed, so that there is still plenty left for the morning.<br>   Keep your bedroom door shut, so that your cat can't physically wake you up.<br>   If he starts meowing and scratches the door, try to ignore it and don't react, after a while your cat will figure out that meowing and pestering you doesn't help and it will retire.<br>   Be aware that any reaction of you, positive or negative, will actually encourage your cat to go on with the attention seeking behavior.<br>   Be strict!|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	Sound like he is wanting out to mate. Getting him neutered will help. Or he could just be wanting attention, but I know what you mean about the different sounds my cats do this also, the only time they do the loud meow is when they want something, food/outside.|`|wxggEPLNaa	He's most likely looking for other cats or a campanion...YOU!!!<br>  he's probably bored or sad at night when its dark and you're not around. you should take him with you at night into your room and see if he meows in there =) he won't most likely!|`|CK5OTjo9aa	He's in heat for sure..<br>  <br>  this kind of question hav been asked.<br>  check this out for more answers.|`|7qk3dFYyaa	my cat does that because he doesn't like being alone at night that might be why ur cat does it aswell|`|5Si8POvNaa	maybe he is afraid of the dark,lol|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Is there a female cat nearby in heat?

8cikAYp3aa	its called picketing.  the horse is tied to a post, line, tree by either a halter or a hobble strap around a leg.  It works fine if you have a horse used to it, and attentive owners.  Its usually not used for long term confinement.  We use it for camping,  on the front lawn for a day..there are better alternatives for long term that are cheeper and safer.  electric wire for one.<br>  <br>  It is never legal to leave any animal without food, water and proper shelter.   if your worried contact your ASPCA/animal control/RSPCA or local police|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	I don't know if tying them up is illegal but not feeding them and no water is defiantly illegal.

It's not illegal by the way, it's a very common way to contain a horse for a few minutes while the owner tacks up the horse or gets something.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	If you didn't actually see the horses tied up, how do you know they tied the rope around their necks? They could have been tied to their halters. And how long were the ropes? Some people will tie their horses up for short periods of time either because they want them to graze in a certain area or because the area is not fenced in. That is not illegal.<br>  <br>  Not feeding or watering your horses, however, IS illegal. So your other case was definitely illegal, but it sounds to me like you don't have quite enough information here to call it illegal. You say you saw the horses in the field... Were they skinny? If so, you should contact animal control or the UK equivalent.
YpEswTQdaa	I don't have a CLUE what that is,nothing about this lettuce came up on my Google search. I would personally avoid it completely. For starters,certain types of lettuce are unsafe for rabbits,those including Ice-Berg which can become toxic after time to the rabbit if fed often. It also has no nutritional value. <br>  <br>  XxX|`|id3yBPGfaa	not sure what oak wood lettuce is but usually you want to stay with the dark green varieties of veggies never give them ice burg lettuce.
oMmBhWK4aa	Just have patience as it's not an overnight thing and actually the plants that you have are undemanding ones that can still grow well without excess CO2 injected. Note that you need to correspondingly ensure your tank lighting is adequate to match the CO2 increase, otherwise you'll only end up with an algae explosion.<br>  <br>  Also ensure you are utilising as much of the CO2 as possible by using a CO2 diffuser and letting your filter outflow distribute the CO2 bubbles throughout the tank. The worst thing is to simply let large bubbles of CO2 rise unhindered straight to the surface. Try not to agitate the water surface through use of airstones or rainbars as you risk losing CO2.<br>  <br>  If you also have fishes, note that injecting CO2 makes the pH drop, which can be disastrous for your fishes. Monitor the pH reading and add stuff like coral chips if necessary to raise pH slightly. One disadvantage of DIY CO2 is you can't stop the supply and there's the potential risk of too much CO2 accumulating at night (plants only use CO2 when there's light), if your fishes are gasping for air at night you can use an auto timer to operate an air pump & airstone during night time.

8lov7Zq3aa	Se orina de los nervios y excitación. El perrito que tenían mis padres hace a?os hacía lo mismo, y al principio pensaron que se le pasaría cuando dejase de ser un cachorro pero no. Siguió haciendolo. Lo único que éste lo hacía siempre que entraban alguno de sus due?os. Pensabamos que era porque se ponía tan contento, que se orinaba.. luego contactamos con un etologo que nos dijo que lo hacía porque se ponía tan tan nervioso cuando llegaban que no podía evitarlo. Asique nos recomendó empezar a tranquilizarlo antes de abrir la puerta. <br>  Me imagino que en tu caso pasará algo parecido que pasaba en mi casa.. cuando llamaba al portero mi padre, siempre empezaba a decir mi madre: "Que pasa? viene el amito? viene el amo?" y acariciandolo y diciendole cosas y así se ponía muuuucho más nervioso. No lo hagas. Intenta calmarla pero no con caricias (recuerda que para los perros las caricias son premios y si le acaricias estando nerviosa, estás premiando que esté nerviosa), sino controlandola y echandole al suelo para que se calme. Solo cuando esté relajada abre la puerta.<br>  Poco a poco aprenderá a estarse tranquila cuando alguien vaya a venir. Asique como siempre con perros: paciencia y perseverancia<br>  Yo me imagino que será eso.. por dominancia dudo mucho que sea porque los perros marcan el lugar con la orina, pero no a otros seres. A otros seres los dominan montandolos.

sMVKFBk9aa	I would guess it would be the companionship they offer.  but they require alot of work on your part.  they must have a large cage.  They must be fed and given clean water regularly.  feeding should include alot of fresh fruits and veggies.  they need a place to bathe or given a shower.  They are very destructive chewers so they must have lots of wood to chew on and a play gym area.  but... they can be loveable pets.|`|AKPaQCsCaa	Not many people have one? <br>  Good convo starter? <br>  <br>  hmm don't really no :/
eJIucizyaa	I  think that you should think long and hard before getting an amazon. They can be very vocal and I can see problems if you live in an apartment.<br>  I got my orange wing when he was four months old and he is now ten years old. he was trained by my wife but he bonded with me. He knows about 100+ words but he will not talk when other people are present in the room.<br>  I would not recommend getting a parrot that someone else has had,they are getting rid of him for a reason,he might grieve,pull all his feathers out,or he might not like the place where you put his cage.<br>  Someone has been around our parrot everyday of his life and he has been out of his cage everyday.The only time he is in his cage is if we go out or he is asleep.<br>  Get one that has been hand fed and been around people and still young you will enjoy him alot more.<br>  Good LUCK|`|ImWeozYmaa	Hi, with time and patience most any parrot can be tamed (note: the term tame can be misleading, any parrot can and most likely will bite if scared or startled. They bite the closest thing to them, not what scared them. Don't be in a big hurry to make it friendly to you, never holler or panic even if they bite, use calm but stern voice. Parrots have long memories and don't forgive easily. Share all feeding and water changing with anyone in the household to help prevent bonding to one person. A bonded parrot can be extremely jealous and can be quite protective. Kelly
b5ecvoTnaa	well, it seems that you'll take care of things price-wise. Also, make sure you save up an extra hundred or so to get supplies. yeah, things are really expensive these days. And let me tell you, you can NOT have enough chew toys and raw hides. Also, find a breed that is right for you. If you guys have health problems, look for a hypoallergenic dog. If you don't have a lot of time to brush or take care him, look for a dog that doesn't shed or who requires minimal  amount of exercise. If your parents really aren't into dogs, then try getting a small toy sized. I'm not a big fan myself, but it's better than nothing.|`|Idyil08uaa	just tell your parents you are being responsible for saving up some money but later in life u will have to buy dog food take him to the vet a lot of other stuff|`|9ZHJCSnTaa	You would just need to really think these things through and get a plan together before talking to your parents!! When i got my puppy I got a big wake up call too! I dont know how old you are now but you would need a job first. The vet bills are kind of expensive for the first few months if you get a puppy. Unless you get an older dog who has already had all their shots but there are still boosters and other health problems that come up. Also, if you get a puppy you will have to remember stuff will get chewed up! My puppy has cost me alot with everything he chewed up his first month with us. There is also training. If you cannot train him on your own you would need to pay for classes. But it is totally worth it! I love my puppy and wouldnt trade him for anything in the world!|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Well if your saving to get a dog you might want to talk to you parents and do chores around the house to help with the dog, maybe help do chores at other people houses in your neighborhood to earn some money to help pay for food and vet bills.  I wouldn't go against what your parents tell you in the end though they know what's best for you.  Just give it some time, it won't be to long before you'll have a house were you can have as many as you want trust me it snuck up on me.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Well...here's my best shot at it...I hope it helps.  Do you have neighbors who have dogs?  If so start volunteering to walk them and bring them to the house every so often and let your parents see you interact with them.  If you can get a ride...see if the animal shelter will allow you to do some volunteering.  Some will let you walk the dogs on their property.  Also do some research on whatever kind of dog it is that you are wanting and get prices not only on them...but what they will need for shots, vet visits, dog food, bed/dishes, etc...  Don't preach to your parents...show them by your actions.  Good luck love, you sound like you are determined.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	i just bought mines and brought it home; lol|`|nKXTjqQWaa	First of all, who will be paying the vet bills? What about buying the dogs's food? It is expensive to own a dog, and the cost go further than the initial price of the dog. When you can pay for all the expenses involved in owning the dog then you will have a leg to stand on with your parents. Until then it would be their responsibility and their decision.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Tell your parents your being responsible for saving up yourself & buying a puppy in need. Also make them a deal (but ONLY if you really have your heart set on getting a puppy). Tell them you will pay for him, train him, feed him, groom him, walk him, put up his poop, everything, and if you don't do that, you can sell him, take him back to the shelter... Try to be as convincing as you can.  Best Of Luck.

hGY08GjRaa	If your dad is unmoveable, you MAY just have to wait until you're on your own. Personally, I don't know what's "not to like" about cats. Many people have misconceptions about cats, perhaps that's your dad's case.  You COULD try to clear up the misconceptions (such as they pee on everything, claw everything, are aloof (heh! You should see my sweetie pie!), etc..     2. The best place is the animal shelter. These kittens/cats NEED homes. Just be a little careful of getting an adult male. They CAN be sprayers, if they were not fixed before they turned 7 months. Both males and females should be fixed before turning 7 months.     3. Well, depends where you get it. BESIDES the original "Cost" for a KITTEN, you want to set aside CLOSE to $200 for ONE TIME costs of shots and getting fixed. (unless this is already covered by the shelter's adoption fee or the cat is already fixed and up-to-date on shots). After that, it's just the occasional vet visit, and about $20 a month (max) for food. Not bad at all. I'm very poor and have two cats, they don't cost me alot.      4. Himalayan ( if you're going purebred) my mom had 2 and they're the most docile teddy-bear-ish GORGEOUS animals. Absolutely stunning, while being relatively calm and quiet and very sweet.    5. A short haired rescue kitten from an animal shelter. Or a very sweet adult who is known to be a very good cat but its owner can simply not keep it for other reasons (That have nothing to do with behavior issues)    6. Food dish, water dish, litterbox, water spray-gun, and scratching post. a few toys are nice too, but that's the basics. (The water gun is to be used along with the scratching post to teach kitty where to claw and where not to)    7. I  have two "rescue" cases. One little calico kitten was supposedly going to be sent to the pound with her mother, so I took her (I was bringing her home from college, and mom already had a few cats, so we couldn't take the mother.)  She's a mixed breed, but a very pretty calico. Her name is Storie. I've had her since she was a tiny tiny kitten, and she's now almost 8. My other kitty is an orange tabby that someone dumped off when he was a tiny, sickly kitten. A friend found him and I agreed to get him better and find him a home. He found his own home LOL.. he turned into a VERY handsome, HUGE (18 lbs) big boy with gorgeous semi-long fur. I'm sure he's a mixed breed to, but he looks like he's got alot of Maine Coon (his fur and the size and general "look" of him.) His name is Moses, because he was abandoned and found. He's almost 6. Again, had him since he was a tiny baby.|`|n7bok7NRaa	1. "Hey dad, I've got some money, I want to buy a cat!"  2. I got my cat, his box, a carrier, food bowls, some cat food and some cat litter FOR FREE from kijiji.com. Craigslist is another good place to look. If you want to get a kitty from a Shelter, that's good too. DO NOT buy a cat from a pet store. They are often from farms, and will not be healthy.  3. My Riker costs about $30 a month to care for. That's for food and litter. He doesn't need anything else.  4. Moggie. That's 'mutt' for cats.  5. A short haired cat. Any type. Long haired cats need tons of extra grooming, and often need special food to help them deal with hairballs.  6. Food dishes, catbox, cat litter, food.  7. Yes. He's a stripy grey tabby. He's about 2 years old. his name is Commander William T. Riker (no seriously, it is!). I've had him for about half a year.|`|C1Cobi1taa	1. tell your dad you will take care of the cat! and do it too!  2. adopt a cat(or kitten)  from a local shelter  3. well approximately costs from 20-50 USD a month(which includes food, flea meds, and treats/toys, cat litter too!) and can be more if you need to go to the vet or get vaccines again...   4. i don't have a fav breed, i like most of them but have found that many siamese(not all) are a one person cat and attach well to only one person.  5. i don't think you should focus on a specific breed, see what are available at the shelter and see which one u seem to attach to the most  6. you need water& food dishes, cat litter box, cat litter, pooper scooper, something for your cat to claw like a small cat tree, a brush, and toys  7. i have two cats one is a female black shorthair and her name is Squishy she is almost 7( i have had her for a few years) .... and i just was adopted by a grey long haired male named Grey he is probably 2 or 3.|`|YzXuJOqUaa	Firstly, I'm not sure about the costs of keeping cats, I have seven but my parents pay for them. I know they can be quite expensive as they have to have injections every year to keep them protected, but as in the past three of my cats died from not having these, I stress the importance of getting cats their vaccines every year.  Personally, as a cat owner, I think a first time cat owner would be better off getting a mixed breed rather than a pure breed. Purebred cats can be very demanding in their needs and often require more specialist care. Moggies (mixed breeds) are easy to look after with the right love and attention. Supplies you will need are:   - cat toys, such as mice, balls etc.  - possibly scratching post, but not all cats use them  - cat food, wet or dry, i heard it is best to have a mix of both though, but don't leave wet food out all day or it goes off  - baskets/somewhere to sleep, but they may just choose to sleep on your bed anyway :)  - litter tray, cats shouldn't be let out of the house when they are first brought into it, so a litter tray and plenty of litter should be purchased  - brush, particularly if the cat is long haired  - collar, even if indoor its best to have a collar in case they escape    Finally, I have seven cats, their names are:  Holly (6), Harry (9), Katie (5), Lexie(1), Bertie(7), Stanley(5), & Oscar(6).   They are all mixed breeds, and I love them to bits |`|Zyb2MENKaa	1. Tell your dad that people who own cats live a few years longer than a person who doesn't own a pet. (It hasn't been proved why they live longer, they just do)    2. A good place to get a kitten would be your local animal shelter. Or you could watch the newspaper for kitten adds. It is coming to that time of the year again.     3. If you are getting a kitten you will have to take it to the vet to give it it's shots. (My cat got the works, declawing, neutering, shots. It costed about $200.) Then you will have to buy the accesories, litterbox, food dishes, food, litter. If you don't get them declawed you will also have to get it a scratching post and a nail clipper. Food costs for me about $15 a month and litter about $12 a month. Then you also need cat shampoo, but I only give my cat a shower about once a month. So a bottle of shampoo lasts about 6 months. The shampoo costs $6. I like to get my cat the random bag of treats and cat toys, so that adds up to about another $12 a month.     4. My favorite breed of cat is the DSH. (Domestic Short Hair) That is your random shorthaired street cat. My favorite color of cat is a mainly white calico.     5. I would say you wouldn't want to get a purebred cat the first time as they cost a lot more then a DSH or DLH. (Domestic Long Hair) They are also more prone to having health problems because of interbreeding.     6. I already listed the supplies you would need in  3, but I'll list them again. Litterbox, cat food dishes, scratching post (if you don't declaw), cat toys, and... that's about it.     7. I have a cat that's a DSH. His color is white with large grey tabby patches. He just turned 1 year old about a month ago. His name is Chipmunk (compliments of my sister naming him) and I've had him since he was born.

This will help him feel more secure in your renting of the apartment. <br>  <br>  Also, you should think about what type of pet you are getting and explain to him why this animal is good in the type of place you are living. A "hypoallergenic" pet could be convincing. Maybe even promising to move out if you do not keep it all clean. You really need to reassure the owner. He does have valid reasons to not want pets in his place, because many owners are irresponsible. <br>  <br>  If anything, I know this sounds odd, but iguanas can make really good pets. They have a great personality, are lovable, and are relatively easy to take care of. They are very similar to a cat/dog mix. You should do some research on them. Only thing missing is fur really.|`|eZtw683maa	To make it simple if you want a pet relocate to a new place that allows pets. You can be evicted for breaking the property managers rules. Then the next tenants are treated with even more distrust and higher fees. Been on the bad end of that one too many times.|`|dTLxjGPyaa	Most landlords do not want pets in there homes. I know that its unfair and all but at the end of the day its there home and don't want it damaged. In units they are not generally aloud as they can disturb the neighbors. Even if you owned the unit you would have to abide by the body corp laws for the units. <br>  <br>  However owners do sometimes allow marine animals as the only issues that will occur with this is if the tank cracks/starts leaking or it falls over and damages the floor. But you do have to keep them clean and healthy.<br>  <br>  So i would recommend asking if you could have a marine animal (turtles, fish etc). He may allow this but will tell you that it's your responsibility for damages if it cracks or falls over.|`|9kTejB0uaa	First of all you have my sympathies.  For any number of reasons, we have to rent.  We have no other option.  Our first rental had absolutely no problem with our having our dogs (are we talking dogs here?) and in fact we bred several litters over the 13 years we had the tenancy.  This was a private tenancy, no agent, and this IS significant.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately rather than put in the double glazing the property needed after all those years (during which they did NO maintenance whatsoever, but we didn't complain because we didn't want to rock the boat), they decided to sell and we had to move out.  We had 5 dogs at the time.  We managed to find a place, on a farm, where our dogs were welcome.  We cleaned the place when we left and all was fine - this was another rental that didn't involve an agent.<br>  <br>  We had to move (medical reasons) after a couple of years.  And needed to move to the SW (UK).  We had to use an Agent (by this time we were down to 3 dogs) and we managed to find a place, after about 3 months of searching, that would accept 2 dogs.  So we smuggled the third in (she was 13+ in any case but not ready to pts by any means) and we had to hide her when we had inspections.  We paid a dog deposit which was half a month's rent and was to cover any problems found on our vacating the property.  The monies were returned in full at the end of the tenancy which unfortunately again ended after 2.5 years when the owner wanted the property back (despite it being a 'long-let') to live in herself.<br>  <br>  Further panic - but we found another property for our then 1 dog (we'd lost the old girl, and her niece unexpectedly to cancer just before we had notice to quit).  We were not asked for an additional deposit, and we have permission to have 2 dogs here so our new puppy is 'legal'.<br>  <br>  Message at the end of all this  - offer to pay an additional deposit on the apartment to cover any perceived damages, carpet cleaning etc.  Do you have inspections at all?  We had quarterly inspections at the property before this one, and 6 monthly inspections here.  I have a Vax cleaner and do the rugs before each inspection so the place smells nice and clean (my hounds are house-trained in any case), and if you have a good Vac. the fur shouldn't be a problem either.<br>  <br>  Finally, I do have reservations about dogs (again if we are talking dogs here?) in apartments, especially if they are left on their own for long periods, but provided you are responsible, and the dog isn't huge, it can be done.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope it works out, but at the end of the day, unfortunately, it's the landlords who call the shots!!<br>  <br>  Edit - sorry, after I posted this I see you are NOT talking dogs!! lol.  But the extra deposit/cleaning still applies.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Snakes are illegal there? Man, like everyone has snakes here.....course, the usa is a bit...lax...it seems.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you have good reasons.

bDPVRtCNaa	Good idea to forget about the pictus.     Most South American community fish will have same water parameters needs and get on well with the rams.    I chose corydoras for the bottom, rams for the middle region, and hatchetfish for the top.|`|Qhdozm54aa	I would have some reservations over the Pictus catfish, these are known to eat small fish and if they are at adult size they could make a tasty meal out of the rams and possibly the gouramies whilst they are small. There are plenty of fish that are compatible with rams (so long as they share the same water quality requirements), these include small tetras, barbs and rasboras.
EdN7fkTgaa	Bringing home a new kitten is exciting but can put stress on the cat that already rules the roost, especially if your cat has been the only pet. Patience and time is the key to harmony within the furry members of your family.<br>  <br>  Keep the new kitten separated in a room, letting your current cat still have the run of the house. If possible, keep the new kitten in a room where they can smell each other under the door. They may growl or hiss at the door but they cannot hurt each other. <br>  Wipe the new kitten down with a dry washcloth or towel and let the old cat smell it. Use the same washcloth to wipe the old cat, then let the kitten smell it. This introduces them to each others smell without interaction. <br>  After a week, take the new kitten out of its room and introduce her to the old cat. Make sure you are present in case of a fight. Do not let the old cat in the new cat’s room. The new cat should feel that it has a safe place. If the cats fight, you can hold off a few more days before the next interaction. <br>  Continue to have "chaperoned" meetings. Do not scold your old cat for growling, only if she attacks. Start the meetings out short, then go for longer distances. Let them smell each other and be curious|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	It's just a matter of time. This always happens when a new cat is introduced, it's because the "resident" has been used to being top cat in the household and now there's a new set-up. The spitting and hissing is part of feline politics as they decide between themselves who is now the "leader", so to speak. It's important that you show plenty of affection to both, to reassure the newcomer that he is welcome and to reassure the old girl that you still love her.  They'll sort it out soon and settle down.|`|z4Huew1daa	Oh not a problem i introduced my new kitten, Shiloh, to my 11year old cat,lucky, about 6 months ago they hated eachother at the start they hissed at eachother and stayed at different parts of the room but after about 2 weeks they were sleeping in the same bed togerther and eating together now that Shiloh is 7 months old they are inseperable.<br>  Lucky cleans Shiloh and they are best friends. So just be patient they will warm up to eachother.:)<br>  hope this helps Rach xoxo|`|o0I5YXMNaa	Most people seem to advise leaving them to take their time.<br>  <br>  Cats can be very stubborn and you don't want to set up a pattern of adverse behaviour.<br>  <br>  <br>  As you probably know cats are very territorial so it may take some time.  It may be that the older cat will just learn to tolerate and live with the younger cat, or it may be that they become good friends.<br>  <br>  We did this once and it did take a long time for the older cat but one day we found them curled up together in the same basket.|`|CMms2lGoaa	Just be patient and wait a few days and your cats will get used to each other. :)<br>  <br>  Blessings,<br>  Bailey|`|AA11119758	In my experience, they will work it out between themselves. Unless there is actual violence occurring between them try to be patient. I don't think this will cause your older cat to run away-cats dislike change.<br>  Do make sure that all resources are spread throughout the house because a favorite tactic is to block access to food, water, litter box, toys, etc.-cats are great stealth intimidators. If these are available in more than one area this is impossible.<br>  Four years ago I ended up adopting a young male stray the same age as another male I had-it's a long story but couldn't find him a home. This is the easiest going cat you ever saw, but it's taken until this winter for he and the other male to get along! You should have an easier time with the different ages and sexes. Be patient and don't force it.|`|ty9iOORRaa	<a href="http://gettinginfo.us.to" rel="nofollow">http://gettinginfo.us.to</a> <br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
FFbWgs0Xaa	I adopted two cats last year.  We went out and bought then a huge soft basket-style bed big enough for two (they are brothers and very close) and put it in a warm corner of a quiet room.  And guess what they completely ignore it.  If they had to get past it the jumped over it like it was lava or something!  We even tried putting it on a raised surface in case they didn't like the the floor but it didn't work.  <br>  <br>  So we tried again.  we gave that basket away to my parents dog (who loves it by the way!) and bough a huge flat soft cusionand put it in a different place.  Same thing happened; they think it is lava and will not touch it.  <br>  <br>  So we have given up; there is no way we are buying a third bed!  <br>  <br>  We let them sleep on our bed during the day and sometimes with us at night.  But they can be noisy so it is can be necessary to shut them out of the bedroom when we need sleep.  <br>  <br>  They enjoy sleeping on windowsills so I put a blanket on one for them.  They sleep on the armchairs and the couch and even on the floor or the kitchen table (they aren't really allowed on the kitchen table though).  <br>  <br>  My advice is try a cat bed but don't spend too much on it as there is a good chance they won't use it!  If you are going to let the cat on the bed anyway then just get a cat blanket or just let it on the duvet - cats are pretty clean animals most of the time.|`|uD7giDNjaa	We bought my cat a little cat bed when we first adopted her. She peed in it because she didn't like it. She sleeps in weird places, like in my wardrobe, also if you leave a draw open for too long, she'll climb in there. She likes to sleep on my handbags aswell.<br>  <br>  So just get a blanket and stuff, she or he will sleep wherever it feels most comfortable.|`|oIe3b65Naa	Spoil it rotten and get it a warm cozy bed, but more than likely it will find it′s own soft spots to sleep, on a blanket, in the sun ray on your living room floor, in bed with you (that′s where my Tyson always sleeps.. first he lays down on my shoulder, and stretches across my neck over the the other shoulder, he is about 5 kg and it can get pretty warm ;)<br>  But after about 5-10 minutes of this position, he moves to the end of the bed.

FewhKlx9aa	When they tell you he will calm down has nothing to do with his playfulness.The fact that soon he will want to get out and might start marking as his dominance will come into play..His humping and peeing in the house will overtake good playful puppy..Cancer of the testicles and a young death also will can happen..It is much better for the dog and yourself in the long run.. But his personality stays the same|`|3giaPYe8aa	Well, I'm glad to hear that you are going to be neutering him, but you are taking away his testicles, not his activity level.  Let me give you a little hint about this breed.  The dog will be a total couch potato by the time he is two.  He is just a pup and his activity level will diminish with age....I PROMISE!  Another thing, if your dog is registered, look at his registration papers....he is registered as a Bulldog, not an English Bulldog.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	I heard the same thing, I have German Shorthairs , they are a very active breed to begin with, When they where neutered they didn't really calm down very much , but they don't try to escape as much as they use to.

Best Of Luck.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Most dogs will calm down at least a little. My dogs did, and theyre both males.

Which he hasn't so it won't work.    But do neuter him because he'll probably start getting out of control.    He probably hasn't learn in his litter when to stop. To teach him yell a high pitch noise so he thinks your in pain when he get's to far|`|Idyil08uaa	well maybe if he looks a some one he likes getting him neutered maybe will help a little bit but if u want him to have puppies with a girl hes not going be able to|`|Ao3axy36aa	sometimes its different. now this is my own experience with neutering male dogs. with the one yes he was way calmer than before. the other one didn't affect him at all he was still hyper as always. but the majority of the time yes it will calm them down. and even if it doesn't its good that you are having him neutered.
oDVx7nSxaa	No - it's not normal, it's a symptom of dental disease.  And just like in humans, dental disease can cause heart and kidney disease due to all the bacterial it pours into their system.  They need to go to the vet, there is no home remedy.|`|3vBALAlaaa	I'm not sure if it's normal, but I think that if your giving it hard food, you should give it soft food. Also, go to a vet.

It is not normal for their teeth to just fall out and it is obviously a sign of some sort of gum disease.

Your cat is probably in a lot of pain over this, just like you would be so please do not put this off.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	Please take your cats to a vet.  They may have serious health issues.    Key points from the link below:    Studies show that 70 percent of cats show signs of gum disease (gingivitis) by age three.     Feline dental resorption lesions are the most common dental disease of domestic cats and the most common cause of tooth loss.  This is a painful disease and tends to occur in older cats (over 4 yrs)    -also per this site, cat's have 2 sets of teeth, baby and permanent that they get around 4mos.  I've never heard of cats having 3 sets.
gBycDD9Baa	FELINE PANLEUKOPENIA           The animal may have a rectal temperature of 104oF or greater and may be severely depressed and not eating. Vomiting usually occurs, and severe diarrhea may develop in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. If vomiting and diarrhea continue, severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances occur.<br>  <br>  Affected cats often assume a typical "hunched" posture with the head between the forepaws. Sometimes the head will hang over a water bowl or food dish. They often act as though they would like to drink and may even take a lap or two of milk or water, but they are unable or reluctant to swallow. The hair coat becomes rough and dull and there is a loss of elasticity of the skin due to the dehydration. The third eyelid (the haw in the corner of the eye toward the nose) often appears. The abdomen is painful, and touching it will elicit a pain response. The lymph nodes in the abdomen are enlarged, and the digestive tract contains excessive amounts of gas and liquid. Cats that are not going to survive develop a subnormal temperature, with coma and death following in a few hours.|`|HvbIE03saa	You want an answer?<br>  <br>  VET...VET VET VET VET VET VET VEEEEEEEEET!!!!<br>  <br>  If you're not a vet...and we're all clearly not vets, then you need to seek a person trained in dealing with this sort of thing so you can get PROPER treatment and help for your kitty's so they don't die.|`|l5qxHOqEaa	It depends on the age of the cat my 6 month old kitten had similar symptoms but instead of throwing up she had white diarrhea and the vet told me that it wouldn't hurt to starve her for 24hrs the vet gave me this paste that binds her up that prevents her having diarrhea  <br>  Your cat may just want to spend time on it's own my older cat 8months loves spending time on her own sitting in the same place for hours on end. <br>  I would strongly advise that you take her/him to vet as soon as possable<br>  the saying three minutes without air three days with out water and three weeks with out food but I'm not so sure that it applies to animals but please take you cat to the vet there could be something seriously wrong.<br>  Hope every thing is ok with him/her good luck|`|o0I5YXMNaa	You really need to seek veterinary advice.

ZkkawcKKaa	What you can do is tie your stirrups to the girth with some kind of thin string. Make sure the string can break away somewhat easily so if something where to happen you would be okay. By doing this it will help train your legs to stay in the right position and eventually you will not need to tie your stirrups anymore. I have had trainer do this to me and it works. My legs do not swing anymore.|`|8cikAYp3aa	shorten your stirrups  to start with.  Then remember to keep your crotch close to the saddle and knees bent.  you only need be 1-2 inches out of the saddle when you jump if you stay low your leg cant straighten and come to far forward. work at it while poping low fences at a trot till you get the position.   Working grids wont hurt your pony either.  Set up trot rails along a fence at different heights up to 2 feet,  he can trot those.  And insist that he does.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Lots of no stirrups on the flat and over low fences will get those legs in shape. Work on bending lines and wide turns to get your position in check,|`|OjeL1if4aa	Without seeing a picture (which would make it easier) the first and only thing that comes to mind is that your stirrups are too long. When you sit in the saddle drop your stirrups and just let your legs hand and relax. The bottom of the stirrup should hit just ABOVE your ankle bone (the nobby part of your ankle). Anything longer is too long. If your still having the problem try shortening your stirrups another hole above that... anything much shorter is going to make it more difficult to get into your 2-point. <br>  <br>  As far as the rushing goes the best thing I've been tought is to ask the horse to slow back down and actually walk up to the jump. If he stops infront, it's ok as long as he stops square and you've asked for it. Don't let him turn off in either direction... as long as you keep your jumps small, probably 2' or smaller he should be able to walk up and hop over without a problem. Use ground rails before and after, a couple on each side of the jump. <br>  <br>  It's best to start out small, with cross rails or 18". As soon as your guy starts to speed up and "rush" bring him back to the walk... like I said, if he stops it's ok as long as he's square with the jump and you've asked... it's a good thing in this case. Don't get excited, just calmly ask him to proceed over the jump... grab a chunk of mane to keep from being left behind or bumping his mouth. Once he's got that down and is automatically walking to the jump then you can ask him to trot through... don't get excited... don't kick him... don't change anything just ask him to keep moving forward when he goes to slow down. The same thign applies for the canter... when he gets rushy, bring him back down to the trot, and if needbe back to the walk. Keep the fences small at first. Once you can walk/trot/canter over the smaller fences at the same pace for multiple jumps then you can work on raising them.<br>  <br>  As for the lessons... I understand not being able to afford them weekly... Could you afford them bi-weekly or even just once a month? Anything is better than nothing, especially when you're having difficulty. Jumping is a very dangerous horse sport and if you aren't trained properly you can seriously injure yourself and or your horse... even if you don't mean to. Find a good trainer and explain your situation and the problems you're having. Most are willing to work with you... maybe you can do a few chores around the barn in exchange for your lesson or part of your lesson. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps some.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Okay, I'll try to help =) One of my students used to have this same problem.<br>  <br>  Well, first, please don't listen to "SexyPaintGirl". When hanging your leg next to the stirrup, it doesn't HAVE to be above the ankle. It can be at the ankle, or even slightly below. This just depends on the riding style, the rider, what's comfortable, etc.<br>  <br>  When you start to jump, you actually should NOT have short stirrups. This way, you'll learn to keep your leg down and around the horse while still being in jump position. Just have your stirrups in the middle of your ankle when they hang.<br>  <br>  I just wanted to clarify that. <br>  <br>  Anyways, If your leg is slipping forward, this means you need to work on your leg position, or even your overall seat.  I would begin to do a lot of trotting and cantering without stirrups.<br>  <br>  Yes, without them. You'll be sore if you don't normally practice this, but it definitely helps with balance and leg support. If your horse is bouncy, it'll be hard to sit is trot, but it is possible. However, you should also post without stirrups to dramatically strengthen your calves and thighs.<br>  <br>  Without stirrups, you'll also almost be forced to sit up tall to keep balance. Don't let your shoulders cave in.<br>  <br>  If you're nervous about this exercise, then just have a friend lunge you in the round pin and take your stirrups up. <br>  <br>  Oh, and even though it's work without stirrups, focus on still keeping your leg in the correct position. (heels down, straight line through shoulder, hip, etc.)<br>  <br>  Once you get more balanced, also trot and canter (with or without stirrups) WITHOUT your reins. This is best if done in a lunge pin so that someone else can control your horse. This also really helps with balance.<br>  <br>  If all goes well for a few weeks and your legs strengthen up, then proceed to jumping agin.<br>  <br>  Just set up a simple crossrail. Have a nice, even trot towards the center. When your literally two strides away, just SLIGHTLY bend forward with your upper body. Once you feel horse horse begin to take off, then bend into your full jump position (though you won't be far forward because it's a small jump).<br>  <br>  While you're going over the jump, FOCUS on these things-<br>  <br>  1. Contact with your leg and the saddle<br>  2. Keeping your leg down and around the horse<br>  3. No daylight between our knee and the saddle<br>  4. Heels DOWN.<br>  5. Nice, straight back.<br>  6. Grab the main over the jump.<br>  <br>  If you're making contact with your leg and the horse/saddle, you should do fine. If not, this is where rider's legs begin to slip.<br>  <br>  However, since your horse is faster from what you've said, then don't grip way too tight, not with all of your force. Just enough so that your leg doesn't slip and stays still. If your horse still goes too fast from this, try longing him before riding so burn off some extra energy. (also make sure he's let out frequently, that could help.)<br>  <br>  Try to have someone take pictures or videos of you jumping, this way you can also get a visual of what's going wrong.<br>  <br>  This will definitely help. Good luck, and never give up =)|`|DDhsF8zYaa	A picture or video would help. I can't really picture your problem :/|`|RloOJ43haa	I would need to see a picture to be sure, but I am willing to bet that your stirrups are too long. <br>  <br>  Is is possible for you to still take lessons, but less often?

ePkiOzPSaa	Cloudy doesn't sound like "gross" to me, it sounds like you may be going through a cycle.  If that is the case, it will most likely clear up within a few days, but you will want to be testing your water for ammonia/nitrites/nitrates, and do partial water changes as necessary.    The "soft glue" that you've never had before is just aquarium sealant, and you've probably only had acrylic aquariums before, which are built as one solid piece.  This is perfectly normal for a glass aquarium.    What kind of fish do you have in the tank?  Did you rinse the tank and substrate (Gravel) out thoroughly before using them?  Has this only happened since you added the fish?  You should be using the normal amount of dechlorinator and doing smaller water changes, as necessary.  Do not change the filter cartridge again until it's time is up.|`|OsVswissaa	Sometimes new tanks will experience a bacterial bloom and it is completely harmless.

oUz7bqcZaa	well it could live out all the time  so finding a feild that doesnt offer you anything like electric would probably work out quite cheap  also if you were really tight for money you could consider taking the shoes off the horse and going barefoot (the horse would get used to this over time)   and tbh you'd only need hard feed and hay/haylage when its really cold, the ground is hard and theres no grass    so you'd only have to pay for   insurance: a good insurence is about 30 a month  everything it needs which is just a one of payment  rent for a feild unless you have your own: rent for a feild could be anything up to 25 (well where I live anyway)  and hay and feed  : 10 for a bag of feed and roughly 4 for a bale of hay|`|mL0BjDQWaa	well if you are including some where for them to live as well it would be at least 100 with out renting a field it would be about 30 a month at least  I hope this helps :) x|`|ADjeuxIiaa	I live in the US so prices are surely way different out here. Food is about $80/month Farrier is $150 each time he comes out. And insurance isn't required here. I own horse property so I don't pay to board anywhere but you can expect to pay anywhere from $200-$1500 per month per horse depending on the facility. Keep in mind though, should anything happen and your horse need a vet, Equine vets are very very expensive.

I know several lovebird owners, and they're all happy, healthy, and doing well financially.  It's very good that you don't believe in such superstitions.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	No they aren't.

OWGBAiXtaa	Your dogs might just be in fantastic condition.  People are so used to seeing fat dogs in the USA and the UK that when they can see ribs at all, they tend to think the dog is too lean.  You say, "They are the most fit and healthy as i've ever seen them in seven years."  That says a lot to me.      If you have a good vet, make an appointment for a professional opinion of your dogs' weights.  I wish you had posted pictures...    Working dogs like greyhounds and sheepdogs as well as lots of sporting dogs like sled dogs and schutzhund dogs are often fed a raw diet.  Prey model raw has become very popular again.  Here is a sample menu for dogs the size and weight of German Shepherds: http://leerburg.com/diet2.htm  You can feed beagle mixes the same diet, just less food- usually around 3% of the dog's ideal weight per day.    If you are interested in the raw diet, you can email me and I will give you the titles of helpful books to read on the subject.|`|AA12128656	i got my working pit bull terrier on Nutrena Loyall in the red bag it's the pro formula with lots of calories in it.... that's the only thing i found that puts weight on her. don't forget some raw meat.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Try adding some leftovers to their food.

It seems to me they are having the time of their lives since the weight is coming off.  I wouldn't switch the brand of food because sometimes that can make them sick...but I would add a little of the same brand but "puppy food" with it...just enough to put some more pounds on again.  I had some boxers that did the exact same thing when I moved to the country...the vet recommended I do it and it worked great.  I just used a little of the Eukanaba for the puppy mixed in with the adult maintenance.

Anything from wal-mart like iams, purina, pedigree, beneful etc. are crappy. Try Canidea, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, Innova etc. Although these foods are a bit more expensive, it's worth it in the long run because they don't need to eat as much and will be healthier. You have to look at the ingredients. The first 3 ingredients should be meat. Stay away from corn, soy, other fillers and by-products. Get a food with enough protein as well since it sounds like they get lots of exercise. :)   Try this site: http://dogfoodanalysis.com/  It has reliable ratings and ingredients of almost every popular dog food. Choose one that's between the 4-6 star range. I personally find that Canidea all life stages is an exellent food for the price.  My jack russell terrier does well on it and we're in the country as well.  Good Luck!  Oh yeah and do make sure to get regular worming because in the country you never know what they can get into like dead mice :P|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Try feeding Innova, instead. It'll improve their health even more.
qMO9S6kvaa	Sounds like a 20 gallon tank? if so its plenty of space.<br>  Doesnt sound like there is anything wrong happening here. My brother has mollies as well, dalmation ones, and they DO tend to eat their own fry, It is very good for their health. So that's probably why they get all exited, dinner is about ready to pop out of the oven. ; )     They are also very active, all ways following each other and mating. The same thing happens with my sword tails, who are also live bearers.  So your fish sound pretty normal to me.|`|AraBfesHaa	Your fish has what is called the "shimmies"  Just add some aquarium salt to the water.  that should take care of the problem.
n8jrLDblaa	Bathing him will strip the oils from his skin and only make the flakes worse. The cold air is also very drying, so allowing him to spend more time indoors will help as well.    Try adding some fish oil (rich in omega 3 fatty acids) to his food daily. Generally, a little extra fat does wonders for the coat and skin. Also, a raw egg cracked in his kibble occasionally may help. If you notice any hair loss, excessive scratching or anything else unusual, please consult your vet.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	WIth a huge dog like that and it being really cold out I would take him to a groomer.

It would take you forever to get him dry with a regular dryer, plus they are too hot.

It isn't uncommon for dogs to be allergic to the chicken or beef byproducts used in the dog food.

Try using an oatmeal based shampoo.    Good luck!|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Use head and shoulders shampoo or an oatmeal shampoo made for dogs. Also make sure you rinse out all the shampoo when you're done.

The first thing to do is try contacting this person again who owns the kitten. If you can't try contacting their family. You could speak to their neighbours to find out if they could have a spare key to the house. If this fails the best thing to do is put cat food through the letter box or if they have a cat flap try to attract the kitten out and then take it back to your house till it's owners get back. Did you leave water and food inside the house for the kitten? The kitten should be ok for about 2 days if all the above fails. If it can be fed through the letter box or flap them it will be ok. You could also try getting the keys back by using some strong thin wire through the letter box maybe? Good luck and i hope you and the kitten are ok.|`|rtOYamgSaa	same answer here - give it a day (max two) if the owner doesn't get back then kick the door down. Cats can go for some time without food - in your case it depends how old/big the cat is ... i have 3 cats @ home, and sometimes they go without food for a day -a day and a half, and it isn't that bad for them|`|d3496b1eb0b2a2ec70adb2a7b6100d89aa	So long as the kitten has access to fresh water, she can manage for another day or so. She won't be very happy, but she will survive. <br>  <br>  Keep trying to get in touch with your friend and try to get an idea of when she will be back home. If you cannot reach her and more than a day goes by, get in touch with the landlord and see if you can get access to the apartment. If he cannot help you, contact the police. Do not try to enter the appartment on your own because if you are caught, you can run the risk of being arrested. By contacting the police, you are protecting yourself and you will be able to get help for the kitten much faster.<br>  <br>  Hope that everything works out.|`|841943b78cff7c2c6b60811aa6a6632baa	Try getting ahold of her.

If you did that, someone could steal all their possessions and then YOU would be liable and possibly arrested.

You did not say about the water bowl but cats really do not drink all that much, they do drink some after eating dry cat food. My cat would go outside for 2 to 5 days at a time with out coming back, I know it was not eating because it was skin & bone when he came back, eat & sleep for three days and then do it again. If you do not here from her after day two I would call the police & let them know of your intentions, try the windows of the place to see if one is unlocked Etc before breaking the door, That is costly to repair. The police may assist you with help getting in , or find some one who will help you and then no one will call for some is breaking into the house. Good Luck Girl, You will here from her today I`m sure.:-)|`|m16gf9mzaa	You have already gotten lots of good advice, so I won't repeat what has already been said.<br>  <br>  When I went away for a weekend, and had a friend come to feed my cats, I had told her to leave the key inside, but she had a better idea.  She kept it, because she was worried if something happened, and we could not get home on time, she would be able to come back and keep feeding the cats.  Well, nothing happened, we got home on time, but she was still right - what if we had a car accident and ended up in the hospital out of state? <br>  <br>  It's not your fault at all, you were following your friend's instructions when you left the key in the house.  But maybe next time you watch her cat for her, you can hang on to the key until after she does get home.

AA12083992	The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) however don't let the pup see you clean it up, he/she will get the idea that is your job. Then get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck<br>  three websites on how to crate train a puppy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info-pub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...</a>      <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....</a>   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_crateTrainPuppy.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...</a>|`|NAEO3c7Laa	Here are the basics of a simple potty training routine for a puppy. <br>  <br>  1. Take him outside (and stay till he's done or a long time has gone by with no results): <br>  <br>  As soon as he wakes up in the morning (You don't have to be awake.. much!)<br>  <br>  Right after his breakfast<br>  <br>  Right after his lunch<br>  <br>  Right after his naps<br>  <br>  Right after taking him out of his crate<br>  <br>  Right after his dinner<br>  <br>  Right after any snacks of much size<br>  <br>  Right before his bedtime<br>  <br>  If he whimpers in the night<br>  <br>  Praise him in a cheery voice when he produces. <br>  <br>  2. Only feed him and give him water when you can take him outside right away. Especially in a hot or dry climate, you would normally never let dogs be without access to fresh water, but for the weeks that you are training, this limitation will speed up the potty training process for your dog. There will be fewer accidents and so the dog will more quickly learn what you want. But use your judgment about any risk of dehydration. <br>  <br>  3. When he does pee or poop where you don't want him to, quietly clean it up in a matter-of-fact way. This isn't a time to talk either loving or annoyed talk to him; essentially ignore him while you do the cleanup. Certainly never yell or physically punish him in any way. <br>  <br>  4. When you and he are both home, keep him with you as much as you can, whether at your side (a leash can be handy for this once he accepts it), in a confined area, or in a crate, or otherwise nearby. (If you are crate-training, do keep the puppy in the crate as little as possible.) <br>  Tips <br>  ### Keep in mind that you are building a relationship at the same time that you are teaching him one of his first lessons. Think sometimes about what the world must look like from his perspective, filled with giants who are sometimes very loving and other times confusingly angry. Practice patience! <br>  <br>  ### Potty training dogs isn't always fun -- you are waiting for the puppy to go, in whatever your climate can dish up and at all times of day or night. If the puppy is running loose in a safe place, this is a good time to do a few stretching exercises while keeping an eye on him. Even if the puppy is on a leash, you may be able to do some simpler ones. If you do a bit of gardening or something else, be sure it doesn't get your attention so much that you are distracted from your job of watching the puppy every moment, so you know when he has done his job. <br>  <br>  ### Don't take him back in the house the very moment he has done his stuff. He is likely to notice that the fun of being outside ends abruptly once he eliminates, and this is not an idea you want him to come up with! <br>  <br>  hope this helps, all the best.|`|mvrygTYTaa	Crate training with potty training has always been the best.<br>  <br>  Once the dog goes potty outside it's allowed full range of the house. It learns that the entire house is where it sleeps and doesn't pee inside of it. You should look up other sites that have more information on it. Crate training is also good for when you are away from the home. Make sure the dog gets enough exercise for it's breed as well.|`|IdSqunZuaa	The key to rock-solid housetraining is to start the day your pup comes home and stick with the program.

h6t4aRUOaa	I've been working with this breed for 22 years. I currently have 3 CH UKC APBTs, 1 Schutzhund ll and I run a rescue that has 18. Please be careful, screen buyers, I bred them for 4 years and my contract stated that I would always take the dog back under any circumstances, also I had the right to remove the dog if he was used for illegal purposes, that's why I stopped breeding 10 years ago. The first blue brindle pits in Chicago were owned by me, as well as imported Old Family Reds. It was so difficult to find good families I just stopped. I know train, handle and rescue. By the way I've never even heard about females being harder to train, they are actually easier, but there is always the exception. Try to limit her water. I mean give her all she wants, but monitor. Offer her water, take her out immediately, wait for her to use the bathroom, keep him separate because if he distracts her she'll forget she has to go and play instead. Once she goes, let them play, bring her in, crate her and repeat. First every two hours and start stretching the time. Good Luck. Do lots of research especially into the different bloodlines, registries, health issues. There is Von Wildebrandts Disease which is a bleeding disorder seen  mostly in Doberman Pinschers for years, is starting to crop up in pits because of cross breeding to get the blue gene. There is a blood test for that. Skin and genetic testing for the blue skin problems and BAER testing for deafness in whites.|`|Mmd07IcOaa	I own two females and two males...and it seems to me it was easier with the females.

Their first heat usually occurs at five to six months of age, but may not happen until they are a year old. There is no mating season. Domestication has obliterated the natural breeding cycle, so cats can go into heat any time of year. <br>  <br>  Cats can go into heat during pregnancy and carry two litters at the same time. Cats should be kept indoors during pregnancy for their safety and to prevent additional pregnancies.Well hope this helps!<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|AA11119758	Zero, if you do the right thing and have them spayed.|`|1yNoO8SWaa	Mine, 3 times we got herr sterilized after a while though<br>  becareful with 1st litter most the time 1 or 2 dies|`|7bNf4lwPaa	i dont know

AA11170074	If the cat only started acting this way after treatment from the vet, call the vet immediately. It could be an allergic reaction.     After a cat stops eating for 2-3 days it begins developing fatty liver, it's kidneys can shut down, the cat will turn yellow and without treatment it will die.|`|45N6tmWraa	Poor Spooky!  Calicos are charming, and not affected by any particular diseases more than other cats.    She is probably oily because she isn't feeling well, and isn't grooming.  Why did she get the antibiotic shot?  It may be the underlying disease that is affecting her, rather than the injection, although either is possible.    If she isn't eating, she likely isn't drinking enough either, and could become dehydrated.  Even a few days with reduced food potentially is very serious for cats, too, as their livers can be affected.    It sounds like she's past due for another visit to the veterinarian, and maybe some diagnostic work (blood tests.)  Good luck.
CdRlOsnyaa	the red eared sliders has an infection keep his water really clean, hold it in the tank for a couple days wit hreally warm water like 80-82 degrees this sounds weird but whe nturtles get infection the warmer water helps boost there immune system to help fight it off, if the infection persist you will need an antidoe go to your local reptile vet and pick one up. good luck with your read eared slider|`|HS44HUrgaa	well if something but him then either hes in pain or he has an infection, maybe posting a pic would help|`|AEAS7A9naa	It's probably infecting just like it would be to any other animal. If it's on his neck than he porbably can't reach it to clean it. I'd go to a vet to see how to clean it without stinging him. It can also be how old he is. If he's young than his emune system might not be as strong as that of a mature turtle.  Robin
AA11457471	I've found that the small breeds often prefer cat toys & small stuffed animals. You can also see if you can find a tiny Kong type toy & stuff it with peanut butter. Everyone likes PB!|`|80S8U7Edaa	He probably needs more time to adapt.

So he may be depressed.  http://www.petco.com/product/2324/KONG-D... these will get him to focus on it if you put peanut butter in them.    He also may not be into playing. I have a sheltie who just carries his toys around and when I try to play with him he is more interest in being patted then playing with a toy|`|bIaywrBCaa	He was probably not given toys to play with before you got him. He doesn't know what they are for. Just continue to offer them to him to play with.|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	i found a stray mixed breed 12 yrs ago who i named molly. i still have her. she has never been interested in balls or dog toys either. i used to try to get her to fetch and she'd just sit and look at me like i was nuts. she doesn't even like rawhide chew bones or milkbones. i think she's too smart to fetch something over and over again. waste of energy. also she doesn't bark and loves all animals, including cats. i have 2 rabbits, two doves and a rat and she is friends with all of them. they all hang out on the floor together, especially if there are treats. (she does like certain treats) she's a happy, healthy friendly little dog and i find her more interesting because she is different from other dogs|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	My Chihuahua is a very happy little dog, but she has no interest in toys. She played with them a little when she was a young puppy, but now she is much more interested in playing with her people. Toys just aren't her thing. If this little dog you rescued, is happy and healthy, I wouldn't worry about it. I would leave them out were he can find them if he changes his mind, but he may just be so happy to have a home that he doesn't need toys. Thank you for rescuing a dog!!|`|rql2ZEJcaa	not knowing this dogs background is probably ur answer. all puppies play and go through a social period where they learn to play. if they are isolated and not played with, then its likely they never learn and will go through life with toy inhibitions!! so its more than likely its a result of neglect from his past life!!  dont force the playing issue with him because it then becomes negative!! he is probably jus happy to have u as his new owners, who now care for his well being!! SO DONT WORRY AS LONG AS HE IS HAPPY AND HEALTHY!!  well done for wanting to be the best dog owners u can!!  (o:  oh n jus to add DONT giv him anything sweet as suggested. chihuahuas suffer later in life wiv tooth decay. so ban all sugar' i hav 2 13yr old chi's n my vet is amazed at how good their teeth are.
9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	There are many doggie classes that you could try. Most of them are not only helpful for training the dog, but quite fun for you as well.|`|AA11457471	Enroll in a basic obedience class. Most of the bigger pet stores offer classes reasonably priced.  It'll be good for both of you.|`|bIaywrBCaa	First he needs to be on a leash where you have proper control over him. If he is not leash trained you need to train him before you take him out in public.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	basic training is the best way|`|AA11828439	Train the dog.|`|Z40E5jZcaa	In public he should have a leash...    ...And if he's in the yard, encourage him with a treat.  let him see the treat.  Make sure it's something that YOU can eat as well, because if he doesn't come, eat it in front of him, acting like it tastes really good.    never, and I mean NEVER, call him when he needs a bath, needs his nails trimmed, etc..  Just get him yourself if you need to do something that he doesn't like.  Not only does this help with obedience, but it could save his life.  For Example:  If he gets out of the house and you call him, do you think he's going to listen if he thinks he's going to get his nails trimmed?  ALWAYS get him yourself if you're going to do something to him that he won't enjoy, such as a bath or going to the vet.|`|6zA0jR6Saa	basic trianing  if you won't have him trained by a professional I suggest trying to get videos offered by animal planet, probably get it on their website    I started dog training when I was 13 because animal planet really got me into it.  At 23 I have had over 10 dogs who never had behavior problems and amazed my friends and family with their behavior.    remember, make training fun, repeat often, and be strict when the dog is misbehaving  (never hit your animals)  and provide a reward system  I suggest clicker training but it seems a lot of people somehow have difficulty with it,   I think its the easies and gets the best response
CtYqMs5Paa	Yes, the Red Cross actually offers a Pet First Aid class...I took it last year it's very informative and you get to do CPR as well as the Heimlich on a dog training dummy...|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I've often wondered the same thing here's some information I found.    Here are CPR instructions, as supplied by Dr. Wendy Wallace.    CPR - Caridopulmonary resuscitaion - is an attempt to supply blood flow and oxygen to the tissues of the body when normal respiration and/or heart function have failed. Time is critical as irreversible tissue damage occurs within 2-4 minutes of respiratory or circulatory arrest. Signs of cardiac arrest include unconsciousness, cesssation of breathing, pale to grey-white gums, dilated pupils.      Check for heart activity    listen to the chest    feel for pulses - femoral artery    Call for help if available!    Airway    open mouth, pull out tongue, look and feel for obstructions    Clear mucus. Careful - DO NOT GET BITTEN!    extend head and neck.    Breathing    with head and neck extended, hold dog's nose with his mouth closed.    inhale, place your mouth over dog's nose and mouth and exhale, watching for chest expansion as you blow.    remove your mouth to allow lungs to deflate.    rate is 12 - 20 breaths per minute.    Circulation - CPR    for deep-chested dogs, place dog right side down with his spine against your body.    position your hands one on top of the other with fingers entwined and the heel of the palm at approximately the level of the 4th - 6th rib, 1/3 of the way up the chest from the sternum.    apply compression in a firm, steady downward motion, release.    rate: approx 100 - 120 cimpressions/minute    single resuscitator: 2 breaths / 15 compressions    double resuscitators: 1 breath / 3-5 compressions    check efficiency by feeling for pulses    DO NO STOP FOR LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS    prognosis is poor if fixed and dilated pupils do not constrict down after initiation of CPR|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Yes the Red Cross and some Humane Societies have the first aid class. You will learn that and more.|`|APNzM50Saa	I know you can, sort of a bit disgusting but you put your mouth around the dog's nose, holding it closed and the rest is just like humans.|`|vPde97E2aa	OF COURSE!  Done it....both.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Yes and I have had to do this a few times..My dogs are small so I sit on the floor with them betwwen my legs..Their back to my stomache and cup my hands press and push up and out flys whatever it was they were chocking on..Watching animal planet emergency vet taught me a lot|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Well...I've done it and I am happy to say, it works.  You do it basically by shutting the mouth and breathing into the snout.  I know it sounds gross...but when it's needed no one is caring about the grossness...just wanting the dog to be okay.  You have to be extremely careful with heimlich because it is so easy to break a rib.  Using a slap on the bottom neck area...careful not to hurt them, or sometimes just syringing warm water down to help them swallow can take care of the problem... but water is not always available.  I curious to how you came up with the question?|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Yes, it is possible to perform CPR on your dog. However instead of blowing air into the bog's mouth as you would a human, you would hold the mouth shut by wrapping a hand around the dog's muzzle, and blow into the dog's nose instead, using your lips to seal around the nose so that the air pushes fully down through the dog's airways.    Of course this sounds a little unappealing, but if your pet's life is at stake, most would see it worth the while.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Yes, there is actually a Canine CPR and a Canine Heimlich class offered by several first-aid centers.     Here is how to do CPR:  http://www.dog-first-aid-101.com/dog-cpr...    Here is how to do the Canine Heimlich:  http://www.bogartsdaddy.com/bouvier/Heal...    I've also found that if its not too large of an obstruction in the throat, you can close the mouth and blow into the nasal passage and the muscles of the throat will contract, and usually move the object downward and the dog can breathe.    This usually only works on SMALLER dogs, from my experience. Larger dogs tend to need the Heimlich.
OWGBAiXtaa	I'm one of those dog owners that madalyn spoke of who would not set foot in a dog park.  I have a dog-aggressive dog, but even if I didn't, I would still not go.  There are too many strange dogs and stupid owners at dog parks.  It's just too risky.  I don't want to be found liable if my dog hurts another dog, and I don't want my dog attacked by another dog.    In any case, it's a very good idea you have to hire a trainer for an evaluation.  Many people confuse aggression with over excitement, and it can take a professional to determine what is really going on.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Dog's are pack animals and they have to set their own hierarchy ,even among other dog's . Small Dog's are a little more apprehensive toward the larger breeds because they are more fragile. If he nips another dog that dog will let him know , that's why he backs off . As far as barking at other people ,its nothing  to worry about as long as he's not aggresive to the point of biting. Mostly it sounds to me that your dog is trying to get some of he othe dog's to play whith him, and may bark at certain people to get their attention, like saying i am over here come and pet/play with me. etc.|`|oVUKtH5aaa	No you are not overreacting. Any concerns or questions you have regarding guardianship of your dog should be addressed. It would be a good idea to have you and your dog enrolled in a class. Also on another note...the jury is still out on dog parks. Some dogs and owners love it. Some owners wouldn't set foot in one.  All dogs are different. And for some dogs the park is sensory overload.  Some of the behaviors you describe are normal and are because he is young , but others ,if not guided will be undesirable as an adult. i.e. the barking at people .  I applaud your keen observations of your dogs behavior. Share those with the trainer and good luck. The time and training you put in now will have life long results.
FwT05Dtaaa	Who did you introduce first? If your clownfish was, perhaps its established a territory and is now making sure the angelfish knows who lives where. Your best bet here is to slightly shift the environment around the best you can, perhaps during a water change. This will cause the clownfish to have to find a new "home" and give the angel a chance to find itself one as well. Things should pan out that way.    Clownfish are just not as cute as Nemo, they're really mean spiteful little son of a guns.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	Clownfish are extremely aggressive fish when defending territory....even more so if two of them are pairing up, being a damsel means they will typically hold their ground against fish 3 times the size. You have a choice to make as i doubt moving territory about will do much long term to stem the aggression in such a small tank..either get rid of the angel and get another fish more suited to your tank size or remove one or two clown fish.

TD5DKXT2aa	Hi :)    First, Please calm down and relax..  Okay, Yes your hamster sounds really sick right now.     Humans can give your sickness to hamsters. So you could have gave your hamster your illness. The first thing i would recommend is take him to the vet. Your hamster is probably lighter then usual because when they are sick they know it and they do not eat. Your hamster could not be opening his eyes because they could be irritated. Or his Pouch on the inside of his mouth could be irritated. So please try and take him to a vet. Your hamster sounds really sick right now. If you can not afford a vet right now then the best thing to do is surrender him over to a animal shelter and let them take care of him. All aniaml shelters take any kind of animals and get them better for free.So please just dont let your hamster sit there and die in pain :[ Take him to the vet!!    Good luck and god bless your hamster!  ?Hamster lover?|`|owko7Jczaa	You should check to see if its but is wet.

mvrygTYTaa	The average life expectancy of an outdoor cat is 4 years (they can also pick up a great deal of diseases) while the average for an indoor cat is 15-20.

In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|l5qxHOqEaa	When me and my family moved into a new house we kept are cat in for a week so that she could get used to her surroundings and she eventually ventured out on her own it depends on  how far you are moving i case the run back to THER home <br>  It will take time if your worried about them straying visit your vet and have them micro chipped.

Y6njzqijaa	Is your TFT neutered? If he is still intact, he is marking his territory. Most male TFTs will squat to pee if they were neutered young, somewhere between three and six months. When he pees on you he is telling the world that you are his.<br>  <br>  What was the weather like the morning he peed on the rug when the door was opened for him? Maybe he didn't want to go outside if it was rainy or snowy or very cold. I agree with a previous comment that he is not fully potty trained. When you take him outside to potty, be sure to have a treat in your pocket. When he pees, pop a treat in his mouth immediately. Don't call him to you. He will think the treat is for coming to you. Be standing at his side. Put the treat in his mouth and praise him as soon as he does his business. Do this religiously until there are no more indoor accidents.<br>  <br>  His peeing when you come home is probably excitement. Lots of dogs do that and I don't know if there is anyway to prevent it. Ask your vet. <br>  <br>  When he tucks his tail he probably has his head down as well. Yes? In a pack, the subordinate dogs never look the alpha dog in the eyes and bowed heads mean respect. He's acknowledging you as his alpha and showing respect. That is a good thing. The best thing to do about that is to tell him he's a good boy and give him the affection he's asking for.<br>  <br>  As far as licking your older dog, this is another sign of respect and affection, just like puppies licking their mother. If it doesn't bother the older dog, leave it alone. Jumping all over him sounds like puppy energy. Taking him away from your older dog will give the older one some rest, but the 8 month old may still need to burn energy. Lots of toys and chewies will help that, but puppies want lots of attention and to avoid learning bad habits like chewing on furniture or jumping on an older dog, he needs lots of attention.<br>  <br>  Toy Fox Terriers are a high energy breed. They are also very affectionate and sweet and loyal. Have patience with him and adore him like he deserves. Check out www.atftc.com for more information on the breed.|`|iVQULHqYaa	He is not potty trained. If you leave your puppy alone all day, he may have developed a bladder problem. Unfortunately it's almost imposable to potty train a dog if he is left alone all day. Try to get home at lunchtime AND pay someone to take your dogs for walks. Give your older dog some peace by separating them BEFORE your puppy starts to annoy him.|`|mvrygTYTaa	Try giving him more exercise. Even if it's just a 20 minute walk or a daily chase the ball activity, it can do wonder. Many people get small dogs without realizing that they need to go out and waste energy too. They think small dogs don't need exercise, but depending on the breed they could need as much as a large breed. Both dogs sounds like they could use some time on the trendmill if you can train them to do so. Exercise can work wonders.

Xa9esMTEaa	DobeLove inbreeding = what crap breeders do, LINEBREEDING with health checks is fine and the lack of it and knowledgeable breeders is why most Dobe lines have swirled right down the crapper. Dobermans aren't friendly, not real Doberman. They're suspicious of strangers and they're very aggressive. Before I move on let's look at the definition of aggression: A forceful action especially when intending to dominate or master. If a Doberman wasn't dominant and wasn't aggressive it wouldn't be capable of it's 1 and only job: Protection work. People nowadays are sheep, soft, weak, and cry too much. The Doberman was created by a man who got the living crap beaten out of him on a nearly daily basis as a tax collector...he created a dog who while not outgoingly aggressive wouldn't tolerate his or his owner's safety to be called into question. That is what a Doberman is! Now you can create a dog who looks like a Doberman but isn't, and for that you should be ashamed...if you can't handle a Doberman DON'T GET ONE...don't breed it down and weed out the traits that make the dog what it is! That's like buying a Ferrari with a Volkswagon engine. A Doberman IS a dog who is fearless (literally, not the cute word we use for the crappily bred GSDs and Rotties of today), a fearless dog is a stable dog. A Doberman is also a dog with a build that is indicative of health...a straight back, straight legs...a dog that's not bred with extremes that may cause injury or deterioration of joints over time. A Doberman is all those things + a dog who when push comes to shove, he pushes back...and when he pushes back he wins or dies. When is the last time you saw a Doberman like that? Eastern Europe perhaps!|`|UfisV9bEaa	not just with dobermans, but with all breeds.<br>  all the working breeds should be breed so that they could be worked that includes the temperament. most show dogs have been bred so much that they have lost the ability to work.<br>  <br>  i have a kooikerhondje and i am going to breed with dogs from show-working line. <br>  <br>  i know of a Lab that doesn't know how to retrieve, he also has the worst hip score the vet has ever given, his parents are both crufts champions. they should stop breeding for looks and breed for work.<br>  <br>  they should change crufts qualifying so that you qualify by doing a field trial|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Where art thou greekman??<br>  I cannot disagree on this. Although I do think most dobermans still have a small amount of protective instinct (any dobie owner will tell you this), it can never be utilize in protection sports, police work, or any militay work (devil dogs in the vietnam war). <br>  <br>  There is actually a working aptitude test done by the DPCA  to test working drive and protective instinct but unfortunately, most if any breeders actually take it. Perhaps DPCA could put more emphasis on this. I think the public has confused that a dog with protective instinct is a dangerous dog, which is far from true.   <br>  <br>  I've been trying to find another doberman locally. But most I've seen are just black and tan labradors. Sure they are nice dogs, but if I wanted that, I'd get a labrador. But I want a doberman pinscher and unfortunately I don't think they will ever revert back to the original doberman. <br>  <br>  I find it funny though how for german shepherds, there are both working breeders AND show breeders here in the united states. But for dobermans, most are all show breeder and maybe a small handful here in the u.s. still breed for working drives.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Excuse me? *DO* they? Or is that SALESMANSHIP???

A dog that can and will do the task it was originally<br>  created to do. I think the conformation ring destroys many breeds by changing what the dog is supposed to look like, going for over angulated, flashy dogs... that can't work and have no brains.|`|XEbe4Votaa	The whole thing just seems weird to me.<br>  <br>  Logically, to me anyway, the dogs who have the form that enhances function IS the better form.  Having a functional Doberman (or any breed) does not make a dog a worse "family dog", necessary.  Frankly, I simply don't really 'get' the differentiation between show and bench stock in many of the working group breeds.  It seems silly to me.  <br>  (I will admit, I think bench bred labs are much prettier than a lot of field bred stock I see - BUT, I also know a heck of a lot of bench bred stock that kicks serious butt in the field)<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's hard for me to say what "most people" really want in a dog.  I personally don't want a dog that wants to be friends with every person they come across.  (I understand a lot of people simply can't handle a dog that is wary of strangers because they feel the need to push their dog into being 'friends' with everybody.)  I think not only are many breeds more than a heck of a lot of people can handle - dogs in general are more than a lot of people can handle.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	The original dobermans were too aggressive to be safe in today's world.  That was what Herr Doberman wanted.  However,  I agree that Health, mental stability, good temperment, function & form should be the goal.  A mentally stable dog with a good temperament can assess a situation and act appropriately.  A dog too soft, (Is that is what you mean by family friendly?)  is not to standard and will be of no use to protect you.  A dog too aggressive, is too hair trigger, and is a liablitly to the public and to your family.  You can have a dog that is family friendly, yet still have the protective insticts that are lacking in some lines.  Also,  in the real world beauty, although the icing on the cake and a good goal, is utterly useless if the dog is unhealthy physically or mentally and if we don't breed for function and form what is the use of the different breeds.  That is what made the doberman the doberman.  <br>  <br>  I think many of the "working" doberman breeders are trying to keep the health, function and form while still having a good looking dog.<br>  <br>  I also think that many show breeders are trying to improve the beauty and health and temperament, but are getting soft dogs and loosing some of the function and form|`|AA12126470	As a trainer and Doberman owner for 20 years and working with several rescues I see and get to work with many Dobermans.<br>  As an owner and when I am looking for a dog for my own home yes I would prefer something along the temperament lines of the "Eastern European Dobermans" I want a working dog. If I wanted a conformation dog to show that is what I would  seek out. I prefer a dog who can and does do what the breed was bred to do and one who also fits the breed standards. Beauty is second to ability in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I do think that the average doberman owner would not do well with that type of temperament. I do in home behavior consultations and most all the time the "problems" I am going in to fix are created by the owners. They have no consistency they do not set and  rules  and do not follow the rules they set. They do not spend any time training. Training is more than basic obedience. It is a life long process or it should be.<br>  <br>  Also there is a HUGE difference between a family pet and a working guard dog. The working guard dog is in no way a family pet nor should it be expected to be one.  They are trained to take orders from their handler not kids or wives or anyone else. They learn to depend on the handler as they handler depends on the dog. It is a working partnership built on trust and mutual respect. <br>  <br>  My wish for the breed would be to see anyone who intends on breeding their dog make sure that all of the health clearances have been done so that many of the health issues that plague this breed are not passed on to future generations.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	I definatly don't think function should be sacraficed at the expence of "flash"  but a Doberman with the proper temperment should still be "family friendly"  they are never going to have that "Golden Retriever temperment" of loving everyone on site or at least shouldn't but they should still be stable family companions while still being capable of doing what they were orignally bred to do be a companion protector.     <br>  <br>  Dobe Love: by "head bobbing syndrome" do you mean Wobblers (CVI)  or something else?   Wobblers has been in the breed for many year it is far from new.|`|AA10327148	The common Doberman of today is far from the founder's intentions.<br>  I raised Dobes from working lines. I don't know how well the male related to a 'family' situation, as he was a Dutch import, Schutzhund and conformation titled before import. He wasn't my own. My own were from the Sheriff's working kennel. My founding female would have won in the ring, AND she was an awesome guard/protection dog, AND she fit into family life just fine. .Their offspring titled in ring and schutzhund. (some of them inherited the 'Dutch rump' and would not do well in the American ring)..However, I was careful to place the pups in Dobe-wise families, as they were too 'hard' for the average fancier.<br>  I see so many Dobes that are so soft, and such wusses, that they are as a different breed than my own.<br>  I think that today, we have the 'working' Doberman, and the pet Doberman, and the show dogs are generally somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  Someone saying, " Oh, but my Doberman is so sweeet!

Xa9esMTEaa	My dog Itor definitely! He's so hard and so dominant that we have a constant power struggle going on. I will say in his "older" age he's more content with his position in our pack (our pack meaning me as top dog and him my right hand man). He's a dog of extreme aggression, drive, hardness, and dominance but when you're breeding for working ability it takes the extreme to consistently produce "good" dogs. Extreme is what separates a good working dog and a stud quality dog...too many people don't know the difference between a dog who'd make a great police dog vs a dog who'd make a great stud!|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	I have had 3 dogs in my lifetime, but I'm only 14. My dog Bear, a black lab mix. I remember was the most challenging. I remember I was 9, and we got him from the SPCA, and he was abused and neglected, so he got taken away and put up for adoption, so that's how we got him.<br>  <br>    We used to go out to the lake, and we would Put Bear in the back of our pickup truck, which had a cap. he would bark nonstop. It wasn't that he was unhappy, he just barked nonstop. He also had a chewing problem, I remember he chewed my favorite pair of sandals. Sad face. <br>  <br>  But I understood why he was the way he was. He died about 6 years ago because when we let him out to go to the bathroom, he wandered out by the road and idiots speed really bad on my road, and well, he got hit by the car. I was so sad.|`|WiycCxpzaa	Max was absolutely amazing. He listened well, could cheer you up just by looking at you, loved most people that came over and was the best dog i've ever owned.

You were at least a responsible pet owner who looked into the root cause of the behavior instead of ignoring it.<br>  <br>  Personally, the bully breeds are the most challenging since they require training for them as well as their owners.  When bully breeds have a responsible owner, they are great, but when not, oh my.  Then it would be the toy breeds since people think they are so cute and don't think they need training.  They become flat annoying.<br>  <br>  But it sounds like you are just the right person for any breed of dog.  You mastered a dob which is a combination of bully and high energy.

He was so darn cute, but had this tremendous underbite and a crooked nose which even made him cuter!!  We saved him.  Though he was cute, he grew to hold true to his heritage of being a guard dog.  No one could touch me!  Not even my hubby!  If hubby came near to me, Jammer Jam Jam Gizmo would prepare to go after him!  Then he nipped the nose of our neighbors little boy, for heavens sake!!   There was a family that had another Lhasa and he got along with their Lhasa so well that we passed him on to the perfect home environment eventually.  Whew, now that was over the top...a challenge.

I knew they were high energy dogs, but did not realize just how high that energy level was! When she was younger, she was extremely stubborn and had so many behavior problems we called her "issue dog". She's stand by her dish, not eating, and give our german shepherd the "eye" while she tried to eat. She's get overly excited when our german shepherd barked at someone through the fence and end up getting into a fight with our other dog. She was also very "possessive" of toys, not so much growling if anyone got close, but if our other dog had something in her mouth, the aussie would take it from her. Very difficult bad habits to break. She's about 3 now and still has some issues, but she has finally calmed down a bit. She was definitely a handful when it came to training, though she is smart as a whip and catches on quickly with basic obedience and tricks. She just likes to "be in your face".!|`|QVeqeMHNaa	when i was younger i had a husky that i had named Yappy because of how much he barked when we first got him. he was never trained properly and got extremely protective of my and my sister.

She *herded* my 18 month old son out of a potential dangerous situation, backing him into a corner, and putting may sons head in her mouth.  I can tell you that it scared the crap out of me!  I know if she wanted to hurt him, she could have ripped his face off, but not so much as a scratch was left on him.  If she had not done this, my son could have fallen down a flight of stairs and probably been seriously injured or even died.  Heck, I thought I was the German Shepherd (being of German heritage) but I guess my dog had more herding instinct that day, than I did as a Mom.

hC4Z8HIbaa	Rats can have most flowers. I'm not sure there are any flowers out there that could be bad. On the safe side, I would not feed any flowers tha may be poisonous to humans. I would also recommend that if you want to feed your rat flowers, do not feed wild flowers. You should only feed them slowers you have grown in your own home. Wild flowers can have herbacides which could harm the rat, or bugs that could have pesticides.<br>  <br>  You can check out the websites below about rat care. The first one is a comprehensive "Do and Don't" feeding guide for rats. The second is an online rat community that I am a part of. They are very knowedgable and it is a good resource to have as a rat owner.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I wouldnt advise it...except for dandelion, dandelions are great for most omnivore and herbivore animals...make sure you get it from a non-polluted area though (ie, not from land that has been weedkiller-ed and not from the side of the road).|`|nd2shkoEaa	They CAN but I am not sure if they SHOULD...|`|nJc0sVnFaa	What...wait flowers?!

Maybe pack some granola bars or even trail mix. We keep a cooler in the truck at all times.  It always has ham and cheese in it along with all kinds of drinks.  At a horse show, you would have the convenience of having the cooler in the truck.  Vienna wienies, tuna fish, or anything of the nature.  Be sure to put bread and chips in the truck.  Fruit is always good.  If you're like me, bring enough to share with your horse!!  Good luck and have fun.

One of these is cost- food purchased this way is twice or three times as expensive as what you could buy and prepare yourself. Another problem I have with concession stand food is poor nutritional content- most of the things sold at such places are loaded with saturated fats, salt, and are full of empty calories which no one needs. But the biggest reason I avoid food of this type is SAFETY, plain and simple. Concession stands at places like horse shows, county and state fairs, and the like often lack the proper facilities for safe preparation and storage of food, and what's worse is that many times, the people who run such places are poorly trained and have little or no understanding of food safety and how to prevent the transmission of illnesses like Salmonella and E. Coli. Both of these bugs cause illnesses which can be FATAL in some cases, and can make people REALLY SICK in others. Right now, in fact, the United States in in the process of dealing with one of the largest outbreaks of Salmonella in history, one which has been linked to contaminated peanut paste made at a plant in Georgia. If you go to a show and buy something like a package of peanut butter crackers, HOW DO YOU KNOW where the concession stand operator got that package from? For all you know, you could be buying something which is under recall because of suspected contamination with a bug that has sickened hundreds across 43 states, and which has already KILLED 9 people. If you go and eat something like that, you could become the latest victim of the outbreak-but you'll never know that what you had was contaminated until you get sick from it, because Salmonella is odorless and tasteless. Certain other things are real no-nos at places like this too, especially things like hamburgers, hotdogs, brats, barbequed chicken, and sandwich steaks, which are ALL potential sources of not only Salmonella, but E.Coli as well. Hamburgers especially MUST BE COOKED WELL DONE, if you want to avoid getting sick. Most concession stands have neither the ability nor the facilities to accomplish this- and it shows. <br>  <br>  Are you starting to see WHY I avoid concession stands at places like horse shows? In my mind, it's JUST NOT WORTH THE RISK of getting a case of food poisoning, which is not only unpleasant in itself, but could keep me out of training or riding for days or even weeks, if it's severe enough. Spending my nights or afternoons in the bathroom is NOT my idea of fun, and I doubt it's yours, either. If I want to eat at a show ( and I usually do, because frequently, it's a long day, and I will have more than one test ( I'm a dressage rider) to ride in a day. There's also the lunch break, and two judges' breaks- and eating something is a distraction during those times.) I will bring a cooler and pack it with healthy snacks and a lunch, and plenty of non carbonated drinks. Water is one of these, but I also will bring gatorade, especially if it's really hot and humid outside. Lunchwise, I will pack a sandwich, chips or pretzels, at least two different kinds of fruit ( and these can be anything from bananas to pears to apples to oranges, or whatever else is available and in season- one of my favorites during the summer are green grapes) a container of yogurt, and a dessert of some type, generally either cookies or brownies. In addition to lunch, I also bring seperate bags of things like Chex mix, granola bars, cookies, and sometimes, extra fruit. <br>  <br>  Another rule of thumb I have is to always make sure that I have plenty of accessories for eating comfortably, such as napkins, appropriate flatware, and a bottle with unsweetened ice tea or water in it. If I'm not sure what kind of sanitation facilities a show will have, I make a point of bringing waterless hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and sanitizing wipes with me. It's a good idea as well to bring a package of facial tissues- these make good all around wipes, and can double as napkins if there's nothing else available. It goes without saying that you need to wash or wipe your hands frequently at a show, but especially before eating anything, or before you unpack or mess with your lunch. Horses are notoriously dirty animals, even when they've been groomed up for a show, and their equipment is a haven for germs as well. By washing frequently, you protect not only your own health and that of those around you, you protect your HORSE'S health, too- have you thought of that? <br>  <br>  This is just my take on this issue- I realize that what I am saying doesn't always apply to everyone, but it works for me, and has kept me healthy. I've been able to show and go to other horse events for years without a problem, simply because I am careful about what I eat and where I buy it from.|`|KMMK6RZSaa	I like smaller things that generally will keep pretty well in hot weather if I don't eat them right away (unless, of course, you want to bring a cooler).  I also don't like to eat too much because I feel too "weighed down" when I ride, plus most of the time it's so freakin hot that it makes me feel sick when I eat too much.  So...that being said...I like granola bars, chips, apples, bananas, or oranges (though they can be sort of messy and attract bees....).|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Granola bars, fruit, crackers, a little candy, and any other little thing you might like to snack on...depends what you like. Try to avoid large amounts of sugar, eventually you'll 'crash'. If you can bring a little cooler that's best. For lunch - usually a sandwich...try to avoid bringing something you have to heat up or otherwise prepare. I try to bring things that I can share with my horse while eating (veggies/fruit/maybe some mints). <br>  Happy showing ~|`|3NjXyl5Eaa	What do you like to eat? Bring a cooler and put in what ever you want.  I like grapes, oranges, usually not bananas they smash easily.  For my horse I bring horse snacks or treats.  Carrots and apples for both of us!<br>  <br>  Horse shows are usually hot and dry.  Plenty of water is a must.|`|STs2ouqRaa	We usually bring LOTS of water and Gatorade first and foremost.<br>  <br>  For snacks, I don't like to bring anything not in some kind of wrapper in case it gets knocked into the dirt, smushed, eaten by horses.. etc..<br>  <br>  My favorites are granola bars, nutrigrain bars, trail mix, energy/protein bars, dried fruits. Sometimes yogurt or sandwiches if I know I have a big enough cooler with enough ice to keep them from going bad.|`|ZkkawcKKaa	I usually bring a cooler and fill it with all kinds of good stuff. I usually pack apples for both me and my horse. Also I bring chips because after working hard I like a salty snack. Also grapes, carrots, bananas and celery are a nice snake and easy to pack. I also bring lots of water and a coke.
0ef3O2m6aa	Metronidizole is usually dosed by the veterinarian at 1-3 times a day for about a  week.  My personal feeling is the twice a day dosing mimimum works the best.   Usually within a couple days a difference is noticed in the stools starting to firm up.  One round of metro doesn't necessarily RID your dog of Giardia and you may have some re-occurances  Mainly due to the resilient nature of Giardia and the possibility for recontamination.  <br>  <br>  Pretty much all puppies are exposed to it at some point but not all become actively infected.  At some point your dog will be able to fight this little pest off themselves and show NO problems.  It is when they are actively shedding the Giardia that diarrhea will happen along with weight loss.  It is important to keep your pooch hydrated and offer him a high quality kibble.  A table spoon of plain or vanilla yogurt added on top of his food will help put some "good bacteria" back into the GI tract. Most puppies eat this with no problems.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take your pup back to the vet on his last day of meds to ensure no Giardia are seen.  If there is still Giardia present ask your vet to prescribe another round of med but to use a different product such as Panacur.  Giardia can be VERY resilent.  Metronidizole, has a 60-70% effective rate...so do the other drugs that treat giardia so sometimes by following with another drug the chances of eliminating are greatly improved.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, if you are crate training, wash your puppies crate with bleach water solution and let air dry. Also bleach bedding etc daily along with dishes.  Bleach will kill giardia.  Accidents on the floor are best cleaned with a steam cleaner but I really would keep him on linoleum so he does not contaminate your house and in turn recontaminate himself.  If you have a cement driveway take him for potty breaks there so that you can properly clean and disinfect.  Remove stool from the grass.  There is nothing you can do to disinfect lawn or dirt...Giardia can migrate for years and is not killed in winter etc with the cold.  Bleach becomes inactive in inert or organic material so will not work on the lawn. Keep your pup clean.  If he potties and steps in it wash his paws so he is not licking and ingesting.  I know it sounds scary or whatever but honestly, not that big of a deal.  As your puppies immune system becomes stronger you will notice no problems.   <br>  <br>  I worked as a vet tech for 7yrs and one of the things we did randomly was check dogs for giardia.  At one point, we decided to check every dog (at our expense) that walked through the door whether the owners reported symptoms or not, mainly for acedemic reasons.  We did this for 2 weeks.  95% of the random dogs were carrying it & with NO symptoms (which is NOT treated btw)  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you a bit, if you have any other questions feel free to email me
hC4Z8HIbaa	It's called a wheelie tail, and yes, it is because they run in wheels. They curve their tail to keep it from getting caught in the wheel, and if they do it often enough, it will end up staying like that.<br>  <br>  Also, contrary to popular belief, wire flooring itself does not cause bumblefoot. It can, however, if you do not keep the floors very clean. I've always avoided the situation by covering my wire floors with fleece.|`|Z9UX0jiVaa	I have never heard of this befor.... my rats live out side in a wire cage with my Guinea pig and there just fine, they love it outside!!

You say they like to run in wheels, and rats who run excessively will get a runners tail.

kNscpF4Faa	Your bird may have had a stroke caused by a parasite...My mom had a Sun Conure that had similar symptoms and the Avian Vet said he had the stroke...He lived for another 10 years but we had to adjust his cage for his comfort and how he moved around. Also got a cage with the bars going horizontally so he could use his beak to climb since his legs didn't work|`|vjijiJT3aa	Awww, you might have to take it to the vet it sounds serious.|`|2cea182bc3a443aa80f77e49c8203556aa	I don't know much about birds, but that sounds like a stroke. I'd take him to the vet.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I am Professional parakeet massager|`|QxIhMHwAaa	A month or two and you haven't taken him to a vet to get him checked out???<br>  <br>  You need to get that bird to a vet to find out what is wrong. It sounds like he may have had a stroke or a seizure that led to this. You don't know if he is in pain or not. This can be considered a form of animal abuse by letting your bird linger this long without treatment or examination by a professional.

im3vWyv6aa	My husband and I have rescued Siberian Huskies for 15 years. It's really sad to say how easy it was to keep our yard full of unwanted Huskies. If you really want a Husky it should be easy to find one at little or no cost.<br>  <br>  If you are getting one, you need to be prepared for the challenge of being a Husky owner. Containment is a constant battle... our Husky's could escape from any kind of fence... the climb over, dig under and even open gates.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on about other challenges... but containment is the main reason owners ditch their Huskies.<br>  <br>  If you are still looking for breeders, you just need to do some Internet research. Google "Siberian Husky puppies your city your state"<br>  <br>  Best wishes...|`|Lor20kXcaa	honestly, if you don't even know where to buy one, you really shouldn't have one.<br>  <br>  Huskies are definitly not for first time owners, not for the inexperienced, and certainly not for people who can't even find a breeder online, let alone appropriate training and information about the breed. <br>  <br>  Go home, do your research, and find a reputable breeder online. <br>  They're difficult, stubborn, destructive when bored.<br>  <br>  Incredibly intelligent and sociable too. <br>  <br>  Your house will be broken if you don't know what you're doing.|`|RxHFYKqtaa	First, yes - shelters will have the Siberian you are looking for. They are one of the most abandoned dogs because people get them for their beautiful eyes and striking appearance without knowing enough about this breed.<br>  <br>  Please do your research.<br>  <br>  Thankfully there are those who work strictly with abandoned Siberians. If you chose a Siberian, I suggest finding a mentor in this field and work diligently with them to learn to provide the best home you can. Siberians are a tough dog for a beginner owner. Please know and understand the commitment that is required for this breed!<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is that not everyone is ready for the commitment a Siberian requires.....First and foremost: Siberians need to be with their ‘pack’ —— this means you ----- not tied or kept in a kennel in the backyard.<br>  <br>  They require LOTS of exercise - a minimum of two to three hours daily. They are frequently bored. This gets them into trouble with chewing and destroying things. Often they won’t respond to commands - not because they don’t know what you want, but because they don't understand what's in it for them. They shed in snowstorm style 2 times a year, minimum. They need fenced yards - they are runners and will run and run without thought of you or cars or anything else. They are diggers. If you want a beautiful yard, don’t consider a Siberian! They are independent and do not hide their emotions/feelings. They like people - any people! This is often seen as being unloyal. Because of these things, and more, they are often found in shelters and rescues. <br>  <br>  Again, please do your research.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Adults contact reputable breeders to purchase quality dogs,not whine to strangers-on-line to do their homework.<br>  <br>  <br>  "List of breeders"? Sure are putting alot of effort into this,aren't you? Call you local kennel club!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	go to petfinder.com and you can search for specific breeds who need homes, or you can also google husky rescue in your area by typing in "siberian husky rescue in (your state)"<br>  good luck!|`|atzw0IP4aa	<a href="http://www.petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/</a>|`|7WUvPI8maa	Just google local breeders where you live but I can tell you that huskies are very sociable dogs. Most people today are told to buy two huskies or at least have a second dog as huskies can become very lonely and depressed and can become ill from this. Good luck with the new puppy.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Skip the 30-40 gallon tank and go straight for a 65-75 gallon tank with external canister filtration suitable for at least a 90 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  Oscars get way too big and messy for a 30-40 gallon, that would be like keeping a St Bernard dog in a wardrobe.<br>  <br>  The 11 gallon is likely to cause stunting in the near future, as well as stress related problems (such as smashing into the lid in a bid for escape) and may also leave it susceptible to Hole in the Head - left untreated is fatal. Oscars should hit 12" within their first year of life, get a much larger tank ASAP!|`|TjLCnxkKaa	I have to agree, skip the smaller tank and get something much bigger.

qdtU1Q1Laa	I wouldn't get any of them.-<br>  <br>  The newer Pessoa saddles are horrible quality, and if this one already has one tear, I'm sure it will get more! And fixing tears isn't very cheap. <br>  <br>  Kincade saddles are cheaply made saddles that seem to put everybody in a horrible position. <br>  <br>  I recommend looking for a used Stubben saddle. With the horrible economy, lots of people have theirs up on ebay right now for very cheap. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Go with the Pessoa. Whatever you do, do NOT get a Kincade! They are cheap but are awful quality and will put you in a terrible position. Just make sure the tree on the Pessoa is in good shape. You can test this by bracing cantle on your thigh and pulling the pommel back. If the saddle bends or the seat leather wrinkles, then you know that something is wrong with the tree and the saddle is virtually useless.|`|EMYlCPfuaa	i would go with the pessoa. not that i know what that is but by your description, it is the better one. i would think twice about tears in the leather though as this could prove costly to repair. <br>  is there any reason you cant take a little more time to look further afield? there may be something even better which needs no repair and may even be a better fit. if there is any doubtin your mind then its best to pass and look elsewherer. <br>  just a thought! good luvk! :)|`|QMl4ELhGaa	$295 is too much for an old saddle without a padded seat and that needs lots of conditioning. You can get a much better one for less than that online. The Pessoa would be better in the long run, but you can also look around at online tack shops. Many of them allow you to take the saddle on trial before you buy it. I, personally, would not spend $500 on a saddle with a tear in the knee roll. My opinion is to hold off and wait for a better deal to come around.<br>  <br>  ADD: I would still pass up the cheaper saddle. As for the Pessoa, a tear in the leather can be bad business, especially if it is in a spot where it will get lots of wear on it (like a knee roll.) The tear can become worse and can also be very annoying. If it is a very minor tear that will not be constantly rubbed by your knee it might be ok as long as you are careful. I would still not pay that much for a saddle with a tear in the leather, though, especially since it is where it is noticeable.<br>  <br>  The Kincade would be a better bet in the fact that it is new. It is not the highest quality saddle, but it would be a good first saddle for someone that does not do heavy competing. It is a close contact, so it is a jumping saddle and not as well suited for flatwork. If you are looking for something you can jump and do flatwork in I would suggest an all purpose. If you strictly do jumping it will be fine.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	Definitely don't pay $346 for that old one from a relatively unknown maker.  The Pessoa is a better buy, but I think you could do even better than that!! Check out ebay and what they have to offer.  If you're buying a childrens saddle, then look at pessoas and crosbys; i.e. things that are good, but mass produced and can be bought resale cheaply.  Look at Bevals if you're an adult--that's going to be the cheapest, yet highest quality saddle you can buy resale.|`|1tX7KwHsaa	I agree with the first response. Saddles are a big investment and buying something that needs a lot of work will only add up to being a pain and more expensive than what its worth. I'm sure that if you shop around long enough you will find a good saddle in better condition. A saddle is a piece your going to have in your tack room a long time so be sure its one you love and fits both you and your horse!|`|n2dUmfcQaa	go with the kincade saddle better buy on both! you don't want a old saddle with out being padded, the other has a tear, just go with the new one. i think you will have a better chance with that!|`|HCuArmpGaa	i would go for the perrosa. Even though it is more expensive, it will last ALOT longer
aP4bkYOCaa	I think the source of your problem might be the Whiskas. :) Whiskas is very low-quality food- it contains more fillers than it does meat. Your kitten is thin because he is not getting enough nutrition, and your older cat is overweight because he's eating too many empty calories. <br>  <br>  Next time you go to the pet store, read the back of the bag or can of food- a named meat should be the first ingredient(s) such as deboned chicken, turkey, whitefish, herring, etc. The food should NOT contain corn, wheat, soy, "maize," animal by-products.. actually, the food should not contain the actual words "animal" or "meat" anywhere in the ingredients! The idea is that if you see either of those words, but they don't say what KIND of animal or meat, those sources in the food could be anything- it's mystery meat!<br>  <br>  Here's a list of foods you might like to try. Many of them can be found at your local Petco or Petsmart.<br>  <br>  Wellness <a href="http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/</a><br>  Blue Buffalo <a href="http://www.bluebuff.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluebuff.com/</a><br>  Solid Gold <a href="http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/</a><br>  Innova <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/</a><br>  Chicken Soup For The Cat Lovers Soul <a href="http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssoul.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssou...</a><br>  Merrick <a href="http://www.merrickpetcare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.merrickpetcare.com/</a><br>  Felidae <a href="http://www.canidae.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canidae.com/</a><br>  Now! <a href="http://www.petcurean.com/index.php?page_id=167" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcurean.com/index.php?page_...</a><br>  Natural Balance <a href="http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/</a><br>  <br>  They're pricier, but you'll get more for your money and avoid big bills at the vet later.<br>  <br>  Another thing you should probably do is stop free-feeding if that's how you feed them now. Read the back of the bag/can and see what the recommended feeding measurements are, and then offer those portions to your cats in separate dishes. Separate rooms might even be more appropriate.<br>  <br>  One thing that could help your big kitty in addition to better quality food would be to be to get him up and moving for about 10-15 minutes a day. Try to get him to play! My cats (even my 18 year old) go nuts for their laser pointer. Try to get him some interesting toys and get him to move, even at a walk, every day. It will help him immensely.<br>  <br>  The very best of luck to you and your kitties!|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  Call your VET, they have prescription cat food for "FAT cat, and you will need to make him loose weight, or it will be a health problem, as he get old. <br>  As for the skinny cat, take him to a bathroom or a room close the door and feed the skinny cat separately, but I would not worry about it.

UC9Wjjscaa	My mom raises cockatiels and has always had atleast 15 or more as long as I can remember.  I have had several that she has breed over the years and has given me.  I had one once that was super tame and very sweet.  He could talk and do tricks.  He only went in his cage at night to sleep and would beg for food off our plates at dinner like a dog.  Anyway he always seemed very happy and content to be an only bird.  I don't think 4 to 6 hours is to long for him to be by himself as long as when you are home he is able to see you and interact.  As old as he is he might not accept another bird as a friend.  He might get jealous.  Also if he is really tame another bird could affect that because he won't need you to keep him company so he might become mean, especially if new bird is not tame.  I have seen this happen with my moms.  She had one that was super tame and put a male in with her to try to breed her.  After that if you tried to hold her she would bite at you and wanted nothing to do with humans.  So I would be leery of getting another.  Maybe just make sure he has a mirror in his cage where he can see his reflection and some toys to entertain himself while you are gone.  When you are home give him lots of love and attention.  Hope this helps some with your decision and good luck.  They make wonderful pets if you have the time to invest in getting them tame.|`|vwC7klVVaa	It should be no problem get her another cockatiel friend as they need company of there own kind.

kRO55DHyaa	There IS a cure for some people, but you have to see an allergist for it.  Too many people are not willing to see their doctor and choose to live with the problem or avoid it.  Immunotherapy has "cured" allergies for many people.  If you are suffering with allergies to dogs-see an allergist to start treatment.  Many people are allergic to many more than one thing...it could be that dogs aren't even causing the issue (I blamed my stuffiness all on the dogs, but my cattle and cat allergies were much worse-now that I am not exposed to cattle or cats anymore, I feel great!).   I am allergic to dogs, too, but I live with four in my home (thanks to the help of my allergist).  I highly recommend making an appointment if you have allergies.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Often the so called allergies are due to the fact that a large % of dogs cannot digest grain.

Syrians are VERY territorial and will kill eachother. They must always be housed singly. It makes no difference if they are male or female, have had babies, have a big cage or whatever. Do NOT put 2 together.<br>  <br>  Dwarf hamsters (robos, russian etc):<br>  <br>  These are social species and can live in pairs or groups. Just make sure the cage is big enough.<br>  If you aer introducing two females who have not lievd together you need to either place them both in a new cage at the same time, or, clean out one cage thoroughly, then place them in it. Do not just put a new hamster straight into the cage with your old one.<br>  <br>  Usually they start fighting and one ends up dead <br>  but if they are the same age and if you introduced them to each other<br>  and they get along it will be fine<br>  But make sure they have a large cage just incase|`|26KPiekKaa	If they are from the same litter than maybe yes also when they are both young they will think they are from the same litter, but there can still be chances of them fighting so keep an eye on them in case anything goes wrong.|`|epywmmHjaa	Yes. Because if they're that young they'll think they're from the smae litter. So they won't attack eachover.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	If they are from the same litter then up to age 6 weeks is fine.8 weeks no because they will start fighting.<br>  you need 2 seperate cages for 2 syrian hamsters<br>  your vet should not be giving this kind of advice out,thanks for checking|`|fbdac5383e6093db75b9079b2855467faa	I really wouldn't risk it if I were you.  Chances are that at that age, they won't be at their most territorial just yet but can you imagine how upset you will feel if you go and check on them and one is dead because they have taken it into their heads to fight?<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that if they are different sexes, don't be fooled into thinking that they will be too young to mate - they can do that from about four weeks old!  If your hamsters are coming from a pet shop, please don't take it for granted that hamsters in the same cage are 100% definitely the same sex even if you are told they are- it is quite difficult to tell at that age and the pet shop can get it wrong sometimes.  You really don't want to end up with a litter of babies!<br>  <br>  To avoid any of thse potential problems, I would definitely suggest getting a second cage.  If you can't really afford another cage as big as the one you've already got, a small cage will do for starters for a baby hammy until you save up to get the bigger cage.<br>  <br>  Good luck - enjoy your hamsters!|`|D75rqaihaa	it should be ok, think about it, when you buy a hamster there all in the same cage? normally hamsters dont get on well and start fighting when sexually mature, but occassionally you get the odd couple of hamsters that if bought together will be fine, i know gerbils are fine infact happier in pairs, but dwarf hamster fight but also can be ok...the larger hamsters probably will fight, but if you only keep them together for tat 2 weeks they should be cool<br>  <br>  good luck with your hammies|`|nptdlUUqaa	I don't think the vet will lie! So what ever they say, you should do, they know a lot about animals(you probably know that)!<br>  <br>  Plus, syrian hamster do fight to death, when they live together, however, 6 weeks old is still young, so they won't fight and can probably stay together, until 8 weeks old!<br>  <br>  If they do fight, quickly stop it, and put one of them in a box, however hamsters gnaw and can bite through cardboard boxes and escape around the house! So just keep a close eye on it!<br>  <br>  Hoped I have helped!|`|yT6JNMdIaa	Yeah its true, because when you walk into a pet store, they always have young hamsters for sale and they are all from the same or different litter and in the same tank. its only when they get older that they need to be separated.|`|WahD9MWOaa	well would the vet lie? <br>  i dont think soo

Been there, done this. :o( I have 2 males who I almost lost to FLUTD, struvite crystals, bladder and kidney stones. I managed to cure both of them naturally (with the help of my vet) by feeding a species appropriate Raw food diet and adding in a regimen of natural supplements. <br>  <br>  My biggest piece of advice is if your vet advises you to use a “prescription diet” food… choose to skip that route and go for a strictly wet food diet, canned or raw, instead. Vets that prescribe dry prescription foods (GASP!) and even canned prescription diets as the cure to Urinary Tract problems obviously know nothing about feline nutrition and are only bandaiding the problem instead of preventing it in the first place. Sadly, most vets never learn anything about feline nutrition except what the cat food companies teach them when they get them to sell their product. Any vet that would tell you to put your already sick cat on a garbage food made with cheap fillers like Hills Science Diet, Royal Canin, or Purina Prescription clearly knows NOTHING about cats nutritional needs<br>  <br>  Cats were never designed to eat dry food. NEVER. They eat their prey whole and wet and they do not have a nearly nonexistent thirst mechanism. Because of that… cats are designed to eat only wet food. We idiot humans feed dry only for our convenience. They do not take in enough water on a dry diet and so their systems do not fully flush out so they get UTI issues. So, we, by feeding dry, are often the direct cause of all UTI issues in cats. Shows how much we used to know, huh? <br>  <br>  What you need to do is unconcentrate the cats urine so that crystals do not have time to form and the system flushed properly as it was designed to do. To do that you need to stop feeding all dry foods and switch to a STRICKTLY wet food diet. Either high quality canned, or a raw diet. It’s not cheap but it will cost you less in the long run than the vet. You can learn about raw food at www.catinfo.org or choose a high quality grain free canned food. No more dry food for your cat ever. Wet food only! <br>  <br>  I’ve also personally had success using Glucosomine and Chrondriton for preventing inflammation in the urethra. Discuss this with your vet. There are some major feline studies being done on this that are VERY promising! <br>  <br>  If your kittys urine needs more acidity because of struvite Crystals you can also add dry cranberry extract, just a pinch 2X a day on wet food. And you can try a pinch of Vitamin C sprinkled on as well. <br>  <br>  Give your kitty distilled water to drink only. Both my vet and I are convinced after speaking with vets all over the county that the hardness and mineral content in water in different areas contributes to the # of cases of UTI’s in those areas. From here on out… distilled water only. Another suggestion… is to get kitty a water fountain. I bought the Bigdog Drinkwell for my cats and keep it filled with distilled water and they love it. It’s a great way to encourage their water consumption.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, get yourself a bag of scientific litter so you can keep track of kittys PH levels at home. You won’t be able to detect the crystals at home that cause blockages, but if the ph was off… you could get kitty in for a urine analysis right away and possibly head off a blockage. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ex1Kuy1caa	The best low magnesium cat food is one that has less than 0.12% magnesium on a dry matter basis and less than 25g per 100 kilocalories of metabolizable energy.

Raw or quality canned is the ONLY way to go!  The ingredients in science diet are NOT what a cat would normally eat, it is a bunch of grain fillers and by products!  Thinks about what your cat would eat if it lived in the wild...feed as close to that as possible and he will be MUCH healthier!  Feeding them dry grain filled foods causes nothing but problems for them.|`|tJkCPbcaaa	Purina One for Urinary Tract Health...I have a cat that about 3-4 yrs ago had the same issues ...he has been on this food ever since and No problems...consider switching and buy it at walmart it is about $11 for 7lbs but the newspaper always has coupons for it

Oscars shouldn't be zooming around in their tanks. He's probably stressed about something. I had an Oscar who would dart around and I could tell he was stressed. He would freak out when ever I would be cleaning his tank. Best thing to do is call a pet store and ask them. Have you tried giving him night crawlers? My old oscar loved those! Good luck|`|tShDXmgbaa	Though they are meat eaters...they still need some other foods in their diet.  Cichlids pellets are very good for them as they contain everything  cichlids need to stay healthy.  Feeder fish alone will only cause your Oscar to become prone to sickness such as *whole in the head*.  Get him some cichlid pellets and he will do fine. My oscar zoomed around the tank soo much til one day he jumped out!  They are intellegent fish and are not the type of fish that are fast movers so what you are seeing is normal for an oscar.
XrPwrWPcaa	I would say that either one is good. If the bird likes to sing and socialize, it would probably be a male. Male cockatiels are known to have bright orange cheeks and lots of color. The females would have less coloring. It's also hard to tell the two apart if they are babies or very young. But I would highly reccomend a male because you don't want to have her laying unfertilized eggs. I think you should also do some research on what they need, like cages, toys, food, water, etc. Hope this helped! ( Also be patient for it to get used to it's surroundings and to you! )|`|x5HMQgQyaa	I am from Canada, so I don't know what pet shops are like over in Ireland, but here, some of them have open top pens, where you can actually stick your hand in and interact with the birds. Pick a friendly one, one that doesn't run in terror from your hand.<br>  <br>  But at the same time, don't get make to grab a bird. Extend your finger towards one, near the feet, slowly, and talk quietly and nicely to it.<br>  <br>  Males, generally, have brighter cheeks than female, and more color about them. This is just generally, and not a guarantee. The only way of knowing what gender you have for sure is a DNA test, or you can know owing to the fact of some sex linked mutations (but that is useless unless you are familiar with the parent birds, which in unlikely in a pet store situation)|`|vjijiJT3aa	get a male so you don't have to deal with eggs because the female will lay unfertilized eggs without a male.|`|YNoNwijoaa	i dont know if male or female is best, but i am sure like budgies there noses are different colours.hope this helps.<br>  lee|`|kHBCUxwHaa	male|`|kNscpF4Faa	Males will tweet and sing more and you don't have to worry about eggs..Get one that is friendly preferable not cage bound , doesn't bite and was hand feed by breeder

Do you know if it will fit your lifestyle? Weimaraners are not only extremely hyperactive hunting dogs,  they are extremely smart. If they get bored they become monsters. They need at least 1-2 hours of exercise and stimulation a DAY. Or they will develop behavioral problems. They love to counter surf which is because of boredom and there big appetite. They also are big chewers and they tend to get OCD. I would suggest you do lots of research on them before even considering this breed. <br>  <br>  Just because they are cute at that age that is not enough of a reason to go out and buy one.<br>  <br>  Its because of people like you that this lovely breed ends up at breed rescues all the time.<br>  <br>  Edit- Plus this is a broker site, only puppy mills and BYB's use this.

I'm sure you all have made a mistake or two when it comes to your pets, so you need to stfu. <br>  <br>  You should take her to a vet and get her checked out, there is no way of telling for sure if she's pregnant unless she goes to a vet.

aIZ6En8Kaa	Put it in a trash bag- push the bag down so it fits in nicely with the litter on it-- clean it daily with a scoop - if you get clumping litter. Weekly, take the bag out and all the litter goes right in it and you'll have nothing sticking to the bottom of the box! =) ..... <br>  (still wipe the box down with a cloth with anti-bacterial soap though - any dish soap will do)|`|nQdGGBN4aa	We have several cats and we use clumping litter and only have to clean the litter boxes about every 3 to 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  There is no amount of money which could get us to go back to the old fashioned gravel like litter.<br>  <br>  If you're not already using clumping litter, switch to it immediately. It makes the chore of keeping the litter box clean much, much easier.<br>  <br>  With clumping litter, we remove all urine clumps and fecal matter several times a day but only dump and wash the boxes about every 3 to 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  If you keep at least 4" of litter in the box (more is better), the urine will not reach the bottom of the box - it will be absorbed by the litter and a clump will be created. It is urine in the box which causes any odor problem and enough clumping litter will absorb the urine, keep it from reaching the bottom of the box, and eliminate most, if not all, of the odor.<br>  <br>  Keep a thick layer of litter in the box and add more as you scoop out the clumps and fecal matter.<br>  <br>  As long as you have sufficient litter to prevent any urine reaching the bottom of the box, you don't have to clean the entire box very often.<br>  <br>  As to what to use to clean a litter box - I simply use something like Mr. Clean or another general cleaner - you don't need to sterilize the box, just wash it out.<br>  <br>  I dump the litter from the box into a large, strong trash bag - I usually use two bags, one inside the other, for strength. I bang on the box to get as much litter out as possible. There may be some stuck to the sides of the litter box, but banging on it usually releases all of it. If any remains, I use a rag to scrub it loose.<br>  <br>  I want to get almost all of the litter out of the box before I begin to wash it because I dump the wash water into the toilet and too much litter dumped into the toilet can clog it up.<br>  <br>  After dumping the litter into the trash bag, I put the box in the bathtub and run water into it and scrub the sides and bottom with a rag to loosen any small bits of litter stuck to the sides or bottom.<br>  <br>  Then I dump the water in to the toilet and flush it - don't dump the water into the tub if there is a lot of litter in the water, it could stop up the toilet.<br>  <br>  If you have a lot of litter in the water, let it set so that the litter will settle to the bottom of the box. Then pour as much of the water into the toilet as possible without pouring in a lot of litter. You can then take a rag and scoop out the litter and put it in the trash bag.<br>  <br>  Once I have dumped the first rinse water into the toilet, I put the box back in the bathtub and run hot water into it and add a cleaner such as Mr. Clean and scrub the box thoroughly with a rag.<br>  <br>  Then I dump the water into the toilet, flush the toilet, and rinse the box again.<br>  <br>  Then I use rags or paper towels to get the box fairly dry so that when I put in new litter it does not clump.<br>  <br>  I then put the box back in place, add new litter, and then I wash my hands.<br>  <br>  So, use clumping litter, keep at least 4" of litter in the litter box, remove clumps and fecal matter often, and you will not have to wash the box very often.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Safe... yes.

If you have a busy, active household then get a breed that is active, playful, and can keep up, like a Siamese, Egyptian Mau, or even an exotic Bengal.  If you have a calm household, with no kids, or if you can't be there because you have to work an 8 hour day, then go with a breed that is easy going and independent, like an American Shorthair, Scottish Fold, or a Maine Coon.<br>  <br>  Of course, it all depends on the cats personality, and what you're looking for, so make sure to do your research before buying any kitty. Make sure the breeder has a good reputation and has a registered cattery; don't buy from a backyard breeder.<br>  <br>  Looking in a shelter is also a good and probably better option, because its cheaper than buying a purebred cat, you get to see and visit the cat instead of just looking a pictures on websites, and sometimes you can even get lucky and find purebred cats in shelters!|`|evnj2DUpaa	All kittens are very playful and sweeties! Go to an ASPCA or a shelter who rescues animals who have been mistreated, they all need TLC and a good home! Let the kitten pick you, and watch out for naughty behavior and selfishness.

Best of luck!|`|nQdGGBN4aa	I second the advice of others about going to the Humane Society or other animal shelter to get kitten.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you the story about how Schuster joined our family.<br>  <br>  My wife and I had just gotten married, we had two cats who we adopted  before we got married - they lived with me prior to us getting married on November 28, 1987<br>  <br>  I grew up with dogs and Sharon grew up with cats. I knew we were going to have cats.<br>  <br>  Simon joined our lives in February of 1987 and Tom arrived a couple of months later. Both were from the Humane Society.<br>  <br>  Simon was 6 months old when we adopted him and Tom was a year old.<br>  <br>  One day, I told Sharon, "I have two cats and I've never had a kitten."<br>  <br>  We were already planning on getting a third cat and Sharon said "Okay, let's go get one"<br>  <br>  We went to the Humane Society. It must have been kitten season because there were dozens - if not hundreds - of kittens in the kitten cage.<br>  <br>  There was a note on the door which said "Don't open the door, get someone to help you."  The cage was actually a fenced in area, large enough for you to walk into.<br>  <br>  Sharon went to find someone and I stood there looking at what seemed to be hundreds of kittens all on top of and wrapped around each other.<br>  <br>  A small black furry ball detached itself from the lump of kittens and walked over the to cage door, climbed up the door, and screamed in my face.<br>  <br>  I can only think that he was yelling "Get me the hell out of here!"<br>  <br>  Well, I opened the cage door and grabbed him and got the door closed before any of the other kittens knew it was open.<br>  <br>  When Sharon got back with someone, I was standing there holding the kitten against my chest.<br>  <br>  I instantly named him Schuster and we took him home and into our hearts.<br>  <br>  I had named Simon for Carly Simon, the greatest signer and song writer in recorded history.  (he was named Furball when we adopted him from a friend of Sharon's sister and I just couldn't bear to inflict that name on him so I changed his name to Simon)<br>  <br>  The "Simon" in the publishing company "Simon & Schuster" was Carly Simon's father.<br>  <br>  So I named the new kitten, Schuster. Had it been female, I would have named her Carly.<br>  <br>  But, because it was male, I decided on Schuster.<br>  <br>  Schuster was a fantastic kitten and an even more fantastic cat.<br>  <br>  Schuster left us on October 24, 2007. We euthanized him because his kidneys had failed completely. He was nearly 20 years old and letting him go was a very difficult decision but we know we did the right thing.<br>  <br>  Schuster was everything anyone would want in a kitten and cat. He was a splendid, lovable furry person.<br>  <br>  So - you don't need a pure bred kitten to find a friend for life.<br>  <br>  Go to the Humane Society or other animal shelters and you'll find more than enough great kittens to choose from.<br>  <br>  Please help reduce the number of cats and kittens killed every week at shelters simply because they don't have a home.<br>  <br>  -- Simon was diagnosed with diabetes on February 26, 2000<br>  <br>  You can read about it at <a href="http://www.sugarcatsimon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugarcatsimon.com</a><br>  <br>  That link will redirect you to the actual web site at <a href="http://home.att.net/~sugarcat_simon" rel="nofollow">http://home.att.net/~sugarcat_simon</a><br>  <br>  The <a href="http://www.sugarcatsimon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugarcatsimon.com</a> is simply easier to enter|`|oAdPL4vWaa	Why do u want another you've already got one pussy

Aphids are soft bodied insects that suck the juices out of plants. If you have roses in your garden, you have seen aphids. Aphids also come in a variety of colors and not all ladybugs like all the "flavors" of aphids. Ladybugs will also feed on scale insects and plant mites.
veDvtYhJaa	Dogs don't make sudden changes like that for no reason.  You missed something.  Think about the last time he went again and try to figure it out.  <br>  <br>  Since he's acting so out of character, it's time for a vet check.  Explain how very differently he's acting and see if the vet can do some testing to make sure he's in good health.  Some health problems could cause this. <br>  <br>  You don't have to take him to a dog park to exercise him.  There are other ways to do so.  You can work him on a treadmill.  If you have a yard, you can exercise him at home. <br>  <br>  Unlike what your first repsonder said, you can't "force him" to enjoy himself.  You need to find out what's the problem.  That's a serious challenge since your dog cannot tell you in speech.  Dogs use non-verbal communication.  <br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt to try to take him to the dog park and just walk around there with him on leash and see how he responds.  You need SOME kind of non-verbal feedback from him to help you figure out what's going on in his mind or body.  -!-|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Maybe there is something on the walk to the park that is disturbing/scaring him?

QMpCqZZnaa	Ugh, story of my life.  My husband and my cat are always feuding.   Your kitties are technically still kittens, though, and you have to start teaching them to behave before they get stuck in their ways.  <br>  <br>  The problem is it takes time and patience to discipline a cat.  Normal pet tactics wouldn't work on them.  I find that spraying a cat with a spray bottle is the best method.  (one of my cats doesn't mind water, so I add just a half of a teaspoon of vinegar to make the spray unpleasant, be sure to always avoid the face!) <br>  <br>  They also dislike loud noises.  A rolled up newspaper smacked on the counter near them, or a loud hiss will sometimes send them running to the other room.<br>  <br>  And, maybe it would be cathartic for your husband if he gets to spray the cat that wrecked his plane? ;)|`|xZE995X1aa	An easy and un exspencive way to keep cats away from somthing valuble or stop them from going near there is if you have a small bowl and fill it with either lemon.lime or orange peel (anything citrus) and the cats will stay away becaus they hate citrus it stopped my cats ripping up the carpets and walls|`|YcGyqGsAaa	spray bottle <br>  <br>  <br>  doesn't hurt them and they get the point <br>  <br>  <br>  I have same issues with my spouse and the cats<br>  try to find some common ground maybe lock up things that can get ruined. <br>  <br>  cats are curious so be cautious of things left around|`|kjAWsDwLaa	One trick for the counters and tables that I've read about but not tried, is to put a piece of cardboard on the surface with one edge sticking out 4-6 inches.  If the cat jumps up, the cardboard will flip up and dump kitty to the floor.  For reinforcement, if it's necessary, put a couple of empty cola cans on the cardboard for noise.|`|evnj2DUpaa	LOL my cats do that too! For the counter, you could try putting aluminum foil on there, it scares the heck out of them! If you have a fish tank, put a cover on it and make sure it is secure. I know how you feel, I love my kitties too. There is no reason why you shouldn't be able to keep them. If it helps you with your husband and their behavior is getting rambunctious, then I think there might be a pet training thing where you can curb this behavior. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Cats also don't like citrus and cayenne pepper.

fgxajTiBaa	"Labradoodles" are nothing more than an overpriced mutt, the same that you could find at a shelter. In fact! WE HAVE one right now! You want to know why? Because they are not hypoallergenic and they DO shed. Years ago someone decided it might be a good idea to mix the two to produce a non shedding/lab like dog, but they dropped the idea quickly because they saw that the puppies they produced could be anything between a poodle and a lab, personality and appearance. We have a lab/poodle mix that came into our salon that shed worse than any lab I've ever seen, and she was like 3 months old.<br>  <br>  If you want a dog that is better for allergies, look into poodles, bichons, airedales, Irish water Spaniel, etc. AKC has a whole list of dogs that are known to be better for people with allergies.

If so they will breed.<br>  And no they cannot be friends because they can mate extremely quickly, under a minute I believe, and that would be extremely unfortunate.<br>  Sadly, they cannot befriend but maybe under extremely supervised play sessions they could meet each other?<br>  Also keep the hammies far from each other because they can mate THROUGH bars on a cage.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|yT6JNMdIaa	Hamsters and other animals arnt like humans, they don't breed if they dont want to, its thier instinct to breed, and they will breed.|`|epywmmHjaa	They will mate as soon as they smell eachover. And if they're syrians then the female will try to kill the male after they have mated. I believe some vets could neuter or spay them, but it wouldn't be worth the money. Keep them apart, for their sake.<br>  <br>  luv Ellen :)|`|xCvOSzpJaa	You could put the cages about 3 inches or so apart, then they could see each other? that;s about it!|`|6i1NM95Haa	in the same cage they eill breed. Plus syrians are solitary so will fight no matter what|`|uEDDlofhaa	yeah, just be prepared for some babie hammies too
gU34xa9vaa	You don't say how long you've had your cat but she must have been very traumatised at being in a fire and her owner dying. Well done to your dad for saving her and bringing her home. The cat will be wondering what has happened to her first owner and will need a lot of time and patience to adjust to her new life.You need to be very calm and gentle with her and  talk to her a lot in a quiet voice so she gets used to you and trusts you. Don't try to pick her up or stroke her where she doesn't like to be touched for now,just tickle around her head and ears if she likes that. You could get some catnip toys for her and a scratching post, she'll love them.Also see if she will play chasing a bit of string you drag along, games like that.Try to make her happy if you can and she will love you a lot once she settles down.Good luck.|`|m16gf9mzaa	The growling is a message.  It means the cat does not like what you are doing.  Bobby does not owe it to you to let you touch her belly.  It was very generous of your family to take her in after that fire, but the cat has been under enormous stress, so please respect her wishes.  Just think how you would feel if your home burned down and all your family died except you.  Then another family generously offered to let you live with them, but kept touching you in places you did not want to be touched - would you want them to respect your wishes when you tell them not to touch you there?|`|f2AWSb48aa	Maybe she just doesnt like being touched, you could always take her to the vet just incase the cat does have some kind of skin problem or something that is actually causing her pain when you touch her, maybe from the fire? :/|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Your cat does not like to be stroked in those particular places.<br>  <br>  You may find that the only place you can stroke her is around her head, under her chin, and back of neck.<br>  <br>  Some cats hate their tummies being stroked, and some cats do not like to be touched anywhere except for their head.<br>  <br>  She might tolerate her shoulders being stroked, but not further down near her tail.   The growl is a warning that she doesn't like it.|`|lIO4uiJmaa	A lot of cats dislike having their bellies rubbed. It is their most vulnerable part of their body and they would have to trust you 200% to allow you touch them there.  Maybe when you hand goes down to her tail end, she worries that you will go near her belly.  Her growl is just to warn you that she dislikes it.<br>  <br>  why not rub her ears or chin or another part that she enjoys instead ?|`|eFvNJOJ8aa	Maybe she is always growling at you because she is not use to you and she is angry that her owner died.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	Never stroke a cat on the belly. For a start it's there vulnerable area and some cat's (not mine) don't like people touching them there. Try stroking your cat in different areas like her sides or her head. See where she likes to be touched and where she doesn't.|`|AmKbvgmwaa	i started doing it when they were kittens even now a year later when i turn them over they play dead or just roll over to be rubbed, yours wasn't brought up like that same as there mum who was rescued and very rarely can you stroke her anywhere and when you can its when she wants it done, leave her be, try her with a laser light most cats go mad for them, she can chase its in cats nature to chase things, might help|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	my male is like that. But he don't growl he just bites. My female don't like her belly rubbed anymore. she used to love it but she has had kittens and has been spayed since then, so i'm sure that has a lot to do with it. Just don't rub her back and tail anymore.|`|Yf4PKEBaaa	First of all, cats generally do NOT like their bellies touched like dogs do [unless they are fat.  Fat kitties love their belly rubbed, but not all the time].  She is aggressive.  Not all animals are happy, loving pets.  My cat is an asshole.|`|ex1Kuy1caa	Cats dont like there belly rubed, only when there a kitten Or VERY FAT, my cat does this but shes 8 years old :)|`|7iiOJKILaa	cats don't like their belly touched. most of them don't like their tails messed with either (or at least mine doesn't). maybe the previous owner abused the cat in some way. u never no.

Yepl4Kucaa	Stallions will fight, so it it is a colt, you should geld it as soon as possible, and if a stallion doesnt recognize the scent on the foal as his own, he will kill it. It is a female, it should be okay for a while, but when she gets old enough to conceive you should mvoe her somewhere else or geld your stallion.|`|2O58btqxaa	depends what the shetland is if its a stallion then deffo no and if its a mare then deffo no but a gelding should be ok just keep an eye on them
s4OtfZ7Gaa	try the gentle leader, you can get them at your local pet store! they are wonderful training collars, and then get her into a group obedience class in your area so she can get some socialization and manners! i would definitely consult a professional on it though instead of trying to do it yourself and good luck!|`|wyfjsfikaa	I would also get enrolled in a training class I personally would go on the APDT list and search for a qualified trainer in your area.Head collars are great but stay away from the Halti brand they are easy to get out of> i would go with a gentle leader kind they are much better. The dog might fight it though so a trainer should help you with it I also like easy walk harness or a snse-antion harness for walking big dogs.|`|8RLi8LYSaa	Honestly, it's not the collar. It's the fact that she just needs to understand what "no" means. Understand that just as a human baby does not know what words mean and needs to be taught their meaning, puppies don't come automatically knowing what the word "no" means. Also, dogs don't come instinctively with directions to know what a leash is. They need to be "leash trained".<br>  If she's timid, she should be dominanced pretty easily and probably is a very submissive dog. Turn her on her back, hold her head and calm her down, especially if she gets overly excited. Do this in front of the children and she will understand that her place in the pack is beneath them. Dogs don't care what their position is int he pack, so long as they are in it. Obedience training will help, if anything just to give you some pointers on remaining consistent. Sometimes I think obedience training is less about the dog and more about teaching owners how to properly interact with the dog (not saying that as an insult, it's always good to learn new tricks! :) ).|`|UC9Wjjscaa	she is still pretty young but I would say get a handle on it as soon as possible.  She needs to know humans in house are the pack leaders.  They make wonderful dogs but can tend to want to be in charge if allowed.  I just got one he is only 9 weeks but he is biting alot.  He is bad about going after pant legs.  I have just started using a water bottle to squirt him and saying no loudly when he does this and it seems to be helping.  As far as the leash that can be hard, I put mine on leash the day after I brought him home and just let him drag it around so he could get used to it and he is doing ok with it but still bites at it some.  I think you need to find a good trainer not a collar.  These dogs can be dangerous if not trained properly.  The investment in good training will pay off.  Especially having small children around your dog needs to understand very quickly that mouthing is not acceptable behavior before she hurts one of the kids.  These dogs bite is one of the strongest and it will not take much for her to really hurt a child while trying to play if she does not know what is good.  <br>  Especially with her being timid she may bite out of fear as she gets bigger. I plan on doing basic training myself with mine but when he gets to be about 6 months old I am going to take him to a very reputable trainer for advanced training just to make sure I will be able to control him when he weighs in over 100 pounds full grown. Good Luck.|`|qioH81tiaa	Timid and shock or electronic collars DO NOT go together, if that is what you mean by "training" collar.  <br>  <br>  I have no problems with e-collars - on the right dog, at the right stage of training, and with a knowledgeable handle.<br>  <br>  Your situation doesn't qualify for ANY of those criteria.<br>  <br>  You need to find a GREAT trainer to help you.  If you use a e-collar on this dog, you will make it worse, guaranteed.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	i would recommend a head collar. she cant pull from you. it would be a good training collar. walmart has them or you can go to a pet store.<br>  <br>  i think you should invest in training bc your dog wants to understand you but doesnt know how.<br>  <br>  check into petsmart or petco training classes.<br>  <br>  good luck and thanks for being kind and giving a not so perfect dog a loving home.|`|26PPwzrWaa	<a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a> Read free articles, especially It takes a pack to raise a puppy. <br>  <br>  Start expecting more from her now. Now more mouthing. <br>  <br>  She should get puppy play though. <br>  <br>  Enroll in obedience classes. <br>  <br>  Socialize her is you dont want to get bitten. Cut her nails, clean her ears teeth, etc. Expose her to people, bikes, dogs on lead, etc. Everything. <br>  And if she starts tugging, invest in a prong collar, but find a professional willing show you how it is used so you dont end up causing damage to the dogs throat.|`|atzw0IP4aa	You can get a training collar at Petco. Just know how to use it. You need a training class. Shepherds are great but you need t train them right from the beginning.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would recommend talking to a trainer about using any type of training tool. Many of them need to be used in a certain manner, and misuse could cause injury OR worse behavior problems. Most of the time i try to shy away from using training tools unless the dog really needs it. Mainly because if you remove them without backing the tool up with training, the dog will go right back to doing what it did before.<br>  <br>  With that in mind i use two - i walk my dog with a Prong collar and every so often use an e-collar in the home. Both are used to back up negative commands like "Leave it" or "no pull" and both are used randomly (in no particular order or time period.) <br>  <br>  Both tools are being used at my trainers advice and after a few good lessons from her on HOW to use them properly. They have worked well so far and i see improvements daily. Talk to your trainer and find one that works with you and doesn't stick to one method only (some only use positive re-enforcement, which can work well with some dogs... but each dog is different and trainers really should realize that not every dog will accept or learn well under one method.)

aCqSF87Raa	Does mom even want a dog yet? She may still be grieving over the loss of the other one. Her comment about smaller dogs may be just a thing like "Well if we get another one, i would want smaller."<br>  <br>  Besides, unless you are over 18 you won't be able to buy OR adopt a dog without her with you. That's the law, plus no responsible person would hand one over to anyone who couldn't prove their age. No responsible person would hand one over to someone wanting to make a "surprise" out of the dog, either.<br>  <br>  Everyone in the home must be on board AND knowlegable before you bring a dog in. Period. Surprises are usually not a good idea, especially if mom is merely thinking ad not committed to the idea.  Plus, mom really needs to choose the dog herself: it will be HERS, after all, and her idea of a "good dog" may not be yours.<br>  <br>  PS - You want a "well trained dog" but many people would jack up the price for that. It's considered a plus and isn't always available.|`|XacL7v9Xaa	Just don't. That's all.

QMl4ELhGaa	8 hours is too long to leave an 8 week old puppy in a crate with no breaks to go potty and eat/drink. If you are unable to get to him in that 8 hour time, I would keep him in a bathroom or some other room instead with pee pads in one area and an area with water and bedding. I found that my puppy ate her food better when I pretended to be eating it. Also, if you keep a schedule eventually they learn that if they do not eat when you give it to them then they will go without for a while. As for the pee pad training, if you notice your puppy sniffing around like they are about to pee, take them to the pee pad and place them on it. When they go on it, quietly praise them and when they are done get real happy about it and give them a small treat. When you notice your dog going where they should not, scold them loudly. If you do not see them make the mess, do not scold them for it because they will not understand why you are yelling at them.|`|R4k613CEaa	I agree with the 8 hours being to much for such a little guy to be locked up. Have you thought about the health risks of using the bathroom in the same area that you have to eat in? And there is no way that little guy can go 8+ hours without eating. <br>  As far as using pee pads & such, you HAVE to remember, he is 2 MONTHS OLD! He is going to take at least a good month of tireless training for him to understand what you want from him. And you can NOT get mad at him or shout at him for a natural bodily function. Thats like spanking a child who has an accident in his pants. We are the parents- its our job to teach them right from wrong, not just be brutish because they did wrong. Lots of love, attention & praise will get you farther then yelling or smacking. Remember he's young!!<br>  And the mornings hes not eating could simply be a case of him missing you so much overnight that he is to excited to see you to think about food. I personally spend the morning giving my dogs all the attention I can fit in before I leave, then feed them right before I walk out the door. That way they are distracted from you leaving them.<br>  Also, you can buy puppy pee drops to put on the pee pads. This helps by giving the pup an idea of just what you want him to do with that pad. My min pin used to play with her pads, I tried the pee drops & she began using them for the potty & not a source of amusement. And give him lots of toys to entertain himself while you are away. We forget that we are the only source of interaction our dogs get- they dont watch tv or chat on the phone while were gone!! We are their only source for love & attention- But all this time & effort on your part will be sooo worth it in a couple months when you have the best friend you could ask for! With dogs you get back exactly what you put in!
UC9Wjjscaa	They can be great pets but do take a good bit of care.  You have to get the tank set up right.  The need special lights and heat so that they can digest their food correctly.  They will need a variety of foods not just store bought.  They have to have fresh fruits and veges daily.  They are prone to calcium diffiecienies  also.  I learned this the hard way.  I had one once and he started acting funny and his feet looked weird like he had arthritis. I took him to the vet and they said he had a calcium defieciency. He had to have shots to get his calcium up to normal and a very special strict diet after that.  The vet said they are not easy to keep and can be expensive to do it right.  They said many pet shops mislead about them and their care.  They are not recommended for someone that is just starting out with lizards.  One other thing to remember with any reptile.  After handling it wash your hands well cause the can carry disease. I ended up giving mine away to someone with more experience because it was so time consuming and expensive to care for him properly. P.S. mine never bit he was real sweet but then he was handled alot from a young age.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	They are good, they don't normally bite. But they do have along tail that they whip around like a whip when they are pissed off. It can sting a little. And they take a lot of care, Heat lamps, heat rocks, crickets, exctra. Also they can grow up to 6 feet long. So think about it!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Iguanas bite, scratch and whip with their tails. They can grow to six foot long and become aggressive and formiddable lizards. They are not for the timid, or for those without a LOT of experience in reptile care. If you are afraid of being bitten, I suggest a bearded dragon they are gentle, calm lizards, the most they will do is hiss and puff their beard up at you, you will not cope well with a giant like an iguana if you are scared of being bitten.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	i dont think there good pets, having a 6 foot lizard that dont have the best attitudes or reputations around can be alot harder than people think. also the time and money and vivarium size need to be taken into account like where are u gonna put a 10x8x8 foot viv lol here's alot of information about them including temperment from an experts <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html</a> shes the woman who wrote iguanas for dummies as well as alot of other books|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Iguana's done bite...they whip you with their tails.

He didn't like to be handled and wanted to climb every surface he could, scratching it up and knocking things down.|`|fmATfubnaa	Yeahh their awesome, dont worry they dont bite :)|`|p4kex5J7aa	They are awesome pets, but as the others said, keeping an Iguana Iguana needs a huge terrarium.

DtkLsetkaa	you need to be more concerned if YOU are ready to do so.  Why do you want to breed?  How much experience do you have?  Is it for money, or just because kittens are "oh so cute"?  These are bad reasons, and only contribute to the overpopulation of animals in the country.  If you were a reputable breeder, there would be no need for you to ask this question, so that being said, please have your cat neutered :)|`|aP4bkYOCaa	You should not be breeding your cat unless he is a pedigreed show male. There are over 100,000 cats on Petfinder waiting for homes and hundreds of thousands more in animal shelters, being euthed every day.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Why do you want to breed him? <br>  <br>  Is he of champion bloodlines? <br>  <br>  Has he titled in shows? <br>  <br>  I'm sure the answer is no or you wouldn't be referring to him as a "ginger tom".  Ginger isn't even a cat colour.<br>  <br>  So why breed him? Every kitten you let him bring into this world means another kitten or cat put to death at a shelter. And if those kittens go on to breed fact is, you could be singlehandedly responsible for FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND kittens in a seven year period. Do you really want that many kittens and cats put to death BECAUSE OF YOU? <br>  <br>  Do the responsible thing - GET YOUR CAT NEUTERED!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Cats become sexually mature from 6 months up.  Look for him trying to escape, spraying urine on everything, and acting aggressively.  Do you have good homes lined up for the 14 kittens he might produce (if he only mates with 1 female) or do plan on letting him be a Walkaway Joe?  Has he been tested for genetic issues and blood type compatibility with the female you plan to mate him with?  Are you willing to provide a lifetime return policy on the kittens should the owners ever have a situation where they can't keep it?  Do you have money for vet bills for all the kittens till they are 12-16 weeks old?  Is this a breeder quality pedigreed cat with show titles?  All these are things ethical breeders do and consider when breeding cats.  Anything less makes you a backyard breeder responsible for the untimely deaths of 10,000+ healthy cats and kittens EVERY DAY in shelters.  Every home you find for your cat's kittens is a home who won't be adopting a kitten whose life depends on finding a home.<br>  <br>  Have your cat neutered.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Allie used to do that too.  I started growing cat grass for her and now all my cats love it!  Just get a shallow pot and some wheat seeds and grow a little "garden" for her.  Stagger a few pots at 2 weeks apart so you never run out.  Some cats do eat grass to settle upset tummies but some just like the taste.  At any rate, it's not too much of her to ask for a little grass to munch on. Before my indoor grass was ready, I would just pick some and bring it in to mine.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	She needs her veggies too!

6KxBqnstaa	Keep him warm by placing a heating source under cage and a blanket over it and keep him in dim lit and quiet room so he is less stressed. Check on him often. could be many things from air bubble to URI to a avian disease or even a chemical in the air of your home. Get to the vet asap as I see you are doing. Call ER vets and see if any see birds in your area as some do. Can also put a vaporizer or warm mist humidifier in room with him. Good luck.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	Too many crackers?<br>  <br>  Sorry, would be best to call your vet back and ask if there are any comforting things you can do for your parrot, especially if he's been treated by the same doctor before.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Call the vet back and describe the symptoms and see if you can get him in sooner . This sounds like respitory distress. This could  be an infection or even pnuemonia. Not eating is a symptom of illness. This is not a wait and see situation.In the meantime keep him warm and quiet. A humidifier may help or a pot of steamy water nearby. . Don't let him get a chill but don't cook him either.. If the desk person gives you a hard time ask to talk to the vet personally.

Take him into the bathroom and run the shower on hot. Let him breathe it in. Definitely call the vet back and move the appointment to something ASAP. Anytime a bird won't eat it is very serious. You have to remember, birds mask their symptoms because it makes them vulnerable otherwise. He could have been sick for quite a while before the symptoms are actually noticeable.|`|tIg3low2aa	Check and see if he has a bulging bubble type swelling around his neck!  Birds tend to get these a lot and the vet may have to use a needle to help it.
evnj2DUpaa	I think she may have ingested something she shouldn't have. Keep a close eye on her. Does she throw up blood, or something that looks like grass? You may have to take her to the vet if either is true. I pray that she will be alright, and make sure she eats and drinks. Best of luck.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Now you need your vet by your side.  Get her there soon.  Anytime a cat displays strange behavior, it's likely there's a medical issue and only a vet can tell what's going on and how to treat it.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	You need to take her to a vet. FYI this is standard procedure when you're worried your pet might be ill or injured.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	Take to vet immediately sounds like she had gotten into something she wasn't suppose to.

C1eHfhrHaa	Go to the shelter and pick out a medium-large sized mixed breed dog that is about 1.5-3 years old.  That way, you won't go through the hassles of puppyhood (house breaking, crate training, chewing, etc..) and your new friend will be big enough on day one to hike with you and act as a deterrent.  Most dogs will protect owner and property regardless of breed.  Go to www.petfinder.com and search by zip code.  This will give you a preview of what you can find in your local shelters.  And it costs alot less to adopt from a shelter than to buy a pure bred dog from a reputable breeder.  I know one of the side effects of being in college is sometimes a lack of ready funds :-)  Good luck!|`|UC9Wjjscaa	If you have time to devote to training and bonding with it a German Shepherd would be excellent.  They are very protective over there owners and territory.  They have great coats to withstand weather.  But I don't agree with leaving one outside all the time.  I think any animal should be a part of the family and allowed in the house, especially at night.  He would alert you to anything going on and they will protect you with their life if loved and taken care of good. Also just the mere size of them (when full grown up to 100+ lbs) and the rep they have gotten in police work will make a lot of people think twice about messing with them or their owner.|`|C6d4ndMOaa	Hopefully you plan on staying at the place where you are staying at now because it wouldn't be fair to your dog to keep moving place to place as your budget changes. I don't know where you fall as far as expenses go so can you really afford to maintain a dog by providing veterinary care and food? Food is not expensive, the vet bills for check-ups and shots are. <br>  <br>  Read up on your first 3 choices of breeds on dogs and see what seems a better fit for you. Obviously some dogs are more protectors than others. If you have a dog park close by or have a park where you see a lot of people with dogs, talk to some of the owners about the breed. I'm assuming your a female so maybe you can ask other women about their dogs.<br>  <br>  It's takes time and effort to train a dog to be obedient so it's not going to do what you want right away. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your search!|`|Bw18seFqaa	A trained personal protection dog will cost you $30,000-40,000 and up.<br>  <br>  <br>  You dont need a dog that is trained for personal protection, or an aggressive dog..  just one that will alert and bark..  most intruders will just not bother with homes that they know has a dog.  Find a breed that fits your lifestyle and personality.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also reccommend you sign up for a self-defence class.. your college may even offer one.|`|om4Szik7aa	German Shepherd. They will protect you until the death and are fearless in doing so. They are loyal, and people know not to mess with them.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Please understand that one does not merely purchase a dog and keep it in the fenced in yard to protect you. It's expensive in time, effort, and cash, to own a dog. I suggest you read up on this project before you find yourself looking for a rescue group to take your unruly canine, no matter what breed you select.|`|USF8xNfhaa	Well anyone that wants to do you harm isnt going to care about a dog theyd just kill it to get to you. there are a number of dogs that were breed for protection it also depends on yard size german sheperds ,doberman ,rotts, german shepherds are very smart in determining of character of a person so if you see one growling or shying away from someone you can kind of figure their trouble but if your a female get a male or vice vera|`|8pdMGoCSaa	you only want a dog for protection? cmon dude, you need to have a better reason for that. no matter the breed, no matter the circumstances, i feel that no pet should be put into that situation. im not a hippy PETA loser, i just feel pets deserve a good, solid home.<br>  <br>  im getting rid of my jack russel puppy because i cannot support him to the fullest. he will need tons of room, tons of attention, and i dont have either.|`|xJKJDyyMaa	german shepards, doberman pinchers they basically have a very mean look so i know i wouldnt mess with one , rotweilers, pitbuls are friendly dogs depending on how you bring them up but i wouldnt recomment this because if you live in a bad area they might steal him to make him fight lol but any ways any dog can be made into a guard dog even a poodle or something but its best to get a dog that "looks" mean with a big bark and im sure no one will mess with you|`|nFiTpDAeaa	My first answer would be German Shephard. But if you are in any way still unstable in your life, you may just want to foster/adopt from your local shelter. If you get a dog that is out of puppy stages (which makes life easier and is less time straining on you), you will already know his temperment and exactly what his coat type will be.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	I can name several off the top of my head.  However most of these breeds require a strong dominant owner and are not for first time dog owners.  I question the reason you want a dog.  Its awesome to have a dog that is a built in security system but should not be the only reason you own one.|`|ZY6svhldaa	German shepherds are known for being good guard dogs, and they have thick fur to keep them warm.<br>  <br>  Also, there are usually a good number of them at animal shelters, so you could easily adopt and save some money :)|`|FfLq56Yfaa	Personally, I like rotties.  They'll bond to you, and will be a wonderful companion.  But they can scare the crap outta people :)  Big dog, too, that can handle colder weather.<br>  Good luck!|`|iByp9i2Naa	Tea-Cup Chihuahua.  Absolutely vicious!|`|22TL93dzaa	if you are truly serious about your personal protection then you should take a look at the canis panther.  this is an extremely powerful breed that was bred in the 1970's for the purpose of personal protection. and since you are willing to let him/her sleep in your bed then the canis panther is a perfect choice 4 u. they don't shed much. they are extremely wary and untrusting of strangers which makes them perfect protection dogs. here is a link<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/canispanther.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/canispanther...</a>|`|ESwB3ETraa	if you have room a st bernard would be a good dog for protection, they are HUGE and in some placess are used as mountain rescue dogs

Totally normal.|`|fFtBqFB6aa	What should you do?<br>  <br>  Take that time to get stuff done around the house. lol|`|D75rqaihaa	puppies do sleep quiet alot generally, my pup had sessions like, 1 hr play, 1 hr sleep, like that throughout the day...so there's nothing to worry about really...<br>  but if you are generally concerned you could get him checked by a vet, just to put your mind at rest...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA12240972	Yeah just like a baby they need a lot of sleep.  Believe me there will be times you will be like "dang why don't he go to sleep?"

Wg1ZTdUYaa	He looks like a fuzzy holland. Did you get him from a breeder? The breeder might have been trying to improve their fuzzy lop by crossing it with a holland lop! <br>  alot of breeders are doing that these days. you rabbit doesn't have as long of fur as it should have to be a purebred fuzzy lop. Some lops will never lop, and some will only lop 1 ear, it just depends on the genetics and such. I can tell you that his color is broken black!|`|5M57TTfpaa	he looks like a holland lop, possibly mixed with endlish spot(actually it seems to really have the features of one). he doesnt seem fuzzy enough to be mixed with a fuzzy lop.<br>  <br>  here is a holland lop<br>  <a href="http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-gallery/small-animal-pictures-breeders-babies/holland-lop-pictures-breeders-babies/pictures/holland-lop-0063.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-ga...</a><br>  <br>  and here is an english spot<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/jazzyrabbit/rabbits/topic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/jazzyrabbit/rabb...</a> i know, not a very likely pair, but possible.<br>  <br>  this is my rabbit. he i believe is english spot cross with ...hotot?<br>  <a href="http://s34.photobucket.com/albums/d101/kristen989/?action=view¤t=DSCN2133.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s34.photobucket.com/albums/d101/k...</a><br>  he also has the half broken line down his back like yours, where as you can see in the picture of the english spot, it is a whole line down the back. i only know of the english spot and checkered giant(which is larger than the spot but still looks the same)that have that line on the back.<br>  <br>  yeah, that lady didnt really know what she was talking about, she must have thought it was a french lop, which is a larger lop. he should be stopped growing soon, wait til he is about a year old. he might gain another lb or 2. rabbits tend to live up to 10 years if taken good care of, sometimes longer. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!|`|O6r6Zqsuaa	I'm not sure what breed he is, he looks like some kind od cross between a holand and something else.|`|m32Oq4cfaa	He is VERY cute.  What's his name?  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what kind of rabbit he is.  Could possibly just be a mixed breed.  Maybe he's a lop mixed with something else.<br>  <br>  Your cat looks almost exactly like mine does.  Though, my cat isn't as comfortable around my rabbits as yours is.  lol|`|aoHjYqrHaa	Idk...With his ears up he looked like a holland mixed with a dwarf but then i seen him put his ears down and he looks like a holland mixed with something.I think he's a holland mixed with a dwarf maybe..?|`|EdOD5V3yaa	well I can't tell you what kind of rabbit that is in the picture  ( psss your rabbit is a cat!!!!!)
x86mC8yyaa	So sorry to hear about your dog, I know how I felt when ours died. You are the best judge of when you are ready for a new puppy, don't take any notice of people who tell you to wait, if you have found your new friend and she just happens to be 4 weeks old at the moment. We had to wait 4 months for ours, because the mother dog was only just newly pregnant and the breeder said we could have a puppy from the litter, and it seemed a terrible long time without a dog. It was a shock getting a puppy, though, and I didn't love him right away, so maybe be prepared for the feeling that yours doesn't fit in and know all your ways and body-language like the old dog did. I soon learned to love my new puppy and now he's healed up the gap. His breeder warned me not to expect him to be like the other dog, but to let him be himself, quite beautiful in a different way, and maybe this is what you are about to find out when changing, not only to a different sex of dog, but a whole new personality. <br>  I know this doesn't answer your question, but I just thought you needed some kind words, maybe, - not implied disapproval for getting another dog so soon. Good luck with her, she'll give you a lot of fun.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	Congratulation Well I have 3 Pugs Mom Dad and baby its a baby boy.the parents are by my side here are there personalty's-Women-Very Energetic and can be a spoiled rotten brat but can be very cuddly for instance right now she is making me throw a tennis ball to fro to her.Men-sweet, lovable and playful he is laying on his bed waiting to get his chance to get the ball.I think girls are like that because they feel very dominant.|`|bY8iv5rwaa	I haven't seen too much of a difference honestly.  My dad's pug is a girl and she's really well behaved just by nature.  I think the females are a lot more laid back than the males IMHO.  However when shes a puppy, she will probably be pretty wild!  just make sure you get lots of toys for her to play with so she doesnt turn your furniture into her own toy!|`|RkNIs0rSaa	The pugs I have known have all been different.  I am sorry for your loss, it seems as if you aren't giving yourself time to grieve before getting another dog.  I wouldn't rush to get another dog...  because I wouldn't want to have the expectation that this one will be like the one I had.  In the Japanese culture, they have what is called 100 days of mourning.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Dogs are bigger & cheaper to castrate than bitches are to spay. No automatic gender specific differences.

YUQgyPT3aa	Yes, they got them from the same breeder.<br>  <br>  Yes Kate will freak out and her OCD will go into overdrive.<br>  <br>  Those pups will NEVER lack attention.<br>  <br>  It is what it is...|`|qioH81tiaa	Who are the Gosselins?|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen..from what i have seen (only watched for a couple of minutes)  they can barely manage their kids let alone add 2 dogs to the mix.  Also you are correct that no resonsible breeder is going to sell 2 puppies of any breed let along a GSD to an inexperiance owner, most will only even consider selling 2 at the same time to a very experinaced owner.   So you are going to be looking at a BYB or puppy mill so have a good chance of running into behavioral, temperment and health issues.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I'm going to admit that i'm one of the people that actually love this show. I think that kate will definately freak out about all the puppy things that are going to happen ... chewing up everything, pooping on the floor, peeing on the carpet! that sort of thing. But I do know that those dogs are going to have A LOT of attention! I think that if they get the proper training and get potty trained, that the Gosselins will be able to manage two dogs!|`|sfUUml0Daa	i think its nice and all, because i watch the show, i just dont think i would get two german shepherds for my 4 year olds. like the twinsare a little older and can understand like when the dog needs space. the 4 years old will be like all over them. and idk if kate andher OCD can handle the potty training of the tw dogs together,|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Honestly, they have a hard time enough managing 8 kids.. how would they even handle one puppy, not to mention 2! <br>  <br>  Hopefully they have time to properly train and care for the dog. <br>  I have a feeling this is going to be disastrous. <br>  <br>  The pups most likely will be spending a majority of their time outside since Kate is such a clean freak.<br>  <br>  To Kip- It's a TV show. =)|`|jWKMqNOsaa	I think it will be a mess for a while and I do not totally think they will keep the dogs. It is true, the dogs will not lack for attention from the kids, but they are going to need attention from the adults as well...which they pretty much don't really have the time to give. I feel like it is just a tv gimic to get more viewers on the show...and I agree that i don't think an experienced breeder would give them two german shepherds, it has to be someone looking for publicity. The dogs are going to be a handful and if they were poorly bred, could lead to heart break for the family...and the sad part is...all the better for their tv ratings.|`|0oyRzDlBaa	it stupid that they got those dogs. they just added 2 extra children to their family. they have no idea what theyre getting themselves into, and i feel bad because i dont think they will be able to keep the dog. theyre a lot of extra work, and kate is stressed out enough with 8 children. but maybe it could work. they must have really wanted a puppy if they were willing to add that much extra work into their lives. but i dont know if the dogs will be able to get the traing that they need.|`|2qv8NTMOaa	i dont think it will last long, with how much kate freaks out about everything and is such a neat freak, or they will end up outside dogs. its great they want to get the kids pets, but i would start with something like a fish for each kid since fish dont pee and poo on the floor, but it should be an interesting episode monday!!|`|aHoeG6f5aa	The Gosselins just need a new angle.<br>  The show has gotten stale and boring, and they need something new for Kate to panic over, and Jon to be indifferent about.<br>  It's just a new cuteness gimmic.<br>  I feel sorry for the dogs.|`|DhvkQG8saa	I think it's a stupid idea, I mean come on, as if Kate's life isn't hectic enough.
kvHqnR5Haa	That dog deserves a chance at a loving home so if you are willing to take the time to train him he would be a great addition to your home!  Good for you for adopting, you are doing a wonderful thing!  Just give him lots of love and attention and he will be a great dog!|`|atzw0IP4aa	follow your heart. Pick the one that you think is good for you. Puppy from a mill might be at risk for health problems so know that going into it. I rescued several and have had both experiences, great purebred dogs or rescue with poor health. Find the breed hat matches your life and start there.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	I personally would choose the bullmastif because im not a fan off small dogs, and his about to be put to sleep so it would be really kind off you to adopt him. <br>  and thanks for adopting a dog.    :)|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	ok, will s is a horrible person! 'dont get a pound dog you're just getting someone elses problem'. poor innocent dogs with nothing wrong with them except that they had bad owners are being put to sleep every day because of people with that type of attitude. <br>  good for you for rescuing!!! i have been doing animal rescue most of my life and it is so rewarding to see dogs who got abandoned get homes.<br>  ok, enough preaching! the puppy mill mastiff may have more health problems, but they are a breed you are already familiar with, so that's a plus. the others were brought back because they were untrainable. what that probably means is that the people who adopted them didnt know how to train them, and didnt want to put the effort forth to find out. most likely not the dogs fault. do some research into poodles and retreivers, both are very high energy dogs so you need to decide if you are prepared for that. poodles also need to be taken to the groomer every 6 weeks or so because their hair continuously grows. <br>  me personally, i would take the bullmastiff, but that's just personal preference. i dont have the energy for the other breeds. do some research see which is best for you!|`|AA11377139	Choose the one you like the most. Provided the dog should not look the best among the others, provided the dog should not be healthy, provided the dog should not be attractive, provided it should not draws the attention of all the rich people because if one of the above is true there will be many people to choose it.<br>  <br>  I guess you are doing it out of humanity.<br>  <br>  Lover of humanity, Lover of mankind.|`|b0e05045427c8db3453c4e2b5fed775baa	the best dog i ever got was from a pound. some might need obedience training and extra love. good luck.|`|MfcTIdlraa	Hi, Dog Lover!  I am in the process of getting a rescue dog myself!!  Good on you!<br>  Since you are familiar with the Bullmastiff breed I have no doubt in my mind which dog you should save.

eyZhiXYpaa	Hi, I'm not really sure what to suggest, as with all duel coated dogs, Akita's are renown for shedding their coats - this is why quite a few people kennel their Akita's outdoors (which I don't really agree with).<br>  <br>  Just get the hoover ready and keep grooming her as much as you are - you're dog will have a fantastic healthy coat due to the amount of time you are investing in your brushing - not much you can do about the shedding though.<br>  <br>  Sorry|`|RCyvGAONaa	There are lots of products around which can help your problem, most good pet stores will sell a shampoo formula that will assist in the shedding problem and by using this it will be cheaper than sending your dog to the groomers. <br>  Once the dog is out the bath go through the coat with brushes especially for shedding you'll find these at your pet store too.. there are shedding rakes and combs especially for shedding. <br>  <br>  With regards to the weight problem it may be due to the food you are feeding her? it is amazing what changing a dogs diet can do for their coat and their health in general, changing the dogs food may assist in the shedding problem too.. id go to your pet store and discuss this with them but foods from pets at home such as wainwrights and james well beloved are great for keeping dogs in tip top condition. <br>  <br>  Good luck trying all the suggestions i hope the shedding calms down soon = )|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Use a universal slicker brush & an undercoat rake for brushing out the most hair. Every hair a dog has will fall out & nothing will change this process. All you can do is brush daily, feed a quality food & try adding fish oil capsules to food.It might be worth it for you to take to groomer for a pro bath & brush - they can remove more hair than you. There is no magic cure for shedding.<br>  <br>  Edit : Furminator will not work for your dog - too much & too long hair.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	Dogs shed, they do not molt. Go get a Furminator. Those things are magic for dogs that shed a lot. They are the best at removing the hair.  I also recommend using a shedding blade when you brush. The only thing you can do for the shedding is lots and lots of daily grooming. If it really is too much, take the dog to a groomer and have them do it. She probably just looks like she is losing weight because she is losing her fur, which makes her look fuller.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	SHED!!!

7ZjloThDaa	That is true the dogs behavior is because of the way its raised. Breeding has some to do with it but not everything. My uncle had an adult male rottweiler that was great with kids and he could even pick the think up (my uncle was very strong) and hold it like a baby and it loved this. <br>  <br>  I think most people think this about these breeds because of the size and most of them do look intimidating. Also if you notice in movies when they want an intimidating watch dog to attach someone they use dogs like rottweilers and pinchers and in cop movies you always see the shepherds attaching the bad guy. <br>  <br>  Both shepherds and rotties make great family pets, they are very loyal easy to train dogs (thats one reason the cops use them). <br>  <br>  Here is a good quote for a good site about dog attacks (the link is below)<br>  <br>  Any dog, treated harshly or trained to attack, may bite a person. Any dog can be turned into a dangerous dog. The owner or handler most often is responsible for making a dog into something dangerous. <br>  An irresponsible owner or dog handler might create a situation that places another person in danger by a dog, without the dog itself being dangerous, as in the case of the Pomeranian that killed the infant (see above). <br>  Any individual dog may be a good, loving pet, even though its breed is considered to be potentially dangerous. A responsible owner can win the love and respect of a dog, no matter its breed. One cannot look at an individual dog, recognize its breed, and then state whether or not it is going to attack. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html#Thedogsmostlikelytobite" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statisti...</a>|`|Yf1Ig8E9aa	its probably because of all the reports of attacks on humans by Rottweiler's and german Shepard's on the news and in the papers.<br>  i agree with you  it's the way the dog has been brought up and usually it is not the dogs fault but the owners|`|y2g9faHjaa	its what they used to be breeded for, everyone just presumes that because of the breed of these dogs they are more dangerous than say a retriever when really it depends on the upbringing and owners of the dog|`|3zv2bbolaa	Why is it you presume ALL people think that way?

Raised in the right home, any dog will succeed. <br>  <br>  No my issue is you say you met them at the dog park. That is imo irresponsible. It doesnt matter who started it, the pit, dobe, shepherd, rottie always get the blame because people that go there tend to follow the media. <br>  <br>  I stop almost everyone and tell them their (insert bully or controversial breed here) is gorgeous because I know they dont hear it that often. <br>  <br>  I actually met a german shepherd pup on a walk the other day. Had to go say hi, not only to show I wasnt breedist, but also the fact that the pup needed to get used to peoples hands, strangers approaching it. He is a pup and socialization that is good helps the dog stay well-mannered. (Yes I asked first).|`|fEaWOiE9aa	I Grew Up W/ German Shephards & Ours Were The Sweetest Dogs.

Z9zzNYNCaa	That's daylight ROBBERY!!!<br>  I wouldn't pay a quarter of that outrageous price.<br>  It's not the extraction-which it obviously needs-but the horrible bill.Shop around.|`|cnZlMojUaa	February is pet dental health month and some vet clinics are offering reduced rates on dental cleanings/procedures this month. It would be worth calling and asking about a discount. My clinic is offering 25% off dental services right now. <br>  <br>  I paid right at $425 for my 13 year-old dog to have a deep cleaning and 4 extractions several months ago. My vet isn't one who wants to put dogs under anesthesia to clean teeth every few months. My dog got an infection around a tooth and I asked the vet to take any questionable teeth while he was under. Since your dog has an infection, this is a health issue you need to address. It is better to have as many teeth pulled as needed while the dog is under anesthesia. Your dog can adjust to loosing teeth. You can soften her kibble with warm water if needed. Keeping bad teeth promotes infections that send toxins into the bloodstream where they can attack and damage the internal organs. It really needs to be done.<br>  <br>  I did hunt my bill to let you know what was included in my cost. I hope it helps, but know that costs vary depending on the area of the country. (I'm Southern USA).<br>  <br>  $110.00  Teeth cleaning level 2<br>  $    0.00  Fluoride Polish<br>  $  21.00  Induction<br>  $  37.50  Anesthesia<br>  $  35.00  Rimadyl Pain program<br>  $    0.00  Rimadyl Pain pack<br>  $  70.00  General Health Panel and CBC (pre-surg. bloodwork)<br>  $  52.00  Surgical IV fluids<br>  $    4.00  Biohazard Waste Disposal<br>  $100.00  4 tooth extraction ($25 per extraction)<br>  <br>  I know you aren't using my vet, but this could be a general guideline. My dog was listed at under 50 pounds. If you can't afford the procedure right now, ask if the vet accepts payments, or check on something called Care Credit. Good luck with your doggie.|`|Chxoncy7aa	I would get another opinion.  I also have small dogs.  My vet tells me from time to time he needs to pull some teeth.  As long as the teeth do not need to be cleaned, and there is no infection, I just let them fall out.  Unless there is a good reason to put them under, let them fall out on their own.  However, it sounds like she does need a cleaning bad.  Check some other vets, and see if they will leave her bottom teeth.  Unless they are causing a problem of some type, they can be left to naturally fall out.  700 does sound high.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	what does the $700 include?  at my clinic it would include blood work, iv catheter, iv fluids, or monitoring, antibiotics, pain medication (for extractions), cost of extractions, anesthesia, and the dental.<br>  <br>  it is very common for small breeds to have bad teeth and the front teeth arent really used for anything.  your dog will be fine without them.  also look at it this way, its either $700 now, or thousands of dollars later when the infection from her mouth affects her heart, liver, and kidneys.<br>  <br>  also, its chihuahua and they are not terriers.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Smaller breeds often have terrible teeth.  $700 sounds high, but I'm sure your vet is right about them needing to come out.|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	If the work is more involved than you seem to think, that could be what it costs... it does seem high to me, but veterinary costs vary in different parts of the country. If you suspect that this is more than you should be charged, than try to get a referral to another vet for another estimate... preferably, get a referral to a vet that owners of toy breed dogs are happy with. Dental disease is very common in toy dogs, and unaddressed can lead to kidney failure, heart failure and serious infections. Dogs who have had dental extractions do just fine... dogs who have few or even no teeth do just fine... don't be leery about having her incisors pulled if they need to be. If she has a dental infection, the vet you saw was correct to put her on antibiotics... she should be on antibiotics before surgery and for a week or ten days after.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	At 12 pounds I'm guessing you meant Chihuahua Terrier mix. It is common in smaller dogs to have these problems. Because of age you really do need the blood testing. The dog will undergo general anesthesia but unless that includes a full set of false teeth the price is outrageous. I've been a Certified Veterinary Technician for 19 years updated with seminars on animal behavior and psychology, nutrition and dental hygiene and I work in a major metro area (Chicago) and the cost is usually half of your quote. Unless something else is being done at the same time that is way to high. It is needed or will cause anything from liver shutdown to pancreatic problems to septicemia so get another opinion or go ahead and get it done there. It must be done, though.|`|xzwZ3lt3aa	When I had to get my two Yorkies teeth done, I was quoted 1200.00 CDN<br>  I told them I had 800.00, and to do whatever they could for the 800. When I went to pick them up, the bill was 801.00, and all the work was done. Unfortunately bad teeth are common in small dogs. I brush both of their teeth, they only eat kibbles, and they've both had to have teeth pulled.<br>  <br>  I'd do what the others have suggested and get a 2nd opinion|`|uhlPVTdkaa	That is  crazy asking for $700.00  for cleaning a dogs teeth the vet always ask for crazy amounts of money.All you have to do is look for a close pet-smart and they always have like a pet salon in back and it only cost like $20.|`|RiW4tSx6aa	that is too exspensive try going to a different one and because they are hipper they are harder to clean|`|9kMJJ1giaa	My vet does not charge prices like that to clean or pull teeth!  I would get another opinion.  Your dog can get very sick, and have several health problems, if you do not get her oral, (Mouth/teeth), problems taken care of.  When humans have a toothache it is very painful, I am sure it is just as painful for an animal.  Please do not let your dog suffer, get her the medical treatment she needs and deserves.  I did not know things like that could happen to a dog.  I just thought my dog, a Pomeranian, had bad breath.  He had to have 22 teeth pulled all at once, he was 10 years old, (vet charged $150.00 for surgical procedure).  My dog is now 15 years old.  I have to soften all of his food now, but he is doing great and feels much better.  He still plays like a puppy!  I feel awful that this happened to him because of my ignorance.  I always gave him Milk Bones and Greenies and fed him hard dog food, believing I was doing things right and helping to keep his teeth clean.  My vet said this is unfortunately, very common in all small dogs.|`|CEgq26oHaa	It is common for smaller breeds of dogs, but $700 is a bit ridiculous.  I think I'd be getting a second opinion from another vet before you give this one the go ahead to do anything.  That just sounds a bit high to me.  I think dogs have to be sleeping with teeth are pulled, but to give you an example, when I took my dog in to be spayed two months ago, she needed three of her baby teeth pulled, they hadn't come out on their own, and the vet only charged me $25 for all three teeth.  It could be a difference being that they were baby teeth and she was already under, I don't know, but the price you were told is outrageous.|`|WyNMAUFGaa	Every vet charges what they feel is appropriate for the services they provide, some are more some are less.  Yes, it seems like a lot, but if that is what the vet needs to charge that is her business.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like your little one does need to have teeth extracted though, and soon before they abscess and the cost goes up for removal due to worse infection that can cause an open hole (fistula) from the teeth out through the face.  If you decide to look around for another vet to clean the teeth, you want to make sure you are comparing the same proceedures.  You should have preanesthetic bloodwork done (to make sure everything is healthy in your pup), anesthetic, scaling and polishing of the teeth, dental x-rays (only 1/3 of teeth are above the gum line, so you need x-rays to see what is below the gum line so that other sick teeth can be removed so you don't have to pay for another procedure or to put your dog under anesthesia again without good cause), antibiotics, and pain medication.  <br>  <br>  It is common for small breeds to have all of their teeth pulled, although there is a dental vaccine that is available now, you may want to consider that if your pup has any teeth left after the procedure.  Don't worry about your pup not having those little front teeth (the incisors) as dogs really don't use them.  If you can move the teeth and if they are infected, they hurt, so removing them will make her feel better!<br>  <br>  Only you can decide what is done for your pet, but remember that it is your responsibility to take care of her.  Pets are not a right and they are not cheap, but they provide you with unconditional love, there is not a price that can be paid for that.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision and your search for a cheaper dental option.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Have you tried getting a price from another vet?  I know that the vet I originally went to charged an arm and a leg for everything.  I started taking my puppy to a small town vet and everything is at least 50% less.  So give that a try.  But you should know how dangerous it is not to have the procedure completed.  I understand it is expensive but it could cause some major health conditions for your dog if it isn't done.  My sister and her husband put this off for too long and now they have to have ALL of their dogs teeth pulled.  But before you do it it wouldn't hurt to look elsewhere to see if you can get a better rate.  Good luck!
fFtBqFB6aa	Is the crate too big? There should be enough room for her to stand up and turn around in it.  And, of course lay down. :-)That it. <br>  Are you leaving her in there too long?|`|QMl4ELhGaa	She might not be able to hold it. I have a 5 month old Weimaraner who still occasionally goes in her crate, but she is getting better. I have to get up twice a night to let her out or she will pee in there. It can take a while for them to be able to hold it, even if you have the crate sectioned off properly. I recommend stopping her water 2 hours before bedtime and if necessary get up during the night to let her out. Make sure her crate is sectioned off so she only has enough room to stand up and turn around. The only way she will get in the habit of always messing her crate is if she is constantly left in dirty conditions, which I am sure is not the case. It is probably just because she is so young. A 3 month old puppy can only hold it for 3 hours max, and usually not even that long for some. Just give her time and if you are really worried about it take her to the vet and have them check her for a urinary tract infection.|`|VBT3Itffaa	I'm a bit confused. Is it when she is in the crate while you are at work or does she just go in and do it? She is still a puppy and can't hold it long. Catch her in the act and bring her outside.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	How big is her crate? It should be just big enough for her to lay down, turn around & those types of things. If it's any bigger then she will sleep & lay in one area that she considers her bed & she will go in another area that she basically considers outside of her living space.<br>  <br>  If her crate is too big then you can put in a crate divider so she only has access to a portion of the crate that is the right size for her.<br>  <br>  How long is she in there for? Puppies are small & can't hold it for very long. You have to let her out often to go.<br>  <br>  Also, what you heard is not true. Your dog is only 12 weeks old. She's a puppy. You need to take the time to teach her where she can & can not go to the bathroom. People who think that once a dog goes in their crate they're a "dirty dog" are not willing to take the time & patience it needs to train a puppy.<br>  <br>  <3|`|KPdWzbxWaa	Her crate is probably to big. All the room she needs is room to lay down comfortably. If there is more room then that, she will go to the bathroom on one side, and sleep on the other. Make the crate smaller and your problem should go away. Also, try taking her outside to go to the bathroom before you put her in the crate. Remember to reward her every time she goes potty outside. Hope this helps :)|`|wdaoaa1gaa	ummm no.  you heard wrong.  First of all, her crate is probably too big. that's why she's going in the crate.  resize her crate and if she's going in her crate at 12 weeks, you are leaving her in there WAYYY too longer.  she's only 12 weeks.  she will probably go every 2 hours if not more.|`|MKH2v6pSaa	well some puppies do this because they just have to go the bathroom at night! its only 12 weeks old so don't expect to much bladder control and also she will most likely grow out of it once she is house trained
vwC7klVVaa	No but it will need to have all it shots and rabies shot and the records that your dog has had them .

If you try to remove it you will rip the chicks skin right off. Not a pretty sight.  What you can do is is moisten a washcloth with warm water and wipe the shell with the damp cloth once the chick has cracked the egg. dont soak it. It should dry off immediately.  If the chick has difficulty you can dampen the shell again. It takes quite a while for some chicks to hatch . Don't help unless the chick is in deep distress.  You will do great damage to the delicate chick if you don't handle it right.

Second, I'd invest in a digital thermometer so you can accurately measure her temps and make sure they're in the 88-92 range.<br>  <br>  Then I'd get her and a fecal sample to the vet to check for sand and/or parasites in the poop.  Both can be treated if caught early enough.  Her pooping is a good sign that she's not completely impacted but may be helped by meds and baths.  If it's parasites, she needs medication.  That can't be treated by you.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple links to help you find a good vet near you... give them a call and get an estimate.

Even if your temperatures are correct they'll sleep more and stop eating as much when it's cold outside, they can just sense these things. <br>  <br>  Even if your gecko isn't eating as much it shouldn't be losing a lot of weight. My gecko only eats a couple of times a week and usually it is not very much, but she still maintains her weight to at least around 70 grams. Having a digital food scale to weigh your gecko with would more than likely put you at ease in a situation like this. <br>  <br>  However, if your gecko is still eating and is losing a large amount of weight you may want to take it to the vet, it could be another problem such as parasites.

Or,cut a few holes out of an empty Margarine tub,securing the lid & put some treats,such as dried fruits or even some of his dry food in the tub & he should try & get the treats out,by shaking it etc.,this is great entertainment for them!<br>  <br>  Hope that helped a bit! xxx|`|oMwv6XxOaa	y|`|id3yBPGfaa	I went to the ups store and bought a box and put a shelf in it and cut some holes and made the top look like a castle and both my little rex's love going in there and playing they already scratched and chewed a new entry into it lol ...little devils but I love them!

If not get some baby gates and pen off areas you don't want your rabbit going. If you can spare a room make it a safe area for your rabbit to play. I don't know if they make a harness to fit rabbits, if they do get one and take him outside for a while. Maybe if all he has is his toys and he no longer has access to the chairs he may chew on them.

AQsiugSpaa	With the symptoms you are describing, something physical may be going on with your kitty for which a vet visit is in order. When cats all of a sudden begin to act "strangely" this is always a signal to steer you in the direction of professional veterinary assessment.<br>  <br>  So many things can cause a rapid change in behavior, and without any further information it is very hard to even hazzard a guess.<br>  <br>  If this was my cat, she would be at the vet in a heartbeat, as she is communicating something to you which needs attention.<br>  <br>  I am quoting a short article from the SPCA about feline behavioral changes.<br>  "If your cat's behavior changes suddenly, your first step should always be to contact your veterinarian for a thorough health examination. Cats often hide symptoms of illness until they're seriously ill. Any change in behavior may be an early indication of a medical problem. "<br>  <br>  I wish you the best with your kitty.

Odds are that your cat is in some kind of discomfort and being fussed with just aggravates it.<br>  <br>  You need to get her over to the vet and have her thoroughly checked out. Things like dental problems can cause extreme pain for a cat and could explain why she is being so antisocial. The vet will also check of any illnesses or tumors that could be causing her pain.<br>  <br>  The fact that this was a sudden change leads me to think that it is a physical problem, but if the vet rules out anything wrong with her, then look for anything that might have changed in your cat's environment.|`|vPb27uNfaa	Maybeee shes pregnant...   that's the only thing i can think of.. take her to the vet for a check up.|`|7iVbgxiSaa	maybe somebody in the neighborhood has been tormenting your cat.|`|Scn7DDhlaa	Hello I used to have two cats and I loved them both the same but one time they got into a fight and one cat bit the other one real hard which he never had done before they were kinda jealous of each other.(because they both loved me so much) anyways a few month go by and the one who got bit started acting mean towards me then one night i came home and there was blood coming out of my cats bottom, well it looked like it to me ...but it was actually beside his bottom but his fur hid this injury for three months till it abscessed and busted which led to diabetes which led to him dying...take you cat to the vet! find a cheep one in your area soon! (in memory of tiger man)hope this helps.Barbara|`|qww84woNaa	Hi D, You cat sounds like my cat. My cat does not allow me to pick her up but I still do even though she does not like it.  I pick her up for like 3 to 4 sec.  She is very anti-social. Sometimes I touch her and she growls and hisses at me for no reason. I have her 4 years and that is how she always has been.  From my experience leave her and observe her.  Get some advice from the Vet and check the internet on animal behaviour you will get some good advice.  Why the sudden change in her attitude towards you I can't say but observe the surroundings and look for changes.  I have been aching to love up my cat but she will not allow it unless she wants me to touch her and that is rear. I get jealous when I see people picking up their cat and giving  some good loving but I dare not do mine that.  <br>  <br>  My cat Only allows me to do whatever I want to her in the night time ONLY on the bed.  I can love her up as much as I want in the night, I can get away with anything but in the day time NO WAY. It is hard and I have not accepted it but I respect my cat's feeling. If I correct her and she does not like it she hits me and then I have to correct her again. (I usuall raise my voice a little)<br>  <br>  She could also have an injury.  My cat was injured by another cat at one time and I did not know and she hissed more than usual every time I passed my hand along her body and then she stopped eating.  So I took her to the vet. She HATES Vets and they put her to sleep and they discovered a whole under her tail.  They flushed it and treated her and she was all good.  Be patient and observe and wait for her to come around again.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I wonder if my cat loves me too.  But you should see when I come home she runs down the walkway to meet me hysterically.  She meows to go for her walk twice a day. I walk her for 1 hour a day.  Sometimes I use a lead collar and walk her also.  If she doesn't come around make sure she is healthy and live with it.  We can't force them to accept our affection unless they desire it.  <br>  <br>  My cat love to catch birds and lizards and when I am tired of it. I lock her inside so you are doing the right thing she will eventually calm down and prop some sorrows and be vex with you, she will be sad for the day and then she will get over it.  It may hurt you but is either your hurt feelings or a dead squirrel you choose.  If I soften my heart and let her out I end up cleaning up half of a baby birds body-how gross.  My vet told me you have to be firm with your pets ok<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	If nothing has happened to obviously upset the cat I would probably take her to the vet for a checkup.  Sounds like something might be wrong and she has no way of letting you know if she is hurting or feeling bad.  Most of the time if there is a sudden drastic change in animals behavior with no reason behind it there is something going on with their health.  Good luck and hope "Mittens" returns to old self soon.

3zv2bbolaa	Giardia a parasitic protozoan found in the intestines of many animals, including dogs and humans. Up to 30% of dogs under one year of age acquire the parasite and become infected and in doing so, pass the intestinal infection to other dogs. Cleanliness in the facilities where a dog lives helps reduce the odds of contracting it, but even then, an estimated ten percent of superbly maintained dogs still get it.<br>  <br>  Giardia cysts are present in a wet or damp environment they can survive up to several months. They are transmitted via ingestion through contaminated water or food or even from the hair of other dogs by sniffing or licking the anus or their own feet. It is also possible to have asymptomatic carriers and it is highly contagious. The ingestion of as few as one or more giardia cysts may cause the disease, as contrasted to most bacterial illnesses where hundreds to thousands of organisms must be consumed to produce illness.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	They ingest it, often thru water that is outdoors where wildlife can have access to it and spread it.  <br>  <br>  We add a bit of bleach to the sheep water at the farm to control and kill off the parasite.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	Contact with other animals with the illness, stagnant water, bad food, feces, anything that has been touched by the parasite can transfer it to another animal.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Same as every other intestinal parasite-INGESTION.|`|3giaPYe8aa	By ingesting infested water.

aP4bkYOCaa	The first thing you should do is call around and find a vet. Ask any of your friends that own cats what vet they use, how much he charges and whether or not they like him. It's essential that you find a good vet, because cats can really rack up a vet bill. Some are very prone to conditions that can end up being very pricey. <br>  <br>  It's always good to have a cat carrier on hand for trips to the vet.<br>  <br>  Cats are obligate carnivores and need a strictly meat-based food. When you go out to the pet store to get food for the cat, check out the ingredients on the can or bag- a named meat should be the first ingredient(s) such as deboned chicken, turkey, whitefish, herring, etc. The food should NOT contain corn, wheat, soy, "maize," animal by-products.. actually, the food should not contain the actual words "animal" or "meat" anywhere in the ingredients! The idea is that if you see either of those words, but they don't say what KIND of animal or meat, those sources in the food could be anything- it's mystery meat!<br>  <br>  Here is a list of recommended foods you might like to try.<br>  <br>  Wellness <a href="http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/</a><br>  Blue Buffalo <a href="http://www.bluebuff.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluebuff.com/</a><br>  Solid Gold <a href="http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/</a><br>  Innova <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/</a><br>  Chicken Soup For The Cat Lovers Soul <a href="http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssou..." rel="nofollow">http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssou...</a><br>  Merrick <a href="http://www.merrickpetcare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.merrickpetcare.com/</a><br>  Felidae <a href="http://www.canidae.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canidae.com/</a><br>  Now! <a href="http://www.petcurean.com/index.php?page_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.petcurean.com/index.php?page_...</a><br>  Natural Balance <a href="http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/</a><br>  <br>  Whatever you do, do not feed brands like Whiskas, Friskies, Iams.. don't feed anything that you can find in the grocery store. These foods are poor quality and leave you and your cat with a huge vet bill.<br>  <br>  Your cat should always have a bowl of fresh, cool water available. My cats have a water fountain to encourage them to drink, but you don't have to go that far.<br>  <br>  You should have two litter trays in your house for the cat, in private areas. Some cats like covered boxes, others don't. Be sure to scoop the litter daily, as many cats will not use a litter box that is dirty, and that can lead to accidents!<br>  <br>  Flea preventatives can be purchased at the vet. NEVER use anything like Hartz, Sargent, Zodiac or anything you can buy in the drug store. These products have been known to cause severe neurological problems and even death in pets. Only use brands like Frontline, Revolution or Advantage.<br>  <br>  You will need a scratching post for the kitty to scratch if you don't want him to mess with your furniture. Encourage the cat to use the scratching post. <br>  <br>  Cats need a variety of toys to keep them occupied and mentally stimulated. Cat toys are usually relatively inexpensive. Avoid purchasing toys that are poorly assembled or have excessive string- some cats are notorious string eaters.<br>  <br>  Your kitty should have a collar with tags that have his name and your phone number on them, just incase he gets out and cannot find his way home.<br>  <br>  And lastly, kitties can be independent but they also certainly crave attention and love. :) <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	This is my absolute favorite cat care site.

Brush your cat now and again for cleanliness and make sure your cat has its injections before it is let out. Enjoy your cat as they can be good company. I hope this helps.|`|kXdXJKEMaa	flea drops, worming medicine, cat litter, cat litter tray, 2 bowls for food and water, cat food (get soft because theres something in dry food that can kill dogs and cats!), kitty toys, carrier, cat bed (if you dont want t on your furniture), cat brush, cat wipes (to keepit clean) and thats it =D|`|c174216429125287577e00667da65510aa	The whiskas website has some good information.

They definitely cannot eat anything bigger than they are like a rat, human, or any other mammal that comes to mind.<br>  <br>  Several different types of spiders are often called Daddy Long Legs.<br>  <br>  That depends on if you mean harvestmen, cellar spiders, or crane flies...<br>  (They are all called daddy long legs). <br>  <br>  As for harvestmen: Many species are omnivorous, eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi; some are scavengers, feeding upon dead organisms, bird dung and other fecal material. This broad range is quite unusual in arachnids, which are usually pure predators. Most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey, although active hunting is also found. Because their eyes cannot form images, they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment. Also unlike most other arachnids, harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach and a filtering mechanism, but ingest small particles of their food. Harvestmen do not have silk glands and do not possess venom glands.<br>  <br>  Cellar Spider: The web has no adhesive properties but the irregular structure traps insects, making escape difficult. The spider quickly envelops its prey with silk and then inflicts the fatal bite. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later. Certain species of these seemingly benign spiders invade webs of other spiders and eat the host, the eggs or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host of the web closer.<br>  <br>  Crane fly: Some larval crane flies may on occasion feed on mosquito larvae. Adult crane flies feed on nectar or they do not feed at all; once they become adults, most crane fly species live only to mate and die. Their larvae, called "leatherjackets", "leatherbacks", "leatherback bugs" or "leatherjacket slugs", because of the way they move, consume roots (such as those of turf grass) and other vegetation, in some cases causing damage to plants.<br>  <br>  As you can see, none of these can kill and eat a rat.  However humans are susceptible to spider venom.  But that would be spiders like Black widow and Brown recluse.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_bite#Types_of_spiders_with_medically_significant_venom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_bite...</a>|`|VCzsfVM5aa	it's the small nasties that can have the most damaging affect to humans, ticks, fleas, mosquitos.

hC4Z8HIbaa	You *can* get a wheel with rough floors to help wear down their feet, but I know rat people who prefer not to because they are afraid that continually walking on something so abrasive may hurt their rats' feet. I haven't seen any evidence for this, so I can't say one way or the other. <br>  <br>  Placing a rock or brick in their cage is a good and very popular idea for trimming down sharp nails. It is best used if put in a location with very high trafic, like near the food dish, in front of the water bottle, or at the bottom of a ramp.<br>  <br>  If you have the patience, you can also try filing them with an emry board or you can even clip them, but rats nails are very similar to dogs nails in that they have a quick which must not be cut to avoid bleeding. But rat's nails grow so fast that you would have to clip or file them every week or so to keep them smooth.|`|378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	1. You could take him to the exotics vet and have them trimmed by the vet technician. Not much $ at all! I've done this with Bailey my dumbo rat.<br>  2. Provide her with clay saucers, pots, rocks. A large enough rock so she can sit and climb on it comfortably. Wash it with hot water and scrub with a brush before putting it in the cage.<br>  3. If she has any wooden huts from the store, these can help wear down her nails when she climbs and stands on them depending on how they're positioned in the cage.<br>  Note:I have provided Bailey with all of the above and I still have to take him to get his nails done because he is so squirmy wormy with me and they are tiny nails. :0) But all rats are different as people are. <br>  4. Some people use bricks underneath the water bottle. I do this with the rock. I think it helps them from growing faster. Rats love to climb so try experimenting with is nail furniture! Good luck. <br>  ps:maybe wooden ladders for birds(with pointy screws removed) for climbing as well.<br>  The vet may be able to teach you how to hold her if you are comfortable with it.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	There are wheels that have a rough paper for running on which will grind them down right quick.<br>  Here is a link for a wheel<br>  <a href="http://www.exoticnutrition.com/images/Sandy%20Wheel%20Entire.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.exoticnutrition.com/images/Sa...</a><br>  However if they are not runners, put in a rough rock from outside.

gU34xa9vaa	As your cat hates dogs it would be very unkind to bring one into his home.He would more than likely hide away and be miserable.<br>  If you do decide to go ahead you need to keep them seperate, pen the dog up so it couldn't approach the cat, until the cat gets used to it being around.Also make sure your cat has a room where the dog can't go, so he can relax in peace.He will need a lot of love and attention and reassurence that the dog isn't taking his place in your home.<br>  If they do become used to each other, never leave them alone so the dog doesn't hurt the cat, until (if ever) they become friends .|`|DtkLsetkaa	You aren't going to be able to MAKE him get along with dogs.  You can hope for the best, and acclimate them as well as possible, but sometimes it just doesn't work out.  You want to try to introduce them on neutral territory, so neither thinks their home is being threatened.  Then place the dog in your house behind a closed door and let them smell each other through the door.  All meetings will best be supervised at the beginning.  It is going to take a lot of patience, and supervision.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	If your cat hates dogs, then you don't get a dog.  It's that simple.  Your cat was there first, so your first responsibility is to him.  Pets aren't possessions, they are living breathing creatures with feelings.|`|gBycDD9Baa	u will never make your cat   like dogs, but u can get a dog and allow your cat and dog to understand there own boundries with each other.   in time your cat may accept the dog and  if the cat still dislikes the dog the dog will learn to stay back and give the cat her personal space  .  good luck|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	You need to buy a puppy, not an adult dog.

WyNMAUFGaa	The first place to start is to work on your grades and learning more about what it means to be a veterinarian.  (I told my parents when I was 4 that I was going to be a vet and finally graduated from vet school when I was 26 and am very happy being a veterinarian now). I would recommend reading a lot, books about animals - go to the library!  You also want to learn about business and people.  Vet school is hard to get into and it is hard to stay in and graduate from, but it is worth it in the end.  I don't know if there are any websites that are free or not, but I would recommend asking a friend to help you or seeing if there is someone from your school that would be willing to help you out (ask your teacher if there is someone that he/she would recommend).  If you are having trouble with a subject, then you need to ask for help.  Usually it actually just takes having someone help you figure out how you learn best so that you can use that to learn any subject.  Veterinary medicine is more than just science, it is also psychology (how people think and behave), communication, business, and problem solving among other things.  Good luck and if you really want to do it, you will have to work hard for it.  If you work hard, but decide you want to do something else, that is ok, the hard work will make you stronger and a better person for whatever you decide to do!|`|cj31x3UMaa	I am not a vet, but close friends w/ my own. You will have to learn science & anatomy on all sorts of animals, not just small ones. She had to learn about farm animals, dogs & everything else... even though she only works on cats these days.<br>  <br>  What you could look into is getting a summer job cleaning at a local vet & see if they will let you watch different procedures. This will help you decide if this is what you really want to do.|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	honey you will more than likely change your mind when you get older. You have years of High school left you may not want to go to collage after that. But it would help to do tutoring, i find it easier when you have someone actually sitting there than just reading or figuring it out on your on. good luck and i hope you do become a vet|`|cV8KNiqiaa	i turn thirteen in june and when I was 8 I told my parents I want to be a vet they loved the idea and started making plans like buying allot of horses for me to Get used to it but know im not so sure i want to be a vet I mean work with animals yes but I don't want to put them to sleep!|`|m16gf9mzaa	There are plenty of websites out there that will help you understand science better - both as homework help and concerning specific topics.  You can use a search engine to find them.  <br>  <br>  Also, there is this wonderful thing called a library, where they have books.  You will be able to find many books about many kinds of animals there.  I recommend you include the library in your quest to educate yourself further about animals.|`|DZEH63wsaa	To be a vet, you need to be good in Science and Math. Thats what its all about. Just start working at animal clinics as a kennel person and see if you like the enviroment.<br>  <br>  Do some more researching.

YpEswTQdaa	Well it depends what kind of treat you mean!<br>  <br>  Green feeding,such treats as Apple,Pear,Melon,Pineapple,Strawberry etc  are great,or growing other plants,herbs such as Fennel,Rosemary,Chives,Basil etc. I like to feed wild plants rather than,supermarket brought ones,it also saves money! XD. Or other grasses? You could add a few certain flower seeds in the mix,for instance Marigolds or Sunflowers?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,xxx
SzW9GmRsaa	If you clip now you'll get the underneath summer coat and the coat will look poor all season.  The best you can do now is get at him with a rubber curry to get the winter wool out.|`|7PAGYzdhaa	yes, if you clip your horse right now, then it will mess up his summer coat. Before summer is here, you want your horse to have his WHOLE winter coat back, if not you will have to shed different parts of his coat allthroughout the summer! I would just reccomend pulling out the good old shedding blade, a body brush, and ALOT of elbow grease!!!!:)<br>  Hope this helps!!!!!!!!!!!:)<br>  Ja-maken me blush<3 ( one of my horses show names!!!!:)|`|hEXb1unraa	Nope, I would give your horse 4 to 6 weeks to coat out after body clipping.....some horses you can clip the day before a show and they look great...like grays....but some need a few weeks with slickers and rugs on to bloom.....but I have body clipped horses and all different times during the year and it looks great.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Depends where you are and how much care you can give her.<br>  <br>  I would, if she was mine, clip her fully and rug her up and stable in inclement weather and groom like crazy.  That would give you a head start and her summer coat should grow evenly.  Any other clip would give an unbalanced regrowth and she would still be woolly where you do not clip.<br>  <br>  I used to have to clip my horse all year round as he had Cushings Disease and that gives a horse a thick, woolly, curly coat all even in the summer.  Some people frowned on it, but hey, surely it is the comfort of the horse that comes first, not convention!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Has he started to shed yet?  If he has, just wait. If he's started shedding, he will have also started growing in his summer coat, and you'll cut off the very tops of the new hairs.  That makes their coat look rough, and will keep it from looking top notch all summer.<br>  <br>  If he hasn't started shedding yet, clip away.|`|3NjXyl5Eaa	It is not too late.  It is only February.  Just make sure you have a blanket for your horse.|`|YHpePjb9aa	we continue to clip our hunt horses untill the end of march (they are clipped every two weeks) and then most of them are shown or competed throughout the summer and as of yet i have had no problem with it damaging their summer coats. My show horses are sometime left untouched at the end of february so really its up to you.|`|2b8677d3ef59cb9e152708b12f1b81f8aa	I would think it's probably about 12 weeks too late i'm afraid.  The summer coat is coming through any time and you dont want to take it off with the winter one<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  I guess it would depend on when your show season starts.  Mine is April - there is no way a clip would grow out in 6 weeks|`|rOZ1WSqNaa	No, I don't think it makes a difference as long as you clip your horse now! That's all there is to say! ^w^ Go- go- GO! Clip away!|`|SoytkhKjaa	Unless you don't mind having clip lines all summer then yes it if I'm afraid x|`|V3u2R0Tpaa	how can your horse be a woolly mammoth?
Xsmkzs9Caa	I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the first two answerers. Cat's are excellent for keeping themselves perfectly clean assuming they are in the wild. Human hands however transfer oils to the fur that cannot be removed with the cats saliva (only via shedding). Human oils, and especially sweat harbour bacteria which cause a change in odour and appearance in the furs texture over time. Personally I wash my cats fur at least twice a year to ensure they are healthy and happy.|`|fzaf5t3Caa	Yeah I would agree that cats do a really good job cleaning themselves. My cat is hardly ever bathed. We usually stick him in a small bin of water in the summer once each year. some years we skip the bath which isn't a problem. My cat is an indoor and outdoor cat, and he doesn't manage to get too dirty outside either. And if he does get muddy in the rain, then we will stick him in the sink. What im saying is you don't neeed to bathe your cats, only if they get dirty or just give them a yearly cleaning. (sounds kinda gross to only take a bath once a year...lol)|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Those who have been privileged enough to own a pure white cat… know that cats DO need bathed. Our White cat was indoor only yet he would yellow out due to dirt in the air that would collect on his fur. We bathed him once a month and that was enough to keep him clean and white.  So yes, cats do need bathed. <br>  <br>  Depending on the cat, over bathing could dry the skin so don’t over do it. There are many cat owners who are allergic and bath their cats once a week to remove dander so that they can keep living with their cat allergen free. Show cat owners also bath their cats weekly or more. <br>  <br>  If it were my cat, I would start with once per month and see how that works out for you and your cat. The earlier you start bathing (after 12 weeks) the more your cat will take to it and accept it as a normal non fearful situation.|`|ehoM8ZyHaa	I agree unless they have gotten into something that could harm them to clean if off themselves they do not need you to bath them. Cats are very clean animals, and most don't like water anyways. Although I do have one six month old cat that likes to sit on my stomach when I'm in the bath.|`|Mxj2PKRnaa	cats are very clean animals. they are constantly grooming themselves. the only time it is necessary to bathe them is if they somehow get too dirty to thoroughly clean themselves. the only time i bathed my cats was when i found one when she was a very small kitten and didn't yet know how to groom herself and then once more when they got fleas.|`|7qk3dFYyaa	well there you go then if they can clean themselves then you don't need to bathe them|`|d3496b1eb0b2a2ec70adb2a7b6100d89aa	Most cats, especially short haired breeds, really don't need bathing very much, if at all. They manage to keep themselves clean and most of the time, all they will need is a wipe down with a pet body wipe to remove any dust or dander from the upper layers of the coat.<br>  <br>  You might need to bath your cats if they do go outdoors much and get muddy, if they are long haired (which makes it harder for them to keep the undercoat clean), or if someone in the house has severe allergies.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Unless they get in a disagreement with something like a skunk or get infested with fleas, don't worry about bathing them. As you've said, they're pretty good at washing themselves.<br>  <br>  But you may want to brush them regularly to help remove the loose fur that would otherwise give them hairballs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
s4OtfZ7Gaa	use the treats as a lure at first. hold it in front of his nose and slowly bring it back over his head, this should lure him into a sit. when he does sit, then give him the treat. do this until he has it down and starts to sit automatically. next switch the treat to your other hand, ask the dog to sit and bring the treat to him. you can do this with down also by getting him into a sit, and luring him down by bringing the treat straight down and then out.

kwhfazx7aa	Hi,  It sounds like this horse could have been gelded late and may have been used as a stud, which does explain this coltish behaviour.  As mentioned he could be a rig.  With the legs, you say he is large for his breed, the rapid growth may have caused joint problems, obviously the vet should check for the cause of the pain.  You could use a joint supplement and a multi vitamin and mineral supplement (if not already).  It could be a shere size issue.  good luck.|`|2b8677d3ef59cb9e152708b12f1b81f8aa	yep, totally agree with Karen.  <br>  <br>  Also you need to look at the possibility that he was turned out alone and doesn't know how to behave with the herd.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about his legs hurting (rather than him being unused to lifting them) get your vet to check him out.  Perhaps in the meantime you could feel to see if he has any splints that are uncomfortable?|`|8cikAYp3aa	Vet check for the front legs.   Only way to know whats up with them for sure.<br>  <br>  As for the ramish behavior with the girls.  Is he gelded?  or is he a ridgling/ crypt  that they didnt bother to fully geld.  When was he gelded?  is the scar still fresh and new looking?  It can take 6 month to a year for the hormones to drop, and if he was done late that behavior may never stop ( I had a horse done at 10 yo  and he never lost the attitude.)     Best bet for aroma is plain old Vicks Vapor  rub inside his nostrils.  It works great with studs and I used it on my gelding when he was being ramish|`|gJE0ujbzaa	If he's 18 hands, I'm assuming he's a draft horse of some sort?<br>  <br>  If he were used or overused for stud, it would be his hind legs, in particular his hocks, that would have problems, not his fronts.  So no, it's not likely.<br>  <br>  It's pretty normal for geldings to act studdy when they are kept with mares. This is one of the problems of having mixed fields of mares and geldings together. While a gelding generally isn't nearly as bad as a stallion, they still have testosterone, and they are often still interested in the mares. They may breed them, and will often want to herd them around and be somewhat agressive with them.  No, there are no aromatherapy oils that will help with this, it's a hormone issue. What would work best would be to keep him in a field with other geldings, and keep him away from the mares.<br>  <br>  Chances are, if he's as big as you say(most people overestimate the height of their horses-but there are of course horses that big!), he was never properly taught how to pick up his feet. It may be that he does not have any pain at all(is he lame?), he just doesn't feel comfortable standing on three legs, and he knows he's big enough to take the feet away.|`|5kUxkun3aa	did you have the horse vetted before you bought it? was it already lame and not lifting its front legs.<br>  if it wasn't lame and lifting it front legs i cannot see why it would be a growth thing as it has only just started doing it.<br>  turn him out on his own or get another male to put out with him.<br>  if you have only just got him have you got it on a trail first any chance you can return him?|`|3NjXyl5Eaa	I am glad to hear you suggest oils and other non-evasive ideas.  Do u use a homeopathic vet?  If not, look it up on line and see if one is in your area.  I use Bio-Scan with is "cold" photon therapy.  I love it.  He may also need to be "balanced" through massage, range of motion, and such.  I do use oils lemon for immune system, calming is lavender.You may want to turn him out by himself in an adjacent pasture.  Do you have a vet check?  There are many ways to approach his "situation"  good luck and if you need further help look on line.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	The front legs have nothing to do with being over used as a stud.<br>  <br>  He could have been castrated late or he may be a rig.  Only your vet could tell the difference with blood tests and internal examination - rather the vet than me!<br>  <br>  He could also just be bloody minded in the field.  Do you know what he is like with other male horses?  He might be the same with them as well.  Some horses are just domineering.<br>  <br>  If he is a rig, I believe this can be operated on, but it does depend on the vet and various other factors.  It is not a straightforward operation.  I had two rigs - and we just kept them away from mares.<br>  <br>  As I said, only discussion with the vet can help.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	It's not clear to me whether this horse is lame or not. If you did not do a prepurchase exam, then I would immediately have the vet out to do normal lameness testing. If there are lameness symptoms, your vet can advise whether x-rays or pain blocks are needed for futher diagnosis.<br>  <br>  However, if the horse simply doesn't lift his legs or doesn't keep them up, this may simply be a sign of poor foundation training. You will need a book like Maimum Hoof Power, which provides information on how to train horses for the farrier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maximum-Hoof-Power-Performance-Management/dp/0876059647/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235145172&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Maximum-Hoof-Power...</a><br>  <br>  Please avoid putting stuff in your horse's nostrils unless clearly advised by a qualified vet who is not a practitioner of "alternative veterinary medicine". Damage to the horse's sense of smell and respiratory system can be the result, and that damage could be permanent.<br>  <br>  Instead, just follow the advice: your horse simply needs to not be turned out with the mares.<br>  <br>  The instincts around herd behavior are hard wired and you are not going to find it easy to overcome them except by doing what you can to avoid them being triggered. You will also need to pay special attention to ground and saddle obedience to make sure the horse complies with cues even when mares are nearby.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Best wishes to you and your horse!

Animals can get nervous if you approach from above their head when they're meeting you<br>  <br>  And do you look like Richard Gere?|`|58J8zchAaa	Well, did u just get the furry thing? because if you did, then its normal for him to be scared. its like if they grabbed u and put u in a different family that you don't know if their going to hurt you or not.. leave him in his cage for about a week or 2, change his food.. give him hamster treats and eventually every now and then put ur hand in there and try to grab him and pet him, he will then understand that your not going to hurt him.<br>  <br>  Also, Idk if this might be the case but hamsters are rodents which means they sleep during the day and wake up at night if you happen to wake him up during the day it would shorten his life span and it would also get you a cranky hamster. so try to let him sleep its okay if you wake him up but don't do it every day.<br>  <br>  Also dont be scared to touch him because i heard that they can sense the fear of the humans like if your scared to touch him, they can tell your scared and they would try to bite you, so just go straight dont be scared and grab him.<br>  <br>  if his not new.. then either you got yourself a cranky old hamster or a hamster thats not interested in a friend =\|`|XXDtilqCaa	What you need to do is teach your hamster to touch you he could be like this becasue someone picked himup when he was young and he wasnt handled correcetly. In order for your hamster to trust you he must know you are not a threat. If you slowly open the door and slowly put you hand in the cage not towards him jsut in the cage he wont be threatened by you if you do what some poeple do which is shove your hand at the hamster then he will become scared. So jsut hold it in there until he walks over and takes a sniff he will do this eventually as they are very curious animlas after he has finished sniffing and he has walked back to somewhere else then slowly remove your hand and close the cage. This is enough for one day then the next day put your hand in again slowly but this time have a treat in your hand hold it there without shoving it in his face and wait until he approaches you and sniffs the treat she may take it or she might jsut sniff it if after a while she hasnt bitten the treat the slowly put it on the floor of the cage and remove your hand. tehn he will associate your hand with treats. The trick is to allow your hamster to approach you the sme with stroking after you have managed for him to approach your hand for a few days try stroking his back a slong as you wait for him he should be fine but if he isnt try again the next day. Continue touching and handling until youcan pick him up without im scrambling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Godd luck and be patient!   :)|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You have a nervous hamster.  If you want to start holding your hamster you will have to ease him / her into human contact bit by bit (no 'sticking' your hand in it's cage).<br>  <br>  Try hand feeding it (approach very slowly and carefully), use a sunflower seed and see if the hamster comes to take this from you.<br>  <br>  If you keep doing this without contact at first, the hamster will start to get used to your hand.<br>  <br>  You are a big thing in it's eyes so it is totally understandable if he / she lets out a squeak when your hand invades it's space.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6i1NM95Haa	leave your hand in the cage dont move it. let him come to you still dont move if he bites try to not react.|`|epywmmHjaa	When he's busy eating stick your hand in and stroke him.

GI27dKIkaa	As 'The Late J' said...<br>  <br>  Geckos, like a lot of lizards, are a predominantly nocturnal species (but he can be active during the day too !) so a UV light is not really necessary.<br>  <br>  A low-powered one can be helpful in the case of a poor diet, as the lizard can synthesise some vitamins from exposure to UV lighting.

09323bf0b0fd30f789881a1f9cb3b0e7aa	One tiny red ant cannot kill a cat. If your cat got bit by one, it's gonna be all right.<br>  <br>  A whole swarm of red FIRE ants, however, can devour a small mammal in minutes. (This is not too terribly uncommon in the southern U.S.) If kitty is not *currently* being devoured by a colony of fire ants, though, she'll be fine.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If there were only twenty, it sounds like a colony of ants was about to devour her. "Was" being the key word. That link I sent you (in the "source" section) describes it, where the ants will invade a mammal's eyes, nose, and mouth, (no mention of ears, though) aiming to kill the animal. Your kitty should still be fine, since she only got a few potential bites, but you may want to take her to the vet for a check-up as soon as possible, just for your own peace of mind.<br>  <br>  here is a page on  fire ant identification: <a href="http://fireants.utk.edu/Webpages/Idpage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://fireants.utk.edu/Webpages/Idpage....</a><br>  <br>  If your cat was bitten - you should be able to tell. If you see the bites, or if your cat is acting like it is in pain (loud, frequent meowing, writhing on the ground, hard breathing), then your cat may have been bitten. Emergency treatment for a cat that has been bitten by fire ants: <br>  <br>  --Never bathe a cat with fire ants on it. The ants will only panic and bite down harder.<br>  <br>  --Keep an eye on the bite area. If the area swells up this may indicate a possible infection that requires treatment.<br>  <br>  --Try to limit your cat biting at the area. Fire ant bites seem to be painful at first and terribly itchy afterward, try to put on cold baking soda and water paste to give relief. Activated charcoal paste, if you can get it, will also help draw out the poison. (Do NOT use burnt food or charcoal meant for the grill!)<br>  <br>  --Small amounts of Benadryl for in case of allergic reactions.<br>  <br>  --Use common sense and call your vet promptly.<br>  <br>  --Contact an exterminator should you see fire ants in your yard.<br>  <br>  Remember, fire ants are not lethal in small amounts, only very painful. Help kitty through the pain, and she should be fine soon.|`|DtkLsetkaa	I don't know much about which type of ants are in the area you live in, but fire ants have a toxin in their saliva that gets in their prey when they bite and slowly poisons them.

I got sick from the bites but it wasn't too serious considering I am a human, but it could have potentially killed a small animal.  If your worried, i would definitely take your cat to the vet.

They will commonly use any means to get out of paying a claim.  Maybe ask your vet for references on insurance plans that pay well.|`|WyNMAUFGaa	If the puppy does not have hip dysplasia officially diagnosed or if the vet has not written in the record that he/she suspects hip dysplasia, you may be able to get insurance, but a previous poster is correct, insurance does not cover preexisting conditions (things diagnosed prior to getting the insurance).  Ask your vet what they recommend for insurance and then read the fine print.  Some insurance companies do not cover certain conditions in specific breeds.  I am not familiar with the options in the UK, but good luck.  There are lots of different options for hip dysplasia though for treatment depending on the severity of the disease.

Add a little bit of warm water just before you feed the dry food to make it more palatable. <br>  The advantage of feeding a complete dry food is -<br>  1. The puppy will poo less, <br>  2. They are less likely to require dental work throughout their life as the dry food knocks the plaque of the teeth <br>  3.

qioH81tiaa	You can't.  The papers come from the breeder.  Which is why you should only *buy* from reputable, responsible breeders.|`|GI27dKIkaa	Why did you not get papers with the dog ?<br>  <br>  Why do you not know who the breeder was ?  If the dog was sold to you as a pedigree without papers, there is NO WAY to prove it's even a pedigree !<br>  <br>  Even if the owner was not the breeder - they would STILL have the pedigree lines from the original breeder !  There is NO way to get papers for a dog without having the KC registration number from the breeders certificate !<br>  <br>  If you were planning to breed from the dog - you CAN'T sell the puppies as pedigrees - without proof of lineage !|`|C1eHfhrHaa	You have to get the papers from the breeder.  You can apply for an ILP or companion number form the AKC, but unless you have the papers from the breeder, you won't be able to register it and get the pedigree.|`|106b0861b9e6921cff2d55a1208f8283aa	You Dont unless you have the registration number, you should have watched rogue traders on bbc1 last night, it was all about the illegal sales of pedigree dogs. Check it out on bbciplayer.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You can't...what leads you to believe your dog has pedigree?  Especially if the breeder is "not known"?|`|cSOwqXKxaa	"Pedigree" is the term for the chart or history of parentage - you can say a dog is a pedigreed dog when its breeding history is recorded, but all dogs have a pedigree - it just may not be tracked on paper or by the AKC.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you bought a dog from a backyard breeder - meaning someone who breeds dogs for money, not because they love dogs and want to improve the breed.  Good breeders never make any money off of their dogs, b/c that $800-$1,000 you plunk down is spent already on veterinary care, premium food, registration, stud fees, and countless other necessary dog needs.<br>  <br>  You're unlikely to get any papers at this point and it's more likely that the dog was never registered with anything, even the pointless UKC, in the first place.  A good breeder would never have sent you home with a pup without giving you everything and answering all of your questions.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your puppy!|`|zNDEDbj1aa	If you saw "Watchdog" on BBC last night you would realise that your dog is probably not a genuine pedigree.<br>  <br>  If it was you would have the name and registration number of both the Ma & Pa supplied with a proper certificate.<br>  <br>  Without that information you will not be able to establish true pedigree.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	I would question how someone would know the dog was a pedigree when they don't know the breeder.  If they know it is a pedigreed dog, then they know where the pup came from.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you were taken for a ride.  You can't get the papers for this dog unfortunately.|`|bqNbAWPHaa	oh dear <br>  you r dog probably isnt pedigree <br>  phone the breeder and demand the papers if not go to the vet and tell him x make sure your pet is not ill - rogue traders last night showed that this happens alot in ireland,<br>  out of interest where did you buy your puppy from and what breed,<br>  good luck !!|`|AA11297232	If the dogs are pedigreed the person who sold it to you should have supplied you with the proof and the papers. The person should also be registered with the Kennel Union Society. Without the papers you cannot claim or tell somebody the dogs is registered.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	If the breeder didn't provide proper paperwork to register, you are out of luck there.

I have got a lhasa apso with no papers and there is no doubt that she is a purebred, and no i am not irresponsible, she is well cared for and part of the family but i have no intention of breeding her.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	If your dog doesn't have papers, and you don't know the breeder...you don't have a dog with a pedigree.<br>  <br>  A pedigree dog means you can trace the parents, grandparents, etc. of the dog, and all of that jazz. At this point, you can't even tell if the dog is 100% purebred, or if the seller was scamming you.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	I doubt very much the dog is a pedigree you have been had! Should have gone to a rescue and given an unwanted dog a home, not line nthe pockets of some back street breeder.|`|6eb40e650879a6f4607c910ca1f0ce5daa	You can't. You can only get the papers from the breeder. How do you know it is a purebred?|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	rotflmao.............impossible.<br>  <br>  You have no proof of anything,including that it's anywhere near purebred.|`|XacL7v9Xaa	Same thing happen to me when I'd bought a "genuine" Gucci watch on eBay :))))|`|Y5dJaZ2saa	visit the following url|`|X4hz3a9haa	you cant. you need to know parents of dog

Be greatful taht he does run around..shows he healthy|`|1hciyvKdaa	Hun, they are nocturnal, next time investiagate before you get a pet!! She needs her exersice while shes up!!|`|WHFzKlJCaa	Rabbits are nocturnal and therefore she will be up most of the night, mine is too. I let her out to play first thing in the morning and last thing at night and since she knows she gets to play at those times shes not as noisy now. I give her hay to snack on, but don't overfeed her because that can cause health problems.I'll also put her fresh veggies in at night and that takes up some of her time.  I put toilet paper rolls (just the cardboard) in her cage and she chomps on them. You can also get soft toys (made for rabbits) at pet stores and they like to move those around. If she's too loud maybe move her out of your room for the night... Good luck!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Rabbits are nocturnal, and most active at night. That is why I always fed mine in the evening. Make sure she has a nightlight or some sort of light, so she isn't in the total darkness at night.<br>  be thankful she's not a thumper.|`|jLBw92IXaa	It needs to feel the warmth of another rabbit.|`|id3yBPGfaa	poor baby lol I have two mini rex's and they do the same thing so I let them out of the cage in my room at night and let them run. but before you try this bunny proof your room. Usually they will run around but it's not enough to be disturbing to me every once in awhile it's like I am at the Daytona 500 but for the most part they are quiet... Good Luck|`|dMeRuiblaa	it might sound harsh but try putting a blanket over it so that the rabbit will think it's truly night or maybe it does want more attention.
7iVbgxiSaa	i had a cat but my dog used to scare it and then it started run off for several days each time and became weaker and stopped eating and got a weird infection on his eye... and then he died.<br>  <br>  i miss him i got a new cat... he's fat and stupid|`|cj31x3UMaa	Distemper, the cat would be hanging over the water bowl, unable to drink, have nasty diarrhea & not be eating... plus have a respiratory infection. Those are the symptoms I remember from nursing a cat through it ~10-15 years ago.<br>  <br>  There *is* something wrong w/ the cat & he needs to be checked by a vet ASAP - he could be injured. I would not be leaving him outside when sick as you have no way to monitor him.|`|WyNMAUFGaa	It can be signs of a lot of things, most of which are medical issues that need to see a veterinarian.  I would recommend go to the vet and get some bloodwork done (including CBC, chemistry, electrolytes, and a feline leukemia/FIV test).  This is not normal for a kitty.  Good luck
NzSA6dmyaa	the nose might be nose rub which is cause by rubbing it nose against glass mesh wood etc it could have got infected. if its infected you'll need to see a vet you could ask if they do any payment plans ok ask a friend for a loan|`|JPlVt9xYaa	Are you sure you Gecko is not molting? Just as with snakes, they lose their skin. Shedding is a common and annual procedure. Check out the link below, look at the pictures and see if you see a similar condition. You may be surprised to see that you have a very normal pet.|`|2nmFFFQ4aa	No you cannot treat her yourself. She needs a vet to look at her. If the nose looks like its rotting then there is something very serious wrong with it. You need to borrow money or do whatever it takes if you want it to live.|`|B4CeJPUYaa	It could be due to calcium deficiency, is the temp in the tank ok my bearded dragon wasn't eating until i sorted the temp out properly then it started eating again.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Sounds like either mouth rot or rostral abrasion that became infected...you cant treat either yourself. Find the money to get to the vet. When you take on the responsibility of a pet you recognise that you need to take that pet to the vet when it gets sick. I have no spare money right now, its all going on my ridiculously high rent, but I still managed to find ￡70 ($140) to have my female ferrets checked over, jill jabbed and wormed, because I'd do anything for my babies and if they need the vet I suffer for it, simple as that. I'd go hungry before deny them necessary veterinary treatment.<br>  <br>  If you cant afford the vet, you cant afford the pet, simple as that.

Although this breed is gentle and affectionate, they do not have patience for unruly children.<br>  <br>  Care:  The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel must be brushed weekly to prevent mats and tangles.

zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior...<br>  <br>  What I had done, is get smaller can of cat food at the pet store.  Let her try them, does that she like, are the one I kept and feed my cats...<br>  <br>  So I am not wasting the food at all.  Try mixing the can food, half with nice warm water to make it juicer for them... All my cats in the past loves it... this way, you can feed them 1/2 a can in the morning, and 1/2 a can in the evening...  No cold can... make sure to warm them up...<br>  <br>  Hope this work for your cat, as cat will always be finicky...|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Fancy Feast elegant medleys is an ok brand.  If one cat is eating $80 a month I think she is being over fed.  I know i can usually get a case of 24 cans for about $21 dollars. I would consider feeding a can in the morning and trying some different dry foods instead of canned.  If you really want to get her off it try mixing in the new gradually adding more and more of it.  This will usually do the trick and she will get used to the taste of it and hopefully it will not upset her stomach.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Try weaning her off of it- gradually introduce the cheaper stuff, mix in 75% expensive 25% cheap for a few days, then go to 50% of each, then 25% of the expensive stuff, then entirely cheap.<br>  <br>  Or you can just ignore her- she won't starve to death she'll eat the cheap stuff when she gets hungry enough.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Are you feeding her at scheduled feedings or just whenever she "says" she's hungry?  If she's an average size cat (7-10 pounds), she should be eating about 3 small cans a day if she's an active cat.  Two if she's on the lazy side and she should have a feeding schedule.  Fancy Feast is a pretty good food (some are far better but for the money FF is a top "cheaper brand").  If you go to lower quality than that, you'll be feeding a bunch of grain-fillers which will leave her unsatisfied and hungrier thus needing even more of a cheaper food.  Better brands use high quality proteins (by-products are low quality proteins found in the cheaper foods) and have little to no grain fillers so the cats get more nutrition from less food which saves money in the long run. It's great you're feeding her wet.  That will save you a ton on vet bills as well.  Dry food contain too many carbs which can lead to diabetes and/or kidney failure if fed long term.  And dry food doesn't clean your cat's teeth.<br>  <br>  Look into feeding Wellness or Innova.  A case of 24 cans costs about $30 and should feed your kitty for a month or more. *edit* Oops!  Bad math!  At 3 cans a day, a case will last 2 months...sorry, I didn't have my coffee yet!|`|yr5W0xS3aa	What i do is mix 2 of them together and it will get used to it|`|XdpBUUZyaa	Just gradually give her less of the food a day|`|lFVfKxBVaa	Try switching her over to the dry version of the food. A diet of just canned food can cause weight gain, dental problems, and other issues with her health. If she refuses to switch to the dry version, mix some of the wet food in with the dry. Make it a treat, not a meal. <br>  <br>  Also consider buying one can of several different types of canned food and experiment with her tastes. <br>  <br>  Try catchannel.com for more ideas and references.
uzfdgFSxaa	That's tough.  I think it would be a fair fight and either one could win.  Polar bears weigh around 780-1500 lbs and Grizzly's weigh around 400-1200 lbs.

TOTW is very good, no corn, soy, or wheat used as fillers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tho if cash is still an issue Iams is an okay(not great) brand I would consider over Eukanuba at around a similar price.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Pedigree canned is also pretty good for a grocery store food.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	The only least expensive brand I would suggest is at Costco. It's their own brand & here it sells for $23 for 50lb bag. It is better than Iams, Pedigree & Eukanuba. It is a decent food not a great one but far better for the price. If the other three brands cost half  of their normal price then I might suggest them but their quality & cost are far from equal.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	First, this website will be a great help so that you can check the ratings, ingredient list, vitamin/mineral/protein content, and a review for each dog food out there.  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com</a><br>  <br>  Most of Eukanuba is ranked only one star.  While chicken is the first listed ingredient on some of their foods, the above site will explain how once water content is removed, that chicken no longer holds the #1 spot on the ingredient list (manufacturers are tricky, huh?!)<br>  <br>  All that being said, there are several 3 star rated foods that can be found at a much cheaper price in main stores.  One is Kirklands (which I believe someone already mentioned.)  Another is Nature Recipe (is sold at Petco type places...runs about $30 for a 40lb. bag.)  Neither of these are *great* foods, but I just wanted to give you a suggestion so you have a starting point. Best of luck!|`|kRO55DHyaa	Kirkland, PMI Exclusive Lamb & Rice (all of their other foods suck-I'd only use the Exclusive), Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, Diamond Naturals Lamb & Rice, Nutro Ultra (their other foods are not good-I'd ONLY choose Ultra), and Canidae are lower priced brands that are still better then Eukanuba, and probably all are cheaper, too.  I always recommend foods by Natura (Innova, California Natural, Healthwise, and Karma)...they are the best I have tried.  Healthwise is pretty reasonably priced, too.  Dogs will eat a lot less of these foods, as they aren't so full of corn gluten, wheat gluten, and other fillers.  I'd rather supplement my dog's food with a Glucosamine, Chondroiten, and MSM pill than feed Eukanuba.  I suggest finding a good food that you can be comfortable with and supplementing if you have to.  You can purchase a huge bottle of the supplement at CostCo or Sam's for about $25.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Think again about iams and Eukanuba's quality: <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  Companies play up ingredients to make the food seem to have more meat in it. I would rather see three meats after oatmeal or rice as the first four then to see chicken then two or more grains listed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Look into taste of the wild, innova, solid gold, castor and pollux, pinnacle, wellness, wellness core, etc. <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com</a>|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	The Kirkland brand from Costco is better AND cheaper.
FewhKlx9aa	I found this helpful and feed my dogs this also,it helps them get the nutrition and also help with anal gland problem I use to have by getting lots of natural fiber in their diet,<br>   Apples (they contain potassium, which stimulates the immune system, and pepsin, which helps the stomach)<br>  * Broccoli (rich in vitamins)<br>  * Carrots (rich in vitamins, great treats to substitute for biscuits)<br>  * Cabbage (rich in vitamins, good for digestive system and skin)<br>  * Cucumber (good for teeth and bones due to potassium content; can combine with carrots to promote a healthy liver and kidneys; in juice form, a good diuretic … peel cucumbers unless organically grown)<br>  * Celery (chopped or juiced; can help with arthritis)<br>  * Garlic (removes waste from blood, can help repel fleas; use fresh garlic finely minced)<br>  * Green beans (lightly steamed; healthy and low-cal treat)<br>  * Parsley (can reduce allergy symptoms and aid kidney function; chop finely or boil parsley and add the juice over food)<br>  * Kale (rich in antioxidants and can help reduce allergy symptoms)<br>  * Spinach (very healthy; serve chopped)<br>  * Bananas (in small quantity; a coveted treat)<br>  * Olive oil (a tablespoon a day is good for skin and fur) * Preparation suggestions: Many veggies can be served raw, lightly steamed or in juice form. For most vegetables such as broccoli and carrots, it is far better to steam them instead of serving raw for improved digestibility and nutritional value. Also, since dogs have small digestive tracts, you can puree vegetables to enable your pet to digest more. If you use canned vegetables, get the salt-free kinds.* Organically grown benefits: Due to their smaller size and more compact body systems, pets can be more prone to the toxic effects of pesticide contamination than are people. So it is best to feed them produce that is organically|`|fMRcX2WDaa	actually dogs need fruits and veggies and meat in there diet you giving him fruits and veggies is good. you should check out the aspca web site they have a listing of safe and not so safe foods for dogs but the apples, carrots, bananas and green beans are great for him and i'm sure he loves them.you could also try yogurt as well my dogs love it and it helps keep unwanted bacteria away and good bacteria present have fun|`|3zv2bbolaa	* Apple seeds<br>      * Apricot pits<br>      * Cherry pits<br>      * Coffee (grounds, beans, chocolate covered espresso beans)<br>      * Grapes<br>      * Hops<br>      * Macadamia nuts<br>      * Moldy foods<br>      * Mushroom plants<br>      * Mustard seeds<br>      * Onions and onion powder<br>      * Peach pits<br>      * Potato leaves and stems (green parts)<br>      * Raisins<br>      * Rhubarb leaves<br>      * Tomato leaves and stems (green parts)<br>      * Walnuts<br>      * Yeast dough|`|agh18eT2aa	I read somewhere not to give dogs mushrooms.

She's strange.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Items to avoid Reasons to avoid <br>  Alcoholic beverages Can cause intoxication, coma, and death. <br>  <br>  Baby food Can contain onion powder, which can be toxic to dogs. (Please see onion below.) Can also result in nutritional deficiencies, if fed in large amounts. <br>  <br>  Bones from fish, poultry, or other meat sources Can cause obstruction or laceration of the digestive system. <br>  <br>  Cat food Generally too high in protein and fats. <br>  <br>  Chocolate, coffee, tea, and other caffeine Contain caffeine, theobromine, or theophylline, which can be toxic and affect the heart and nervous systems. <br>  <br>  Citrus oil extracts Can cause vomiting. <br>  <br>  Fat trimmings Can cause pancreatitis. <br>  <br>  Grapes and raisins Contain an unknown toxin, which can damage the kidneys. There have been no problems associated with grape seed extract. <br>  <br>  Hops Unknown compound causes panting, increased heart rate, elevated temperature, seizures, and death. <br>  <br>  Human vitamin supplements containing iron Can damage the lining of the digestive system and be toxic to the other organs including the liver and kidneys. <br>  <br>  Large amounts of liver Can cause Vitamin A toxicity, which affects muscles and bones. <br>  <br>  Macadamia nuts Contain an unknown toxin, which can affect the digestive and nervous systems and muscle. <br>  <br>  Marijuana Can depress the nervous system, cause vomiting, and changes in the heart rate. <br>  <br>  Milk and other dairy products Some adult dogs and cats do not have sufficient amounts of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the lactose in milk. This can result in diarrhea. Lactose-free milk products are available for pets. <br>  <br>  Moldy or spoiled food, garbage Can contain multiple toxins causing vomiting and diarrhea and can also affect other organs. <br>  <br>  Mushrooms Can contain toxins, which may affect multiple systems in the body, cause shock, and result in death. <br>  <br>  Onions and garlic (raw, cooked, or powder) Contain sulfoxides and disulfides, which can damage red blood cells and cause anemia. Cats are more susceptible than dogs. Garlic is less toxic than onions. <br>  <br>  Persimmons Seeds can cause intestinal obstruction and enteritis. <br>  Pits from peaches and plums Can cause obstruction of the digestive tract. <br>  <br>  Potato, rhubarb, and tomato leaves; potato and tomato stems Contain oxalates, which can affect the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems. This is more of a problem in livestock. <br>  <br>  Raw eggs Contain an enzyme called avidin, which decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin). This can lead to skin and hair coat problems. Raw eggs may also contain Salmonella. <br>  <br>  Raw fish Can result in a thiamine (a B vitamin) deficiency leading to loss of appetite, seizures, and in severe cases, death. More common if raw fish is fed regularly. <br>  <br>  Salt If eaten in large quantities it may lead to electrolyte imbalances. <br>  String Can become trapped in the digestive system; called a "string foreign body." <br>  <br>  Sugary foods Can lead to obesity, dental problems, and possibly diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Table scraps (in large amounts) Table scraps are not nutritionally balanced. They should never be more than 10% of the diet. Fat should be trimmed from meat; bones should not be fed. <br>  <br>  Tobacco Contains nicotine, which affects the digestive and nervous systems. Can result in rapid heart beat, collapse, coma, and death. <br>  <br>  Yeast dough Can expand and produce gas in the digestive system, causing pain and possible rupture of the stomach or intestines.|`|PGv3srOmaa	i have a west highland terrier and i feed him apples, carrots, and sometimes when he is feeling sick i boil hamburger then drain it out. then i add cooked white rice to that and he just loves it.<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|4IZHdhJQaa	My dogs go crazy when i peel an orange or am eating strawberries, and love too eat them.<br>  Most fruits in moderation are fine.|`|vVZLFPtRaa	Lettuce and Carrots you Rascally Rabbit .|`|KaDuWf0Qaa	My dog could eat carrots all day!

My rescue (who passed away a few months ago) I would not allow around children unless I was holding her. She was very fearful and I did not know her background. My older male is great around children. Because he is deaf, I would be careful to make sure he was not startled while asleep. My new female has only been a member of our family for 2 months. At this point, I feel she would do well around children, but I would need to judge her reactions to feel 100% comfortable. I feel all dog/child interactions need to be supervised since I don't have children and they, therefore, are not around children all the time. Any children my dogs are around must understand how to gently interact with a dog, or I will remove my dogs from the situation. I have a breed that can be snippy and I will not allow my dog to react with a bite because a parent didn't teach a child not to poke and pull.|`|a6an2aN0aa	1.

BMri9tITaa	For bettas, it really depends on whether you're getting male or females bettas.  If a male, just one betta in either tank.  If a female, you can get either one female betta, or 5-6.<br>  <br>  Cory catfish should be in schools of 4-6.  They are all about two inches long (there are exceptions, but most are two inches).<br>  <br>  Cardinal tetras should be in schools of at least 6.  The more you have, the better they look.<br>  <br>  Otos can be anywhere from 1 to 2 inches, depending on what kind you get.  You should have at least three to a school, 6 is better.<br>  <br>  When it comes to assassin snails, that really depends on if you want snail babies or not (hint: you don't).<br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  <br>  30 gallon:<br>  <br>  8 cardinal tetra<br>  1 male betta<br>  6 oto<br>  6 cory catfish<br>  1 assassin snail<br>  <br>  40 gallon:<br>  <br>  10 cardinal tetra<br>  5 female betta<br>  6 oto<br>  6 cory catfish<br>  1 assassin snail<br>  <br>  The 40 gallon suggestion breaks the "1 inch per gallon" rule of thumb just a tad, but that rule is just an approximation.  You should be fine with that stocking.

evnj2DUpaa	Cats like cardboard because when they scratch it it feels good on their claws. If you don't approve of this, then there are cardboard scratching posts if you want to save your boxes and plastic bags. They like plastic because they like the way it feels on their teeth|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Do you mean cardboard boxes? Or pieces of cardboard? Cats love to play in boxes just like children love to play in forts. <br>  <br>  It is funny how we will spend hundreds of dollars on cat trees, kitty condos, the newest cat toys... then they play with a scrap of cardboard for a half hour.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Because cardboard boxes make excellent hiding places. :)|`|H7JS6h0waa	because they like anything they can scratch their nails on or hide in, my cats also love to lick plastic bags for some reason which i also thought was strange.
VTee51r9aa	I also have a tadpole that was shipped to me by Milton Industries. I got him back in October and still no legs or signs that he's changing into a tadpole. I did read somewhere online that they go dormate in the winter months, so hopefully as soon as winter passes he will begin to grow. Good luck!|`|WfBZcSPVaa	I have a pond and by the end some of the tadpoles didn't change. They have disappeared now and probably been killed off by the cold or changed really late on. But the person we got the frogspawn from told us that he had had tadpoles stay tadpoles through the winter and then change into frogs the next year. That might happen to you, or it might never change. The little frogs they change into are so cute!!! Our lawn was covered in them last year.|`|oemHtmDsaa	Some tadpoles are actually baby bullfrogs. I went to a conservation area with my school a few years ago and the man there said that bullfrog tadpoles take about 5 years to turn into frogs! So maybe its just a bullfrog tadpole!|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Are you absolutely positive that it is a tadpole?|`|TjLCnxkKaa	I'm interested because I've never tried raising amphibians. Is this some kind of artificially bred deal?<br>  <br>   I admit I'm no expert on amphibians so it may be the particular species you have, but when I had my nature pond they spawned early spring and the tadpoles transformed by mid to late summer in time to get out before winter.
YV1bOajXaa	Dogs do not let you know when they are in pain.  It is because they are pack animals and to show pain would be to show weakness.  In other words, if her back hurts, her hip joints hurt, etc., she will not cry to let you know.  <br>  <br>  We had a Golden Retriever that we had put to sleep at age 13.  He had arthritis and was on medication for that, but in the last year he needed me to lift him to his feet and then he could walk to get outside to go potty.  He enjoyed eating and came out to the dining room when we had dinner "in case" we dropped something.  In the last couple months, he stopped coming to the dining room.  In addition to getting him to his feet, I had to practically carry him outside.  He began to have accidents in the house - he would just lay there and leak because he could not get up.  In the end he stopped eating.  He had no desire for food and after going outside would just go back to his bed.  We made the decision to have him put down.  I always said "just because he is old and has trouble getting up, doesn't mean he should be put to sleep", but when he couldn't eat or drink, it was time.  <br>  <br>  It is a tough decision, but it is yours to make - not the vet, not your relatives or friends.  You are your dogs advocate and you must do what is best for her.|`|PGv3srOmaa	when your dog wont respond to you ( she is going deaf) and will go to the bathroom wherever is easiest for her ( probabbly inside) . or if u have to yell to get her attention (signs of deafness).<br>  <br>  my friends dog has these same problems and his dog is 14 and its almost time for them to put her down.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..... sorry if you do have to put her down|`|USF8xNfhaa	As you described now would be a good time this dog is suffering 17 years is a good long life now put the animal down before it gets worse|`|qszeZXwWaa	When she looks like she's tired.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Bladder control doesn't seem to ME to be a reason to put a dog down. You can buy diapers for her. <br>  If she is happy and healthy, its not time. To me, its time when quality of life declines and the dog is suffering. Talk to your vet if you are unsure.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	when the dog is suffering<br>  its always up to the owner. Watch your dog carefully. Is she really happy the way she is?|`|H7JS6h0waa	i recently put my dog down, he was very old. doctors say that as long as they still are eating then they still have the will to live, she may not be able to control her bladder but it doesnt mean she is ready to get put to sleep. when my dog stopped eating and we found out he had kidney failure is when we decided it was best for him to put him down, which was still very sad.|`|agh18eT2aa	You should get a professional opinion from your vet, who would be the one to do it anyway.  The dog can't tell you if it's suffering from pain, but the vet can determine that.  I have seen blind dogs live a full and happy life, and I have seen dogs with bladder control issues that have been trained to wear diapers and live a happy life.  At this age, however, there may be other issues that will have an affect on your decision.  Let the vet decide.  It will be an educated decision, and you will be free from guilt.  I hope you don't have to.  That's a long relationship to give up.
Z9zzNYNCaa	Just the most recent "fad-for-fools".<br>  Like any other breed(or,unfortunately,mutt) that the lemmings glom onto. Bought w/out any research.

Well, in less than a month she is housebroken, understands hand signs and barks whenever she sees others barking. My male is an agility champion and just begun Schutzhund training, so trust me he's not apathetic. I think they were just over bred and you've seen some of the results.|`|agh18eT2aa	Don't know a lot about the behavior of the breed, but the Westminster Kennel club site has information on all breeds, and so does Dogster.com.  I do know that they are a very handsome breed with a lean, fast, muscular looking form.  I think their looks are a lot of the reason people get them.|`|3GHXk05saa	The dog's personality has to match the owner's expectations. And how the pet is brought up has a lot to do with it. The ones I've known have been very smart, attentive to commands, loving, protective, and all around great pets. But, the families who've had them know the breed's characteristics and brought them up accordingly. They are willful, so need a firmly established alpha but once you have that they should be fine.<br>  Breeds have certain tendencies, that's true, but a lot of it comes down to how the owners treat them.|`|kNscpF4Faa	My boxer is a smart dog...but as with any dog I took the time and effort to train her into the dog I want to be around...All breeds of dogs that seem to have learning problems/stubbornness is usually caused by over-breeding /inbreeding.

The thing is that a dog is much like a best friend...

4yt4D3vMaa	It usually means his diet and digestion aren't quite right-the main part of his diet should be good quality hay such as Timothy hay with a handful of pellets and some greens daily. I would only give small amounts of greens just now or none if he doesn't normally have them until the problem clears up a bit. If changing his diet doesn't help then he may need his teeth checked as uneven growth or tooth spurs can cause rabbits not to chew their food properly. It would also be a good idea to try and get some probiotic for rabbits, from the vets or online to restore the balance of gut bacteria.Some helpful links on diet <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html</a>  how to clean his bottom <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/buttbath.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/buttbath.h...</a>  rabbit poop-the section on cecal dysbiosis is relevant <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/poop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/poop.html</a>   and something to watch out for <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html</a>|`|LDdd6uAQaa	a lot of problems of sticky bottom syndrome are down to bad diet.

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I have fed Canidae for quite some time and my dogs experienced zero issues when the formulation was switched. <br>  It still remains a good quality food, but not all dogs are going to do well on a new formula. <br>  <br>  In regards to the answer above mine, the class action lawsuit against Canidae is not true. I heard this rumor as well and looked into it at length. It's a rumor as 0 dogs have died from Canidae food. You cannot sue because your dog got diarrhea, if that were the case, every dog food company would be sued as no food will agree with every dog.<br>  <br>  Edit: That's the website I initially saw and got me started looking into it....do some more research, you'll find that it's a load of crap. Legally, you can't sue because your dog didn't do well on a food.....no dogs have died, therefore, no attorney would take this case. I'd be shocked if anything came of this. <br>  Canidae themselves have gotten their own lawyers involved to find out where this rumor started.<br>  <br>  The consumer affairs website is the same website that claimed Canidae had acetominophen in their food and that was proved to be completely false. It seems this site will post any claims without any kind of proof. <br>  I don't deny that people may have problems with Canidae food, espeicially with the formula switch, but you can find negative reviews on any kind of food....it doesn't mean it's dangerous.<br>  <br>  Edit: Kidney and Liver damage? I don't believe that for one second. All of Canidae's ingredients are USDA human grade ingredients .....there is no way it would cause liver or kidney issues of any kind. I know many, many people that continue to feed Canidae to their dogs without any issues whatsoever, and those that have had issues are limited to diarrhea....which simply means the food doesn't agree with that particular dog.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I would switch her off if it but I am kind of biased. They started splitting ingredients and went to non-specific ingredients. Also, they moved lamb meal down on the list. All for a price increase.<br>  <br>  Look into innova or Taste of the wild if you want to switch.|`|OVASKZMNaa	I noticed nothing different with my dogs when switching to the "new" formula (which has been out for quite some time). Both of my dogs continue to do wonderfully on Canidae.<br>  <br>  My cat however didn't do so well with the switch on Felidae. I had to change her food due to diarrhea after the "new" formula came out. She now eats Acana Prairie Feast (no grain) and Weruva canned.<br>  <br>  I don't think it was the food causing the various issues you mentioned.<br>  <br>  Edit: Kidney and liver damange from Canidae...that sounds like a load of CRAP to me!<br>  <br>  Also...most of the info I've found by googling states that Canidae uses corn as a filler; which is completely false!|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I feed my dog Canidae and have not had any problems.  He loves it - prior to that he ate Chicken Soup for the Puppy - it was like forcing him to eat.  My parents have also been feeding it to their dogs for several years and haven't had any problems.  There is a class action law suit being built up right now against Canidae and Innova but there have not been any recalls of Canidae, it is all speculation at this point.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Originally we had troubles with the change over.. We didn't realize that a new formula was coming out and we didn't buy any old formula to be able to change the dogs over with.. it was a surprise.. Our dogs had diarrhea immediately from the new food.. We contacted Canidae who told us to change over slowly, which obviously was not an option at that point.. So we tried a few other foods, Solid Gold, Wellness etc.. None were like Canidae when it came to the dogs.. So we finally went back to Canidae and the dogs are fine with it.. I think if you are having problems it's related to the way the dog was changed over.. I would follow Canidae's directions and feed many small meals thru out the day to avoid the digest upset.. and would stick with the Canidae.<br>  <br>  Edit: The class action lawsuit is not true at all.. Just cause there is a website doesn't mean it is true. I contacted them in regards to the lawsuit  THREE times now and they ignore me. I also contacted them a fourth time and told them that I thought it was a big con job to make Canidae look bad.. They still ignore me.. If it were a true Class action lawsuit.. Why do they ignore people who contact them ? Why it is done with a website that was put up for free, a ' template ' didn't the lawyer have his own website prior to thinking he could sue Canidae? It's someone who is working for another dog food company and they are bugged that their dog food is garbage and jealous.. I have 10 dogs, all eating Canidae.. Puppies, adults, old dogs, and no one has died, or had bloody diarrhea.. I have had pregnant females eating Canidae.. no issues.. TEN DOGS, If someone was going to have a serious problem with the Canidae ( other than a change over problem ) then it would certainly have been me..|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Canidae did change their formula several months ago. Some dogs didn't adjust well to the formula change, but most had no problem with it.<br>  There is no law suit pending against them and there is no kidney & liver damage caused by Canidae..this is all a hoax and it is too bad someone felt the need ot spread false accusations against a company.
UC9Wjjscaa	I don't think you are being unreasonable at all if most of the care is going to fall on your shoulders.  I personally love German Shepherds but they are not the dog for someone who does not have time to invest in the training.  They can be very dominant dogs and have to be trained to know their place in house hold. They are super smart though and with proper training make a wonderful family pet. I think that you and your husband should research the breed a little so that he will see what is involved in training one and that if untrained they can be dangerous dogs.  They need lots of attention and guidance from the time you bring them home and they are big time chewers.  They will chew on any and everything in your house if not watched and taught what they are allowed to have. But all considered they are great but not if it is not wanted or like by anyone in house.  Everyone in house has to be willing to act a pack leader or dog will take of advantage of those he sees a weaker than him. The purpose of him getting a dog is for it to be his responsiblity, but if he is home only in the evenings he is not going to be able to give it what it needs. I would say wait until he has more time to devote to it and then by all means he can get the dog he wants.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes just a bit. You have a dog YOU like and got a week too soon.<br>  <br>  Seriously If you can't come up with an argument better "I just don't like them and I am the one at home all the time(well SOMEONE has to work don't they?)" let the man have his dog.<br>  <br>  But hey you're someone who didn't like Dogma, WHICH by the way was written by someone who is a christian and loves god, but hey your sense of humor switch must be in the OFF position.|`|agh18eT2aa	Who picked the cats and the Golden?  If you did, or if he relented to your wishes, then let him have his dog.  It's only fair.  But if you will be caring for it all day, he should compensate you in some way.  If the dogs is HIS, then he should take responsibility for it.  If he can't because he works and you don't, then a little paycheck from him should be offered.  I don't see why not.  If he boarded it while he worked, he'd pay handsomely.|`|AA11085356	German Shepherds are very good dogs. Give it a chance. But if your husband is the one that wants the dog, make sure he has the responsibilities for it, feeding in the morning before work, bathing, walking, etc. I've had a German Shepherd before, and he was a very well behaved dog. Great for families too.|`|3zv2bbolaa	I don't believe you are being unreasonable at all. Marriages are partnerships where both parties have equal say in any changes made to the household. Your husband should be willing to come to an agreement and find a mutually acceptable breed for both of you.|`|8j7FCEOraa	I wouldn't let him<br>  I mean if he wants it so bad get him to take it to work<br>  Its your house too, and you should get something you both agree on<br>  Its not fair for him to expect you to care for his animal|`|h5cPbPj5aa	Unfair. Marriage is about commitment, happiness, sometimes compromise. You dont want this commitment, it makes you unhappy, and he isn't doing anything to compromise. Also its going to be YOU taking care aof a dog you dont even like, which isn't fair. tell him if he really wants it, he has to bring it to work. lol|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	you should still try to find a dog you both like!

You realize that like goldens they all have different personalities?|`|fFtBqFB6aa	Personally, i don't think that's fair to you. The one who has to care for it all day long. I can totally understand.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Yes, you are being a bit unreasonable...let the man have his dog.<br>  <br>  Sounds more like a control issue than a dog issue|`|1FPpglMpaa	I don't think you are being unreasonable at all.  All the animals in a home should be loved and all the humans in the home should understand that the animals are a mutually shared responsibility.  I would tell him that if he goes ahead with this you feel it would impact the relationship because he clearly was not respecting your feelings.  If counters with you not respecting his, remind him that a German Shepherd is a living being and deserves a loving  home, not disrespected feelings betwn husband and wife.     <br>  <br>  Having said that, what you might want to offer to do is contact a well respected GS breeder in your area (go to the National Breed Club to find one) and agree to spend some time with adult GS. Adult because puppies are easy to fall in love with but they are puppies a short time, you'll be spending most of your life with an adult dog.   this will be your attempt to see if perhaps you might change your mind.  However, your husband must agree that if you still do not want one, then he has to accept that.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	A well-bred German Shepherd Dog is an absolutely wonderful dog, a poorly-bred one can be a nightmare as far as behavior & health problems.  But that's not the point.<br>  <br>  The point is, if he is not going to be doing the majority of the work in caring for the new dog whatever the breed, it's unfair to make that decision and put the burden on you.<br>  <br>  Add:  I see in your previous question that you just got the Golden Retriever, it's only a 7 wk old pup.  Whatever you decide, getting another dog or not, raising 2 puppies, or a puppy and adding a new, adult dog to your household can be really stressful.  Give it a year at least until your pup is grown before you add another dog or puppy.  Good luck.|`|om4Szik7aa	Well, personally, I have been in the same spot. I am a German Shepherd Lover and was not too keen on Dobermans when my husband wanted one. I was scared of the breed. I was the stay at home Mom, and I would be responsible for potty training, cleaning up after it and such, BUT Ididn't mind doing all that for him. As far as not liking the breed he chose 100%, that did not matter. Because if this breed of dog was important to him then it was to me too. My husbands happiness over-rides my own (personally) and I want him to have anything he wants. When I got my German Shepherd, he really didn't want a dog, in general. But that didn't matter. He knew what it meant to me and let my feelings over-ride his. Personally, I think, just because you don't like the breed he wants, is not a good enough reason for him to basically be told no your not open to the idea. I also, don't think making him compromise would be good either, as you I am sure want him to love this animal and there is no better way for that, then getting him the dog he wants. Everything worked out well for my husband and I, and I am no longer scared of the Doberman breed at all. I hope everything works out, and that your Husband gets the German Shepherd. Keep in mind of the things he has done for you when you know he maybe didn't want to.<br>  *** UPDATE***Also, one person said your husband should compensate you for caring for the animal, I think thats a horrible things to ask. Get him the dog, because you love him and he loves you. Don't make caring for something of his into a chore. I mean, really think about it. The only reason your upset is because it's a breed you don't personally like, but if it was a breed you did like it would be alright. I don't mean to be harsh but that sounds a bit selfish....I disagree with almost everyone on here in the way they responded to this. Your husband is out working all day, providing and doing what he needs to do to care for the family. Letting him have his dream dog, really would not impact your life in a negative way. So you let it out with the GR, they will play all day and you will come to see, how happy this dog makes your husband and be so happy you did it.<br>  <br>  <br>  QUOTE FROM ANOTHER:<br>  the greman sheperd will kill your cats if not watch very closely and if it turns on you or your cats you will not be able to fiht it off fully grown it would be able to take your husband down and get servel bits off before he could react but mybe try to persuade your husband buy researching similar safer daogs and showing him them mybe he will find one he likes better<br>  <br>  Are you kidding me?! A german Shepherd will NOT kill the cats. Thats absurd. Some do not like cats, mine does not, but guess what we got a kitten and everything is fine. It's not going to turn on an owner anymore then other breeds. This is the problem with people. Because GSD are in police work and such they are now labeled unsafe? Did you know statistically, smaller dogs are more aggressive and bite more then these so called unsafe breeds??? But because a large breed can break the skin they are the dangerous ones, when a bite is a bite. I think, to the above person I quoted, they need to do some research, before they make an ignorant comment.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Maybe a German Shepherd is his dream dog and he's wanted one for a long time.<br>  <br>  They are very lovely puppies and I think you will fall in love with the pup and then wonder why it was that you didn't like the breed.<br>  <br>  If he hasn't chosen any of the animals you already have then I think it's only fair that he chooses the one he wants this time.|`|DEGClROKaa	heh sounds like he's a little kid if you know what i mean (no offense).

Overall it is a bit of a tricky situation you're in, do a bit of research into the breed yourself so you have the knowledge behind you before you sit down and talk it out with him. For instance a generic breed problem with German shepherd's is weak hips resulting in skinny back legs and hip problems as they grow older. <br>  <br>  I think the perfect thing to do would be to talk with your husband. I think you'll love the puppy no matter what breed it is.

Getting a "tough" dog is a mistake in my opinion.  It may be an ego thing with him, which would not be good.<br>  <br>  Tough dogs can make it hard to get insurance.  Neighbors will be fearful... and heaven forbid they ever attack a child, you will be paying for the rest of your lives.<br>  <br>  If your husband wants the fun of training his "own" dog, I would recommend an Australian Shepherd.  They are AMAZINGLY smart, can learn anything, athletic... and most importantly friendly, fun and non-threatening...and YOU will love it.

I have 10 zebra finches and 9 society finches in one 5ft huge cage. It's 5 male and 5 female as I added to my collection the males use to pick at each other bad to the point where I thought they were sick and dying. The males are very territorial so they need alot of space to fly away from each other, the females get like that when they are nesting and the others get to close to their nests. I don't think you should spray them it is in their nature to do that just give them time to get use to each other and give them plenty to get their nest started like little sticks from millet too, shredded cotton, ect. it keeps them very entertained as they fly around with it making their nest more comfortable to sleep in. Until they get things right they will be frustrated and take it out on each other the cuttle bone is great find other treats that they can peck at also it helps with their frustrations. I hope this info has helped you, my zebras and societies get along great now they all respect each others space.

I think there might be a training program for pets where you can help her be more kid friendly.I'm sure you all love her, but she has got to behave, since I'm sure you don't want to get rid of her. Make sure your little bro stays away from her, and maybe for a while you can put her food, water, and litter box in a room that your brother and family rarely go in, so she can have some time alone. Make sure she has toys, and is satisfied physically in her room. If you train her to use toys like this, then she may be able to take out all of her energy out on them. Also, have you tried catnip? Does your kitty get enough sleep? Tell your bro to NEVER interrupt her when she is eating or sleeping, that agitates cats very much. I hope I helped you, and the best of luck!

flwhQ9F4aa	they're all ADORABLE ( except the Dumbo rats). SO CUTE!|`|WcsYK6sYaa	well i i know is about the hamster<br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  hamster exercise ball <br>  Aspen bedding<br>  hamster food <br>  hamster exercise wheel <br>  disinfectant <br>  fresh fruit <br>  wire cage, heavy-duty plastic rodent cage or aquarium with screen lid <br>  small water bottle for rodents <br>  fresh vegetables <br>  <br>  <br>  Step1.Look for the right hamster to buy. An ideal hamster is between 4 and 7 weeks old; hamsters are easier to tame when they're young. There are two types of hamster: the golden hamster and the Siberian or dwarf hamster. The golden hamster is available in a variety of colors and fur variations, while the smaller dwarf hamster comes in only a few colors. However, the big difference between the two is that dwarf hamsters do not tame well, while golden hamsters can become gentle, reliable pets. <br>  <br>  Step2.When you bring home your hamster and supplies, place the cage in a location away from drafts, and out of direct sunlight. Pick a spot in the house where you will frequently visit your hamster. <br>  <br>  Step3.Cover the cage floor with a 2 inch layer of bedding. Aspen Shavings are best, NOT PINE<br>  <br>  Step4.Keep a filled, clean water bottle attached to the cage at a height where the spout is reachable by the hamster, but doesn't touch the bedding. if the bedding gets wet it can rot and cause your hamster to get sick. Wash and refill daily. <br>  <br>  Step5.Provide plenty of chew toys. Hamsters love the cardboard tubes found inside rolls of toilet paper and paper towels. Attach hamster wood chews to the side of the cage. <br>  <br>  Step6.Make a box for your hamster to sleep in. Cut a 2-inch doorway into a small, closed cardboard box. Place the box in a far corner of the cage. The hamster will fill the box with bedding and chewed-up pieces of cardboard from the toilet paper tubes and will use the box as a bedroom. He will not urinate in the box, so you can use it for many months before replacing it. <br>  <br>  Step7Feed your hamster a commercially prepared hamster-food mix once or twice a day. Supply a small amount of fresh fruits and vegetables year-round. When you introduce new foods, initially feed small portions so his system can get used to them. <br>  <br>  Step8Exercise your hamster by putting an exercise wheel in her cage. Let her exercise outside her cage inside a specially designed plastic hamster ball, available at pet stores. Close the doors to your bedroom, take her out of his cage, and let her run around in the hamster ball. <br>  <br>  Step9Wash your hamster's cage at least once a week. Remove the hamster to a safe location and dip the cage in water that has a few drops of household disinfectant added to it. Wipe out any debris, dry the inside and add clean bedding before replacing the hamster. <br>  <br>  Step10Remove any uneaten fruits and vegetables after two days. Fresh foods that turn moldy can make your hamster sick. <br>  <br>  Step11Don't bathe your hamster. Hamsters clean themselves. If you think your hamster smells bad, the odor is probably coming from dirty bedding. Clean the hamster cage more often. <br>  <br>  Step12Take your hamster with you or find someone to take care of him if you are going on vacation for more than three days. <br>  <br>  !!!!!Tips & Warnings!!!!!<br>  Choose a young hamster not only for cuteness, but for sociability. Choose a hamster that relaxes in your hand, washes himself and seems plump, bright-eyed, alert and curious about you. Choose only one hamster.<br>  <br>  Hamsters are active at night. The best time to clean the cage or exercise your hamster is in the evening or morning, rather than at midday when hamsters prefer to rest undisturbed.<br>  <br>  Tame your young hamster by handling daily and rewarding calm behavior with vegetable treats.<br>  <br>  If your hamster's wheel is keeping you up at night, remove the wheel at bedtime, and replace when you wake up.<br>  <br>  Introduce your hamster to people and situations gently; a scared hamster can give a painful bite.<br>  <br>  When you put your hamster in a plastic exercise ball, keep the ball away from stairs. A fall downstairs can result in serious injury.<br>  <br>  When choosing a place for your hamster cage, make it out of reach of other household pets who may be a threat to your hamster.<br>  <br>  Keep hamster bedding warm and dry--moisture can cause fatal infections.<br>  <br>  Do not give in to temptation and buy two hamsters to live together--even if they are littermates they will either breed immediately (and you'll have twenty hamsters) or fight, often to the death.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. NEVER KEEP 2 SYRIAN HAMSTERS (THE LARGE ONES) TOGETHER!!!!<br>  Children as young as three can be good hamster owners, but must be closely supervised when handling and have an adult to help with cleaning and care. A mature ten year old could be ready to care for a hamster solo.<br>  <br>  Hamsters can catch the human cold virus, so avoid contact if you are sick, and keep your hamster away from people with colds.<br>  <br>  Consult a veterinarian promptly if your hamster needs medical care; a sick hamster can die quickly.<br>  <br>  While a hamster can live to five years, even well-cared for hamsters

Once he has mated with a b1tch he will want to mate constantly. Dogs can smell a b1tch in season miles away. He will scream and howl for a b1tch and he will be restless. I addition to this you will need to be extra vigilant if he is loose in a field or a park, if he smells a b1tch, he will run off looking for love. Ask your vet and he will confirm this.<br>  <br>  Even dogs who have won accolades in the show ring whose owners advertise their services, do not get numerous requests. These dogs are mostly kennelled, consequently their restless behaviour and howling does not effect their owners. In any event they ignore this because they charge huge stud fees.

Here are some of the most common reasons pets owners give when asked why they want to breed their pets, along with a few facts that need to be considered.<br>  <br>  1. "My dog has AKC papers. It should be bred."<br>  This is a common misconception. AKC papers are worth exactly what they are printed on. The AKC is a registry only, not a regulatory agency. They require no proof of health or quality to issue papers. All AKC papers tell you is who the parents of the dog are, they are not a "license to breed."<br>  <br>  2. "I paid $XXX.XX dollars for him/her. I'd like to make that back."<br>  According to a recent survey by the American Kennel Club, the average litter of pups looses approximately $2500.00! There are so many hidden costs that the pet owner may not think about such as prenatal exams for the *****, extra food for her when she is pregnant, food for the puppies once they're weaned, the puppies' first shots, time off of work to care for the ***** when she's in whelp; the list goes on. What if the dam should run into medical problems? According to the same survey, 63% of the bitches bred suffer medical problems endangering their and/or their puppies' lives. C-sections, antibiotics, milk replacement for puppies, etc, all cost a lot of money. Most pet owners buy their dogs for pleasure. Do people really expect something bought for enjoyment to "pay for itself?" If someone bought a pretty gold ring, would they shave off little pieces of gold and make earrings so they could sell them and "get their money back?" Of course not! Then why must a dog, who gives so much and asks so little, have to justify its existence by "paying for itself?"<br>  <br>  3. "You need to let them have a litter before they are spayed." or "I want her to experience motherhood."<br>  These are nothing more than old wives tales. The benefits of spaying a ***** before her first season out weigh those of leaving her intact. A ***** left intact suffers a greater chance of contracting diseases and living a shorter life. A spayed ***** has no chance of developing pyometria, endometrosis, uterine and ovarian cancer and has a much lesser chance of developing mammary cancer, one of the more common canine cancers. As for "experiencing motherhood", bitches have no sense of maternal "needs." Their desire to reproduce is strictly an instinctive response to hormonal fluctuation.<br>  <br>  4. "But I don't want to rob my dog of his manhood. He won't hunt or guard the house."<br>  The pet owner should not confuse the canine sexual act with human sexual fulfillment. There is no "love" involved with canines, it is purely an instinctive hormonal response. Dogs do not need their reproductive organs or a sexual experience to "make their life complete." A neutered male makes a far superior pet. He will not roam in search of bitches in season, he will have less tendency to mark his territory with urine and he will be less likely to get into fights. He will not develop cancer of the testes and he will suffer far less prostate and urinary tract problems. He will make a better watch dog because he will be less inclined to wander off and will stay home where he is needed. If he is a hunting dog, you can be sure he won't be distracted by the scent of a ***** in season! The list of benefits goes on and on. Sometimes a male dog will have only one testicle descended into the scrotum. This is commonly called "monorchidism". When neither testicle has descended it is commonly called "cryptorchidism". In these cases one or both testes have been retained up in the dog's abdominal cavity. Because testes are not designed to be kept at body temperature, the retainned testicle essentially "cooks" and becomes a serious cancer risk. Occasionally a monorchid male is fertile, but the trait is hereditary. Therefore, a monorchid male should never, ever be bred. It is not fair to pass on this high cancer risk.<br>  <br>  5. "But if I have my pet fixed he (or she) will get fat!"<br>  A neutered or spayed pet will not get fat simply from the surgery. A pet only gets fat if an owner over feeds it. When an animal is neutered, its metabolism slows down, therefore it requires fewer calories. If the owner continues to feed the pet the same amount of food after the surgery as before, it is very likely the pet will gain weight. The owner needs to limit the amount of food the pet gets as well as maintaining a healthy amount of exercise.<br>  <br>  6. "I want my children to witness the miracle of life."<br>  Are the children ready for the miracle of death as well? As stated earlier, 63% of bitches bred suffer problems. Many times these problems are fatal for the puppies and/or the mother as well. Puppies can be born dead or die from complications at birth. Dams can retain placentas, develop eclampsia, go into uterine inertia or die during a c-section. The list of possible problems is very long. If the potentia|`|YoZZDqq9aa	SHOULD I BREED MY DOG??<br>  <br>  Almost everyone who owns a dog thinks about breeding it at least once. Raising a litter sounds easy and fun -- but having puppies isn’t all its cracked up to be.  Breeding dogs involves much more work and responsibility than most people are prepared for. Before you breed your dog, there are some important things to consider:<br>  <br>  Will all your puppies find good, permanent homes?<br>  <br>  According to the Humane Society of the United States and the government Census Bureau, 2,000 puppies and 450 humans are born every hour in our country. Right from the start, only 1 out of 4 puppies has a chance at a home.  Finding a permanent home is even harder - only 1 out of 10 dogs will stay with its original buyer for its whole life. 5 out of 10 will change owners before they’re a year old. The remainder of these dogs will end up in animal shelters, abandoned and unwanted.  Even if your dog is an expensive purebred, your puppies are subject to the same statistics. At least 3 million dogs will be killed in animal shelters this year alone because there just aren’t enough homes for all of them There are so many unwanted pets that cities all over the country are considering passing laws that will ban all breeding.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your responsibilities as a breeder:<br>  <br>  As a breeder you’re personally responsible for each and every puppy for the rest of its life. Your responsibility doesn’t end with selling the puppy - it only starts there! It will be up to you to know where those puppies are six months, a year, five years from now and whether or not they’re being taken care of. It will be up to you to keep any unsold puppies or to take back puppies you’ve sold after they’re grown if their owners can’t keep them anymore. Since only 1 out of 10 puppies stays with its original buyer for life, you can expect to have to take back most of your litter sooner or later. The time to prepare for this is now - before you bring puppies into the world, not after. Will you have facilities to house these dogs?  Will you have time to care for them?  If you’re offering your dog for stud service, you have as much responsibility for the welfare of his puppies as do the owners of the bitches bred to him.<br>  <br>  As a breeder,you have the responsibility of controlling the reproductive future of the puppies you sell. It might seem like having just one litter doesn’t add much to the dog population but - if your dog or ***** produces just one litter of four pups who in turn each produce just one litter themselves and so forth, in only 7 years your dog will have 4000 descendants! “Just one litter" has serious consequences!   You’ll need to learn how to write and enforce a contract requiring the new owners to spay or neuter their puppies.<br>  <br>  You have a responsibility to your puppies and their buyers to produce the healthiest and most mentally sound dogs possible All breeds have genetic health and temperament problems that can be passed on to their puppies. It takes experience and knowledge to learn how to recognize these problems. Many inherited defects are “hidden” - although your dog may not seem to have a problem, it could be genetically programmed to pass trouble along to its pups. Without expensive medical testing and a thorough understanding of genetics and pedigrees, you could easily produce puppies that will be a heartache to their owners and a financial burden to you. Reputable breeders check their adult stock for evidence of hip and elbow dysplasia, eye diseases, thyroid and hormone trouble, skin problems and allergies, bleeding disorders and other problems before even thinking of breeding.<br>  <br>  As a breeder, you must be prepared to guarantee your puppies against inherited health problems that may not appear until adulthood. This can mean refunding money or replacing a dog years later. Many states are now passing “puppy lemon laws” that would require a breeder to refund up to three times the purchase price of a defective puppy or pay for its medical bills. Temperament is also subject to guarantees. You could be sued if a dog you produce bites someone! You need to be there to give buyers advice on training, behavioral and medical problems. You’re the “on-line” support for your puppies’ owners for the next 10-15 years!<br>  <br>  <br>  Having a litter is expensive<br>  <br>  Raising a litter involves a considerable investment in time and money - money that you aren’t likely to get back in profit. By the time your ***** is old enough to have puppies, you’ll already have more than $1000 invested in her purchase price, food & upkeep, vaccinations and the medical tests & certification to prove her suitability for breeding. In order to produce quality puppies, you’ll need to use a stud dog that’s as good or better than she is. Good stud dogs require a hefty fee..   Most professional breeders won’t be interested in taking a puppy in exchange nor are they interested in breeding to just any *****.<br>  <br>  There’ll be pre-whelping exams and x-rays, post-whelping exams and sho|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Having 2 dogs of the opposite sex & same breed is only step one out of many more stops involved in breeding dogs.   Your dogs are both old enough at 3, but the "ideal age" depends entirely on the quality of the dog and the knowledge of the owners.<br>  <br>  Your dogs may be old enough, but anyone who is responsible about breeding will have their dogs tested for genetic disease that can be passed on to offspring.  Hip and elbow tests for dysplasia are needed.  Chances are, unless you're extremely well-educated about boxers as a breed and both of you have purchased superior quality dogs from a reputable breeder---your dogs may be lovely but are pet-quality, not breeding quality.<br>  <br>  Breeding & whelping can be a disaster in the making for someone who is unprepared for the task.

RCyvGAONaa	He sounds to me like a spaniel of some sort, maybe a springer spaniel from all the different markings you have described. They are very agile and 'bouncy' dogs. They do have tons of energy and are commonly used by the united kingdom police force as 'sniffer dogs' who come into crime scenes and smell out the drugs. <br>  <br>  Here are some links to images of springer spaniels so you can see whether it fits any of your dogs description: <br>  <a href="http://static.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-gallery/dog-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/english-springer-spaniel-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/pictures/english-springer-spaniel-0119.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://static.gotpetsonline.com/pictures...</a><br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/English_Springer_Spaniel_black_sitting.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  If he's not a springer spaniel then he may be another type of spaniel from the description you have given. I've worked in a pet store for 3years and see hundreds of different dogs every week and from what you've described im pretty sure is from the spaniel family. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your search hope i have helped in some way = )|`|uCJ4EQZraa	Do you have a pic of him|`|YoZZDqq9aa	What does your veterinarian say?|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Did they say how old he is? I also agree that he is part hound and he could possibly be part lab. My lab does a lot of what you said in your question. He's a goof ball too. But a lab will get a lot bigger than 40 pounds! There are places that do dog DNA testing, i've never done it, and i don't know much about it, but you never know?!
