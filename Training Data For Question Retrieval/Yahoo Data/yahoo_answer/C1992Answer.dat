ZLCPulYKaa	Im almost 90% sure its not the xbox. Call your Ineternet Service Provider (ISP) and tell them whats going on. Also, is your intnernet password connected? if so that may be the problem. And can any other computer or soemthing on your network connect to the internet? If so it may be that your router is restricting access to your xbox because of the firewall on it. Your ISP may know how to solve this. If not add me as a contact and i will be more than happy to help! :)
qLBU4t9Zaa	i have a centro now, but something similiar happened to my old phone.  It got wet and even though i dried it out and everything it just wouldn't turn on.

Assuming you can get these numbers you would divide this by the actual draw of the light.  So lets assume that the batteries can provide 1200mAh or 1.2Ah and the light draws 300ma then you can assume that you will roughly get 4 hours of run time, this is just an estimate though and it is a really generous one (unless the flashlight is an LED type).

It has a nice full and easy to use keyboard, while the Pearl's keyboard is 2 letters to a button. It can get frustrating sometimes. My friend has it. I dont like it.|`|qpXPJ1pLaa	I would go with the Blackberry pearl.. some people don't understand how to type on it but it is extremely easy. The phone is very slim and compact. However, if you don't like the texting on the pearl, you may be more inclined to buying the curve. Using it is easier to type on and the keys are fine to press, but the phone is wider and thus harder to put in your pocket, ect. Both phones feature many of the same features so there really isn't too big of a difference other than the keyboards. It also depends which pearl you are getting. Depending on which one you will get different features, such as wi-fi and video that the curve will have.

pZGLhV2Waa	The D40 is a much better camera period. There is not a point and shoot out there that can beat a DSLR in terms of image quality. This is because DSLR's have much better optics, much larger sensors, full manual control, better faster processors, faster auto focus, and no shutter lag to name just a few things. <br>  The P90 may have more features but it is a point and shoot and suffers from all the drawbacks of them. These include tiny sensors. Which deliver high noise and less detail. The lens may be a 20x zoom but it no way compares to a high quality SLR lens. There is a reason good SLR lenses can easily cost triple what the P90 costs. Also all point and shoots cameras sufferer from shutter lag. This is the time it takes to actually take the picture after you press the shutter release. Shutter lag can vary from maybe a quarter of second to several seconds but they all have it to one degree or another. DSLR's do not really have this problem. The shutter lag of DSLR's is measured in milliseconds. It is almost instantaneous.<br>  <br>  Now that is not to say that the P90 may not be a better camera for you. It is a great point and shoot camera. If you want something that is easy to use and offers you the features that you want then it may be the best choice for you. If on the other hand you are willing to learn how to use an SLR effectively then you will notice how much better an SLR can be.|`|7Bx5DYv0aa	I prefer the P series.<br>  <br>  Also consider the P80.  Not much difference between the P90 and P80.  You won't need 12 MP unless you want to print very large sized pictures.<br>  <br>  You'll save a lot of money with P80, almost about $100.  The P80 is an excellent camera.  I bought one after doing a lot of research a couple of months ago and I am very happy with it.  Takes excellent pictures.<br>  <br>  I bought it through Tigerdirect and I found the deal at dealjuggler.com.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dealjuggler.com/Nikon-COOLPIX-P80-Digital-Camera---Only-$299.99.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dealjuggler.com/Nikon-COOLPIX...</a><br>  <br>  Hope the above was helpful.|`|i5OVORXgaa	If you want to become a serious photographer then I suggest that you get the D40 so you can use additional lenses... if not, the P90 is fine.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	This is something only you can decide. Different people have different needs. For me, I need a DSLR because I do product photography and project documentation for the place I work at. For my brother, a small point & shoot works great for him. I don't need video. I'll leave that sort of task to a $2500 DV camera I have access to which does an excellent job compared to a video function on a still camera.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for something that is no frills and gives much better image quality, then the D40 is for you. The fact that the D40 doesn't have live view shouldn't be a factor because live view is troublesome when shooting in bright light, dim light, manual focus, and panning shots while shooting in continuous mode. Plus, one gets used to optical viewfinders very quickly and will wonder how anyone can shoot using live view! The 6 megapixel sensor that the D40 uses is an excellent quality sensor with noise and dynamic range at ISO 200 that rivals other DSLR sensors shooting at ISO 100. The only thing I don't like about the D40 is it tends to blow out highlights easily. This is quickly cured by using the camera in Program mode and setting the exposure compensation to -0.7 (depends on shooting conditions).<br>  <br>  If you are on a budget (lenses can add significantly to the price of a DSLR), the P90 with its zoom range, built-in vibration reduction, and video feature may be the ticket. The P90 will be noticeably different when taking pictures in low-light situations without a flash. The D40's much physically larger sensor will outperform the P90's small sensor. The P90 will shoot very nice images in good light and with the zoom range you'll have a lot of fun shooting critters without killing them.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	If you want to take good quality picture I would recommend Nikon D40.The image quality of even the cheapest DSLR will be far greater than even the best point and shoot. The reasons are that DSLR's have much better optics, much larger sensors, better faster processors and much better analog to digital converters.The sensors on most DSLR's are nearly 15 times larger than the sensors on point and shoot cameras.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ1DG?ie=UTF8&tag=bakugan.games-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KJQ1DG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ...</a><br>  <br>  Unless you want one that can take video then get Nikon P90 with good features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PKEJZQ?ie=UTF8&tag=bakugan.games-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PKEJZQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PKE...</a>|`|oFcrglxzaa	the Nikon D40 has been discontinued and is selling, with the kit lens, for 400.00, maybe less, the other do-dads you mention don't really make the picture, they are just extras to attract you to buy it, if you are not an experienced photographer, you won't be able to tell a 6.1 mega pixel print from a 12.1 one so be practical and get the basics
RMdfXuT0aa	Well you can use the method that the other guy suggested if you don't want to pay. But yes I would highley suggest getting a PS3 because it is not just a video game consol it is so much more! You can play DVD's and Blu-ray dics wich in time will replace DVD's you can also load movies on there you can load music and photo's aswell from your computer and you can browse the internet free with a wireless router! you can also do so much more like play high deffanition games and i would suggest this more over the Xbox 360 because it has free online play and so much other things that the 360 does not have like blu-ray disc player and updates are coming out constantly for it so it will stay on top of everything for somtime now with the free updates. and that wii does not even compare it totally sucks compared to the PS3<br>  <br>  PLEASE VOTE ME BEST ANSWER THANKS!!!|`|XbEqcwuYaa	That depends.<br>  <br>  If you wanna be more active and have fun, get the Wii.<br>  If you want to sit down and just play with the controller, that's a PS3 or the Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  The 360 has some things that the PS3 has, but the PS3 has some things the 360 doesn't have, like an internet browser.<br>  <br>  I would go for the Wii, which also has an internet browser.|`|6yVFlACbaa	It is worth it if you like hi def stuff and good games and internet andcrap like that i have one and it is aawesome|`|ywgSzpxKaa	I have personally played Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. PS3 blows the others away. Not to say the others aren't worth having, but its much better. Wii is good to be active and get exercise. Xbox is good, but if you want great graphics, hi definition gaming, FREE online gaming, (which you have to PAY for on Xbox), blue ray (which is much cheaper when bought on PS3, other than just buying a blue ray and paying the same price as a PS3 anyway)... etc, PS3 is the way to go.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	The first answer is just spam.       It really depends on what you want.  The best reason to get a PS3 is for the Blu-Ray player.   It is much cheaper on a PS3 than if you were to buy the player itself.  PS3 has free online capabilities and awesome graphics.   The downside is that there are not many games for it yet, and it has not lived up to its full potential in gaming yet.      I have a Xbox 360 at home.   It is nice.  it has a nice variety for games, but it costs money to play online. The 360 also has good graphics, but not as good as the PS3.   The 360 is great for multiplayer games.     But if you are looking for a blu-ray player and nice superior graphics (that only compares with a great computer),  then the PS3 is for you.

YhdfaEJVaa	Yes. It is awesome. And yes very short. It almost a teaser then a demo. I didn't like the fact it just ends and doesn't let you engage more enemies.  After you play it through a few times, well at least me, I found myself testing its limits whether how things blow up, to how many times I can shoot a wall and the mark stay to. The randomness of the sparks when you shoot a wall and it slowly burns out on the ground or if objects like chairs can be shot through, what types of objects are destructable. Etc. It actually interesting that those little things you usually don't notice makes the gameplay that much more realistic. I've played it like 10 times. But once you play it a couple times I feel like you just breeze through it and it loses it edge. I know its a demo but I thought it should be a bit longer myself.|`|N2rntAqvaa	Well, lots of people did.  But the full game is already in stores.  <br>  <br>  Don't you think it would be better to ask if anyone has played the full game?|`|F8tTFJf0aa	I bought the game the other day.

TaxYLHbMaa	Look , I am not going to even pretend that I am in the know here , just some pointers that I have found in the one video I have ever done for some bloke on his wedding day at bunkers bay on a pretty piss poor day of surfing. ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pKNREvpyic" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pKNREvpy...</a> ) if I were in the know , I would suggest filters , the filters that come from red giant software for your editing program called movie looks , this will give you the base line of the video original , and the transition of the top of the frame giving you a change in the dynamics of the video colour effectively changing the look of the ocean.<br>  <br>  your video is awesome , some awesome pictures there , however as you have indicated the colours are stock standard , you can try and change the settings on your camera to vivid , but I don't think that any camera will get this to the dynamics you are looking for , I know you have a good camera , as I know that the zoom has to be a pretty Strong either fluorite and long distance with help or stock standard, but pretty strong.<br>  <br>  what you are looking for in camera wont ber something which you have or can probably find without doing it in the production room , changing the contrast a bit , and putting a movie looks filter on , and probably changing the colours to studio in your cs4 or vegas ..<br>  <br>  editing is where you will get the colours you seek mate

YLOD is rarely seen though (about 0.2% of PS3s get it) because PS3s can cool themselves properly|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Well as the RRoD is caused by overheating and all electronics can eventually overheat the technical answer is yes it has something similar. The difference however is this has not been a problem with the PS3. It has been built in a difference fashion that it will not overheat as easily as the Xbox. Given a High enough temp and long enough playtime though and yes the system will overheat. The other difference is in that even if the PS3 overheats right now it is unlikely that major damage will be done to the system. What happens is when the Xbox overheats a connection is destroyed in the system causing the permanent RRoD|`|Ae5IYHjVaa	There have been reports of dsk image errors....meaning the laser can't read the image.....I personally have not met anyone with this problem, imcluding myself...|`|akXAbzVUaa	Yes, it is very likely to catch fire if it is left on the stove so get an xbox!|`|TD5Wqe4maa	Nope my ps3 runs great and I have had it for about 2 years.

The PS3 also has a hardware failure like that.<br>  <br>  Again, it is very hard to get RROD if you take care of your xBox. About yours failing, some last longer than others. Also, if it was anything else than 3 red squadrons, you returned it for nothing. Not 3 red squadrons means some other kind of failure, usually nonfatal.

I've had some bad experiences with portable storage: I had almost all of my iTunes library on a external hard drive to save space on my laptop. I wanted to move all of the music onto our new computer, but I found this takes and /incredibly/ long time, especially if you have a lot of music. I just left it on the external hard drive, and had iTunes draw the music from there, but then the hard drive broke. I probably lost around $100 worth of music.<br>  <br>  So, my best advice is to put all of the music unto CDs. It will still take awhile, but then you've effectively backed up your whole music library and you don't have to worry if something happens to your new computer or your storage device.<br>  <br>  As for the music already on your Mac...you just need to add it to the iTunes library on the computer.

q8cBE6w8aa	Your question above does not say much about what you want to do with a digital camera.  But, to answer your question directly, 6mp could do a great job for you, depending on the size of the picture and quality you want. A few years ago I took portraits with a 2mp camera, and they were impressive.<br>  <br>  Megapixels are only a small part of a digital camera purchase, so here are some questions to ask about whatever you buy: <br>  <br>  Are the megapixels optical or digital?<br>  Is it new or used?  is there a guarantee?  how old is it?<br>  Do I have to pay shipping, and if so,  how much to mr?<br>  Do the following come with the camera or do I have to buy them separately? Camera to computer cable, camera to TV cable, memory card size if any, special or easy to find inexpensive battery, instruction manual, case, software.<br>  Have other people been happy with the camera?<br>  Is the lens focal length good for what I want to do with it?<br>  What brand, well known or obscure?<br>  Can it give quality images?<br>  Will I get people pictures with red-eye? if so, how will it be corrected?<br>  To see what will be in my picture, can I hold the camera up to my eye, or do I have to hold it out a distance in front of me.<br>  These are only a few of the questions!<br>  <br>  What are all the uses you will want the camera for?  First identify them.  You can learn about digital photography from many free websites.  Visit a good camera store (when they are not busy), and ask what would be good for you, and what price range to allow you to do what you wish it to do for you.  Public libraries have plenty of books from simple to sophisticated, free.<br>  <br>  A digital camera is so much more than mp's.  It can do wonderful pictures for you, even in a relatively simple cameras.|`|bInF0Rhqaa	Based on your question, I'm not sure you understand what megapixels really means.  Almost any camera on the market today will take a picture wide enough to capture a person's whole body.  This has nothing to do with megapixels, though.  It has to do with focal length.  The megapixel number is simply an indication of how much information is stored in each image, and how big you can print the image without blurring.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you go to a local store that sells cameras, tell them you're a beginner and what you'd like to do with the camera.  You're not obligated to buy from them, but you will get a lot of good information.<br>  <br>  If you're buying on eBay, make sure you ask the seller questions about the product, and about defects the item may have, so you know exactly what you're getting.  Also, if you are asked to pay shipping, compare what they are trying to charge you to the actual rate tables on the USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc websites.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	A  6mp camera is more than enough to make good quality 8x10 prints. The scenario you described can be done by any camera out there. Mega pixels have nothing to do with that.|`|i5OVORXgaa	yes!

I have like 70 movies in itunes that my have all been compressed and they take up so little room.  I have 5 full movies, 1000 songs on an 8 gig touch.  Apple does not care if you already bought it and that is why they make sooo much money.  Just buy a professional grade ripper and deal with it.  You dont win with apple.
jBIotay5aa	That would depend on how much money you're willing to spend. A woofer irrespective of size being capable of truthfully reproducing the sound signal would depend on its design and its efficiency and the properly matched amplifier. Most important would be to choose good quality equipment. If you have a modest budget for a smaller amplifier, choose speakers with a higher efficiency. This is the unit of measure in dB/W/m. It takes a doubling of amplifier power to achieve a 3dB increase in sound pressure level, so choosing a speaker with a higher efficiency can automatically give you sound increase at the same level of the less efficient speaker. This however does not relate to the maximum sound pressure level of a loudspeaker. That is another topic.|`|dUeDmb7raa	the larger the woofer the deeper the frequincies it can produce, thus it can make a deeper, fuller bass sound<br>  <br>  <br>  atleast an 8 inch woofer for maximum sound. and thats the actual round part inside, not the whole box. <br>  <br>  12 inch and above if you want to rock out with yo cock out

That way you can upload the music into your iTunes library and into any other music library. Costs a little more, of course, but there aren't many other options.<br>  <br>  I've bought from a few online sources. Some allow you to chose to download to iTunes or Windows Media, but I'm not sure if it will allow you to do both.|`|xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player. The easiest way is to burn the music to an audio CD and then rip it back to Windows Media Player or a similar program as an MP3. Or you can get some software to help you. I use TuneClone to do this.

HVQFVtelaa	If it does not have a remote search function, you are limited to the codes that came with it. Universal remote codes are not universal among different remotes.<br>  <br>  The newer RCA remote in all the dollar general and family dollar stores is only $5 and has the search function. I would buy that one, and use the old remote on something it has a code for.
2btGvJexaa	All the companies are 59.99 for the broadband card. If you have a simply everything plan with Sprint ($99) you can get the broadband card for $50 a month.

One thing about it is that it also has Metal gear online, which can also keep you busy for hours after you've beaten the story mode.|`|hyo4tWv9aa	no, because no console is worth getting for a game. but getting a ps3 is a good choice rather then an xbox360. and remember there are also some better games then metal gear solid for ps3, like god of war 3, killzone 2, uncharted, but if u feel u are only interested in playing metal gear solid 4 then its not worth it|`|ktbyKKK9aa	Actually, no console is worth for just one game. MGS4 is one of the greatest PS3 games, but it should not be your only interest. LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are just a few of many other great titles on the PS3.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Defiantly! MGS is very good plus there are a lot of other good games like Uncharted, Killzone and Resistance.|`|AA10121737	I got the PS3 just to play MGS4 and haven't regretted it at all. PS3 has other great games too .|`|txEMWye4aa	No but there is a lot of other good games but, i would rather an xbox360 any day.|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	yes indeed, i love mgs4 i beat it 3 times and i all i play is mgo i have all the expantions and everything. maybe its just cause im one of the best on mgo.<br>  <br>  p.s. new world there is a red ring of death its called the ylod you just dont see it as much as the xbox, and i was reading up this story the other day that xbox has fixed the red rings for good.|`|8Raw4M1naa	Metal Gear Solid 4 was by far the best Metal Gear Solid to date. It tied up all the lose ends, had amazing gameplay (the BEST and most fun I've every had playing a game) and even my husband got into it, who hated the first three.<br>  <br>  While Metal Gear is absolutely amazing, there are even more games on the PS3 that make it worthwhile too, such as the Resistance Fall of Man series. One of the best first person shooters since Goldeneye for N64.<br>  <br>  Blu Ray is also something really nice to have. You can REALLY tell the difference, especially with a high def TV. Movies like Underworld, Batman The Dark Knight, 300 etc... all are made AMAZINGLY clear. Its wonderful!<br>  <br>  I would highly reccommend the PS3. No red rings of death for us Sony fans.|`|ROLrtssHaa	Uhmmm...there maybe a better way of doing that...But, you get the gaming system and free lifetime updates for the Blu-Ray player w/ the PS3.....I love downloading movies on my PC and watching them on the PS3 via a powerline adapter!  No Delay!|`|UGP33Ugzaa	If you are a hardcore MGS fan, yes.<br>  If you are new to the series or are not very into it, no.|`|geixYUgzaa	probably not if you already have an xbox but there are a lot of good games for ps3 now.  mgs4 is just one of them.|`|32rOhhvDaa	YES <br>  MGS FAN OR NOT<br>  <br>  HELL YES
pl6eDKQbaa	Technically they should have to repair it because Apple's warranty is global.<br>  <a href="http://images.apple.com/legal/warranty/docs/ipodisight.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://images.apple.com/legal/warranty/d...</a><br>  This information here states that it covers the iPod manufactured by Apple. However it does state that the laws vary from country to country so this is probably where they are getting the FCC crap. You should call Apple support and find an authorised repairer taking all your documentation that proves that it is infact still within the 1 year Apple manufacturer's warranty. Technically they will have to repair it as it is an Apple product and is valid in any country that Apple sells products.

q84KT11saa	Just an FYI . . .if you take off the sticker the text on it changes to show that the warranty is void.  Also, if you plan on calling in and taking advantage of your warranty (if in fact it is still under warranty), make sure you have your receipt or proof of purchase.  They are very strict about that.  Mine stopped working, but I misplaced my proof of purchase so they were going to charge me.  So I ended up fixing it myself with some help from the PS3 forums.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.psu.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.psu.com/forums/forumdisplay.p...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.xtremeps3.com/faqs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.xtremeps3.com/faqs.php</a><br>  <br>  If you google your issue, you will get tons of info that may make you go "THATS what is wrong with my PS3".<br>  <br>  If you have to pay to get it fixed anyway, you made as well open it.  IF however you have a warranty, just send it in and have them fix it for you.  No point in tampering with it if you have a warranty.|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	well i dont recomend this but its your bluray thing that reads the disks you can open it very carefully and clean the lens but it voids your warrenty i heard that you can remove the warrenty sticker with a blow dryer so they dont know you took it off but theyll show you how to clean the lens on youtube.|`|8Raw4M1naa	It does sound like there is something seriously wrong with your PS3. If its still under warranty call Sony and see if you can have it repaired for no cost to you. If its past the warranty (which I think extends a year from purchase if I am not mistaken) you can try and call Sony to see how much they charge to repair it. If its too pricy, try a local gaming store (not a big chain like Game Stop) because sometimes the privately owned or smaller chains will do repairs. Otherwise, you may have to get a new PS3.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	Well, all signs lead to one conclusion and that is the Blu-Ray laser is out or else something is obstructing it's working. If it's under warranty, then take it to sony and they will replace the lens or else, if it isn't, then you will have to pay for repairs.|`|6GB5P7ojaa	Contact Sony and tell them the problem or go to the store where you bought it from.

pl6eDKQbaa	You need to download Audacity, a free audio editing program. You will also need a decent microphone if you are singing or picking up an acoustic instrument. Around $100 will get you a really good quality one that does everything you want it too with impressive results. If you are playing only guitar or other amplified instrument you will need a 6.5mm to 3.5mm stereo converter / reducer and 3.5mm plug to plug audio cable. That will enable you to plug the instrument into the amplifier and from the amp into the computer's microphone jack. This will give you much better quality than if you used a microphone to pick it up the sound from the amp.<br>  Good luck and I hope it works for you.

Enough said.<br>  <br>  4. Depending when you go online, it's pretty easy to find a good team.

ceebuRIIaa	you got to get the applacation thing there are two of them  touchgrind and iskate
lrMCiDnraa	With 1080p its progressive scan which means the screen has 1080 lines of resolution on the screen at one time. The same with 720p just you have 720 lines on screen but with 1080i its interlaced which means you only have 540 lines on screen at one time alternating between even and odd lines. So 1080p is better than 720p but 1080i is not as easily said to be superior to 720p.|`|w4I9oj2Maa	NO...smaller number means LESS resolution.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	no.  the higher the number, the better the image quality.  1080 is better than 720.|`|bda90c576f1d500516702950d3dbb7ffaa	There is not really a "Better"  1080P is newer tech. but basically people are right, however, DONT GET FOOLED BY 1080P. <br>  <br>  On screens 46" and smaller, you need to sit LESS THAN 5.5ft from the screen before your eyes will be able to tell the difference. <br>  <br>  ON 46 and higher you will need to sit 8.6ft or closer to see the difference.<br>  <br>  Nothing is broadcast in 1080P yet. (Except SOME Blu-Ray) <br>  <br>  720 is great!|`|n8UBfhgpaa	also 1080p is better than 1080i<br>  the numbers reflect the more lines of resolution, so the higher the number the better is right. not sure what the i or the p stand for though|`|HX6JjCTyaa	No 1080p is better than 720p|`|q11aFYudaa	no but i prefer 720 hd since most of my ps3 and 360 games can support it
j5Apt8hWaa	The 10 MP Nikon D200 has a multi-exposure feature and you can take up to nine different images on one image file (of course you will have to adjust the exposure so you don't over expose the final image<br>  <br>  If you are really talking about continuous shooting, as in frames per second, the D200 can shoot from 1 to 4 fps, depending upon how you set up the camera|`|q8cBE6w8aa	Nikon makes quite a few different models.  I believe you may have the P80.  This is an excellent choice, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  The P80 has this mode selection on the menu:<br>  Continuous - Single, Continuous, BSS, Multi-shot 16, Interval timer<br>  <br>  I suggest you study the manual and try out the various choices.  The nice part of digital is it costs nothing to test all the features.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new toy! ..... Johnny.

NAZeTH0Maa	Well 1st off there totally worth it.The PS3 wont let u down its failure rate is less than 1%,It has a built in blu-ray player so u can not only watch all your dvd's but you can also watch blu-ray movies in HD.The PS3 also upconverts dvd's all the way to 1080p so your dvd's will look just as good as blu-rays if u have a HDTV.The PS3 has a HDMI 1.3 input so you can hook up a HDTV to get true 1080p HD quality something that regular composite or component inputs cant do.You can also use the HDMI port to hook up a sweet sound system as big as 7.1 surround sound.The PS3 also has a built in internet browser so u can surf the web right from your console.The PS3 also has built in wifi (except the 20GB PS3) so you can wirelessly hook up your internet connection or take advantage of a wifi hot spot.The other cool thing about the PS3 is that everyone has a Hard Drive which not only lets you save your games but it can also shorten load times,reduce game pop ups and you can also download music,photos & videos to it.Sony has promised PS3 owners that they will keep supporting the PS3 with new games and features for atleast until 2016 which exceeds the Xbox 360 and the Wii's lifespan.The PS3's game library is growing quickly with games like Killzone 2,GTA IV,GT 5 Prologue,Resistance,Ratchet & Clank,Metal Gear Solid 4,etc etc.Theres also tons of great games coming out like Uncharted 2,God Of War 3,Granturismo 5 and  many more.So if you ask me I think you should get the PS3 it will keep u happy for yrs and yrs.O yea and to answer your other question the only PS3's that can play PS2 games are the 20GB,60GB and older 80GB PS3's|`|LbPD1ZJHaa	I'm glad that you have decided to select PS3.i can tell you what this machine really promises.<br>  <br>  PS3 Pros:<br>  <br>  1)Failure rate less than 0.2%<br>  2)Free online<br>  3)Controllers never been on batteries, they can be charged<br>  4)Great selection of games about to come this 2009 fall<br>  5)Packed with Blu ray player, that means you will not only play hi def games but also view movies at 1080p with latest sound techs.<br>  6)Very Reliable & longevity when compared with  xbox360.<br>  7)Built in Wifi & bluetooth headset.<br>  8)Amazing graphics with impressive brightness & sharpness in detail .& Only Console that which allows games to use the 1080P. (not like 1080i in xbox360)<br>  <br>  PS3 Cons:<br>  <br>  1)Latest 40,80,160gb versions are not compatible with ps2 games.(60gb vers can able to play ps2 games,but they are not available any more).<br>  2)Games may freeze occasionally , due to firmware glitches. and<br>  system grow hot when using long hours like 24/7.<br>  <br>  <br>  IMO ,PS3 WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE CHOICE FOR YOU .& YES IT WILL WORTH YOUR MONEY.GET IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.|`|qIsAmWu9aa	IF u want ur console to last for ever and have the best Tech in get a ps3 its the best blue ray movies and more man i love mine|`|zYRwZqslaa	yes toaltly worth it plus theres going to be a price drop in a couple of weeks|`|wrhRjwKaaa	I bought mine about a year and a half ago, when the price was an extra $200, and I think it was totally worth it.

Basically ($$$ spent/time used) is how you should look at it.<br>  <br>  The new ones do NOT have PS2 backward compatibility.  The old ones did, but to drop the price to make it more affordable they ditched the PS2 compatibility.

You then take the internet wire to the Wii LAN adapter and then configure your internet settings in the Wii menu. From there click on Wii Shopping Channel. Purchase a Wii points card from a store or use a credit card to buy the points on the Wii Shop Channel. Now look for your favorite NES, SNES, N64, Genesis, Turbo Graphix 16, Neo Geo, or Commodore 64 titles and download away. <br>  If you have wireless internet, it can sometimes be a bit complicated depending on your situation.

FIL4vngsaa	Maybe the driver for playing DVD's has going wrong or weird.<br>  Perhaps you should call Sony or further advice or just use a DVD player.|`|LbPD1ZJHaa	there may be 4 reasons for not playing DVD's on your ps2 console.<br>   <br>  1) Certain ps2's has region restrictions to play the dvd's. so when you inserted the dvd not belonging to the ps2 region simply it wont play,& displays the error message.<br>  <br>  2) dvd may be dirty. wipe it with soft cloth or wool. from center to edges.<br>  <br>  3) I don't think ps2 controller here has worst scenario, it was just like other type of remote controller that which enables you  to do dvd operations without use of its actual remote & also you had another option to buy ps2 dvd remote controller(sold separately) when things are not going on your way with dualshock controller to use with dvd's.<br>  <br>  4) Call sony. your dvd driver might be corrupted.

YmXvERLtaa	You can say that about anything.<br>  <br>  Did you know that chewing gum increases your chances of getting stomach cancer?<br>  BUT it's been shown to help concentration?<br>  <br>  And dying your hair can increase your chances of liver failure as the dye gets in to your bloodstream through your roots, then to your liver. <br>  <br>  If we listened to everything released, we'd all live in a bubble.<br>  <br>  Live your life loud, we'll go deaf anyway, we'll all die at some point.<br>  Make sure you go out with a BANG! :P|`|CT3t80suaa	They'll make you deaf if you listen to music too loud, so bring the volume down to a level where you can still hear it, but it is not at full volume, as as to not damage your ears while you listen. Or you could buy some of the over the ear headphones, which are easier on the ears generally, and allow you to play music quieter as the headphones themselves block out more noise.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	don't use them|`|ohq6qrFaaa	You could either :<br>  <br>  A) Not care<br>  B) Not listen for overly long periods of time<br>  C) Use in ear canal phones to block out noise<br>  <br>  You do know that 40% volume for one player will be different than 40% of another? It all depends on the amp inside. For example, 40% volume of a Cowon D2 will be louder than 40% of a Sansa Clip and a lot louder than 40% of an iPod because they have different amplifiers.<br>  <br>  I say be happy, and don't care. Because you only live life once, so why not live that life with your Cowon D2, earphone amp and great in ear phones? :D|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	why do we listen to these so call researchers why are they doing this so people who are born deaf did they listen to music loud i don't think so if you want to use your headphones and listen to them loud go for it life is too short to worry|`|LLnNjH94aa	too<br>  <br>  It's your hearing.  It sounds like you know what you're supposed to do, it's up to you whether or not you want to keep your hearing.|`|WOQAbVzbaa	Get new headphones, or try and listen to music in a quiet place.  This means that the volume doesn't need to be as low.|`|lB3iFbugaa	Well you could always pretend like you never heard about this research. Also if you search long enough you can probably find research to negate the research you found.  Just use your best judgement when listening.|`|HmyabzC8aa	Buy higher quality ear buds and a headphone amplifier.|`|jxg88KqFaa	Better quality headphones, the ones with the buds which mould to your ear shape...

ZdF9tnzkaa	I have a white G1 and I love it.<br>  <br>  I love google maps, because I can find everywhere I need to go. It has GPS on it, so I can literally see where I am at, when I missed my turned, etc.<br>  (I wish it TALKED, though, so it could tell me when to turn, like a real gps...)<br>  <br>  The GPS combines with an application I downloaded, for free, that tells me where the closest, CHEAPEST gas prices are.<br>  <br>  There is an application called Shazam that listens to whatever song you are listening to and can tell you the title and who sings it.<br>  <br>  I use it for shopping lists, to do lists, downloaded a program to keep track of mileage, there is a bartender application that tells you how to make just about any drink, a shopsavy program that can tell you where to buy the alcohol to make the drink at the cheapest price (or where to buy video games, tvs, etc etc for the cheapest price)<br>  tons of games,<br>  <br>  It connects to the internet, browsing is pretty easy, can open multiple windows, keeps track of your history...<br>  <br>  I love their text format.<br>  It keeps conversations as opposed to single text messages.<br>  You can keep them open for as long as you want, or delete them when you want, so you can see what you said to someone and what they said to you easily.<br>  <br>  The touch screen took a bit getting used to, though.<br>  And the battery can go dead quickly if you do not remember to turn off the gps and wi-fi when you are not using those things.<br>  I almost always keep mine off and have no problems with my battery.<br>  <br>  I love this phone<br>  And its basically like having a portable computer/cell phone that does a ton of useful and fun amusing things.
KSIY3EVVaa	im pretty sure the grubs do want peace. ive heard from some people that it was actually the HUMANS who started the war. if u ever watch the cutscenes 4 gears of war 2, u'll know that the humans were once very greedy with imulsion, which is like a very valuable fuel. the humans and the locusts had once lived in peace. but the imulsion lay underground so the humans stormed down there and tried 2 gain as much of the imulsion as they can (which led 2 the pendulum war). so almost immediately after the pendulum war ended, the locust were extremely angry and launched an attack on all of the major cities on sera (the planet).<br>  <br>  if u have gears of war 1, at the ending, the queen says that the locust cannot and will not stop fighting in the war until they die or win. the ending seems 2 tie in with the story. <br>  <br>  so yes, the locust do want peace, just that they will try 2 get it in a violent way.|`|USsjb7YLaa	they want peace for there colony.......

yezbmlaKaa	You should wait until June, contact T-Mobile then and tell them that when your contract is up, you are moving to another company - unless they upgrade your phone (for free). Of course, you would be more than happy to sign another two year contract with then for this upgrade.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't like T-Mobile and don't feel that they respect their customers or even have mediocre customer service. I would, personally, change to another carrier. In fact, that is what I did but not before they threw all these phones at me last minute to try and retain me.|`|QBQKxsNtaa	Go to t mobile store and they know for sure.

It was a headache. I have a pink Sony Ericsson walkman phone now and the sound quality of he music is better too.
HVQFVtelaa	The best way in general to remove pesky glitches from a cell phone is to remove the battery briefly, then replace. Glitches start occurring when you are stressing the limits of the memory of your phone. They usually continue once they start, but often you can get a few day's peace with that technique.<br>  <br>  If that does not help at all, it may mean you are experiencing design flaws, like the people with LG Scoops are having.
0vsvd3YKaa	umm first of all, i wouldnt mention to them that you want to be on late at night... that will persuade them NOT to let you move it into your room... basically, tell them that you would have a quiter area to study, which would allow you to get more work done with less distractions, and you would (overall) be more productive in your studies. you could also mention that you feel that you are old enough that you deserve a bit more privacy and freedom at home.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, and good luck!
4Ovf0Gr8aa	well the battery is in the back of your phone... you should know how to take that out!!<br>  <br>  and that happened to me before i ended up having to send away for a new phone.. do that quick so you don't have to pay for a new one!!|`|StJGeiFyaa	try the vanilla one next time, it lasts longer.|`|7fQLO6gZaa	Yes, take it out unless you can turn it off with the "END" button, located on the side of the phone, by pressing it down for about 3-5 seconds. If this doesn't work, take out the battery by pulling the trigger with the two lines on it to the left. There is a little nitch where you fingernail fits that you pull up on while pulling the trigger at the same time. Pull this out, and this is the battery. Leave it out for about 15 seconds and put it back in, and then proceed to turn the phone back on by holding the "END" button again. If this doesn't work, try again. After this, your phone is most likely down for the count, so you'll want to get it exchanged. Good luck!|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	well ya its gonna be black. unless it was white chocoate phone than it would be white!

5eUoENzuaa	It generally states on the iTunes Store information for the game if it lasts forever, or how long it does last. Check the information before you buy it again, it would be terrible to keep buying the same things over and over, when you could probably find a similar game that stays permanently, that can be played on your computer or mobile phone.<br>  <br>  Don't get sucked in, and spend loads of money on a game that really isn't worth the hastle, or cost!|`|YNJsvtlQaa	NO, you get to keep them forever, its just that itunes must update and those must get deleted, in itunes, go to the top, click store, view my account, enter password, and in the reciepts, where it shows the game you bought click the game, and on the next screen, click report a problem, and then tell them that your itunes deleted the game. and then after some time itunes should contact you and get you some money to re-buy that game.

6P27whuGaa	There will most likely be a 3rd generation iPod Touch out probably be before the year ends because thats when Apple's "cycle" of releasing new generations ends, but that's just my opinion/guess. There haven't been any announcements on what the new features are going to be since the 2nd generation was just released in September 2008.|`|kTyiKldbaa	I was wondering is their going to be a 3rd generation Ipod Touch? yes<br>  <br>  If so what are the changes? unfortunately only those who work for Apple know. I'd bat a built in microphone and maybe a faster processor. just a guess keep updated with macrumors,com<br>  <br>  And when will it come out? my guess is in September 2009 because of the iPod product cycle. although that makes sense it can be released anytime: tomorrow or 2 years from now (if the device actually exists). Apple employees are sworn to secrecy so our only hope is to look at what Apple has done in the past, hope the follow it again, and wait
a7AatQcEaa	The first guy is right. However you can play EVERY SINGLE xbox game ever known to xbox. What you do is sign up for xbox live. Go through the whole process. Maybe watch on youtube. Then decline the signing up for gold and you get a month of gold free. Anyway as long as you have live gold or silver you put in any old xbox game it will say cannot play do you want to update the game. Click yes and you can Play any xbox game...star wars, sports, halo 1 and 2 etc....|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Star Wars Battlefront<br>  Star Wars Battlefront II<br>  Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith<br>  Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy<br>  Star Wars Jedi Starfighter<br>  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic<br>  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords<br>  Star Wars Republic Commando
IhtbWbJpaa	16gb you can fit more music in it and video :)|`|6P27whuGaa	No difference, the 16 GB holds more songs than the 8 GB but everything else is the same.

If you have a lot of music and video, get the 16 GB. It is just the size, and nothing else. If you don't have a lot of music and video, get the 8 GB as it is about $50 cheaper.|`|nZynoCVKaa	8|`|YNJsvtlQaa	Well they work the same way, but you should give some information about what you will have on your ipod nano.  Because without that I don't know really, but I have a 8gb nano and a 16gb touch, and i like the 8gb because it has just enough for about 150 3 minute podcasts, 200 pictures, 5 TV shows or 2 Movies, and 400 songs. So the 16gb can hold 2x that.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	More GB is better. My opinion? If you're going to buy the 16GB Nano you should just spring for a classic, 120 GB for an extra $50.|`|mZBctgn8aa	it doesnt really make a diff. because 8 holds less than 16. they function the same. but one holds more stuff.

RyvKws7Laa	Ignore the other comments.<br>  <br>  At 32" you're not going to see the advantages of 1080p.  You need to be in at 37" bare minimum (and that's heavily sketchy), 42" (you can start to see it here), or well into the 50's (more likely to see it).  If you're sitting super close to the TV, at 32" you might be able to see 1080p advantages, but most consumer tests will lean towards not being able to pickup on the advantages.<br>  <br>  Don't worry so much about the contrast ratios.  There is no independent body that creates a system by which to measure it.  So that means each manufacturer can measure it and report it how they want.  If you go Samsung you'll get decent contrast, so don't get too hung up on the specific numbers on the box.  And again TV size matters here.  At 32" you're not going to see huge amounts of the potential extra detail offered by higher contrasts.  Its not bad to have higher contrasts here, its just not something to be hung up on in your decision making process.<br>  <br>  What I would look at is the refresh rates.  Again TV size matters and its not a huge deal at 32".  But over the other things I've mentioned, I would be more concerned with my refresh rate.  If either of those TVs is at 120Hz, I would jump on that one first and foremost.  If neither are offering that, then don't worry about it and move on.<br>  <br>  Also you say 2008 vs 2009 models, but from which series.  I would take a 2008 series 5-7 over a 2009 series 3 for example.  But if both are from the same series, I guess I might go with the 2009 version.  But you didn't list the model numbers, so its hard to know what exactly you're comparing (or as one person mentioned, if its even truly a 2009 model, as I hadn't heard of them being officially out yet-they were only announced in January at CES).|`|UinOWcMUaa	How would you know if it is a 2009 model ?? You wouldn't... and besides that.. you will kick yourself in the rear-end for not getting 1080p<br>  I would think about it more before buying :)|`|HX6JjCTyaa	May be you mean Samsung LN32A450 which 10,000:1 contrast ratio <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141AYIC?ie=UTF8&tag=bakugan.games-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00141AYIC" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141A...</a><br>  and  Samsung LN32A330 which 8,000:1 contrast ratio.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413D2G?ie=UTF8&tag=bakugan.games-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001413D2G" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...</a><br>  I would recommend Samsung LN32A450.higher contrast ratio will give you better picture.

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	I do believe that this is the cover for the WiFi antenna that allows you to connect to wifi hotspots around the world. It’d be best if you didn’t break the cover and find out.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|kTyiKldbaa	it covers the wifi antenna since the wifi signals would be really bad and well slower trying to pass through the chrome backing they decided to cover the antenna with that rubber circle thingy|`|YNJsvtlQaa	thats the Wi-Fi antenna, it gets you a Wi-Fi signal, so you can have safari browser, youtube, stocks, mail etc. and don't worry if you have a case thats thick and covers it, it won't disturb the connection, and you can place skins on it too, it doesn't break it
kTyiKldbaa	Using Apple's USB power adapter:<br>  make sure the outlet works<br>  restart my iPod<br>  change the USB cord<br>  if all else fails: call Apple<br>  <br>  Using a computer<br>  restart my iPod and computer<br>  change the USB cord<br>  re-install iTunes<br>  again call Apple if nothing helps

TaxYLHbMaa	you need to click on the effect hold onto it , and drag it onto the required video for the effect you wish it to be active on
q8cBE6w8aa	You can lose detail in either the shadows or in the highlights.  In digital photography, you may be able to correct such pictures within limits.  A correct exposure is the best, however.<br>  <br>  Even when there is proper exposure, pictures can be greatly improved with software.  I use iPhoto on my Mac, and it is really easy to improve a shot.  Check out what you have in photo software.|`|i5OVORXgaa	underexposed means it's too dark... overexposed means it's too bright.|`|AA12114566	under exposure mean thats the image is too dark. over exposure means that the image is too bright. neither under exposure nor over exposure is good. They are both bad. you want the correct exposure. correct exposure if what you want!
YNJsvtlQaa	Ipod touch is the best thing ever and gig wise maybe 16, because you seem like a music/movie person, and the apps take up some space, so that should be enough, and i've had my ipod touch since christmas, and it is the bestest thing ever!!!!!!!! Videos are crisp clear, and the apps are so amazing, they go from games, to food recipies/ cures for certain bodily problems.  I mean who wouldn't buy one!!!!!  I did and it was the BEST INVESTMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i gotted mine engraved :)|`|0vsvd3YKaa	i would reccomend 16gb, as the space fills up pretty quickly, and with 8gb, you'll have room for maybe 1000 songs and 1 movie MAX. 16gb gives you more double the room for $100 more, and is a worthy investment.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|K96tzjnxaa	YESSS!!!<br>  i have one! its awsum!!<br>  i love it!!!<br>  too awsum not to buy!!<br>  and if u have loads of songs, buy the 16gb, 32 is wayy TOO much. 8gb if u dont want as much songs and only want apps and stuf. <br>  i have an 8, havent used up a gb yet =) have bout 10 apps.|`|sBpMpfTxaa	heck yeah, its so amazing !<br>  (:<br>  the Gbs depend on how much stuff you add to the iPod|`|zy6fU9nCaa	totally buy it!! i L-O-V-E it! =^D<br>  i bought Blocked, its an awesome game and a total brain teaser<br>  also pocket god, yea its stupid but it's sooo funny and an amazing stres reliever. tap tap is fun too, i love playing solitare so Sol Free is another game. i also have astrology, yea its not a game per say but if you like to know that kinda stuff its a good app to get.<br>  8 Gbs is enough for anyone unless you are one of those people who like to put lots of movies PLUS its cheaper yay lol <br>  <br>  good luck hope you have fun with your new ipod!

AztCTaQlaa	Something that has worked for me (and this is very specific so I KNOW not everyone can do it), to get free music onto my computer is, I went to my library (which has 14 branches all linked) went through their music selection online, grabbed and put on the hold shelf the music I choose. Pick it up, check it out, copy the music onto my computer, return it to the library, repeat. Like I said I know this won't work for everyone. My library all connected and carries all kinds of music (including the heavy metal I love so much) has saved me LOTS of money (since I'm not buying off Amazon).<br>  <br>  But if you're not buying it when you DL online then most likely you will always be doing it illegally.|`|eUdk3VUvaa	You can try <a href="http://searchformp3.net" rel="nofollow">http://searchformp3.net</a><br>  You can download straight from there or you can just listen to the music from there.<br>  <br>  No need to download any programs, just download the mp3's directly from the website!|`|uH5eYdLqaa	You will get into trouble if you are downloading free music as this is illegal. Any site offering free music is illegal, and you will get caught.<br>  <br>  Try somewhere like <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com/</a> instead, it's cheap, legal and won't get you into any trouble. <br>  <br>  There are enough cheap places on the web to get music legally and cheaply without breaking the law.|`|LVSCAzyaaa	hey i have been using kptunes for a while and i am happy the way it works. i have used other free site to download music and i ended up catching viruses. if you don't want to mess around with your PC then try <a href="http://www.kptunes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kptunes.com</a> where you will always find the best and good quality sound track. they have the largest network and biggest music collection. this is the best program i have ever used. the best thing in kptunes is, there is no popups or an advertisement or no strings attached.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|pZZlrrDnaa	This is surely the easiest way to download music/movies that I've ever seen .<br>  Straight to the point, no annoying ads or popup...I love it! Check it out yourself <a href="http://www.areswire.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.areswire.com</a>  YOU CAN ALSO GET IT FREE..! VISIT THE WEBSITE FOR DETAILS.|`|aq0wOb6Waa	limewire|`|UtxSaJXDaa	ok this is better because the web site that i am about to give you is very good and easy. these are the conditions (no downloading,no installing) :) and it is way better than lime wire. Its called www.mp3realm.org       and you don't have to register <br>  <br>  1.type in the song you want<br>  2. when you find the song click on it.<br>  3.then when you do you will see and it will say either the link is not working (song) or it is. Most of the time it works. If it is left click the download word it will be blue and if you are using fire fox when you left click it you will see save link as click it then when it is done it will show up on your desktop but if you are using regular internet you will do the same thing but when you left click it you will see save target as click that and then save it where ever you want but if you use fire fox its much easier because it saves  write to your desktop and you can just drag it to a music folder. Well hope that helps. And please vote mine the best.|`|4MUM1vrTaa	Most music is copyrighted which means downloading for free = illegal.

If you transfer purchases, I believe it will only load purchases that you made from your ipod onto the new computer.<br>  <br>  What you have to do is store all you itunes files in one file on your old computer.  Then load that onto a flashdrive or external hard-drive.  Once you have done this then you can open that folder on your new computer.  iTunes will probably tell that the library is already being used on another computer so you will have to authorize your new computer to play your library.  Your find this option under Store tab in iTunes I believe.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|0nAhDKRYaa	You may take a look at this step by step guide, it will teach you how to transfer iTunes library to another computer, it's easy to understand and works pretty well for me. <br>  <a href="http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-transfer-itunes-library-to-another-computer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-transf...</a><br>  Hope it helps.

I'd say..<br>  Wii Fit IF you're willing to commit, and play it daily. Otherwise, it's a waste.<br>  If not, Guitar Hero. However, don't forget about Rock Band 2 (TWO. Not One.

VJ1C5JsYaa	1. In the matchmaking there are all the different sections they simply are for you to pick what you want to play. Ranked is the normal ranked games. Social is for non compete people who want to just enjoy that game. Hardcore is for players that have more advanced skills in certain parts of that game and wish to hone them.<br>  <br>  2. Yes slayer is an elimination based game type.<br>  a. King of the hill a simple spot that you have to hold for a set period of time. <br>  b. Crazy king is the same as king of the hill but the twist is the hill moves on you. <br>  c. territories is where there are certain plots of land that you have to capture normally there are three the more you have the faster your time goes up. First player or team to 100(or whatever) wins.<br>  d. CTF normal two flag capture the flag work as a team and get the flag<br>  e. 1 flag CTF attack and defend in turns for around 3-6 rounds team with the most captures at the end wins.<br>  f. Assault there is a bomb you must plant it at the enemy base. basically the opposite of CTF<br>  g. Neutral Bomb one bomb in the center work as a team to get the bomb and advance it to the enemy base.<br>  h. Oddball there is a skull or ball on the map work as a team or loner to get the skull and hold it as long as you can. The player holding the skull can not fire a weapon and can only beat down an enemy.<br>  i. Swat is a one shot one kill game type. No motion sensor no shields and all BRs. Head shot your enemy for the win!<br>  j. Sniper all snipers lots of fun. Bad game type for a beginner as it is a hardcore game type and you have to be good with a sniper but its lots of fun.<br>  <br>  Those are the basic game styles played. Now if you want to know about matchmaking.<br>  <br>  1a. Ranked playlist. <br>  A. lone wolf- Classic Free for all. Fight your way to the top for the win. Normally plays slayer. Oddball can be mixed in as well.<br>  B. Team slayer- Simple slayer. One red team one blue team....kill the color that you are not.<br>  C. Team Objective- CTF, Oddball, Assault, other. Mission based games that make you work as a team<br>  D. Team doubles- 2vs2 games. <br>  E. Squad battle- Two six-player teams square off in a mix of slayer and objective modes.<br>  <br>  1b. Ranked playlist (Hardcore)<br>  A. Swat- just like I said its all about the BR and headshots. Skill, speed, and accuracy is what you need to succeed.<br>  B. Sniper- All snipers. <br>  C. MLG- Slayer and objective. This is Major league gamers rules.<br>  <br>  2. Social playlists<br>  A. Basic Training- A place for players new to Halo 3 to learn the ropes and get up to speed. Start here!<br>  B. Rumble Pit- Same as Lone wolf just not ranked.<br>  C. Social slayer- same as ranked team slayer just again its not ranked.<br>  D. Social Team DLC- a playlist for people that have all the downloaded maps.<br>  E. Social Skirmish- Same as team objective just not ranked<br>  F. Multi team- Like squad battle<br>  G. Big team battle- Large games 8vs8 players<br>  H. Team mythic- Is only for the people who have the mythic maps that's just came out.<br>  <br>  3. Double XP weekend.- this changes normally its griffball. Rules change depending on game.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. If you are in a team game your armor is automatically your teams color. If you are in a FFA game your armor is whatever color you want it but everyone is your enemy no matter what color your armor. This just depends on the type of game you went into.<br>  <br>  4. I believe you start with 12 maps I think. Right now 4 maps are free on the marketplace that you can add to it. Another three maps come at a price of 800MS points and the list three so far can only be got if you have gotten halo wars.|`|NARak4iBaa	2. Yes it has different game types,  none really like gears of war<br>  3. There are some team based games,  but you can also customize the look for your Master Cheif.  You have to get into the options and you can pick an icon to put on the shoulders and different colors<br>  4.  I think there is like 5-6 maps.  Not sure. Some of the newer maps on xbox live are free, so you can check those out.  There is just a new map pack that came out. <br>  <br>  You should have gotten call of Duty 4 or 5|`|AA10600896	1. Just take a look at all of them.  It explains what each game is.<br>  2. It has various game styles in it... again, look around and play it.<br>  3. You can change your armor color.  When you play on teams your team will all be the same color.<br>  4. You need to play the game on single player to unlock more maps before they'll appear in multiplayer.

kDj1NSiVaa	WOW. Those are both AMAZING deals. I love amazon!<br>  <br>  First of all, good job going for philips. You clearly know what you want, and you can be assured that anything you get from them will be top-caliber quality.<br>  <br>  Now, for the meat of the matter. The most crucial difference between the two systems you have selected is the form of sound output. The shelf/bar allows for more customization, because of the wireless subwoofer. I would definitely choose this one (the first link) because you can uniquely position the subwoofer in a place that will give you the best, clearest, bass (such as the corner of a room,) while still positioning the main speakers in a central location.|`|3W9YN7rYaa	Both are about the same, and should be up to your standards. However, if you really want something that will blow your mind, get BOSE. It's much better than Phillips but is a bit pricey.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	Out of the two you listed the one with a separate subwoofer is better. Typically built in subwoofers are not as good as separate ones. <br>  <br>  This isn't an ipod speaker system but these speakers blow away both of the above ones. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Z-2300-THX-Certified-200-Watt-Speaker/dp/B0002SQ2P2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_7?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236509616&sr=8-7" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Z-2300-TH...</a>|`|cbe8d33e7cbbe8c1c91e8ee76259d01faa	The first one.. the form factor would be more suitable for multiple situations.. while the second one may work with the room now, what if you moved stuff around or wanted more furniture...
N2p30Mo4aa	usually when you have a pirated version, you can't take it online.  It'll play campaign just fine, but the second you take it online it checks to see if everything is on the up and up.

AA10594501	No. The converter box is only for receiving DTV signals over-the-air, with an antenna.

Search through My Computer and find the folder that you saved your songs to, they should still be there.<br>  <br>  You could run a search (start menu - search). there's an option on the left that will search for music files|`|WPao1l5naa	How the crap do you manage to delete both the ones on your ipod and in your library?
My0D4lmVaa	Yes. I believe the flash memory would be destroyed, and thus you would love all game save data.<br>  HOWEVER - this can be prevented, if you buy an SD card large enough to hold all your data. But some games can NOT copy the save data, so you may still lose some things.<br>  Also, I think you would be able to get your WiiWare & Virtual Console games back, if you called Nintendo. They would be able to find your old Wii's purchase records (if you save the console's serial code), and transfer them to your new system.|`|xGzq2Eueaa	it depends HOW it broke down|`|qj2KzBDFaa	of course man<br>  lose every single **** in there

DQ8Y2mIDaa	you have to connect it with a usb cord then press the ps button in the middle then it will connect to that ps3. it would be like if your neighbor had a ps3 you could control it from your house so you pretty much have to set it up to whatever ps3 you want to play it with or else it wont connect.

2V2jZAhwaa	actually your doing everything fine.  That's the way it works.  The font always gets smaller when you up the resolution.  same goes for a computer monitor.<br>  <br>  the lower the resolution, the bigger everything appears(much less space).   the larger the resolution, the smaller everything appears (far more space available for maximum image/video viewing<br>  <br>  it should be set to either 720p or 1080p depending on what the maximum resolution your tv can support.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you didn't mention what type of connection your using from the playstation to the tv. HDMI or component (red, yellow, white)|`|ef7020dcefd4e72fce16954952cc8e17aa	COMPONENT is actually red.blue.and green and COMPOSITE is red, yellow. white. <br>  <br>  Component is HD and HDMI is HD  so if you have those the screen shoul zoom out a bit so everything looks clearer
qVYyw1ndaa	have you looked at the samsung rant yet? its better than the lg rumor|`|70lNYGVDaa	The rumor is better because it has a bigger keyboard and has 2 ways of texting instead of 1.

o6BDapZjaa	No; the whole concept of long distance really doesn't exist any longer within the U.S. on cell phones.  As long as you're within T-Mobile's system and not roaming, you shouldn't get charged, and even if you're roaming, you're probably on a T-Mobile roaming partner, so you still won't get charged.  With unlimited texting, you can send unlimited texts to domestic numbers, meaning any phone in the U.S.  The recipient might be charged if THEY don't have unlimited text messages, but you can text anywhere in the country you wish.<br>  <br>  If you text to a number outside the U.S., then you will generally incur a per-message fee, because then you're getting the necessity to interface with another nation's cell system.  But as long as the recipient is a cell phone on a U.S. network, you're fine.  Even if THAT phone is out of the country for a while, T-Mobile only has to make contact with another U.S. company; how THEY get it to the recipient is between them and their account-holder, and doesn't involve you.|`|2f9dd364fde210fed1fb348be36d43ccaa	nope. u can send texts to any moblie and any place in USA. u only get charged when u text abroad.|`|lPsO6v1Daa	<a href="http://answersinnn.fredmccubbin.com" rel="nofollow">http://answersinnn.fredmccubbin.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|VPL7YGaeaa	no it is nation wide

WUgyCmMhaa	WiFi is free to your phone.  WiFi has nothing to do with your cell carrier, connect all you want.  I see you have an Unlocked iphone, nice.<br>  <br>  T-Mobile has an option where you can make and receive calls that flows through the wireless, but your iphone definitely cannot do that.  That may be what folks are thinking when they tell you wifi cost.|`|sjNffqIRaa	it shouldnt i have a ipod touch and its wifi enabled i use it and it doesnt charge.|`|n0A3eMWCaa	No, I am 99.9% sure it does not.<br>  As long as your not using the 3g or whatever service.<br>  Check with your carrier to be sure!|`|AoPcWYvdaa	it shouldn't but idk sorry
fca256c18e2ddc70911db7e7e706e07aaa	You don't need the disk to transfer your pictures from your camera to your computer. Just take your sd card out of your camera and plug it into your computer. A folder with your pictures will appear on your computer. Copy them to a different folder on your computer, so you can take your sd card out and still have them on there.<br>  If that doesn't work, plug the cable in that came with your camera, and hopefully that will work.<br>  good luck<br>  xxxxxx
NARak4iBaa	Maybe $100-130.  <br>  <br>  I'm guessing you are selling it because you don't use it enough?<br>  <br>  Maybe try some local online site.  (One of our local news station has a classified ads that people sell all the time).|`|HfNralgnaa	Since it is a model with an hdmi port I think you should be able to at least get $150.

j9YiR51Xaa	On your Ipod press the middle button and the up button at the same time. A little Apple Symbol or something should show up. Then immediately place it on the charger. Or if you have it hooked into your computer to charge. Plug it in first, then press the two buttons at the same time. This resets your Ipod without you having to lose all your data that is stored on the device. If this doesnt work place it on the charger for about 20 minutes. Then try these steps again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|KGnj5RBnaa	google it

deqc17Mkaa	Yes you can, the PS2 Rock Band drum set, guitar and microphone are identical to the ones you get in the PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band, they all use USB connectors unlike Guitar Hero controllers for PS2 which used the PS2 controller ports which the PS3 lacks. So if you buy Rock Band 1 or 2 for PlayStation 3 you can use your old PS2 instruments.|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	i dont think so because ps3s use usb ports not the ps2 controler ports so that mean you cant use any of your old controllers on it either. sorry|`|4e69153b735b65047087e01926d2496aaa	The PS2 Rock Band microphone, drum kit and Rock Band guitars can all be used on PS3....as long as they have USB connectors and not the PS2 connectors..a freind of mine still has his Rock Band 1 stuff from his Ps2 and they ALL work fine...|`|MaSxlf78aa	you can use the game and Accessories because Ps3 was built able to play Ps2 and Ps1 so you do not have so many system and

VlzaXlNkaa	Think of it this way, the xbox 360 wireless adapter is the equivilent of a wireless g adapter and will only be as fast as a g connection can be.  A wired connection will be MUCH faster depending upon you broadband service.  If you do not do any major gaming or downloading on the computer, I would suggest moving the modem and router near the xbox and using the hard connection to the xbox.|`|fwIe1sQwaa	I would go with the wireless adapter, in your situation. If you don't like it, return it or sell it and go with moving your modem and router to your XBOX.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	The best of your two would be to move the router and modem to the xbox. While a computer sometimes need a fast connection your xbox ALWAYS need the best connection you can give it. Hardwiring is always your best bet. If you don't care either way this is your best bet. Not to mention it would be cheaper to buy an adapter for your computer then it would be to buy the official xbox wireless adapter. So I would just move the router and modem and buy your computer an adapter.|`|WPao1l5naa	Your not going to like the answer, but its the best possibility for a good connection. You need to buy an extensive amount of ethernet cable and run it through the wall.If the modem is on the top floor and the xbox is in the basement, the wireless adapter will barely be capable of picking up the wifi connection. You will be lagging all over the place. Plus, the wireless adapter and routers will put a huge hole in your pocket. It seems like the ethernet cable would be more difficult, but trust me, its worth it.|`|BB4Qd9ymaa	If at all possible, a wired connection would be ideal for speed and reliability.<br>  <br>  Short of that, getting the wireless adapter would be your best option in my opinion.|`|HiU8pyfjaa	u could buy a really long ethernet cable<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4660734" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> <br>  and connect them with a RJ45

If that fails to work you will have to send it in for repairs.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	yup. Disconnecting the cables were the right thing to do.<br>  bcuz if u called MS, they would tell u first to remove everything and put it back in to see if it works before they send u the "coffin"..

z88IMXNFaa	Under that plan, which I have, you get 5000 minutes each month to use between 9pm and 7am and from 9pm Friday through 7am Monday.  The rollover minutes expire a year later.  You have to pay the $40/month even though you have a boatload of rollover minutes.<br>  <br>  If you're going to be texting, make sure you add a text plan since texting is not included in the $40/month.|`|IQotYdMBaa	The 5000 thing means that you will have 5000 minutes to use on nights and weekends.  Other plans have unlimited.  As for rollover, yes, you have to pay for your unused minutes, but you will almost certainly have extra minutes in case you want to talk a little more one month.  One thing to know about rollover is that every 12 months, you start from the beginning meaning that the extra minutes you have accumulated over the last 12 months are erased and you start building up your extra minutes from scratch.

xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player. The easiest way is to burn the music to an audio CD and then rip it back to Windows Media Player or a similar program as an MP3. Or you can get some software to help you. I use TuneClone to do this.

j5Apt8hWaa	You have a problem ... P&S cameras under $400 or even more suffer from shutter lag ... in sports and action photography, that means missed shots<br>  <br>  You will have to increase you budget to $550.  That will get you a DSLR with 18-55 mm lens (over 80% of your shots of the family, friends and travels) and a 55-200 mm which you will use for all your sports and action photography.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDPMEI/ref=noref?ie=UTF8&s=photo" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDP...</a><br>  <br>  The $150 will be well worth it, since the cameras sensor is over 15x the size of most P&S cameras and eventually you will be able to add more lenses to your system.<br>  <br>  The Canon SX-10 has about the least shutter lag of the P&S cameras, 0.079. The flash shutter lag takes a little longer, at 0.78 seconds.  At just under 0.08 seconds, it is close the the longest shutter lag found on DSLR's  At $399 US with a 20x zoom, it could be a good choice, but in the end, what you buy has much more to do with your goals as a photographer.|`|7Bx5DYv0aa	Nikon P80.

pl6eDKQbaa	There will be a new iPod Touch but it wont be out until much later in the year at least, what to expect? Well there wont be a lot of improvements over the current models. Expect perhaps a small redesign, perhaps it will be reduced in size again, expect higher capacities, longer battery life, more software and things to do, but overall it will be very similar. It will still have wifi internet, apps, internet, wifi music store, big screen, etc. Perhaps they will finally convert it to full 16:9 widescreen and add bluetooth but who knows what Apple is up to they are very secretive. My suggestion is to get the new one and have fun. Their is ALWAYS going to be a new, better model.

kA55GdQoaa	well according to what Steve said only half is true...  psn can support up to 40 players but it will lag. But i haven't  heard of x box never lagging not even 100% of the time they both lag and it is up to your connection to see which is better. also if you  have hard line the connection is way better than wireless since the wireless adapter cost 99.99 most people just buy a extended Ethernet cable and hook it up to their x box which makes the connection way better. so in reality its not about paying 50 dollars but its about your connection and type. Also home is on beta so it isn't complete yet but i found it to be quite boring but its good to play if you have nothing to do or to chill with your friends. Xbox doesn't seem to have that  at all i hear the red ring of death is almost eliminated but that's what they said about the falcon chip but hey im rather cheap so i will play online for free i could use the 50 bucks for games and stuff either way they are both great and rival each other more but its like this<br>  <br>  PSN= Free, lag due to wireless connection, Home (which for me wasn't that great but people loooooove it ), trophy's (total rip off of xbox achievements) and well that's about it <br>  <br>  xbox live= better connection due to hard line cable, avatars,gamer score,50 dollars a year voice messaging (which both of them have only xbox has it way more developed  people can voice chat on the psn tho)<br>  <br>  now they both can download movies and content they both use the cards to do that and Microsoft is affiliated with netflix while psn is affiliated to Sony films.<br>  <br>  other than  that<br>  <br>  i would go with the PlayStation but to be kinda fair  the x box has achieved a lot but i have to remind you they had a year head start PlayStation has no where to go but up with the 6 cell engine and the blu ray player i mean it has only gotten better and its going to get better but after the dust clears its going to be harder for Sony to get developer to make games for the ps3 since now we are in such a financial crisis but it supply and demand Sony has sold a lot more units since killzone 2 came out and i haven't even played it yet  but i can say it pretty awesome.<br>  xbox was very intriguing when choosing a console because it had such a head start it must have been the greatest console out there but i believe in late bloomers so i chose the ps3 <br>  <br>  anyways that's what i think hope i helped out and  hey Steve give pete a break just pointing out the obvious.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Pete957 very good job on looking at only what a fanboy would see.<br>  <br>  XBL and PSN are both decent both could use improvement.<br>  <br>  Overall XBL is better mostly due to the fact the it has been around longer and supports its users needs much more then PSN does. <br>  <br>  While in PSN there are some games that allow up to 40(i think) players. This is nice but chances are very very high that the lag will be so bad it will make you cry.(fanboys cant say anything to this because it simply depends on who is in the game and how there connection is). <br>  <br>  XBL while not allowing as many players per game is nearly 100% lag free. (again fanboys can say whatever they want because it the people in the games connection) However if someone connection is bad enough they will be removed from the game to create a lag free game. Also The overall features that come with XBL are better catered to gaming then on PSN. <br>  <br>  So yes while you pay for XBL you are paying for a quality service instead of a free sub par service. However if your not a big online person then PSN will be fine for you. Me on the hand plays online all the time so PSN can't support me before I get annoyed. (And I have tried being that I own both systems and a Wii). I like the PS3 single player more but the Xbox Online more.|`|AA11902365	Live is better because it has more features but PSN is very good too, and it's also free.

LF7MduWAaa	The RAZR ($80) and the Juke ($50) are both good phones from Verizon Wireless.|`|AA11092893	Well there are good phones that are cheap at Verizon. But it depends, are you new to Verizon? or your 2 year contract ending soon? If your new then you can get discounted phones, flip phones, blackberry's. For a teenager I am guessing you would be using phone primary texing, and making phone calls, so I would suggest, LG Voyager, LG Env 2 or the Samsung Glyde. Those are primary aimed for teeenagers and for those used for texing. But if you are not a texter then I would suggest LG Chocolate 3 flip phone. LG Voyager costs $199.99 and Lg Env 2 costs around $179.99. From that you might be eligible for $50 mail in rebate if you quailify. I would suggest going to the Verizon store and look around to see what phone you might like and then ask the price. You may be eligible for discounted price or not so it's good to ask. Also visit their website and see the current promotion. Or talk to the representative over the phone. You have many option butI would suggest going in to the store.  Also Samsung Alias is a good phone too, the phone can open 2 ways and can text and place a call. Like the other user has said there are other basic phones, Razr, and other basic flip phones under $100, so it is up to you what is your budget for the phone and how much your willing to spend on a phone. There are good phones (Blackberry and other PDA's) but need to pay bit more and have to pay additional package bundles with the basic phone plan. Hope it helped. Well good luck with your new phone.

The only other lens you may consider would be the excellent 10-22 mm wide angle zoom for shooting amazing landscapes or if you get into shooting closeups, the great 60 mm f/2.8 macro lens.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	That is a good set.Canon 450d ia s good camera, picture quality are awesome.<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00170WU8M?ie=UTF8&tag=computer09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00170WU8M" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0017...</a>|`|zm3JIDFvaa	I have this package and it is great. Are you getting the 55-250 IS lens? Read and reread the manual, this camera does a lot of things on its own (if you set it properly) that will give you better photos and save time in correcting later. Keep a notebook handy and when you try something new, write it down and review the results later. Have fun with it!|`|ZieA4fxraa	Yes this is a bloody good camera. My husband sells cameras for a living and he says these are fantastic.
