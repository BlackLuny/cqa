VN2wyTnFaa	Nope, but you definitely shouldn't waste your money. If you have a tattoo, it was injected underneath your skin and no topical cream will be able to penetrate that deep. If you're not happy with a tattoo you have, you should really look into laser removal. My boyfriend's best friend had a tattoo on his hands and had them removed with a laser and you can't tell anything was ever there. Hope that helped!
fjQP9dcnaa	Golden browns, warm taupes, deep purples, soft peaches and soft violets<br>  <br>  :)
kCdISEGqaa	I think it has to do with infection.  If you got your tattoo at a reputable, clean shop, you should be fine.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	What does a tattoo have to do w/ a medical exam?  Is it a strip search?<br>  <br>  Or are you trying to ask if you can get a job w/ a tattoo?<br>  <br>  Shouldn't you be asking this is the Norway section?|`|awskuSGBaa	Blood tests to get a passport/visa?<br>  <br>  You should be fine if you went to a good shop.
kCdISEGqaa	Loose fitting t-shirts, with no bra if you can avoid it.  I am small, so I can go without a bra (not sure that is always a good thing though!!!).  I always wear what I have, cotton, cotton blends, it really doesn't matter, just as long as it's loose.  Best wishes!!!|`|AFVwmOR2aa	A lose t shirt will be ok or a tube top what ever works|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I would wear a tank top if it doesn't touch the tattoo, or otherwise just big loose airy t-shirts. Maybe you could buy a big pack from wal-mart
BxMInUUNaa	Don't worry about it, I am sure that they have all types in. Anyway, if it is a posh place, I would book an appointment, because often those places won't even take walk-ins and anyway I think it is just better to book and be sure you won't be hanging around in the waiting area for ages. When you book, just say you want an eye brow wax. Don't go into any detail then.<br>  So when you actually go- normally they will ask you what you want. I have been to a few places and they have never just started without asking me. So say, "I am happy with the shape, I just need to get rid of the strays". That is quite common, they won't think anything weird about it. I personally like to shape them myself, but occasionally I get them waxed and I just say to keep the shape, but neaten it up.<br>  Good Luck, and don't worry about it, no matter how bad yours have been there will have been worse and I am sure they probably don't really care anyway!|`|NsTdWhgkaa	just walk in and say<br>  "hey! i want an eyebrow wax"<br>  <br>  like that, nothing hard about it....<br>  <br>  <br>  ps. the shaving it was really stupid<br>  dont eveer shave, they come back thicker
AA10873745	Honey just spritz it with a spray bottle and scrunch it with a towel, you can do that tonight or tomorrow. Just some spritz will cause the braid kink to fall out but won't be too wet so it will air dry quickly. Good luck.

Alright, next... you'd look wonderful with a nice glitter eye shadow, or something to bring out your eyes.  And mascara (a girls best friend!  Joking, I sound so vein...).

r0oHga6Vaa	get a supplement, if you go to a vegan store i know they have them there. or you could check in super supplements, they have a huge selection and i bet you could find something there. and a plus to that supplement is that it usually helps your hair repair and grow too!<br>  try not to paint them, they get yellow and break, eww. <br>  obviously dont bite them.<br>  get a buffer to get rid of the ridges and make them shine<br>  clip them so they wont break!<br>  thats what i do and my nails are nice and healthy!
3cQNxsqHaa	i had the same exact problem like 2 weeks before my wedding!!! What i did was, i found a beauty school where students do the coloring, it's always half price and they are always supervised by an instructor. You need to schedule a bleach and tone and explain to them what happened. some will be hesitant to do it since you just colored your hair, but when i had mine fixed i begged them, and it turned out awesome!!!! since it's mainly your roots, it would not really take too long. if you go to a beauty school it should cost you around $30. Good LUCK!
NRADLcVbaa	To make your nails stronger by eating try Spinach, Broccoli, Salmon , Eggs and Milk (soy milk is fine too). <br>  <br>  DON'T bite!! Biting weakens nails over time. Carry a file in your purse at all times---so anytime you get a snag you can file away. . .Thus preventing the urge to bite. Invest in a manicure (either professionally or at home). . .you can use a plain nude color. . .But the base coat, color and top coat give you nails extra strentgh to with stand damage.<br>  <br>  Take you vitamins and don't use you nails to type, open soda ot dial your phone (as any of the above weakens already brittle nails). A great book on at home nail care is by Ji Baek (Rescue Your Nails).|`|oQnlIr88aa	there are hair and nail vitamins that help them grow strong and fast otherwise you can buy what is like a strengthener. check out sephora.com and look at the nail treatment section<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P2884&categoryId=C156&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P217304&categoryId=C156&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a>|`|sOO93u5Oaa	They have strengthening clear nail polish and things that you can put on that make them stronger. Also, drink a lot of water. Water is good for everything, not just your nails, but your hair, skin, and everything else. You could try drinking milk, too. Sometimes if you don't drink enough milk, you get white dots on your fingernails, so I think that if you drink milk and get calcium and dairy in your body, it will help your nails, too.|`|AA10689703	i put nail polish on them from keep me from peeling my nails off(that sounds gross)....so put nail polish them maybe the ones that help them grow?

8hsD9qvVaa	Hmmm well I really think you could pull of like crazy colors like pink and lime green and stuff. It just seems like it would suit you!<br>  <br>  But if you are going for more normal then maybe blond? I mean definitly no platinum, but a light base with a lot of brown and darker blond undertones and low lights to even it out. Maybe even a dark wine red?<br>  <br>  I dont know but whatever you do I am sure it will look cute because you have stunning eyes and flawless skin :))<br>  <br>  Thanks for answering mine.<br>  <br>  Btw that first girl was pretty rude and what she said was ignorant + false  <br>  <br>  Bye and good luck :D!|`|GMvzUYbSaa	I think blonde would look good since you have blue eyes. My sister has blue eyes and dark dark brown hair but bleached it. It looked good but don't do the thing with brown underneath. It's so unoriginal. Get side bangs and layers but tell the hair stylist not to make it shorter. Just to layer it. And also I think straightening it would look good and hold back on the freaking eyeliner.

You match your purse to your clothes, and even only when it comes to style and not color. I say save up and buy two or three nice purses and then wear whatever you want. Besides there is no law that says that you can only wear nice purses with certain clothes.|`|cdcc5bd1e7cd458a1cc4a95f146da288aa	well..looking at the bag on the coach.com site, two of the three color choices are very neutral brown or black combos that will go with practically anything.  YOu don't really need clothes to match the purse, it just has to go with them.  The pink version might be a little bit harder to work with and I would probably not get it.  but i tend to only buy the leather bags from Coach because they are more neutral and go with everything I own.

AA11195732	Your tan will fade away gradually over a few weeks.  To help keep your skin lighter, avoid the sun and cover up with clothing, hats, sunglasses whenever you must be outside.  <br>  <br>  You can also try a few traditional treatments from www.oldenbuzz.com:<br>  <br>  1.  Lemon-Radish Brightening Serum<br>  <br>  1 teaspoon lemon juice<br>  1 teaspoon radish juice<br>  <br>  Swab the combination directly on areas of freshly cleansed hyperpigmented skin.  If desired, rinse off after 10 to 15 minutes.  Apply twice a day.  As with all skin lighteners, to see improvement, continue applying daily as part of your grooming regimen, and protect spot-prone areas from sun exposure.  Preparing a new batch of juices daily is ideal.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  Buttermilk Brightener<br>  <br>  This remedy for lightening the skin was already considered traditional in the late 1800s:<br>  <br>  1 pint cold buttermilk<br>  1 ounce fresh horsesradish root<br>  <br>  Steep the horseradish root for four hours in the cold buttermilk.  Keep chilled in a closed container.  Apply to the face two or three times daily.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  Dr. Wilson's Complexion Brightener<br>  <br>  1 pint rain water<br>  1 wine glass fresh lemon juice<br>  a few drops of scented oil (optional)<br>  <br>  Mix ingredients, and keep in a well-corked bottle.  Apply several times daily, allowing the brightener to remain on the skin for a few minutes before drying. <br>  <br>  <br>  4.  Safe Sun Spot Fader<br>  <br>  ? cup dry oatmeal<br>  ? cup milk<br>  ? cup pulpy orange juice <br>  <br>  See package directions for preparing oatmeal (cooking times vary according to type of oatmeal used and whether you're using a microwave or range for heat).  You can adjust the consistency by adding a little more oatmeal or milk, as needed.  Wait until the mixture has cooled to a pleasantly warm temperature, and apply it to hyperpigmented areas or your entire face.  Leave the treatment on for about 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse completely.<br>  A combination of oatmeal, milk, and orange slices can also be used as an effective treatment for facial spots.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.  Simply Lemons<br>  <br>  1 lemon<br>  <br>  Cut the lemon in half and rub over the hands and face after washing and before drying them.  Lemons lighten the skin, fade a tan, and remove minor spots and discolorations.  They also soften and cleanse the epidermis by removing clogging matter. <br>  <br>  <br>  6.  Bleaching Cream<br>  <br>  2 teaspoons lemon juice<br>  2 teaspoons hydrogen peroxide<br>  4 teaspoons powdered zinc oxide<br>  <br>  Combine ingredients well.  Apply to brown spots and freckles before bed.  Wash off in the morning with water.  Use nightly, and avoid sun exposure.<br>  <br>  <br>  7.  Freckle Fade Water<br>  <br>  1 cup vinegar<br>  2 whole lemons, chopped<br>  ? cup water<br>  2 tablespoons alcohol<br>  a sprig of fresh parsley<br>  <br>  Mix ingredients together in a jar, and allow to stand in a warm place for two or three days.  Strain the mixture, and bottle it.  Use the water nightly after washing and drying the face. Allow the face to air dry.  Keep the product refrigerated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Natural, homemade products are far safer than ingredients in many commercial preparations.  They're also cheap and fun to make.  Good luck!|`|BsDv3k5iaa	The only thing that I know of is to stay out of the sun and when you are out make sure you wear high spf sunscreen.  Your skin will lighten over time.

And i know you said dont say chop it off but you really should consider cutting a little more off. <br>  Really long hair drags down you face (if that makes sense) and cutting it will brighten up your face
jcEtRUVZaa	They can really give you a wonderful look. You leave them on until they're cool. Usually you put them on, do your makeup and get dressed and they're good to go. You can get some with steam, others with rubber coating...they're all about the same. The curls can turn out however you want them.

jcEtRUVZaa	I hit return too soon, so if I have two posts, forgive me!<br>  <br>  Yes they can hurt your hair if installed incorrectly. Too heavy and they'll break your own hair.

(where they sew it in) when they braid your hair first, for some it does hurt em ... i suggest take 2 shots of something strong if your kinda chicken. some charge from 100-300 dollars for a full(braids)head plus the cost of your hair. depending in what you get its about 140 pus dollars per pound for real human hair (remy, european). Stay away from synthetic hair they clump, they are better for dreads. Plan on paying at least 500 dollars on a good weave if trying to find someone good. or not find people in your area that have weaves/extensions and ask who they would recommend. person who puts them in for you is just as important, you could pay all that money just to have em do a bad job... you can tell too. braids are loose hair  leading to ur hair shedding, its a little lumpy and etc. I think glued in one last bout 3 weeks (i think) weaves can last up to 3mnths if you take good care of them. you can call around local salon to for more info and research they might even recommend someone to you. k hope this helps.|`|PTydjBFHaa	they are bad for your hair and they will hurt them. thats why stylists always suggest taking them out ever now and then the let your hair "breathe" i used to have the one's where they were glued to my head. i honestly would not suggest getting them but my hair was crazy short b/c of this horrible hairdresser who messed up beyond belief so to me it was worth it. also during this period i didnt dye my actual hair and when i took them out lyk every month i was cut my hair. i lost alot of hair from the extensions but if you are really self conscious then its worth it but if your just looking for a change why don't you try to get the clip in hair extensions. wayyy better. i've had them too and they are the best option out there b/c extensions are crazy expensive and so is up keep. honestly just go with the clip in but your going to do do what you really want to and learn first hand anyway so follow your gut.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	They do not damage your hair whatso ever.

jUuYMVqiaa	well the general waiting time is to wait at Least a month in between sizes.<br>  but a better rule (when you start to get to bigger sizes) is that if you can see a little light through your ear when you pull it down (like pull on your plug and if there is space) then you are ok to stretch up a size.<br>  <br>  do NOT stretch to fast! i stretched to a 0 in about a month and needless to say i ended up getting a serious infection that spread to my neck and had to get a shot in my butt (lol) and take antibiotics and a year later i just started to be able to wear normal earings again.<br>  luckily mine shrunk back to a normal size like 14g.<br>  i regret not waiting, because i tried it again and my ears are way to sentive from my previous stretching fiasco. so i wont ever get to have stretched ears :(|`|TjPwxbuJaa	At the smaller sizes, down to 2g, I found that I could go up a size every 2-3 weeks. Since there are 6 stretches between 14 and 2, that would be about 18 weeks, or 4 months and a bit. Then you would stretch to 0g, then 00g, then 7/16, and then 1/2 inch, and I found that at least a month is needed between these, so a total of around 8 months.<br>  Realize that everyone is different. This is what worked for me. I know some people who need to go slower and I've know of people who have stretched 2 inches in a year and still seem to have healthy earlobes.<br>  Regardless of what anybody tells you, listen to your body. If there is a lot of pain, stop and wait. Ear stretching is not supposed to be very painful and they should never bleed.<br>  One more point: from my experience, my first goal size was 1/2 inch. However, it can be addicting and I'm now up to 1 1/2 inches and still stretching very slowly. Be certain that this will be something that you want forever. I love mine and don't regret them, but know of people who do.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I have to wait at least 2/3 months before I stretch up one size. Make sure you do not skip sizes, as you can form a blowout, tear or infection. Just be patient and make sure to do your sea salt soaks. Another great way to keep your lobes thick and easy for the future stretch is Vit. E Oil rubs. I even put the oil onto my taper when I stretch. Vit E Oil breaks down the scar tissue, so it's a lot easier to stretch. They even sell vit e oil at wal mart with all the herbal medicine.<br>  <br>  As someone has said to use tape, make sure that you don't have a reaction to the material of the tape. My piercer told me it's really not a good way to stretch, reactions lead to infections. and that means you'll have to start from square one. If you can't use any materials other than stainless steel or titanium I'd steer clear from the tape.|`|W7GrERjkaa	2months. depending on how you stretch. <br>  <br>  I stetched in 6months from size 12g to 1' 3/4!<br>  <br>  Use elctrical tape. <br>  it stretches it faster. <br>  just wrap around the stretcher  evry other night, three or four times. and if your ear hurts wait a week or so. <br>  <br>  <br>  just pop the stretcher in from the back. <br>  you can only use tape once you get past a 00<br>  Get me?|`|STLYxP39aa	Considering that you have 9 sizes to go.. I'd say nine months.<br>  Always wait a month or more between stretching. Don't rush it or you can rip your ear or have a blow out, which is permanent unless you pay for a pricey surgery.|`|XZoQblwpaa	i'd say about 18 weeks i'm only at a 6g and intend to go to a 1/2 inch<br>  but it all depends on your body some people can stretch a size in a week|`|ODllxGl6aa	wow gaugingg isz freakingg discustingg itsz not attractive idk whyy anyone would do it,
1rHmtCdLaa	i went from 6 gauge straight to 0 gauge and i was fine but i don't recommend you do that i say wait a month because 2 to 0 is a major stretch and why go to a peircer? just buy tapers and push them in while you take a warm shower... the warm water will make it less painful and will let taper go through easier
hhW4j8PCaa	Go get fitted|`|hFpchZ1saa	If you wanna measure urself u go under your armpitts but above your chest. I guess it would be just where your boobs beging to grow off your body lol but as an exable ill say that measurement was 36in then you measure across your boobs going over your nipples so ill say that is 40 in  so the first measurement is your size around 36 then you subtract your around size from your bust measurement 40-36=4 then you just count from the beginning of a bra scale A=1 B=2 C=3 and D=4 so it would be a 36D if your bigger it just continues on DD= a 5in difference in your measurements If your in between regular sizes just go try on bras a size bigger and smaller n see what you like better<br>  I hope  i helped ya<br>  <br>  <br>  I want to comment on the person saying if your a 32 you can round to a 34 that is not true. 90% of support comes from the band so if you round up it will be too loose and cause sagginess lol If you are 32 in around you should wear a bra 32 in around.|`|7WaPZ8IUaa	You have to start by measuring just underneath the bust. Keep your arms down while measuring. If it is odd number, round it to even. Meaning 33 would round up to 34. If it is even number, you can opt to go up to the next size. Since yours is 32, you can opt to go up to 34 if it is more comfortable.<br>  <br>  For cup size, get one that you can completely fill out. Sometimes, if you reduce your band size, then you need to increase your cup size. So, if you are wearing 34C and you go down to 32, you might need a D cup instead. Your current bra size would be a good starting point to find out your right size.<br>  <br>  Anyway, most lingerie shops such as this <a href="http://www.intimateclothingshop.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.intimateclothingshop.com</a> will have their own sizing charts. Different brands will have slight variations between them so, you will have to try them out for best fit.|`|d8BSDETvaa	if you dont feel like goin anywhere here's a site that will help you...<br>  <a href="http://www.barenecessities.com/fit_sizing.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.barenecessities.com/fit_sizin...</a>|`|88JCKhJkaa	go to victoria secret, theyll measure u and tell you|`|xqQO81Omaa	I would try a 34D. Bra sizing not an exact science, it often involves trying different sizes until you get the best fit. First you need to make sure you get the correct band size. This means the band should not be too lose or too tight, but gives you support. Then you can find the correct cup size.
WSV0kjERaa	Ummmm..... NO. Are you crazy?? You have a really cute, SMALL nose. But I know how ya feel. I'm thirteen 2 and I worry about my nose alot. Just try not to think about it too much and it won't bother you. Gotta be happy with what you have :)|`|ArVCMN3faa	It looks fine but if you want to make it appear smaller<br>  take a light brown eye shadow, with no shimmer, and lightly<br>  apply it to both sides of your nose, avoiding the middle.|`|bhFvGRZwaa	It would be nice if there was a picture of your whole face to see if your nose is big or just proportional, but honestly your nose doesn't even seem big.|`|BKUhGTHdaa	I can't tell because I can't compare it to your entire face. The way it curves is cute, though.|`|RoRrOK9Laa	no its nice..and i have seen waaaaaaaay bigger|`|YG84sTdFaa	No, not really, but if you are self conscious, there are a few things you can do. First, updo your eyes and lips to draw attention away from your nose. Darker colors, but not too black and not too red for lips. Also, keep your skin clear. What's worse than a big nose is a big zit. Don't worry, if your nose is the only thing you worry about, your lucky. Hope I helped. Byeeeeeee!

8IfePMa3aa	Weight usually isn't the best idea unless you have a lot of "meat". They make various types of hanging weights just for this. I wouldn't be surprised if Body Art Forms or BME had them for sale. <br>  At 5/8" you are well past the point of no return. If you were to take them out they will shrink a few sizes with time, but it's not going to be even close to a normal hole. <br>  Personally I have 5/8" and I can take them out for months at a time and they only go down ~1/16" of an inch.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Weighing down your lobes can cause uneven stretching, so I'd just upsize one gauge at a time if I were you.<br>  <br>  Everyone's body elasticity is different, but at 5/8 it's unlikely that the hole will shrink back down to a "normal" size.  If you remove your jewelry for a while it'll probably shrink down, but still be rather large.  It's impossible to say for certain though.
0vlm2OZcaa	You're a little above average.|`|uQWKSQMzaa	You look very pretty.|`|F0uLexezaa	i'll give you a 7<br>  a little chunky (and not my type of woman)|`|dOnQuOtyaa	I don't fall for the makeup and hair idea.<br>  <br>  I mentally peel away the rubbish and actually..

ANiMHgb0aa	your gorgeous btw. ha. anyways. your hair needs some volume. spice it up with layers and some side swept bangs. dont cut it too short because it will make your face seem round. i'd just cut some long layers. good luck:]|`|F80jKUvYaa	I like your eyes..<br>  now, onto the real reason for this question. Are you looking for short or long?do you want to curl it, braid it, dye it what? Because Dying it I'd say for you I would go to either a lighter brown or a kind of strawberry blonde.A regular blonde could look good on you too. But if you went for blonde I would keep it at the length that it is and just do it with some long loose curls throughout your hair. <br>  As for hair I'd cut it.. cutting it is always fun. Takes some getting used to but will generally look nice. <br>  www.myhaircuts.com is a good site to look on in medium legnth haircuts they have some good things. And some other sites you can look at or people you can look at star wise would be like Victoria Beckham and people like that. But as for other sites....<a href="http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/</a><br>  There are also other sites you can go onto and upload your picture and set it up to sample different hair colors and styles for you.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	short alot lighter your hair is way too dark it drags your face down, so soft brown with blonde highlights and to the bottom of your chin with long pieces at the front. Lots of highlights and low lights and much shorter and layered for fullness.|`|aDWQfWJ3aa	Do this:|`|Sua2AJIvaa	You would look adorable with a wedge cut!<br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2487418589_c18c05dda0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2487...</a><br>  like this one, but a bit longer.|`|1Q5OU6Pcaa	WOW YOU KINDA look like your avatar<br>  <br>  to me all girls hair looks the same no mattter how its styled|`|1Akk3hZyaa	well you look happy in your pictures, try short and blonde :P not guy short but like shoulder length that would look hot|`|ML3PGUPYaa	mohawk all the way|`|pJ7ZtCFFaa	well if your hair is naturally curly, i highly suggest only trimming it, and staying safe. If it is curly, then get a new hair style with accessories such as head bands and clips.<br>  But if you have straight hair, or always straighten it (which you shouldn't! Natural hair is almost always the best way to go if you know how to tame it) then almost anything would look good. Don't go any short than a few inches below your shoulders! You run the risk of looking like a surfer dude. Also, no frontal bangs on you.|`|8lVSpsNxaa	<a href="http://sas.localguides.com/bundles/guides_ci/assets/widget_aTix3Gv1rjtA41NDXRt9HW.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sas.localguides.com/bundles/guide...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://donyanissi.com/celeb/index_files/posh_bob_4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://donyanissi.com/celeb/index_files/...</a>|`|skvzwS8Faa	Ok some of these people are saying get bangs?

te3vxV0haa	Well, I've got the same type of hair, and I've found that the best thing you can do is buy a Chi. They're great hair straighteners. They run a little pricey ($120 or so), but they are worth it, they save lots of money since you don't have to buy so many extra products.<br>  Just straighten your hair in layers, and before you do, spray each layer with some straightening spray (you can find some at any hair salon, just ask for it). Then, hairspray it when you're finished (but don't go too close to your head...you don't want it to be all crispy).<br>  <br>  :)|`|4BaDlyj8aa	get a chi straightner :))|`|vdJimPfqaa	blow dry it straight.<br>  maybe your using the straightener wrong o_o.

PTydjBFHaa	there is no right or wrong but you probably have extremely oily glands which is normal. some people's glands are oilier then others just like some peoples are dryer. it may be possible that you use too much condition. when you put your conditioner on make sure that you only apply conditioner to the ends of your hair then whatevers left over you can lightly run through the tops but if you do have oily hair then you shouldnt apply anything to your roots. good luck|`|hhYHGHNsaa	i used to use sunsilk, and my hair got kinda greasy too.<br>  you should try some of the aussie products. they work amazingly well! i use the aussie awesome volume and it smells great and works well for my hair. <br>  you might be using to much of the conditioner too. you might just want to use a tiny bit...<br>  hope i helped :)|`|AA74H3C5aa	you should try herbal essance drama clean.. or any shampoo that cleans and removes build up. and when conditioning... only condition the ends and rinse rigt away. conditioner can make it greasy. try not to touch your hair. <br>  dont get any shampoo that offers shine to the hair. you need one that cleans and removes buildup|`|sVowiexmaa	You should change your shampoo to something stronger like pantene, also apply it twice and make suure to really massage your ROOTS because thats where all the oil and grease builds up. Wearing hats all the time or caps can also make it hot and greasy/oily. Hope I helped!|`|csNzoGNZaa	use creme of nature its so awesome my gosh my hair is so soft and voluminous i always condition the roots
ZxoU6Qvgaa	curls no<br>  kinks possibly<br>  <br>  comb with fingers in the morning or else it will be mad frizzy|`|igfQac8faa	depends how fat the braids are. i did thin ones like 7 years ago when i was in 7th grade and the next day i looked like a poodle!|`|e7zXr9ozaa	It works much better if you wet/dampen the braids then let them dry over night. It won't be curly but more crimped looking.|`|WKAqqYXEaa	It won't look curly but it will have slight waves in it.<br>  Put some hair cream in it tomorrow and crunch it to define the waves.|`|hf5RgDzwaa	nope not curls<br>  just wavy hair<br>  <br>  braiding your hair doesnt give you curls|`|qPhoe1Opaa	you should but sometimes they dont turn out good.|`|5cf3134315e59e8603473e8d7ee634e2aa	yes,  but if you have a hard time getting curls/waves to stay i would suggest completely drying your hair with a hair dryer or just clamping a hair straightener on the braid. then spray the braids with a little hair spray before you unravel them.|`|vtuCoaa6aa	i tried that once and it gave me just waves but really loose. they fell out within a hour. so i would put some hair spray on it now and again in the morning.

JTjL9eD7aa	Yes, Folica.com is totally legitimate... I've ordered from there at least a dozen times.  <br>  <br>  BUT...I once went through 6 CHIs in less than two years between my mother and I, which is insane, because we both take VERY good care of such things. CHI does a great job straightening and curling, however, it is not durable. From cords fraying for no reason to fuses blowing out of the blue, CHIs have proven overpriced to me. One flat iron that works just as well and is half the price is Solia, which is sold at Folica.com. They are $80-$90 and I recommend the 1" iron. DON'T BUY A CHI! Like I said, they do work well, but you can get the same results for half the price and, Solia's flat irons have lasted me up to 2 years... not 2 months like CHI. I've always been told that I have gorgeous hair, and it's usually straight... I will never buy anything but Solia again.|`|nqGB8DPLaa	yes. they sell the name brand stuff. iv ordered from them several times and it was always great. if you dont like the product they will return it with no problems.|`|jyb0x1rsaa	i know everyone is so in love with chi straightners, but i honestly recommend le angelique ones. they usually come with a lifetime warrenty. <br>  i love mine, and if it ever gets fucked up, i can fix it[: <br>  they're a little pricey, but AMAZING

You are straightening your hair to make it flat and smooth.  You are NOT going to get volume.  These are contradictions in terms.  Try to realize what you are doing here, and make the adjustments.<br>  <br>  If you have straight hair, why are you straightening it??  Think girl think!!<br>  <br>  You need to dry your hair with some lift at the roots.  If you use the J-clips, to get the lift, and then use the straightener to smoothen only the top layer, you will have the volume you want, and the smooth look.  But if you don't know what you are doing, then no matter what you do, it is going to be all wrong.<br>  <br>  There is way too much to explain here.  Go get some lessons.  All girls groups will have presentations on how to do hair.  Go to a hair school and ask them how to do it.  It's not that hard... but you have to follow the correct steps!|`|Sh5pKTkTaa	Tease roots.<br>  Or straighten up and use hairspray

They sort through and find the legit samples so you don't have to. They are great because they are updated daily and all of their offers are "catch free", that means no long surveys, no pay offers. They also have a e-mailing list where they send you the free samples listed on their site. I use that so I get them in my email which comes daily. It isn't required though to get the freebies. Sometimes their descriptions are pretty funny too! If you are looking for a specific type of free sample, there is a categories list and a search bar right above categories so that you can do searches.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yes if you are from Canada you might like:<br>  <a href="http://www.canadasamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadasamples.com</a><br>  <br>  If you are from the UK you might want:<br>  <a href="http://www.uksamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.uksamples.com</a><br>  <br>  WHAT I GOT:<br>  Today I just got a Kashi Bar....

f3f7cd2d3542d38a1d847470285b6fd5aa	I have horribly oily hair too.<br>  <br>  Here are several tips:<br>  - Leave your shampoo in for awhile, like 3-5 minutes. It gives the chemicals in the shampoo to break down the oil and really wash it away.<br>  - Also, and this is probably the MOST important part, don't let your hair air dry. Air drying allows the root to lay against the scalp as the hair dries, and then the hair soaks up the oil on the scalp. So, it will seem that your hair is oily even after washing.<br>  - Personally, my hair is oily enough that I wash it in the mornings instead of nights. It just makes my hair look better, and if you get an ionic hair dryer, your hair will dry quickly.<br>  - Lastly, if you use conditioner, don't use it every day. Try every other day, and make sure you rinse well.|`|Sh5pKTkTaa	Get the products they use.|`|G2ay40UOaa	Try showering in the morning,<br>  don't use conditioner,that makes<br>   hair that is already greasy WAAy greasy.<br>  <br>  You may be using shampoo that is for dry hair ?<br>  ((if you are switch to ones specifically for greasy hair))|`|UIF7OBuxaa	honestly, get a cheap shampoo, don't use conditioner.<br>  <br>  The cheaper shampoos will strip all the oils from your hair, where as the more expensive ones take pride in providing your hair with oils.<br>  <br>  In the morning put a little power on it and brush it through, it will soak up some grease and make it manageable. Or spray hairspray in it and brush it out. There's many things you can do.|`|9oirBmlLaa	if you run your fingers through your hair a lot that spreads the oil around everywhere, thats one big reason<br>  another is what kind of shampoo you use. get the kind for oily hair<br>  and DONT leave in your conditioner any longer than 5 minutes, make sure you get it out<br>  i shampoo my hair 2x and my hair is way soft now<br>  hope i helped|`|eNKyRGXDaa	its happened to everyone...people tend to not wash all of their conditioner<br>  out cuz they think it'll leave their hair looking great...but really conditioner has oil in it and that makes it wayy more oily...what i did is not condition my hair for a couple a days and just use shampoo!|`|zWx6KRlJaa	You can try to get Some shampoo that is made for greasy hair, my hair gets pretty greasy too. Also another GREAT tip is when you use conditioner, only put it on the ends of your hair, don't put it on the roots.

JTjL9eD7aa	I once went through 6 CHIs in less than two years between my mother and I, which is insane, because we both take VERY good care of such things. CHI does a great job straightening and curling, however, it is not durable. From cords fraying for no reason to fuses blowing out of the blue, CHIs have proven overpriced to me. One flat iron that works just as well and is half the price is Solia, which is sold at Folica.com. They are $80-$90 and I recommend the 1" iron. DON'T BUY A CHI! Like I said, they do work well, but you can get the same results for half the price and, Solia's flat irons have lasted me up to 2 years... not 2 months like CHI. I've always been told that I have gorgeous hair, and it's usually straight... I will never buy anything but Solia again.<br>  <br>  Buying any flat iron from the drugstore or Wal-Mart is not worth it. I've tried several of those cheap, inexpensive ones, and they are mostly junk and not even worth the $30 or $40 I paid.|`|jrfUS1mqaa	a chi or solia|`|Dil6DihTaa	I use SalonCreations.

Of course! Take a shower at night, and ethier wait an hour or just blow dry MOST but not all of your hair.

I know you are growing it out, but you can't just leave it alone.  Hair does not all grow at the same speed, so in time, you are going to get uneven.  The cut you had will also grow out unevenly.  As it gets longer, it will get harder to handle.  So periodically, you need to go and fix it up.  You need to make all the uneven ends tidy to it looks neater to your parents, your friends, to you.  I didn't say make it shorter, I said make it neater.<br>  <br>  There is no truth to the old wives tale of cutting making your hair grow faster.  Nothing you do on the outside is going to affect it on the inside.  It grows fast enough as it is.  But keep it looking good as it is getting longer.  You may have to change the style a little as it gets longer, to keep looking presentable.  It will be long soon enough.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	go back at least once a month to get your edges trimmed to keep it healthy and keep dead ends from damaging your hair. I am growing mine out now (but I wear weave to let my hair grow underneath) however i still go to the salon once a month and get it washed and conditioned and trimmed.|`|zWx6KRlJaa	I guess you should just go back when the ends get really split, but when you go don't ask for a real cut if your trying to grow them out. Ask them to simply get rid of the dead ends and nothing more.|`|Z96I7wlgaa	never let it grow
NXcZ8Gkjaa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  The main element here is time...<br>  <br>  I've said this to a few other posts but it's the truth so here goes...<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is get a water based moisturiser with oils like Coconut or Olive oil (stay away from mineral oils like petroleum as they lubricate and don't penetrate - door hinges need lubrication to stop squeaking - hair doesn't!) moisturise daily!<br>  <br>  Use a protein conditioner. When you use a protein conditioner like Cholesterol etc, leave it on your hair, put a shower cap on and either sit under a hooded dryer for 20 mins or wrap a warm towel around your head - this opens up the hair shaft and allows the strengthening protein to penetrate the hair. Do this at least once a week.<br>  <br>  It's best to use a shampoo with the correct PH balance so anything that says it's for dry damaged hair is fine. You can wash as much as you need to - if you exercise often it's important to wash the salts out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep doing this and within six months you'll see a difference as the healthy hair grows at a rate of about a centimetre a month.<br>  <br>  It's a really good idea to stay away from heat appliances as they weaken your hair - well done you!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Chaz|`|ubofHDxPaa	Eat lots of cottage cheese.|`|aW4ivP7Faa	no|`|nnuTNmWsaa	take sciccors and look through your hair and cut off your split ends. DO NOOTTTT cut anything but the split ends. also, use a cream like long term relationship Herbal Esscence on your hair to prevent split ends and that is smart to give up the straightener and blowdryer.|`|qflKqif4aa	get frequent really small trims
eGW4X9pgaa	if she has said yes to highlights before and she is freaking now, it is probably due to the economy and she doesn't see it a necessary expense ...  hair colorations that are professional and non-damaging are usually pretty expensive ...<br>  <br>  she may actually go for a wash out kind ...  not sure of a name brand ...  just google temporary hair dyes ...<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|CtwGOAykaa	If you go to your local store, you will notice on the hair dying boxes that they each will say either (Permanent, Semi-Permanent, or Temporary) The temporary ones will let you know how long they stay in, as well as the semi-permanent ones. As for getting your mom to comply with you dying you hair, just tell her it's your hair; not hers. If she still refuses, do it anyways. Can't do much after you've dyed it.. unless she shaves your head. Now, that'd suck :P|`|EgqCLBwBaa	I don't know about the other part of the hair dye stuff,<br>  but a way to convince your mom that worked for me is telling her that by dying your hair is a way to express yourself and your style, tell her that you dont want to be like everyone else.<br>  Or what else might work is if your hair is blonde tell her that people are always making dumb blonde jokes about you and that people don't take you seriously!<br>  I hope that these work!|`|N9HU02Qbaa	theres barely any temporary dyes out there. the only one i use is ; colourpulse. it comes in a bright orange/copper (the same box) box, and its pretty easy to find in walmart.<br>  <br>  what i did, is i once got blond highlights, they grew out and got cut off. then i asked for temp dye and my mom agreed even though its bad for your hair.<br>  <br>  so now, i dyed half my hair black. the only reason she wouldnt let me dye it is cuz of my dad. he's big on that 'beauty is natural' thing. so, i did it when he was away (i was with my mom). what i told him after was; its gunna grow out back into my natural hair. its kind of 'temporary', but just for a much longer time.<br>  <br>  lol, sorry for my babbling (:

Might as well wax them all and besides that, bleaching after waxing would be very painful because you'd be subjecting your skin to harsh chemicals right after opening your pores from waxing the other hairs off...OUCH!  Just wax.....

Ykzx3OVfaa	I know it sounds overdone and probably everyone else will say the same thing but seriously - get some side bangs! You would look totally awesome with them!

I do know from shopping with them that if you choose standard shipping it takes 3-10 business days after the order shipped to arrive. I would GUESS that if you order was placed on the 1st it would have shipped on the 2nd making today the 5th business day and your 10th would be the 16th.

nuhfJk5taa	either hot rollers and hair sprayed after, then curl it, or <br>  <br>  take small sections, spray the hairspray about half arms lenth away BEFOR curling it, then after its curls spray again . <br>  <br>  touch it as little as you can and maybe you could do it at lunch or sometime closer to your school production rather than in the morning. <br>  <br>  also just a TIP:<br>  <br>  if you take the curling iron to about half way towards the root and curl to the root then start againn from the end of that srand all the way back up to the root youll get a tighter curl. because the root wont fall as easily during the day|`|taYFAwlzaa	Use hairspray and mouse.|`|ktLmwXo2aa	Lots of hairspray, spray each of your curls with it.

Doesn't sound like you need a mild relaxer... but they make them for kids and one of those MIGHT work for you -- but it's chemically straightening your hair -- so even though it's mild, the potential for damage exists.

V2zxqqo6aa	I got my nose pierce when I turned 18. It took about 6 months or so to fully heal, and was sore for a while. About two weeks after I got mine done, I had a white bump develop and it went away after about a month, but I was told to use warm soapy water and rubbing alcohol and it finally fell off. The only big thing is to keep your hands off of it and turn it a couple of times a day, but make sure you wash your hands before touching it. Also make sure that you clean the area several times a day to keep dirt and stuff out. As long as you don’t play with it, it will heel.  As for the pain, it depends on your pain tolerance I would say it was a 4 but that not something I can gauge for you. I change mine, out with different styles, I have to wear a clear one at work but change it out for something more me on the weekends. You don’t have to wear a ring, there are so many types that can be seen but are not big. Good luck!|`|QOsewJqWaa	just got mine done for my 17th birthday. :)<br>  <br>  okay so they dont actually take that long to heal, bellbuttens take longer actually and have a worse chance of getting infected,<br>  just start with a small nose stud, a screw not a straight one cause those falll out.<br>  <br>  small nose studs most people dont even notice so they dont look strange and most jobs will let you wear it unlike a nose ring.<br>  <br>  the pain wasnt that bad at all, just for like 10seconds then your nose kind of numbs itself, it barely bleeds and if you clean it and dont move it too much it shouldnt get infected, healing time came go from 2 weeks to 2 months.<br>  <br>  i finally got my parents to agree by having them look at pictures of other people like my friends and celebs like kelly clarkson, and proving it wasnt that big and most people wont notice it..<br>  <br>  my own friends didnt even notice at first it is so small.|`|ZzveN6B3aa	I got my nose pierced when I turned 18. I'm 22 now and I really wish I hadn't pierced it. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was about a 1 or 2. And your mom is right it either won't heal completely when you take it out or it will take a very long time if it does. But like I said I really really wanted it too but now I really really wish I hadn't pierced it in the first place. A friend of mine took hers out 2 years ago and you can still see where it was and she gets blackheads where it use to be. Gross right. I wouldn't recommend it.  Also my pierced nostril has slowly started to sag lower than the other after I pierced it and is starting to make my nose look crooked. But it's up to you (or your mom). Good luck.

Just don't over do it this product tends to make your hair greasy. This stuff smells terrific. And its super cheap only 6.49 or 5.99 with your sallys beauty card!

ZAJqUKDvaa	I have the same problem as you. You're not going to be able to make your hair thicker without extensions.. but there are a few things i do to help. First, blow dry your hair using a round brush. This helps create lift at the root. Also, I use hot rollers in my hair for special occasions. It instantly makes my hair look thicker and fuller. Just make sure to spray your hair after setting it in the rollers with hairspray and it comes out really thick looking. Finally, I tease my hair at the roots. Take sections of hair and spray hairspray at the root. Then back comb and fix the hair back to look normal.. It creates instant lift. However, my hair doesn't hold the tease for very long, but a lot of my friends say it works for them really well. So just play around with some of these ideas, I'm sure at least one will work.Good luck.|`|ykExUGW8aa	Answer to our questions sista - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSL2RKT-A34&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSL2RKT-A...</a><br>  <br>  I hoe this helps!

You can do that by take one layer of hair, teasing it, and flipping it over your head. Do the layer under it. Then, flip it back down. Lightly comb out the top. <br>  Buying a volumizer can help. You spray it at your roots and let it dry. You can do this with hairspray, by spraying it when your head is upside down.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are just some I thought from the top of my head, so there are plenty more. Good luck, hope you like your hair! (:|`|rxHVYfDpaa	Blowdry ur hair while your leaning over on the side and blowdrying it up so that your hair gets more volumous.  That worked for my hair, but i really dont know.  <br>  Mabey you could try extentions or something....

What happens with the collagen fibres in the skin is that if there's lots of stress, stretch and strain, the fibres then start fraying. After repetitive stress and tension they actually break, causing an abnormal surface texture which is crinkled and has lost all its support. So when the skin fibres in the deeper layers — or dermis — break, they create marks on the surface — stretch marks. <br>  <br>  Tests have been done on the effect of cocoa butter on stretch marks and the results have not been very promising.|`|4nqAS3sbaa	Not really.....just prevents them. Maybe if you treat the area everyday with cocoa butter, it will eventually lighten the stretch marks. Stretch marks are permanent, unfortunately.|`|C0BRtmGkaa	it doesnt actually remove them, all it does is hind them a bit. You can't actually remove stretch marks unless you get laser surgery

f6fCixDnaa	What kind of hair do you have?? Depending on what kind of natural hair you have (curly, frizzy, wavy, straight) depends on what your hair will cling to.<br>  <br>  What works for me best is to put it in a wet pony tail, then tie another elastic about 4cm down the pony tail, then another elastic again 4cm etc Repeat until you run out of hair...this should give you a nice wave look. (Dont comb the ponytail back so its tight..do it loosely! but makesure the elastics are on tight or they wont work)<br>  <br>  Or...i tie it in a ponytail and twist the ponytail then form a bun..that works well for me.<br>  <br>  I have layered wavy hair so it workes really well with the bun because the twists make the layers flick out. (all depends what hair you have)<br>  <br>  Maybe add a little mousse to your hair before you tie it back. I always spray a leave in conditioner mainly because i have dry hair but it helps it to be soft and gentle and more workable|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	put it in braids|`|UuLZBX9daa	I do this too here is what you do<br>  <br>  First get a spray bottle and buy some sea salt water, then mix warm water with about 3 tablespoons of the sea salt water. After you shower let your air dry a little bit, but do not let it dry completely. Then, Spray the sea salt in your hair and make sure you do a good job then split your hair into two sections, top and bottom. <br>  <br>  First twist the top part of your hair and tie it into a bun and then do that for the bottom half, then go to bed!

aYgj4cIBaa	I've never used the Physician's Formula foundation, but I have used mineral foundation before. I also have acne prone skin & have found that if the powder is too dry, it will dry out my skin(ie flakiness etc) even though I normally am oily. That being said, if you do use moisturizer, I have found that if you wait until it's absorbed into your skin, then apply the loose powder form, the 2 kinda morph into a liquidy foundation, giving you better coverage. If your skin is too dry, it goes on really powdery & doesn't provide too much coverage. You can use a concealer brush to dot on the foundation if you need more coverage, then buff over it. Make sure you get a good brush for applying it-that really does make the difference. Also, I have tried a number of mineral foundations & am in LOVE with Alima. It's the best one I've ever used & even though it's $20/25 for a container-you really get what you pay for, + it lasts at least 8-12 mos depending on how many times a day you apply. It's the smoothest, best coverage(& I have some scarring) & it doesn't dry out my skin, just had to share :) Hope that helps!|`|fzQIZPCTaa	Lighest Coverage -- Powder<br>  Medium -- Whipped/Mousse<br>  Heaviest -- Liquid<br>  <br>  Since you have acne prone skin, I recommend Maybelline's Dream Matte Mousse Foundation, since it delivers a heavier coverage than powder and since you don't want to use liquid. Not only should you stay away from powder because of your acne prone skin, but if your skin is dry that's another reason not to use powder.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|YOb8NPvRaa	The loose powder would be better since compacts tend to have more breakout prone ingredients.
rVWAdxP0aa	No, but if you MUST wear makeup, just stick with eyeliner or mascara at the most for your age. Your skin is probably smooth anyway.|`|DpQQZg3Daa	Dont use foundation...it will make your skin age more in the long run<br>  I would suggest using concealer and then maayybbe putting a little powder on top to set it and control shine.|`|9vCLgQHIaa	If you need it because your skin tones are uneven or you tend to break out a lot yeah.

A6jEzidYaa	I bought a ghd for 300 dollars and it did work good, but not good enough for the price. Go to folica.com   They have a lot of the best straight irons and ratings and pictures from people who have actually used them. It helped me a lot while picking an iron for myself.|`|rFUPo4YDaa	CHI|`|HFsRHZS6aa	Well you could get a GHD straightener, but they are a bit expensive. If you do get a GHD, I suggest getting the GHD Ceramic Hair Straightener (MK4).<br>  <br>  Here's a site: <a href="http://www.folica.com/GHD_Ceramic_Hai_d3360.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/GHD_Ceramic_Hai_d3...</a><br>  <br>  You can also get them from Sephora, but they're a bit more expensive. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to go for something as expensive as the GHD, then I suggest getting the Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron. I definitely recommend it. Unlike many other straighteners, it doesn't snag or pull on your hair. So it would be less likely for your hair to fall out while straightening it. It also has temperature setting that go up to 450. I got it and I absolutely love it. <br>  <br>  Here's a site for it: <a href="http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1558.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1...</a><br>  <br>  I recommend not getting the CHI at all. They don't have temperature setting, so you can't control how hot the flat iron gets. And it gets extremely hot. The hotter the flat iron is, the more damage it can cause.

I like seeing what people look like (I know that sounds creepy but that is not what I mean).  I just kinda like putting a face to the answers and avatars. ha ha.  Also, since most are prettier than they think they are I can be honest and still hopefully brighten someone's day.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you are old enough to not care about your looks, but times have changed.  What is on the outside is what counts these days, especially if you are young.  Studies show that attractive people make more money and are overall more successful and happy than ugly/average looking people.  Our generation has placed looks above everhthing else.  So how you look is how you are percieved by your peers.  I'm not saying it's right, but it's just the way it is.|`|zzkmdusEaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  You know for a fact that this question was a dissappointment to some horn dog whose jaw dropped when he read that question.<br>  <br>  You pretty much cover all their is to say.

Ipierced my mose when i was like 16 and it left this hole when it closed, it looks like a huge pore.|`|77GpYF5kaa	I Think it would be cute. It would give your face a diff look. Not bad at all.<br>  But hey ultimately its up to you. I say yes!|`|QOsewJqWaa	i think you would look cute.<br>  stick with a small stud though.<br>  left side ;]<br>  rings are gaudy|`|g1nPfYD7aa	i would say yes.<br>  i think everyone looks good with a lil stud in their nose.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  :)|`|HucBXB7Taa	those people above me probably just dont like piercings o_O<br>  I say it was look so posh =]<br>  go for it ^_^;|`|51pUgWvGaa	I would say No, sorry...|`|sBpMpfTxaa	honestly, no. sorry|`|coC1Mu4eaa	No sorry, it draws unnecessary attention towards your nose.|`|cOqAU04yaa	I say yes.  My sister has one and alot of people think it looks good on her.|`|6tOMmiPtaa	ooooh nooooo, to getto....|`|8xPZ2ZLYaa	what are you talking about!??  you dont need a nose ring ... you are very pretty just the way you are<br>  <br>  (:|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No, nobody looks good with a nose ring.|`|hXdt1lntaa	i think that a stud will look good on you...if you want one i think u should go for it
hMY5HDlIaa	Well, I only use it once in a while. I bought it three months ago and I think I've only used it about 5 times. It's VERY good for unteasing hair. Sorry but that is all the info that I can give you. I don't use it daily ):|`|6tOMmiPtaa	yes i have and it dryed my hair out really bad idk because of my texture, but that should not matter.
g1nPfYD7aa	i have used it & i love it. it smells amazing, but it wont repair ur hair.<br>  u should try to use REDKEN Extreme Anti-Snap.<br>  this also smells amazing. its in a pretty dark blue plastic bottle. i dnt think its expensive & it can be \ found at walmart. just a few pumps & rub through clean damp hair.<br>  <br>  good luck & hope i helped.<br>  :)|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	IT will not do anything|`|3MsuKdNFaa	ya it smells amazing but it doesnt do crap to ur hair
gVih4CGwaa	People think they can wear skinny jeans even if you're not skinny (just by getting it in a bigger size. But they are called skinny jeans because they get smaller as they meet the ankle. So when fat women wear them, it makes their hips look extra big.|`|GgBdQqrdaa	ya..but people who are abnormal try to be normal, examples: what you said.    larger guys wearing tight shirts to show they can fit in them..  girls always trying to prove how strong they are(because they have to compete with guys (kindof different, but same theory)<br>  <br>  <br>  so i think its just trying to prove a point.. but you are right.. its completely unsightly|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	the name is skinny jeans for a reason!|`|aAe0aZTqaa	I guess because they want to?|`|8dff88d974a255fe37cf6414a3f6981daa	you all are dumb if they make the jeans in a size that would fit a bigger person then the jeans are obviously made for a bigger person just cause they call them skinny jeans doesn't mean they are just made for skinny people.|`|LWCmNfpYaa	its whats in style and its just that much more easy to buy whats already threre than to look specifically for a certain type of pant i would guess|`|quFaycboaa	they see skiny and popular girls wear them and want 2 fit in and b popular|`|SHoIWZ56aa	cause they want to but like skinny jeans if they fit nicely ok but jeans that are cleary for skinny ppl are wrong on a fat body|`|X1UNkY61aa	if you don't like it, don't look.
zlXofrG4aa	lol SURE!|`|di3Gs5NEaa	that's pretty broad.  it depends for what?  baking...no you can't.  For colouring hair...no you cant.   For covering something up in the fridge, I guess you can.  Wax paper is used mostly just so dough and things don't stick.  Or to keep things from burning, like doing iron on t-shirts.  And if you used aluminum foil for that...you'd be in some trouble.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	You can't cook with wax paper - that would be parchment paper. But for wrapping stuff up to freeze, wax paper works fine.|`|FGuzsRpJaa	hmm depends on what your doing <br>  like if your baking a cookie then sure!<br>  but like if your getting highlights or something<br>  then that's a problem...|`|Jwh5enUCaa	For what?|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Im not too sure how either one would look with your makeup.  *ü*
69PoS4sIaa	you can put avocado in you hair the oil should bring it back to life<br>  and start using products that protect it from heat damage even if you dont iron it<br>  the sun can do the same damage <br>  get a trim and conditon<br>  <br>  good luck|`|UH4lU7MEaa	apply  mayonnaise  on your hair for two hours twice a week <br>  <br>  it will make ur hair moistured  and conditioned<br>  <br>  don't miss it|`|6HX4u0SRaa	in my tool bar i just typed in home remedies for dry hair and it send me to a website hotstufforks there it will give you 16 home remedies for dry hair take a look its very interesting
77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	Well after I came out of the shock induced coma I'd probably open a savings account with it.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i would buy my mommy a present!!!<br>  and go shopping, get my other tattoos|`|VWILDaYPaa	ima see if i can "change my age" so i can go to a strip club|`|qfGXtF5taa	Go on vacation to California. That would be so sweet, I wish I was young enough to still have chores.|`|RuuQWpFLaa	ill probebly buy a car|`|alAtUXvyaa	buy a moped lol|`|CI9J6x3daa	Omp Shopping!!!<br>  Id raid the mall.<br>  Go to every store and see if they have realy bright skinny jeans and converse and realy cute shirts xD ( My new ubsession is converse and skinny jeans)  <br>  Of course I might pass out casue I would get that much money just for doing my chores I get 25$ a week<br>  It would take me awhile to save up that much money!|`|9pvizOQpaa	Do whatever you want with it! Buy a new phone, some accessories or clothes...or you could just buy some early birthday presents for your friends and family!! Nothing wrong with being generous!!<br>  o_x
oquBKA4naa	leaving them alone for awhile would be the best option, and yes olive oil does help your eyelashes grow better and look longer. Some people use vaseline, but it sometimes clogs pores. Vaseline has to be applied at night and taken off in the morning. <br>  <br>  Also very important; do not scrub away mascara! That just cause eyelashes to break off. What your supposed to do is gently remove mascara with baby oil. The eye make-up removing baby oil should contain Vitamin E which strenghtens and makes eyelashes healthy.|`|eow59EaEaa	You could also use a eye makeup remover that is really moisturizing like Lancome's Bi-Facial eye makeup remover. You have to realize that you also need to keep the eye area moisturized to prevent aging around them. And don't rub too hard, the skin around the eyes are very thin and your don't want to get crow's feet at an early age.|`|3atgzahdaa	YES extra virgin olive oil is amazing for your eyelashes!!<br>  It also works as a makeup remover for waterproof mascara too!<br>  but it depends how you are taking your mascara off.  I would suggest buying a face cleanzer that also takes off makeup.  I use that and it works fabulously, and never takes off my eye lahses.  Maybe dont put on such a thick amount of mascara would help also.
7a9d80e7578cd0357143e2c187142a25aa	I like it|`|0BdTKNZzaa	no|`|gVih4CGwaa	No, it looks a little bit too straight, it won't show your curves. And the color's a little off, maybe a little bit too faded and dirty looking|`|ynxJOG66aa	not really, but it depends what your going for and if your top really steals your attention.|`|7xsJHSGTaa	nope|`|CYcqQb6Caa	no|`|53LyysJZaa	No its bland and the color is well yuck but thats just my opinion
6uZULSzMaa	I color my hair all the time and I live in a place that's sunny year round.  I use conditioner after shampooing my hair on a daily basis, and do deep conditioning treatments and use leave in conditioner every time I style my hair with heat.  However, I don't really go to the beach or anything like that very much.  I would say you should probably bring a conditioner to use after going swimming, or a leave in conditioner or something like that, so your hair doesn't dry out too much.<br>  <br>  I have some friends who color their hair and like to surf and go to the beach a lot (more than once a week all year long) and I know their hair gets pretty dry.  But that would probably happen whether or not someone colored their hair.  I'm guessing you're only going to be out there doing outdoor things for a week so it shouldn't be that bad.|`|wa9AFrasaa	yeah its totally ok for you to color your hair....it may fade a bit, but all your greys will still be covered. Also a note about the fading.....your color is always going to fade a little no matter what you do. If you want it colored, I say go for it :)|`|Ovn7040naa	It will be fine to color as long as you are doing close to your natural...and a little fading will happen but won't be that much...<br>  <br>  <br>     have a great trip
GWoW1o5oaa	Bee Gees perhaps. Didn't everyone wear white billowy pants in the 70s?|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	The Average White Band??
4lAR2Or2aa	its normal.<br>  itll go away by a day or two.<br>  <br>  i had ears stretch to 5'8s, they close. but the bigger they are the longer it takes to close.<br>  6 to 4 well close fast.<br>  depending on how quick it can close.<br>  <br>  im not sure if this is any help?<br>  sorry lol|`|Er6uwEmRaa	yes its normal for your ears to be red<br>  they will be red until they cool down.. they are probably hot right now..<br>  <br>  they seem smaller because as soon as you take them out the hole starts to shrink.. and that's normal..<br>  when you decide to take your gauges out they will eventually close! :b|`|bwYVs2k9aa	this is all normal my friend|`|zlXofrG4aa	lol You just stretched your skin, yes it's normal.  They'll be red for a few hours?<br>  <br>  Skin is very elastic, that's why you can stretch it and it doesn't rip, like it were paper.  So elasticity means stretchiness in a sense.  When you take the earrings out the skin doesn't have something solid to hold it in place so it 'shrinks up'.  <br>  haha It's like stretching a shirt out on a bigger body, it'll stretch over the mass but when it's taken off it recoils.
27hANXS4aa	I would just stop worrying about it. Its normal to have fine hair on your face. If you do something about it, it probably would come in thicker or darker. Think about that.|`|hXQBbOlvaa	Nair made me break out into hives and shaving will make the hair thicker, darker, and quickly regrowing.  I have had some luck with the Smooth Away system, but I have found it is more effective on larger, less sensitive areas of the body. <br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't suggest anything else, but I tried to eliminate some of the other possibilities!|`|h0su8iqdaa	They have this new product out, its called smooth away i think. Anyway, its supposed to be gentle and also exfoliate the skin. Its relatively cheap to. you can do a Youtube search for it and watch the TV commercial :)<br>  <br>  DON'T use nair. even if you have used it on your legs, your face is VERY sensitive to chemicals. you could actually burn your skin, and trust me, it is impossible to cover, painful to treat, and doesn't go away for weeks... <br>  <br>  Hope this Helped :)|`|zHN43P4Haa	Nair brand hair removal has a product that is meant to use just for the face area to get rid of hair.  It only costs less than $4 or so.|`|fibUKY4Eaa	def. do not use nair! nair is a b****!
JcUCMqVJaa	tell em.."no cutty"!<br>  and they'll get it<br>  ps. theyre never supposed to cut cuticles, thats a health issue|`|4suCPfMbaa	im  pretty sure they remove it so it gets rid of the dead skin there, and it makes your nails look longer sometimes. but really not sure?!?!?!  thats a good ?  i want to know the real answer to.. i think ill ask!!! :)|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	it looks better i guess but its not sanitary. the cuticle is supposed to be a barrier between your nail and your finger and if cut germs can get inside much easier. i used to go to Asian salons and I just used to say loudly " NO CUT!" and point to my cuticle.<br>  <br>  I started going to an Italian salon and its sooo much better lol|`|uXvvC9RAaa	To keep nails clean
KfzuzB47aa	well your hair should be dry and unwashed when you dye it even if you have junk in your hair unless theres a lot of hair product in it then you should rinse it out with water and then dry it with a hair dryer and if it wont dye leave it in twice as long...that happened to me and what happens is it stops absorbing anything so if it gets like that you might want to give it sometime to let it moisturize itself and get some what healthy again, not that im saying your hair isnt healthy. if its like that use like ausie conditioner the stuff that smells like grapes and when you put the conditioner in let it set for about 3 mins and it should absorb the color after that just fine|`|FJiq3on9aa	leaving the dye in longer wont necessarily make the color last longer it will just damage your hair more. try leaving it in for five minutes longer than it says, make sure you buy permanate color cause some boxes say temporarely on them. try not to wash you hair every day cuase it makes the color fade adn also try not to straiten, or blow dry as often. also use shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. also with dies from boxes, get one that is more expensive, trust me they last longer, try Perfect Ten|`|stKD9rgcaa	Most box dyes need 25-30 minutes. <br>  Make sure you're using a permanent dye (usually "level 3")<br>  Wash your hair the day before you dye it - don't use gel or spray or anything.<br>  After you dye your hair, try and not wash it for a couple of days - so the dye soaks in better|`|GBBOt9Vdaa	Do what it says on the directions and if that isnt working maybe add 5-15 minutes.|`|8JDxBlcVaa	i would leave it in maybe 30minutes at most. i am blonde and used to dye my hair black and i would leave it in for about 30minutes. and it wouldnt fade too bad. but it really damaged my hair.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.!|`|jQe1796Waa	my suggestion would be to go to a professional. Dying hair by yourself, can result in damaged hair, fading and colors that you do not want<br>  If you want the black to stay in for a while and you keep on using the home style hair dying technic you are spending a lot of you time, energy and money. So for say $40, or 2 home dying kits you can get a professional to do it, so that the color will stay, and it will be the right color
51pUgWvGaa	if you go to sally beauty supply you can get a good pair for like $130 but they dont come with the blades, you could pay around 25 dollars per blade, but since you are probably going short or to the skin you might only need to buy one|`|Ovn7040naa	pro clippers will run you between $90-$200...only supplier i know for non professionals is sally's...
g1nPfYD7aa	yes ur hair will be pretty badly damaged. its not good to bleach hair but than to dye it afterwards is even worse. it will be very dry & unattractive to be honest lol. <br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  :)
KVHYROztaa	i live in california, and sally beauty supply is the absolute best.<br>  <br>  find your local sallys<br>  <br>  you can use their website to find the one closest to you:<br>  sallybeauty.com
9FBh8Mu0aa	Here's a site about longer eyelashes. It lists a lot of the eyelash stimulators and you could probably get them in your pharmacy in Ontario. It also discusses natural recipes like Olive Oil and Castor Oil. Also discusses how to apply mascara to make your lashes look longer.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	I don't know if those eyelash growing stuff works...<br>  <br>  And Vaseline doesn't, because I've tried it. <br>  <br>  But an eyelash primer is good because it instantly adds extra length to your lashes and you can straight away put mascara over the top so that your lashes look long and dark :)|`|rvtktabkaa	There are some good products on the market for this situation, but most are very costly.<br>  <br>  I'm  not sure if vaseline works.<br>  <br>  Another way to get longer lashes rather then constantly wearing fake eylashes and applying them yourself and them bugging your skin, you can go to a beauty salon and most can professionally apply fake eyelashes which last a while. Talk to your local beauty salon for prices and for how long they last!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  Also I'm not sure if you can buy it in Canada but I use, nutrimetics curvy lash XL mascara. it works great!!|`|WVnrjYnvaa	Maybelline XXL mascarra. You use the white mascarra on it first, which thickens and lenghtens, and then coat it with the black afterwards. It works really well, I've been using it for year.<br>  Other than that, theres no way you could put something on it to make them grow longer. You could always use single lashes, and just add them where you need them or something.<br>  Hope that helped ?|`|Jwh5enUCaa	Have you tried an eye lash curler? It works at it is your real lashes!!!|`|nM8yB6Liaa	u surely buy then ....lashes can't be grown.....<br>  they fake ones r gud...<br>  n not tat expensive|`|VDWFRNHWaa	I have also heard that vaseline works as well. I know its great for dry skin, but i am not sure if it helps eyelashes grow. Either way i still rub some on before i go to sleep and i do think it makes some difference! As far as finding something that will help your eyelashes grow there are many things you can use but they are costly! One i am constantly hearing about is revitalash, here is a link to a few others <a href="http://www.eyelashgrowthproduct.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyelashgrowthproduct.com/</a><br>  Good Luck and if anything, continue with the vaseline!
K6K82f5Jaa	Um yes very I am red head to and I'm covered in them, but were lucky. Right?|`|8eCyY7RCaa	I have freckles!  I'm a red-head, too!<br>  <br>  They're adorable!<br>  <br>  I once had a boyfriend who said he was going to name one freckle every night and if we got pregnant, we would name the child after the freckle he'd named!|`|05A7FZwyaa	Well, I do have some freckles, but probably not as much as you.  I almost wish I had more.  I think they just add to someone's natural beauty and individuality.|`|hhW4j8PCaa	No|`|4qimEWgDaa	no, not really|`|ORcQKqkiaa	yea, there light and little but i like them..they're cute ^-^|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	nope|`|xUCXXb73aa	i have some|`|51pUgWvGaa	i have strawberry blonde hair and yes i have some freckles but i also am fair skinned.

jWmnSXlLaa	I bought it today. It is called lash blast luxe not deluxe. I haven'tt opened it cause i have been reading reviews on the net and youtube half the day. Most everyone says the older version is better in many ways. No one can see the shimmer even on themselves. and I have seen like 20 review videos on this. People like it but not like the orange tube. I am going to exchange mine tomorrow for the orange tube.  *ü*|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Not much of a difference really. You MIGHT be able to see something in direct sunlight, but other than that, it's no different than wearing regular Lash Blast. Good luck!|`|5viX2saAaa	I haven't use it yet, but the glittery effect should work.  glitter usually helps to bring out the eyes or any aspects of your face or body that you want to stand out.  I have tried Benefit's miss popularity, which is a kind of glitter that you can put on your eyes or on your face, which helps bring them out.  The lash blast in the orange bottle is amazing though.  The brush is amazing.  I think the one in the pink bottle should work pretty well though
1A1ozEaKaa	do you know the brand?<br>  if you do, locate flagship stores or stores that sell them..if i knew what brand they were, i could've helped you :(<br>  sorry.
gzaVGE4Qaa	My fiance uses Neutrogena "Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion". It smells great and it's really good for your skin. It moisturizes and heals dry skin. It's amazing.
Jwh5enUCaa	I just got one on my lower back a few months ago. It hurts but its like a scratching feeling. They stop every couple seconds so it is easy to take. Good Luck! Oh mine is not to big like the size of a piece of bread folded in half and it cost me $80. They go off the difficulty of the tattoo. They start at 40. Do no tlisten to them about it dragging through oyur skin it is tolerable. If it wasn't so many people would not have them.:)|`|hXQBbOlvaa	I would say that if you are only 13, you need to seriously think about why are you want a tattoo.  It hurts like a needle being dragged through your skin, and at such a young age I don't think you are mentally or physically stable for that kind of intense pain and tension.  Just think it over more and when you are 18, consider it again.|`|vamM6jOFaa	yes it hurts to a certain degree. it varies from person to person and their pain tolerance. it feels like a persistent scratching on the skin.<br>  <br>  BUT: you are only 13, and in most (if not all states) it is illegal to get a tattoo at your age.  It is typically 16 with parental consent and 18 without.  and besides, even if it wasn't illegal... it would stretch on you because you aren't done growing yet.<br>  <br>  wait.|`|CDvbGSxAaa	Tattoo's hurt, especially on the part's of the body with lots of nerves like the lower back and the wrist's.Remember, the more nerves the more it hurts.It Feels like a small needle constantly going in and out of your skin(I got two tattoo's on my arms)|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	I ALMOST GOT A TATTOO WHEN I WAS 13!!!!!! OF A SMILEY FACE- MY MOM TOLD ME IF I HAD IT DONE SHE WOULD HAVE LET ME- BUT IT COULD MEAN “GAY” sign LATER IN THE YEARS-  LIKE RAINBOWS NOW MEANS GAY!!!<br>  I AM NOW 24 AND I HAVE 3 TATTOOS. ALL OF THEM I GOT AFTER  I TURNED 18!<br>  GET SOMETHING PIERCED IF YOU HAVE TO LIVE ON THE WILD SIDE- IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT LATER- YOU CAN JUST TAKE OUT YOUR PIERCING!!! GETTING A TATTOO REMOVED HURTS ---MORE--- THEN GETTING IT DONE!!!!!!!!!!|`|qo2u1BCoaa	it hurts a whole lot.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	I hope your mother realises she has no legal authority to permit you to get a tattoo, and anyone who tattoos you is breaking the law.<br>  <br>  The physical pain is nothing compared to the mental anguish when you are stuck with a tattoo you no longer want. They are made to be permanent.|`|AgiwOGbUaa	everyone has already said it's illegal because you're 13. they are correct, besides you want to get a tramp stamp, be classy and plan a great design, draw it yourself, find an artist you love, and hold onto it until you are legal. then get it. BUT PLEASE, don't be another girl with a tramp stamp...leave that for girls with no promise.|`|b50de6e63c61b84e8a7ee07f92ab42b5aa	Sweetie, leave your poor mom alone, there is nothing she can do even if she wanted to. At 13, you can not get a tattoo anywhere in the county, even with your mother's written consent. It used to be if you were over 16, you could get a tat with a parental signature. Unfortunately, that changed a few years ago and you cannot get a tattoo while under the age of 18 under any circumstance. <br>  As for the pain... yes it is very, very painful. I have 10 tattoos at 21, and not that I regret any of them, but tattoo's are also very addictive. You will have plenty of time to get tattoo's once your over 18. And I am not trying to mean and I know you don't want to hear this, but just enjoy being a kid and forget all this nonsense about a tattoo at 13 years old.|`|alAtUXvyaa	they jam a needle into your flesh a hundred thousand times (for a very small tattoo) and inject ink into your skin...YES it hurts!!!! and they usually charge anywhere from 50 to 300 bucks for a small tattoo, depends on the compleity and size of the design. and sorry sweetie but it is illegal to get a tattoo if you are under 18, even if your parent says you can.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Hun there is no way at 13 that you can "legally" get a tattoo ANYWHERE so you have a while to worry about that. <br>  <br>  Tattoo costs depend on the exact tattoo you get, and where you go<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course it hurts its a needle going into you over 1,000x it sure as h*ll doesn't tickle|`|BwEN0hWAaa	uhhh dur!

kqtrWKIcaa	the green one in a way kind of looks like puke color....<br>  i like the first one in navy blue because i prefer clothes that is blue...<br>  but it depends.... navy blue would look nice for the winter <br>  and the second one in white would look good in summer...<br>  i guess green isnt a bad color for spring but the color is way to dull|`|ZkyYVS9daa	I personally think that you should get the jacket on the first link, because gray and navy blue are those colors that match with anything :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you know that big ol icon of the dude holding his head in his hand when someone types a question that is such an obvious fail?  yeah, if i knew how to make that icon, i would<br>  <br>  both those sweatshirts are boring.  they both are the same exact style, and they both say hollister way to largely.<br>  <br>    i thought maybe for one second this question would actually require some thought or decision making, but really the only decision youve got is what color.  beyond that there is so little differance between them, that any differences they DO have are pretty much moot.<br>  <br>   they need to hire some staff at hollister who actually have an original thought in their heads when it comes to design|`|oquBKA4naa	if you get one I think you should get the second one in gray or navy. It will match with a lot of stuff and they're super cute :))|`|6mxeFXDmaa	ummm there both really cute but id say the first one and if u do get it u shud get it in navy blue|`|gVih4CGwaa	Personally I like the brown, but out of your choices: the gray|`|rFUPo4YDaa	The gray/ navy blue.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	lol they're practically the same, but I'd go for the latter.

g6lvm8eUaa	the hair you want is on someone with thicker hair. Get your hair cut into more layers, and get your side bangs bulked up. Don't part your hair so far over (it makes it look thin and stringy). To thicken it, run a volumizing or thickening mousse through damp hair. Partially blow dry with your head upside down, then finish drying layer by layer, pulling the brush outward and not down. Tease your roots in the under layers just a tad and top with hairspray. Oh, also, definitely blow dry you bangs in the right direction and set in a roller for about 15 minutes to thicken them up. Good luck girlie!|`|51pUgWvGaa	blow dry it with a wide round brush. you have to divide into sections first when it is wet. sides, front and back. take pieces at a time and blow dry curling the brush inward  toward your head. make sure you dont take too big pieces at a time, it wont dry right or get straight.) do the whole thing like that taking small pieces at a time.  when you get to the top, part it to one side and blow dry it towards your face. remember small pieces at a time. it takes a while. give yourself atleast 45 minutes to accomplish it.|`|GBBOt9Vdaa	Yeah sure. For the bangs it won't be exact but get all your bangs. Wet them and use a round brush to comb them from underneath. While the bangs are cupped around the brush spray with hairspray and blow dry them. For the regular hair I would just suggest straightening it.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Or for waves you can use a curling iron and rap pieces of your hair around the barrel and hold it there for a few seconds; release and you should get a nice wave.|`|J4YG59tJaa	Well your gonna have to gain just a little more length..but you can actually get you hair cut to look like that its called texturizing.....look here..they do the best cuts..and more than likely they have a salon in your area.... <a href="http://www.toniandguy.com/822FB/HOME.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.toniandguy.com/822FB/HOME.asp...</a>
zzkmdusEaa	Bikini zone is the hair not covered by a bikini.<br>  <br>  Basically i'm just going to thow this out there. It is what I prefer, it is what everyone else says they prefer is just this.<br>  <br>  Trim it by all means. The only thing that is really a turn off is a jungle. I would say neatly trimmed, completely shaven just seems a little weird to me but is unnecessary in my opinion.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	NEATLY TRIMMED<br>  <br>  why on earth would a guy want a WOMAN to look like a prepubescent 11 year old girl down there unless he's a closet pedophile?|`|2Q3VkEfTaa	i don't like pubic hair on myself. <br>  i get rid of it for me, not my boyfriend. and he likes what i have to offer, but most guys don't care if you have a little. but i just don't like it personally.<br>  and for guys out there...do not ever shave your private...that's weird. just trim it a little bit, so it doesn't look disgusting.|`|QOsewJqWaa	i have wondered this forever.<br>  <br>  it kind of scares me when guys like it bald though.<br>  cause it just reminds me of the little girls that i babysit,<br>  and the way mine was before i hit puberty.|`|hhW4j8PCaa	Guys who like girls to have NO pubic hair are a bit of a worry to me.<br>  Why would a normal guy want his girl to look like a pre pubescent teen.<br>  bikini zone is the hair the bikini doesn't cover|`|1XAp4woVaa	I like when they neatly trim my name down there......so sexy.|`|bMZhDcNRaa	I've read in magazines (though it was a while ago) that more than half of women completely shave their genitals.  I think it's a matter of preference, in my past I have found that the guys I've been with didn't mine the hair as much as some girls think guys do but I've still always felt comfortable shaving first and then asking the guy later if he minds the hair just because I get embarrased easily. Shaven genitals can also be scratchy against your partner so he might actually have something to say about it!  The bikini zone is exactly where you are talking about, that crease between where your leg starts and the bikini bottoms hit.  Some guys like different things so just do what makes you most comfortable and when you find a person you are interested in then just ask them! I'd say definitely trim it though.|`|Xww9vGWPaa	I guess I must be a closet pedophile because of this, but I like when my girlfriend is all smooth down there. I don't like it any less when she's not, but it feels nice reaching down her pants when its smooth like that.|`|49vO7HWIaa	Depends, if he likes to give oral then bald eagle is the way to go.|`|kDQ1ZCFFaa	completely shaved. but its just whatever they prefer i myself think its too 80s|`|PNfkulukaa	shave it all off woooooooooo or trim there both good|`|6tOMmiPtaa	i think as long as its trimmed nicely that's fine
RTDQXBK6aa	The only thing I can say is that the lady who does my waxing recommended Braun Silk Epil. She said that's what she uses on herself, which I figure is a pretty good endorsement coming from someone who makes a living taking care of unwanted hair on others. She said they update them every so often and she just goes with whatever they have out at the time she needs to buy, which is usually every few years. Now my only question is, the X'elle or the Soft Perfection?

It's a demi or semi permanent but i gives you really rich long-lasting color. And you can dye your hair every month, without damaging your hair. It actually makes my hair shiner and i love the way the conditioner smells. Using a permanent will damage it for sure. Also, try a different shampoo. SOme can strip your color. Try pantiene, or dove (for color treated hair) or even john frieda for brunettes. And if your hair isn't very oily, try shampooing only every other day.|`|Ovn7040naa	Sounds like you are using a semi- permanent color...no need to worry you can usually re-color within 3 or 4 weeks without doing much damage. you can make the color last longer by switching to a permanent color but if you plan on lightening your hair in the future you may want to stick with the semi permanent as permanent color is harder to remove.

Alot of guys stand outside but ive noticed they are getting braver. lol. Yes its a good thing. Especially if you go to the fitting rooms with her and let her model what shes trying on for you.|`|hFpchZ1saa	My only Boyfriend that will go shopping with me is my gayboyfriend and i even have to con him into going with me! Ur Gf is luuuucky|`|R5hcAgwLaa	when i somehow get dragged along to the mall with my g/f it is a living hell|`|EEVx7gKeaa	Yessssss. as long as you don't care more about what she wears that she does.

I love it when my hubby goes shopping with me, and he always says that he likes it and he just likes spending time with me no matter what were doing. Your a good guy, most men wont go shoping with their girls ;P|`|C1spuRsZaa	It is sweet if the girl likes it.<br>  <br>  I HATE when a guy goes shopping with me b/c I know what I like to wear and don't need to ask the guy's opinion lol I wear what looks good on me, TO me.<br>  <br>  I do love shopping with girls, though...that's a different story.|`|xi9sOmEXaa	Of COURSE man. Shopping is something that she likes to do, and it's even better to do it with someone she wants to be with. So it's really great that you're not a drag about that, because that's the worst.|`|I98iE7ybaa	absolutely ;) <br>  <br>  nice job.|`|ywqB3Z4zaa	I hate shopping with my girl she takes to long. so it's a bad thing..but i ain't a chick
MMmv06Ynaa	my ear was pierced in the wrong place when i first got it done. I was 6 years old. so they had to re do it. i am 15 now and you can't see any hole. <br>  <br>  Yours will close and go away, it'll just take time. it'll probably take a year or so to fully close.|`|psLk5fDGaa	It will get less noticeable, but it will always be there. I had TONS of ear piercings when I was younger and I still have the impressions of the holes in my ear. It sucks, but it isn't a big deal and barely noticeable.|`|FOCpoUZpaa	it sounds like it is done healing and over time it go away <br>  since you didn't have it for a very long time. <br>  However, there many always be a "dent" <br>  but the noticeably will fade.|`|niGAKJT4aa	nope.  it might close up on the inside but you'll always have the outer hole.
0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Use a Roux Rinse...they come in colors...that's if they still make them.  The brown hair shampoo may darken your hair just a bit but not enough for what you want...|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Check out the drugstore or Walmart for hair dye that washes out.  Ask at the cosmetic counter they are really helpful.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|DtBx851Maa	They have demi and semi permanent colors at most drug stores or grocery stores - the one I'm thinking of is called naturals.  They usually only come in browns and reds, no blondes - but that's ok for you because that's what you're looking for.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I would go to a trusted beautician at your favorite salon and ask him or her to give you a non-permanent all over color.  He or she will be able to match it perfectly to what looks good with your skin tone.<br>  <br>  Edit: Shampoos specifically for brunettes/blondes/redheads don't actually turn your hair that color.  They don't deposit any color into your hair, unless you use certain expensive Biolodge conditioners, and even then they won't really make a difference.  I use my sister's shampoo by John Freida that's just supposed to be for blondes.  My hair is brown and it never changes anything, I just needed something to wash my hair with and don't see a point in buying something new if she has some I can use.|`|K5F9T4vNaa	im not possitive, but i dont know of any temporary brown hair dye. there might be spray, but i would check the drug store or supermarkey.  And if you use brunette shmapoo for three days, it wont turn your hair brown. you may notice a slight darkening to your hair but wont significantly darken it.  if you are really serious with  wanting a change i just say go for it. just pick a somewhat lighter brown at first, dont go too dark. because if you go liight first time, and wwant darker, its a hell of alot easier to go darker than to go back tolighter.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	The best choice for you would be L'oreal's Color Pulse. See my source link. It washes out after 10 shampoos.|`|LO4Lf7zcaa	no it would not be.<br>  if you want it darker, avoid the sun.<br>  also, try using temporary hair dye. :)|`|6olZBGDGaa	if you buy the boxes of color dye at the store it is only temporary. with your hair color, it may take a little longer for the color to wash out but it is your safest bet to avoid the permanent stuff.|`|4LXCVnjdaa	Use a temporary dye. It only last for a couple washes.|`|rFUPo4YDaa	Go with a semi-permanent haircolor it will wash out in a month.|`|4DSyEqTuaa	temp dye! my sister did this.<br>  <br>  walgreens :]<br>  <br>  return the favor?<br>     question on my page
8dWamvoXaa	yes it does... especially if you use extra hard hair spray.....<br>  teasing hair is basically just knotting it  :o<br>  -------<br>  if you want more volume, just use really big hair curlers at the roots and use a moving palmade..<br>  or blow dry your hair with a really big circular brush at the roots...<br>  teasing is ok... but use a really good conditioner to take out all those tangles  ^-^|`|ZAJqUKDvaa	My hairdresser told me that teasing isn't the problem. Its when people brush through their hair after teasing. If you put conditioner in your hair and let it sit for a few moments and brush your hair in the shower it should be okay. Good luck!!|`|GBBOt9Vdaa	It will probably cause damage if you do it constantly.|`|f65fe6708c96316f9a9cb1729c261f7baa	duh.<br>  when you tease you are breaking your roots over and over and over again.|`|A7LRGnVnaa	yes so does brushing your hair.|`|35EDYBKQaa	i dont think so...<br>  but then it might.<br>  <br>  im pretty sure if you dont do it that often then it shoud be fine.

Tease it up and maybe wear some bows or headbands in it. Straight accross bangs would look good on you too. You look good with red hair though. It looks great.|`|Jwh5enUCaa	Your hair looks cute now but try having it framed around your face more by having layers and lots of high and lo lites. Also try poppin it, you would look phenomenal.|`|NfIdKeJ8aa	you should get a front fringe. or something like miley cyrus's fringe. the one where it's kinda front kinda side.<br>  it would look good :)<br>  <br>  I think i answered that right :)

At all.<br>  If you have nice charming personality, you will have no problem making friends.<br>  Ignore that "I am ugly" voice, because everyone is beautiful in their own ways.<br>  And everyone has problems. I'm sure that there's that one girl you know that's perfect. But she has problems too. Maybe she's bad at school or has family issues.<br>  You really have to be thankful for the kind of person that YOU are. :)|`|JcUCMqVJaa	in 2 years they'll be knocked up or something..stay just the way you are build confidence and always wake up in the morning and know your freakin rad! own it..whatever you are or claim to be..own it!<br>  seriously|`|G2ay40UOaa	Don't think like that.<br>  i'm sure your pretty.<br>  just believe in yourself<br>   and you'll shine lol.|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	study and get smart<br>  <br>  if you can't get by on your looks, you have to use your brain. some people are lucky to both but if u have one you should be fine. now if u don't have either that's a problem.....|`|1T1rHTGBaa	then have something that lasts a lifetime while looks fade - a great personality
farhj0Kiaa	I worked at Guess, Banana Republic and Tommy Bahama...those places are very similar (except Tommy Bahama) to Ralph Lauren. Dress code is probably like banana republic...Alot of the guys wore polos and slacks or button ups. Women wore slacks with a nice blouse. Shoes either had to be clean canvas or spit shinned dress shoes for men. Women had to wear comfortable dress flats or heels (if you want) Toes must be pedicured if you had open toed shoes. I was making $9.75 hour (california) start. Discount was 20% off plus 1/2 yearly employee discount events (40% off) <br>  Its cool working there...But you deal with alot of Foreigners and upscale rude people. So you MUST have a solid heart. I liked working there but I liked nordstroms better. Good luck!|`|WaeuF1KGaa	fine from internet
UDc9C3Qmaa	Truth is everyone gets stretch marks wither they admit it or not. I have been tiny all my life and still have stretch marks. When I was in my teens I started growing breasts faster than my skin could stretch, which caused me to get fresh stretch marks (the pink/red tone is a early stage). Same happened with my hips. They do fade over time and turn white. I haven't found any way to get rid of them an I really don't think there is a way. Once they fade they won't be as noticable. <br>  <br>  I do know a secret to preventing them and it help me so much when I got pregnant. Vitimin E oil (comes in a bottle, not the capsules)....lotions say they have it but the oil works so much and makes your more elastic. Go to the pharmacy (Walmart sells it too for like $4-$6) you should find it there. I have no stretch marks on my belly cause of it. Since your stretch marks are fresh (pink/red) you have a chance to heal them better and I would use  I wish i knew about it a long time ago, but if your afraid of getting more you should use it after you get out of the shower. It's a god sent haha. <br>  <br>  As for your being embaressed in front of your partner. It really isn't much of a big deal as you think. Plus they do fade a lot and half the time guys don't notice things like that.|`|4e75214dd69cb400fba95f596db55087aa	<a href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce/onlineProductDisplay.vs?namespace=productDisplay&origin=onlineProductDisplay.jsp&event=display&prnbr=CK-206743&page=1&cgname=OSBDYALLZZZ&rfnbr=5757" rel="nofollow">http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...</a>|`|xM3iQwhaaa	if there purple and red there not permanet yet. get some cream and maternity cream is the best stuff.|`|YFiDnVrtaa	Use cocoa butter, the real stuff.

UcWA30y9aa	Stop washing your hair 2-3 times a day because you are making our skelp even more dry by doin so.  Try using a special shampoo just for dandruff.  Some of the ones I know of are: Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue, Neutrogena T/Gel, and Nizoral.  You should be able to find all of these at Walmart or at a Drug store.  <br>  <br>  -or-<br>  <br>  Hot oil therapy is one method to cure dandruff. Massage hot oil into the scalp at bedtime. Next morning an hour before bath, rub lemon juice mixed with cosmetic vinegar (mix 1:2 ratio) into the scalp. Give the hair a good wash with egg shampoo. <br>  <br>  Give your hair a hot steam bath. Massage hot oil with a hot damp towel and leave it on the head like a turban so that the steam can fight dandruff. You may use two towels for this purpose. This will improve the moisture of your scalp skin to fight against forming dandruff. <br>  After giving your hair a good wash, boil five teaspoons of dried and used tealeaves in limewater, use it as a last rinse after shampoo, to give your scalp skin, the factors of anti-dandruff formation. This gives your hair… a lustrous shine and provides nourishment too. <br>  <br>  Instead of shampooing, massage handfuls of baking soda into the hair and scalp to absorb oil and to loosen dead skin on scalp. Rinse thoroughly and use no other shampoos. While initially the hair may seem dry, after several weeks, dandruff will go off and hair will be smooth and shiny. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Clean the hair and scalp daily with Baby Shampoo. The Baby Shampoo cleanses the hair and scalp with its less harsh ingredients but removes the excess oil from the scalp and pores leaving the skin still infused with the conditioning oils. This also avoids you from having to use harsh conditioners that could also cause your scalp to react badly and flake off.

997sxSawaa	The color might not be as even when you dye it. Whenever you dye your hair if you have dry hair or over processed hair the area that is most damaged will soak up the dye more. You should go to the salon and get a conditioning treatment and a really good haircut before you dye it.|`|kUWRiagKaa	no not really if u do it profesinal of coarse :)<br>  answer mine thx|`|az0Z0DIjaa	Yes. It will.|`|1RWdip75aa	I would try some DEEP conditioner for a couple of weeks (like use every day or every other day). If this improves your hair then I'd say go on and dye it, and continue with the deep conditioner for about 2 weeks after dying it. But if your hair is still brittle... I wouldn't risk dying it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also try a semi- permanent dye. It's less harsh then permanent.|`|A6jEzidYaa	If it's been a year you can dye it again with little damage. Dye is always gonna damage your hair though. Just make sure you do a deep treatment 1 week before and 1 week after dying your hair.|`|rFUPo4YDaa	I don't think so. My hair always feels softer after I dye it.

Nevertheless, I would still go for the tall girl simply because I like taller girls.|`|kDQ1ZCFFaa	im 5'11 so i say the taller one. its always better to be tall cause just think of what the short one is gonna look like after kids and age. she will prolly be huge no offense or anything|`|cdc012529cbae7ee39f6399f8eaf40f4aa	5'7, 5'8 is a good height for a girl in my opinion.|`|bMZhDcNRaa	though i'm a girl, I'd also agree :-) I'm 5'0 and I wouldn't trade it for anything.|`|T257iVtBaa	Honestly, I would pick the 5'7" female.

GZKbvXLLaa	I'm far from being beautiful, but I wear long nails. No, I don't avoid work to keep from breaking them. I don't normally do the type of work that may cause them to break. I don't do any heavy lifting, but how many women do that sort of thing anyway? I have very little problems in terms of breaking my nails, and yes, I live an active lifestyle. Most things that most normal women do on a daily basis won't damage your nails. So, I don't know what you mean by work, but it sounds almost like you are talking about guy type of work - you know, heavy lifting, being rough on your hands and nails by doing outdoor construction work, plumbing, roofing or whatever...that sort of thing. If so, no, I don't so that kind of work. I do not avoid it, I simply don't do it. Most women don't.|`|By1DJAUOaa	BEAUTIFUL O YES TRUE TRUE TRUE!!!<br>  o i don't because i never pay attention to my nails like that i have strong nails that just won't break and i keep mine painted and if i get tired of them being so long then i just clip them shorter and get them painted but im not the broke a nail type of girl:)|`|YI9cEtFvaa	if people do thats just sad. and there either lazy, too young  or rich to have a job.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	LOL in my town we call them "railroad wives". 20-26 year olds married to 40-50 something year old dudes, bleach blond and stick thin. You see them picking up their husbands paychecks in their huge SUV's at the union then going to the mall to blow it all. After they turn 30 they are divorce for an "upgrade". <br>  <br>  Its the cycle of life.|`|KcSL53Ooaa	no, i'm a violinist, can't have long nails, so if they're long enough to break, they need to be shorter|`|hhW4j8PCaa	What? no|`|Tk8nAbRfaa	All my friends tell me I have princess hands because my nails are semi-long and clean and clear and strong. But every now and again I'll break the white part of my nail clean off  dancing, or on the edge of a car door handle or desk, and have to deal with a stubby fingernail for a few weeks :[<br>  But it definitely doesn't stop me from living at all.|`|gUIhXGNeaa	I'm beautiful (not to sound conceited, but I know I'm not ugly) BUT I am also a mother...avoiding work is impossible.|`|6tOMmiPtaa	i just handle everything so delicate, but if you do hard work, wear your own.|`|g1nPfYD7aa	hell no!<br>  the nail will always grow back.<br>  only girly girls worry about that ****.|`|sU8DI4yfaa	Yes...

hnZkQyj0aa	Feel free to wear your thong. Nothing wrong with it.As for families around we probably woudnt have as many problems in our society if people lightend up a bit. The human body is nothing to be ashamed about and if we didnt make such a big deal about it most people wouldnt have the issues they do . <br>   I occasionaly wear a thong myself at the beach.

MuWth0wyaa	Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver the other 7.5% is an alloy including copper.  <br>  <br>  Copper can oxidise when in contact with your skin or with the air.  Therefore the alloy component can discolour and/or tarnish, turning your sterling silver brownish (tarnish) or grey-black (oxidised).<br>  <br>  You can clean it with a silver cleaning cloth from a jeweler's or even from the supermarket.  (Do not use chemical cleaners if the silver jewelry has gemstones or pearls in it.)  <br>  <br>  To keep sterling silver looking great all the time, give it a quick wipe with a cleaning cloth after every wear and if not wearing for an extended period, keep it in an airtight environment, eg. a ziplock bag.<br>  <br>  You may be able to obtain argentinium sterling silver instead - this is the same content of silver but instead of a copper alloy it has germanium, which is tarnish resistant.  Much easier to keep looking clean and shiny.|`|eO1zN6wSaa	ya sometimes but if you dip watever in achol its like<br>  new again.<br>  <br>  help me with my question ladies only plzz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqJMc2VuPRHa88CyhKPq1QHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309210326AAWmc6m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oUJUp7h3aa	im not sure but can someone helo answer my ? at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgUsfS0N4E6I0QLmNk4BnuLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309194406AAXoTAb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  thanks :)|`|XrcZkt6Haa	sometimes will, depends on the methods you wear and store!

FdUKvE6xaa	The actual piercing part might last about 30 seconds. Add in all the prep time & it's maybe 5 minutes total, if that.<br>  It doesn't really hurt. It's just very uncomfortable. It'll just feel like a little pinch & then a lot of pressure. But, depending on your tolerance for pain, it might hurt more or less. Everyone's different. It definitely hurts more while it's healing than actually getting it done. It'll feel really bruised & tender to the touch for a week or so (like if you've ever had one of those really bad-@ss big red pimples on your nose or in your ear...that's what I'd compare the healing pain to). If you have a tendency to pass out at all (I do), I recommend drinking some juice or having a couple cookies or granola bar or something right before & after, and remember to breathe. :)|`|gxYXIpxKaa	if you really want it that bad<br>  it wont matter how much it hurts|`|8d7ac16347d32d9fa03837f21bb72527aa	for the actual piercing and insertion of the jewelry it should be less than 30 seconds but that doesn't affect the pain much. it'll be a sharp pinch as far as pain goes.<br>  <br>  the pain is gone immediately but for at least a week or so it will be tender assuming you take care of it correctly.<br>  <br>  make sure this is all done by a professional|`|QbpK9GbTaa	1. It took like five minutes.<br>  2. Very painless, seriously.<br>  3. Hurt like 1 second whilst getting it done.<br>  4. Afterwards its hardly read and not swollen.<br>  5.

VRhvQryiaa	Before you grow your hair incredibly long... make sure you know what exact style of 'asian hair' you want. You can get that wild and spiky look with semi medium, medium and long hair. <br>  <br>  After you grow your hair go to a hair salon or barber shop... an asian hairstylist is prefered (not trying to be racist >.<), If you have a certain style you want to get, print out a picture of that style. If you have Thick hair you will probably want to get it thinned out to make it easier to spike. And they will most likely have to layer your hair as well.<br>  <br>  Judging by what your description is, grow your hair, ask the cutter to get your hair thinned and layered... make sure they have thinning shears and a razor first.<br>  <br>  After you get your haircut, you have to <br>  1) Shower or wash your hair, <br>  2) Blow Dry your hair <br>  3) Straighten your hair if its curly <br>  4) Get some Wax (ie. Gatsby) and just spike it up, it takes practice but after a week you get good at it. <br>  5) Hairspray. <br>  <br>  Tip: Don't use too much Wax and Hair spray.|`|6uZULSzMaa	look for pictures online for asian hair styles and take it in when you get your hair cut so you can show the person cutting your hair.  maybe you should go to the same place your friends go to.<br>  <br>  i think they use wax to style their hair.  there's videos on how to use wax for your hair on youtube, i just saw some the other day.|`|SQmWPaYzaa	Get an Asian haircut.

If you did, I'd suggest going back to the salon with the picture and ask for the manager.  If you didn't take the picture with you, and it's only been a day or so since your cut, I'd suggest going back to the salon with the picture and ask for the stylist who cut your hair and show her the picture, then ask if she can fix the cut she gave you since it isn't what you wanted. Personally, I'd be really disappointed to not even get bangs ... but don't be grumpy when you talk to the salon folks; you always get better reception and treatment when you act professional.  So...stay cool, calm and collected.  Simply state your case, what you expect them to do for you, and mention that you will not be paying for a service you have already paid for.<br>  <br>  re: color ....

If you want to wear it curly like the picture use a conditioner that won't weigh your hair down.  To get the soft curls, you'll have to take small strands of hair and curl them around your finger.  Spray a very small amount of hair spray on and hold them for a few seconds.  After doing all of your hair, give it a final spray, making sure you flip your hair and spray under it also.<br>  <br>  If you'd rather use a curling iron, you'd have to go with a smaller barrel curling iron, just know you won't get the same kind of curls.|`|tKaBqvuVaa	go on youtube look up cute short hairstyles<br>  youtube,com<br>  <br>  curl with curlers, straightner or curling iron

It won't hurt your skin or anything, but it won't do a particularly good job of spreading the foundation, either.<br>  <br>  If you want to use a paint brush, it should be a relatively small brush, a centimeter to a centimeter and a half thick, preferably with a rounded  rather than a square tip.<br>  <br>  However, if you're going to have to go out and buy a brush anyway, probably the best thing to do would be to check out the beauty supplies in your local drug store.  They're relatively inexpensive and work fairly well.  Though I will say that the better-quality brushes you get from department stores are a good investment if you're very serious about makeup.|`|eow59EaEaa	Please don't use the posted brush on your face!!

I personally use make-up brushes, but I know others that use paintbrushes and they have had no skin problems from it. <br>  <br>  The important thing is, is that the bristles need to be VERY soft.

Wear what you want; if people laugh at you, it's because they fear you.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I think skinny and straight jeans are always going to be in in some way. They are both a type of cut of jeans, not something trendy like keffiyehs which has already died and people are not getting it. Nor is it something radical that's only going to be stylish for five seconds like lame and neon clothing. They're just jeans. Both sexes have worn them for many years and will continue to wear them for many years.|`|T257iVtBaa	Yes, the skinny jean trend will always be the tred du jour in the homosexual and emo community-- these communities are interrelated.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're getting some laughs because if you are a straight non-emo man wearing skinny jeans, you are the one being laughed at by all who surround you, make no mistake about it.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	no, you'll go back in a couple years and realized you looked gay either way. skinny will fade away soon enough, just as baggy pants did too

yogS60O3aa	I know what you mean, I'm a 32/34dd and I cannot go without underwire.  I hate every bra that doesn't have it.  Wear an underwire, it won't hurt you.  It gives better support and takes a lot of weight off your back/shoulders, and since your also busty you need all the support you can get lol.  Boobs also tend to look a little nicer in underwire bras for some reason.  I don't like the sagging/floating around/hanging out/bouncing feeling either!  It gets painful when all that occurs.  And hey keeping them upright now might help you in your later years?  (not sure about that, but makes a little sense lol)<br>  <br>  Although when I'm at home sometimes I'll just throw on a snug t-shirt,or tank and hoodie for support so I don't always have to wear a bra.  That helps out a lot.  But, when I sleep I always sleep without a bra.  It feels good to let them free once in awhile you know?  It allows blood to circulate better, Your band isn't cutting off circulation and stabbing into you by laying on it wrong.  I sleep better and maybe even breathe better.  There's no proven fact that sleeping in a bra causes cancer.  So for now just sleep in whatever way is more comfortable for you :)  If you like to sleep in bras, try a sports bra they're def more comfortable to wear while sleeping.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	Women who wear a bra while sleeping are 8 times more likely to get breast cancer.

They'd be happy to tell you.<br>  <br>  Just don't go with the lowest price though, go check out the shop. <br>  <br>  Some shops will give you stuff to help heal it but generally most don't. Lip piercing is pretty easy to take care off. Pick up some mouthwash and anti-bacterial soap. <br>  <br>  I've had mine done for about 6 years now, and the easiest way to clean it is twice a day (morning and before you go to bed) wash your hands, put some anit-bacterial soap on a q-tip then run it under some warm water to dilute it a bit. Swab the outside of the lip piercing with the q-tip & soap. Carefully rotate the piercing back and forth through your lip using your fingers. It should move easily. If you have any crusties you can wipe them away with the q-tip, don't pick them off. Then grab a cup and pour some warm water over your lip & piercing until all the soap has washed away. Rinse with some mouthwash and you're done! :)<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>  Don't forget to clean it twice a day for a couple weeks. If you forget to clean it one night like I did, you won't be able to rotate it the next morning and it will hurt.<br>  You may want to dilute the mouthwash with some water if it's a bit strong.<br>  Mouthwash after every meal, drink (except water) and cigarette.<br>  No kissing or oral activity for a month.<br>  No alcohol for a month.<br>  <br>  If you can avoid dairy products and spicy foods until it's healed. It won't hurt if you eat these things but it will take long to heal.<br>  <br>  And when you go to the piercing place, MAKE SURE they are using a BRAND NEW open needle and also they should be wearing gloves. A good sign too is if they break that needle in front of you. Not everywhere does that but some palces do just so you can be sure they're not re-using the needles.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Jb2QyeK0aa	try cutting your bangs.  i know someone who has the exact same problem.....if you cut them shorter (along with the rest of your hair) train them to do whatever you want as they grow out.  if your hair is just naturally thick and unmanageable, then keep it short and messy.  that's always a good look! :)|`|xM3iQwhaaa	it just needs to be trained to stay the way you want it, try blowdrying it to the side you want or use bobby pins (when your alone if you want) to get it used to staying to the side<br>  <br>  (my guy friend does that)<br>  <br>  or just to the hair flick like every 2 seconds, wont fix the problem.
WOiH4CGvaa	Enjoy 16, the college guys, aren't worth it! Really! You'll be 21 before you know it, and 30 before you'll want to be, and then you'll be asking "how do I look younger than I am", for real!|`|PwD3slrTaa	dont' don't don't DON'T DON'T F***ING DON'T you have no idea how many girls start playing with trouble and wind up f***ing up their whole lives because they watch too much TV and it makes them unhappy with themselves and they seek the "approval" of older, very wicked people|`|6uZULSzMaa	be careful with the people you'll be hanging around with.  i'm in my early 20's and seriously...be aware of the guys.  don't get caught up and listen to everything they say because i'm sure many of them say what girls want to hear, because they think they can be manipulative or whatever.  they like to play games.  but i can understand that you don't want to feel uncomfortable or out of place.  i think a lot of it comes from how you hold yourself and your confidence.  people look at me and think i look 5 years younger than i am, but people who get to know me and don't know how old i am think i'm 5 years older.  it's a lot about appearing to be mature.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	Just... dress maturely? I don't mean slutty or skanky or "sexy".. I mean just.. more maturely. Argyle, vests, etc. I don't see why you need to try to look older anyway. You want them thinking you're older than 16? Cuz that'd be lying to the guys. Besides, one day you'll wish you looked younger ;D Best to appreciate it now!|`|Zuqyx4tJaa	enjoy the age you look. besides, you don't need to trick guys into thinking you're older because they find out how old you are eventually. and you really don't need to trick them into a felony.|`|f65fe6708c96316f9a9cb1729c261f7baa	go to glamgirl.com<br>  wear cute make up<br>  and style your hair wavyyy!

I know NUMEROUS very religious people that have tattoos or hang around tattooed people. Tattoos are NOT a bad thing. They are an art form. They don't mean you're an evil or bad person.<br>  <br>  I'm a good,moral person and have 2 small tattoos. So what? Do what you want! Don't let some religion dictate your life!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Nope I don't think its bad at all. Actually a lot of people take the bible out of context.<br>  <br>  I believe it is your body you should be free to do what you want with it.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Leviticus actually can be taken out of context as many do. If you read the Bible thoroughly, the Lord was talking about people tatting up tributes to false idols on them. I have told people that the Lord would probably only get angry with you over a tattoo these days if it were "Praise Allah" or "There is no God." I have a gaurdian angel, a wrist tattoo of the crown of thorns, a cross, and "Saved" written on me.|`|Jwh5enUCaa	Nope, I think it is a personal choice. I so not see religion an issue. Do not let society norms effect your choice. If You question it at all your not ready for one. I this for life. I love mine and never thought twice about it.|`|chfILbonaa	Tatoos are a form of art and art isnt bad some can be innapropriate but it dont mean a bad thing|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	Well first of all the lord never had any tattoos unless you mean this in a figurative way lol. Anyways I believe it depends on the nature of the tattoos and if they are respecting your body and who you are as a person. It seems to me that your tattoos are respecting who you are as a person, so that's fine. Yea your body is a temple, but that could mean numerous things both  literal as well as figurative. What I dont personally like though is when people tattoo the entirety of their body, thats just gross to me and thats not respecting your body and the beauty of ones own flesh!|`|Awblj4Dqaa	No, I do not believe that tattoo's are a bad thing if you're religious.  I myself have 9 tattoos, each of which have some special meaning to me.  I am a Christian and I believe that not only is my body God's temple but it's my own.  And if you look at your body as a temple, don't religious places have paintings and sculptures inside everywhere you look?<br>  <br>  On the contrary however, I would think it odd for someone to be religious and have a huge demon tattoo on them...that's kind of hmm..what do you call it....oxymoron maybe?  <br>  <br>  I dont know who said anything to you about tattoos being a "nonreligious" thing or whatever, probably because it's marking up your body....but turn it around....tanning beds "mark" your body, piercings "mark" your body....the list goes on and on...everyone has their own way of "decorating" themselves|`|hXQBbOlvaa	I am a devout Christian and I honor God in everything that I do, including getting my two tattoos.

9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	People need to cater to their bodies. If you have a bigger body, do not wear skinny jeans. Something that starts off semi-slim at the top but flares out as it goes down is better.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	None.

When i first got it pierced it didnt hurt just swelled and was that way for about 4 days. I was still able to eat regular food even tho they said not too. As long as you use the sea salt like they give you and clean you mouth you will be okay.  My friend at work took hers out a couple months ago and it is healed you cant even tell it was there, and yes if you take it out, it will close within hours maybe even minutes.
3bf853eb6eadae5d5e3c2aa99854d383aa	how exactly does this "discoloration" look like? is it dark and kinda like a scab? does it flake and get red? i think u might have what i do. unfortunately my dermatologist had a hard time diagnosing it.|`|cvRscoQ3aa	do you drool when you sleep? Because sometimes when you drool your drool stays around your mouth area for a while causing your skin around your mouth to look kind of crusty/dirty and it stays there for a while even if you wash it. If this is why, then you should scrub the area pretty well everyday.|`|YoNMn90Maa	I have something similar at the edges of my mouth so it always seems though I have milk chocolate at the corners.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, it's just annoying but mine never got darker or changed at all. No dermatologist has ever said anything to me about it.
oWLO6SiKaa	Mine doesn't grow fast, because it doesnt grow at all (i don't do anything to it). Just go back to waxing it, or leave it. Forget what stupid society says about being completely hairless.<br>  As for the cheeks, that's completely normal. If you'll notice, alot of people's hair shows like golden in the sunlight. Leave that, definetely.|`|i8cFHtUzaa	I do not reccomend waxing your face. It's a normal type of hair, though the amount varies from person to person quite easily.<br>  <br>  As for the lip, I wax mine, because whenever I use nair, it would burn and then blister my upper lip (Even when i left it on for like, only 30 seconds). Plus, waxing is the surefire way to get it all off.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I actually use a men's electric shaver.  Being of Hispanic ethnicity, I practically have a mustache and Nair just irritates my skin.  I have to shave my "peach fuzz" as well and have found that waxing and chemicals just make things worse.  As long as I apply moisturizer after shaving, the electric razor works out really well.  My fiance makes fun of it, but at least I don't have to go out in public with a beard!|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Mine is only noticeable in the sunlight, too. I ignore it and so does  everyone I come into contact with. <br>  <br>  The facial hair that bugs me is the periodic solo thick, black hair that grows  out of my chin. With that one, I wrap the hair around my finger and yank that baby out... until the next time it appears... and then I yank it out again.|`|hzxplycYaa	Who the f-ck EVER said to SHAVE YOUR LIPS is a complete idiot!! It'll grow out faster than waxing and in no time, you'll have a nice patch of 'stache. Mines don't grow out fast, it's barely noticeable. EVERYone has hair on their upper lips. I just pluck mines out with a tweezer at times. I don't understand why everyone is pretending to be so grossed out? They probably have as much as a man themselves. And stop waxing. The more you do, the faster and thicker hair will grow out to be. If you have thin white hair on your cheeks that is barely noticeable, LEAVE IT ALONE!! You DON'T want a hairy face!! Nair's was probably a bad choice. I suggest leaving it alone for a while and pluck it several times a month. Use some foundation or powder to cover it up a little bit.|`|VOEvsE6aaa	its not disgusting. as long as its not noticeable and black. its normal. dyk (besides lips eyes etc) hair grows all over your body except your hands and the soles of your feet. <br>  i learnt from an epad (permanent hair removal) booklet that you have lots of hair folicles and that they fall out and grow out of another folicle. so, that means that about every 8 weeks, the same hair comes back. so , its just that the hair on your toplip is very regenerative and quickly.<br>  <br>  dont nair it (if you mean nair hair removal) use nair cream bleach. it lightens hairs and its about $13 and it lasts for months. just redo it every 2 weeks. available from chemists and supermarkets. or try epen epad. visit www.verseo.com and check the country site to make sure its yours.<br>  <br>  kk|`|QZnekv7aaa	NOOOO!!! Don't wax your face. I bought Smooth Away the other day and oh my Jesus it works. I wasn't hopeful when I first tried it because I know how most as seen on TV things work, but it worked! You just have to use it lightly and not burn yourself.<br>  As for my upper lip. Wax is fine by me, then tweeze the left overs it's just the easiest.|`|BlfjbHysaa	I don't have hair on my lip, but it's no reason to call someone else disgusting.

3cGgRo42aa	I have honestly not seen a Caucasian ulzzang. Ulzzangs are mainly found in Asia and I think that's why. I've currently tried the make-up (dude, I have tiny eyes, no joke) for ulzzang girls and  i l o v e it. Screw what other people think. Go for it. You can run around shouting "I'm the first white ulzzang! Fuhkk you, I'm cute!^_^" Just be aware you're going to have to act uber cute and childish. Nice anime-ish hair works well with the look and circle lenses/huge-asz eyes are like the center-point of ulzzang so make sure you have that (if you don't know what circle lenses are, look it up).<br>  <br>  p.s. Sorry if I'm stereotyping or whatever, but white people generally have bigger eyes than us (Asians) right? If you got those special contacts, you're eyes would be hellaa huge! *I suggest the blue or black (yes, * black) ones.|`|ukOgOplCaa	jeez, no need to be so agressive.<br>  <br>  i have never seen a white uzzlang boy before, but i am sure that if that is what somebody wants to be, they could do it.|`|9HnYjw3Aaa	NO. Ulzzang is just an illusion. In reality, all they are is a bunch of self-absorbed, superficial asian guys and girls that slather on a mountain of eyeliner and makeup, spray on a whole bottle of hairspray, and take pictures from odd angles and photo shop everything in order to become myspace celebrities. Don't even waste your time.

yogS60O3aa	Sally Beauty Supply<br>  <br>  <br>  I bought mine there, love it :)<br>  They have it in stock at the store, or you can get it off their website, and I'll list other sites for you too.  <br>  <br>  ps- It really helps to get a beauty club card, especially if you find yourself buying more polish hehe, it's addicting!  Their colors and formula is awesome.  The card is only $5.00, lasts a whole year, you get an instant $5.00 coupon for next months purchase (so it pays for itself), and you save so much off products!  All China Glaze polishes would only be $3.25 with a card instead of $5.99.  Cool huh?  Just a tip!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|dckhOavsaa	Sally Beauty Supply was what I was going to say, until I saw that the girl above me beat me to the punch! :)<br>  However, I also can suggest that you purchase it at a nail salon. Nail salons tend to retail polishes in the brands they use, which typically include China Glaze. You know what I mean? Ever notice the big glass case most salons have of untouched polish? Lol.<br>  Another solution may be to look for it online- maybe you can find it really, really cheap.
Ip2Z6nesaa	If your mom won't let you lose products as in Proactiv or Murad or anything like that, try seeing if she'll let you put food and natural oils on your face. A mask that has healed a woman's acne cysts, acne scars, has made her skin firmer and silky smooth is this:<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1/2 avocado<br>  1 teaspoon sunflower oil<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  1. Put the avocado and the oil in the bowl. <br>  2. Mash the former with the latter. <br>  3. Apply the mixture to your face and neck. <br>  4. Make sure you avoid the eyes and lips area. <br>  5. Leave it on for 10 minutes. <br>  6. Wash off with warm water. <br>  7. This mask helps to moisturize the skin. <br>  8. Enjoy!<br>  <br>  This one kind of burns your face, and leaves it red for a little bit. One woman said that she had redness for 15 minutes after removing the mask, but after 30 minutes it was completely gone and her face was very smooth and looked better than it did before she used the mask. <br>  <br>  What I use is Freeman "Feeling Beautiful" Facial Clay Mask Avocado and Oatmeal. Your mom might consider it a "product" since it comes in a bottle, but it uses what it says, a little extra ingredients, and some coloring. This one burns in the beginning, but it goes away once it's drying. It purges your pores and leaves your skin smooth and soft. It also makes redness go away. I bought it especially since it has clay, since clay is good for acne.|`|AA10638471	I have two home remedies. I tried one last night and it worked wonders for my face.<br>  <br>  Its a sugar scrub. I know it doesn't seem like it would work but it does. I've done research. Anyway, here's the recipe:<br>  <br>  2 tablespoons EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil<br>  2 tablespoons of honey<br>  2 cups of sugar.<br>  <br>  I suggest don't put in as much sugar as it will be grainy. As with mine, I put some water on my hands when I used it last night and it worked better. It leaves your face smooth and has a glow. It got rid of two of my zits. The other one is smaller than it was.<br>  <br>  Another one is an Aspirin scrub. It also has a glow. My friend has used it. It worked wonders and she had horrible acne. Beware, aspirin is a form of salicylic acid and for me, it dries out my skin. Here's the recipe:<br>  <br>  ---5 to 10 of plain aspirin- (the cheap generic kind is just fine)<br>  ---Crush aspirin tablets into a fine powder<br>  ---Mix in your favorite fruit acid, freshly squeezing the juice from a lemon, lime, or orange<br>  ---To use as an aspirin scrub make a thickish paste using only a few teaspoons of the fruit juice<br>  ---For a refreshing aspirin toner use a least 1/3 cup of fruit juice to make a thin solution that can easily saturate a cotton ball<br>  <br>  A dairy product can be substituted for the fruit acid or used in combination with the basic aspirin facial recipe for the oilier skin types.<br>  <br>  -Adrienne|`|J6Tdrd8Xaa	In short you can't because it's a hormonal condition.

Wn0Hj7H4aa	It's gonna hurt --how much depends on "where" it's being placed-and your pain tolerance-but -remember-and meaning NO disrespect - a lot of employers and others equate tattoo's with "bimbo'ism-so be prepared. It costs lots of $$$ to undo what you are about to do.Peace|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Eat and sleep well the day of and the day before.<br>  Don't be too nervous, there isn't anything to be nervous about...you will see once it's over. :)<br>  Make sure what you pick out has a lot of meaning. You are already on the right track by wanting something you would want to look at years from now. <br>  Needles from the doctor and tattoo needles aren't exactly the same thing. They even feel different. They aren't bad. Once you get used to the feeling...it will be easier to get through. Depending on your pain tolerance...you should be fine. I sat through a 4 hour tattoo (for my first tattoo) and was fine. The only time it hurt was during the forth hour and he kept rubbing the area. It got really sensitive. It really doesn't hurt. It's more annoying than anything else. The only time it hurts really, is when the needles are on your skin, but even then it should be alright. Once he/she takes it off the skin it doesn't hurt. So hang in there.<br>  <br>  You need to BREATHE during the tattoo. My brother kept holding his breath and didn't relax...so it hurt more. So breathe as normal as you can and relax. Don't tense up too much. It will be over before you know it. Good Luck. Enjoy it!! I'm about to get another 3-4 hours of work this month. I can't wait!! =) I'm actually looking forward to the whole process again...so it's really not that bad at all.|`|ppX0xoeFaa	When you get a tattoo,you have to remove if you don`t like any more.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	First make sure it's an artist that can be trusted (so you don't have to watch him) <br>  Then get a book or something and zone out, if you don't look at it it doesn't hurt as bad. <br>  <br>  Don't drink before the tattoo (it makes you bleed more)<br>  Don't take aspirin before the tattoo (makes you bleed more)<br>  Try and pick a part of your body that doesn't move as easily. (I did my inner calf and he practically had to sit on my foot cause it kept twitching involuntarily) Twitching makes it hurt worse JIC I need to state the obvious<br>  <br>  If you hold still properly it doesn't feel much different than if you were to take a fingernail and scratch the skin good and hard. (Like when you were a kid and people would do the strawberry patch thing on your arm).. at least they did that when I was a kid|`|2JerJwCcaa	Just get it. It is a different kind of kick. You will love it. If a girl, go for a:<br>  1. Star<br>  2. Butterfly<br>  3. Fairy<br>  4. Dragon<br>  If a boy, recommend:<br>  1. Dragon<br>  2. Snake<br>  3. Scorpion<br>  At a later stage, if you don't wan it, just erase by laser. Finally, it hurts - at the time of doing it and during the recovery time of 1 week. To reduce the pain, to begin with, suggest you select a stronger skin area, like biceps, ankle, shoulder etc.|`|zCakedeXaa	trust me it hurts but a fun kinda pain, yea it sounds crazy but once they get going you can barely feel it you go numb quick.  its a annoying pain not a hurting pain.  i had to lay on my face for 5 hours when i got one, i feel asleep some proff that it doesn't hurt that bad, that or i am just weird.|`|tGVp5fyJaa	try not to worry about it - the more relaxed you are the less it hurts|`|Er6uwEmRaa	don't think about the pain and maybe that will help you get through it better!|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	I HATE needles but somehow I managed to get 3 tattoos done. My first tattoo was of my cat. I figured even if I wind up hating her years down the road- I KNOW why I would get it “now”. She is almost 6 years old and my tattoo is 4 years old. I am still glad I have it. I also have 2 tattoos for my son whom passed away. They are things I wont regret- because they have special meaning to them and TRUST me- it  was a lot easier to get it done with the idea of something that really mattered in my head. The past 2 I got for my son hurt soooo bad that if it wasn’t for me saying “I am doing this for my son” over and over- I wouldn’t have finished them! Lol<br>   Try to think of something you have always liked or enjoyed- for me it was cats. But I wanted that one in particular. Maybe lyrics that mean A LOT to you- just a few. <br>  I had the writing of my sons name done by my own handwriting and HIS foot prints so it makes it even more special.<br>  You will get used to the pain after so much time passes. But TRUST ME- totally worth it.<br>  Just be careful WHERE you get your first one done- if it is somewhere sensitive and hurts TOO much- you will NOT want more. :)  Make SURE you check the tattoo artists work to make sure you like what they have already done!!!!! :)<br>  Hope this helps some. Also- I am not someone who uses prescription drugs or alcohol on a daily or even monthy basis- BUT you might want to think for you first tattoo to take something. I took 2 thing. I took Tylenol 3s left over from a tooth being pulled. Just don’t ACT sleepy ?<br>  lol. :) HELPED A LOT with the pain. And DON’T get it somewhere ticklish!! OMG nothing worse than you jumping from the ticklish area (no it doesn’t tickle to have it done) but when you have it done on a ticklish area your nerves react and jump- NOT good when someone had a needle!!! lol<br>  Also- I will say- something UNIQUE is SOOOOO much better when NO ONE else has what you have- or VERY few. :)<br>  SOOOO much cooler to go- thats MY tattoo- then not- hey- thats half the worlds tattoo! lol :)
ksXayEUoaa	Blow Dry<br>  <br>  Then use a 1" flat iron with gold color plates. (Got mine from Target for around $12 and it's perfect!)<br>  <br>  Tiny bit of 360 pomade.

If that doesn't work, get your hair thinned out, that way you won't have to deal with the thickness of your hair. Then just wait till it grows out and then start straightening it
ddXQeEvNaa	Go with whatever has little to no sulfate. The brands with the most are Pantene, Herbal Essences, Sauve, and Garnier Fructise, Try the drugstore's natural brands, a lot of them carry them now. Also, Aussie's Cleanse and Mend is amazing. It has a thick, rich lather and smells like a big *** orange. Make sure to get a nice conditioner too. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. I don't like Paul Mitchell either.  Certain types of alcohol are actually used to make nutrients stick to your hair better.

I'm pretty sure there are some regular shampoos and conditioners that are comparable to professional shampoos and conditioners. I heard Dove and Nexxus are really good. In fact, I'm thinking of switching from Biolage ("professional" brand) to Nexxus. <br>  <br>  I do agree with your hairdresser that Pantene is the worse. It made my hair really dry and straw-like...But it also depends on hair. My friend just recently switched to Pantene and she loves it. Still, I think Pantene is the worse shampoo that you could use.<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  Head and Shoulder is AWESOME!

Dreads are awesome!<br>  <br>  Don't listen to those people, this is the most ridiculously anti-dread website I've ever seen.

You'll learn a lot.|`|Okrs9Qjfaa	I like dreads. I think that you need to have longer hair to pull it off, but you could.

I have seen dreads actually not look so bad on people. If you are pretty(which you are) you can pull of almost anything.. But no promises it will look good.. But the thing is YOU WILL NEVER KNOW TILL YOU TRY. So even if people are saying NO it will look bad and stuff.. If you feel like it will look good and you really want to try it then do it, you can ALWAYS go back to the way you were. Same as if you cut your hair short and regret it, you they made extensions to help. If you dye your hair and it looks bad you can always go back. So take the risk, You only live once, so live it how ya want and do what ya want!

zlXofrG4aa	Your body is unique.  It will react to certain things and not react to others.  I can't tell you how your body is going to react to the pill.<br>  I've been on three different types of birth control and none of them have made me gain weight, all of them have helped (not cleared, just helped) my acne, and uh I don't think I've ever experienced mood swings because of the pill.  Ortho tri cyclen gave me awful stomach pains for 3 months though, but that was my second time on it.  The first time I didn't notice anything so maybe my body became immune to it or hated it idk.<br>  You won't know until you try it.|`|3Xibw7ALaa	I took it for 2 months, and my last time using it was last thursday.<br>  It gave me BAD BAD BAD cramps, but on the good side, my period became regular and light.<br>  I can say it works, as I'm not pregnant yet :p<br>  Also, it came with the seven day placebo's, which is convenient because your still in the habit everyday, even though you dont need those seven pills. Not all Birth control pill packs have that.<br>  I think in most places, if you're 21 and younger, you can get free birth control from your clinic.<br>  I got 3 packs for free.<br>  Also, its suggested you eat with it, so you dont feel light headed. This never happened to me, but if varies from person to person. I definitely had major mood swings, and the info paper says it would clear up my acne, but i actually got more acne. ( probably not from the pill, but i was staying out late, and keeping makeup on for too long) <br>  I'm not sure if it's worth the cramps, but effective in preventing pregnancy, and keeping your period regular & light :)|`|YoNMn90Maa	*My experience was 14 years ago*<br>  <br>  I used these pills for only ONE month and it has screwed up my skin ever since.<br>  <br>  I gained 8 pounds, total mood swings and received a beard of acne that lasted for two years and still get cystic acne because of it.<br>  <br>  Worst experience of my life.|`|mGDlujUsaa	It caused me to go into depression. When we talked to my doctor she said this was common sometimes.|`|ddXQeEvNaa	It cleared up my acne but I gained so much weight. Took about a month to put it on, and 6 months to work it off.

RN7NzeCsaa	you all look nice but if i had to choose one i'd say 3!|`|BYHRjUa6aa	I think you all look the same. In the last pic, whoever it is, is wearing too much eye makeup. The girl in first pic is cute, and I really like the girl in the second pic's hair. All in all, being pretty, pure, and caring on the inside is really what matters. (:|`|9gKGCPwOaa	1|`|scHA4BX2aa	3<br>  she is relly gorgeous.|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	WHY CANT YOU POST A PIC WITHOUT THE STUPID EXPRESSIONS?

I wish I had perfect hair like you guys :/|`|zmlUjx5Taa	They all look the same 1, 2, && 2. <br>  Except 1 & 3 have bigger lips.<br>  One is the pretty because she has big gorgeous eyes, but i can't tell anything more because of her expression.<br>  But 3 is probably the prettiest because her features are perfect, althought i can't tell between 1 or 3 as much because 1 is making that expression but i would say 3 because of that(:|`|3dd29054af547958045124a726786d7baa	number one and three are very pretty. id have to say number one, you are all very gorgeous. and i agree with chelseamarie, less is better|`|67wM6jM2aa	1 and 2 look kind of the same, but i would say that #3 stands out more... maybe a little less make up, no offense.<br>  <br>  you are all very pretty(:|`|a0HzJSobaa	the first one looks better<br>  just looks more alive<br>  <br>  the 3 one is kinda scarry sorry|`|Pd0L0Jqdaa	Number 3|`|xDEYAUwGaa	1|`|ESwxC9iHaa	3|`|q0PwbO6caa	i love all of your hair :)
Rneb8IjLaa	buy the right color, and it will work.|`|nKrPTYLpaa	if you want to go lighter, you should go to a professional. they will "strip" out the color in your hair, so you will have a clean base, and then dye your hair the new color that you want. this way, the shade will turn out the way it's supposed to be. i've tried to dye my hair from light brown to blonde, and it came out an orangy color, like yours did.|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	yeah.. you gotta be careful when dying hair.. I've heard lots about how it turns orange... call a local hair stylist.. that's my suggestion.<br>  <br>  I have light brown hair, pretty thick and I wanted to dye it deep burgandy then put highlights in it.. it worked...<br>  <br>  However, when my natural color started to come back in 3 months or so later, my hair was showing an orange tint.  Weird.|`|vqM01n5gaa	They only way to lighten your hair is with bleach you can't lighten naturally black hair to light brown with dye. I would go to a pro if you want it lightened. Home DIY hair bleach tends too look brassy.|`|YalCuQDPaa	Try bleaching it and then dying it a light brown;<br>  <br>  OR sorry to say this but you may need to unfortunately by a real expensive proper one...  ;P<br>  <br>  If I was in your situation I would go to the hairdressers.. they will do it all for you   (:<br>  <br>  hope i helped  (:
dqB2LBLwaa	yupp y nt but see to it ur hair color is ammonia free|`|oAGvwYY8aa	No.<br>  you can only dye your hair darker.<br>  You will have to go get your hair stripped or bleach bath to get it lighter then dye it light brown

J8tYQZ4gaa	yes it sounds like you do need a b your cup size should fit comfortably underneath your breast and not rise|`|SCTkHr7saa	i'd say move on up to the 32 B. it all depends on the store and what the store's sizing is. i'm a 32B in some stores, and then in other stores im up to a cup size bigger! it just all depends. seems to me like you're cup size should be bigger because you're bras shouldn't be moving up.<br>  <br>  <br>  welcome to the "B" club. :p|`|1pxKM9Buaa	the bras you buy at victorias secret, i would get in 32B since they're professionals and you got the fitting done.<br>  <br>  (yeah the size now seems too small)<br>  try both sizes (30/32 A/B)<br>   see which feel more comfortable & the cups dont move. try measuring your cup sizes yourself, and on most bras they have instuctions on how to do it. (im not exactly sure which measurements are which/how to... or i would tell you)<br>  <br>   (:|`|9NSfJChaaa	Go to a good lingerie department like Macy's or Dillards and have them measure you.  Victoria's Secret is not a good place to go for a fitting.  Their goal is to size you and then fit you in their bras, and their bras only.  <br>  <br>  And remember that all bra styles and brands fit differently... you'll have to experiment and see what fits you best.|`|s8Wwk7H7aa	If the cups are moving up, it is usually because your cup size is too small.  Even if your band fits perfectly, your breasts literally will push the cups away.  I had the same problem with a size C.  I moved up a cup size and my bras fit perfectly.<br>  <br>  Of course, all bras are different.  The best thing still is to try on both sizes when you purchase bras.|`|cJd4SRL9aa	If they told you that you need a different size at VS<br>  I'd trust them
YW74O9aNaa	Well ... put a specific question about something and people will answer.

Whenever I've had my hair done they style it for you so it looks really nice afterward. If you cover your hair in a hair towel and put a shower cap over that and take a bath instead of a shower you can usually get a good 4 days out of your hair style.|`|AA12050428	Oh Yes you will WANT  to go to town. You feel great. All brightened up.

MR9iBgafaa	If you buy your perfume, buy the body spray, cream and talc to go with it. It's called layering and will last longer.  If you use an 'eau de parfum' it will last longer as it is more concentrated, so go easy with the spraying. Just your neck, wrist and behind your ears.  if you are using 'eau de toilette' then the scent is weaker. You can spray your clothes and hair, but take it easy.|`|5881d0db3420625300aecd1cf7107d5daa	To the answerer a few people above, what does weight have to do with smell?!<br>  I would recommend Lush shower stuff, it smells gorgeous and I can still smell it on me ages after. And don't wear too much perfume because you don't want it to be overpowering. You could try finding some decent perfume though, most of the celebrity ones are full of synthetic stuff designed to smell nice straight away but then they fade really quickly :(|`|l8G6OnNYaa	Rock and rose by valentino is a lovely smell and the smell lasts for a day and maybe even longer than that!!! It is lovely and recommended. spray it on yourself and clothes xxxx|`|GBSO1Efraa	go to bath and body works and use their body cream and the smell last for the whole day.  Body cream is thicker then regular lotion and it feel better and works better.|`|aDQCs2yAaa	you dont smell it because you smell it constantly... like the countryside air, you probably have a natural odor but because it is the normal smell you do not smell it obi|`|uvFm2Dfwaa	Three steps to smelling nice everyday.<br>  <br>  #1.

I've been told that I have a naturally pleasant smell.|`|vhXbGB8naa	Take showers with strong, good smelling scents. <br>  I spray my perfume on my shirt and my hair, because those will hold the scents the longest. You get to used to the smell, but others will notice it.<br>  I like most of bath and body works scents.=)
Drg3bLjUaa	I would say do your make up to match your outfit, for example if you are wearing a green top do something like this....<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLycBIDgeoo&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLycBIDge...</a> (minus the glitter on the eyebrows!)<br>  <br>  <br>  if you are wearing a funky colour outfit such as shiny leggings & a brightly coloured top then try something like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOF8BveUAc&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOF8BveU...</a><br>  <br>  I would be careful trying to age yourself with make up...just relish in the fact you have a youthful look and take your proof of age with you!!! <br>  <br>  have a great night!|`|RvvCNk1jaa	Do NOT use blue shadow. It makes eyes look older, sure, but that's because they look tired. I couldn't really tell you exactly where to go for colours unless I knew your skin tone and hair colour, except not to go with most blues and certain purples. They make eyes look tired because they bring out the purples and blues under your eyes, giving the appearance of eye bags(except for green eyes, in which case purple is okay). If you wanted to use blue liner or mascara, make it either navy or bright, not in between. For shadow, smokey grey or black is a great trick for everyone, and shimmery browns and tans do wonders for your eyes. I would personally go with black mascara and eyeliner, though, no matter what eyeshadow colours you use. It makes eyes pop, and large eyes are absolutely perfect for that. You want to define your large eyes, not hide them. On another note, to look older you should use a lip colour slightly darker than your natural lip colour so as to not look childish or like you're trying too hard.|`|519Cs3Tyaa	this is a great question.an easy way to make up your eyes and make you look older is to do a smoky eye look with blush and lips that coordinate the best way to do a great smoky eye is to go onto youtube and paste this :   SMOKY EYE MAKEUP TUTORIAL for blue eyed babes                into the search engine this is a great tutorial I've used it many time before. Browse the other videos if you don't like that one. Either way there's hundreds of vids for Smokey eyes looks and others. sorry about the lengthy reply hope it helps oh and ignore the  weird part at the beginning of the video:)|`|bd7qDDGPaa	you should do smokey eye. use black and greys or dark purples|`|0815e87af19ccebc311a04b81ba46cd5aa	i found that Kohl's has really nice, inexpensive makeup line. <br>  I seem to have some similar features to yours, but my eyes are really more blue.<br>  <br>  I use Licorice Delight, which is an eyeliner that is a shiny navy-blue-teal, and really brings out the blue in your eyes. I would use that for the bottom liner.<br>  <br>  on the top line, i would find a charcoal color and line your top lash line. <br>  <br>  then get the Midnight Disco cream eyeshadow (also from the Kohl's Flirt! line) and smudge some on the lid. heavier, higher up and darker on the outsides, then lighter and lower as you get closer to the inside of your eye.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest Flirt! mascara though.<br>  personally, i've learned that drugstore brands are great. for really big lashes, I love Maybelline XXL Curling mascara.(black and purple tube.) it has a primer on one end, then the mascara on the other side. <br>  <br>  hope I helped. :)|`|8iR6XOD7aa	use brown and blue shadows and a brown liner.|`|KsaaEZqHaa	Basically outline with kohl pencil, and have smoky black on the eyelids.. and have lots of mascara!|`|sSlRzn2iaa	gray eye shadow then but dark eye shadow over it then but on a black liquid eye liner on your lid and below your eye then put on non clump extra long last mascara|`|zYqHaDcmaa	Do a light greyish brownish blue mix. Lol. Then wear heavy black eyeliner. And some glitter. Add some black mascara. You will look great!
Izbp5nLBaa	ok so im going to tell you what to tell her, im 18 and i have had my eyebrow as well as my lip pierced, let me just say they leave scars and your skin is never the same again it take forever for the scars to leave and go away,another thing is that when you are looking for a job,most places wont call you back for an interview because of metal in your mouth and on your face, ok i can under stand if they are hidden but still,after awhile you get sick of whatever kinda pierced you have and you end up taking it out which leave holes and scars, she might think that its going to heal but it does not,you can have infections that will cause more ugly scars,i have learned my lesion about them, like i said before just talk to her about jobs and trying to get one and how it leaves scars, keep saying no if she wants them because you are the mother, if she wants anything she will have to wait until she is 18 when she does not need a parent to sign the paper|`|CI9J6x3daa	Wekk I am 14.  I think that thet are simply tacky and down right disgusting.  Nose rings, lip rings, eyebrow rings ( i think thats what there called idk) Anything like that is just plain tacky.  I have my ears periced and that is it.  Though when im older I do want a belly button ring.  I might not even get one cause that is even tacky.  <br>  Just tell her that it will ruin her Beautiful face and leave scars and that people wont take her seriously.  That it juts doesnt look right and isnt appropriate.|`|W5EDjfIqaa	well for nose peircing tell her that the hole gets really saggy when your older and when you sneeze it comes out of that hole thats what my principal did and yuck <br>  and just tell her it gets saggy and gross cause they are gross|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You can't.<br>  She's a teenager.<br>  But just know that she can't get a piercing(professionally) without your permission.|`|YfjTbJBbaa	Use an example like her friends...<br>  "Do they have piercings?"<br>  OR<br>  "What about the cool kids in school.Do THEY have piercings.If they don't...look at where they are now WITHOUT piercings..."|`|24sK6L2uaa	Just tell her she can't get one. Don't use the my house my rules or those sayings those are annoying.|`|c5anDswjaa	Well just because YOU dont think theyre cool, it doesnt mean everyone will.. Some how, I doubt she will dislike them if you show her pictures of all the things can go wrong, she will just be like "Well that wont happen to me!".. Just tell her until she is 18 shes going to have to do without.. And make sure you check her every so often, these kids are desperate nowadays and will pierce themselves with sewing needles then try and hide it lol|`|16vMIGPiaa	Hon, I hear that you'd like to get your daughter's buy-in on decisions, but *You* are the Mom.  Children do not run the world.  If your answer is "No" then stick to that.  She'll get over the sulks about the time she discovers some other fashion.|`|O7xYvttsaa	sorry, but you're not gonna be able to. she's at the age where if she thinks something's cool, and her mom doesnt, then she's gonna think its even cooler. i know you don;t want to, but i would just not fight it, and let her get her piercing, but if it starts to get crazy, like she wants to start getting tatoos and MORE piercings, then i would draw the line. but one peircing wouldn't hurt.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	You should also point out to her that in many states one can not get body piercings as a minor. Here, Georgia, I believe that it is illegal even with a parent's consent. So not 18, no piercings. And I really like the idea of find a couple of pictures of old people with bad piercings. Look for before and after plastic surgery shots where someone has had to have plastic surgery to correct problems caused by piercings. Oh yeah and tongue and cheek piercings have the added non benefit of breaking teeth.|`|ltqUpAKhaa	You dont have to convince her they are uncool; you are the parent, she is the child. If you dont want her to have one, she doesnt get one, end of discussion.  If she doesnt like it, tough cookies.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	Find a picture of an old person with a whole bunch of them or just some horrific picture of someone with piercings. Maybe it'll scare her.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	As long as she's not doing drugs, let her do what she wants to do. <br>  <br>  However, if you're REALLY that much against it, google some pictures of facial piercings that have gone bad and let her see them. She may change her mind.<br>  <br>  On a side note, my brother had his eye brow pierced when he was 18. He's 31 now and has a scar on his eye brow from it. He gets CONSTANT questions about "what's wrong?".<br>  <br>  On another side note, my best friend had her belly button pierced 15 years ago. She now has 3 kids. You should see the hole in her belly button. Yeah, not cool.<br>  <br>  Try to convince your daughter of what it may look like in the future!|`|JQKADWyzaa	Show her pictured of infected ones!!!<br>  It's gross and ruins some faces forever.<br>  Don't tell her flat out no, at fourteen they'll just go against you and do it in an unsafe way!<br>  The best thing you could do is compromise, like maybe a cartilage of your ear or something.<br>  <br>  I can't even tell you the amount of people who regret it, I'm only in my senior year of high school and i know tons of kids who had peircings and regret the scars it gave them!|`|GzL8X6vTaa	I am 23 and I have two kids.<br>  <br>  This is what I personally think. <br>  <br>  You could let her get one and see how she likes it.<br>  It is just a hole and if all else fails she can take it out and it will close.<br>  It is not permanent, it's not like it is a tattoo you have to be willing to flex a little to show your kids that you are trying to understand.|`|D3rfzhL9aa	Nathan's way will probably work...<br>  Try telling her the downs-they could get ripped out, infected, leave permanent scars, leave an ugly hole when you take the jewelry out, will not look good when she tries to get a good job...etc.<br>  Or just tell her to wait til she's 18 and see how she feels.  You can't stop her forever, unfortunately.|`|9it5nGJjaa	You can't because it's impossible for it to NOT be cool. Seriously, she's not connected to your umbilical cord any more. The second she turns into an adult, she'll be making her own choices; most of the time without your help.|`|aVFyG1n7aa	Show her some nasty pictures of what happens to infected piercings, blow outs, and scars they leave behind. If she wants them bad enough, the images won't bother her.|`|0iiKq3sjaa	You really can't. If you say they're uncool as her mother, she'll think they are that much more appealing. If you are against the idea, do not let her get one.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	Get one yourself and show up at her school with it.  She would be embarrassed to get one then.
JcwjDpY8aa	Yes.  If you aren't aware, this is one of the most popular styles.<br>  <br>  All it is, is a bunch of very short layers cut into long hair.  The look is entirely the style and not so much the cut- so it really depends on if you know how to style it correctly.  There are actually videos on youtube.com that make it simple.<br>  <br>  The girls hair is thin in the picks.  She has teased her hair to make it appear thick but it is easy to tell it normally isnt.|`|h9gag6hOaa	if you hair is thin i dont think it will be possible, i mean its possible but it wont look like that.... If you get extensions you could probably make it look like that... im not a professional or anything its just that girls hair looks thick|`|uGWJaMT2aa	Maybe not exactly like that, but they can probably get it pretty close :D

BvjPU3wkaa	Getting yourself off on the right path by finding yourself a skin care regime that is going to work for you and your skin type is incredibly important. Keeping your face clean and moisturized is going to keep it looking great for years to come.<br>  <br>  As for makeup I would suggest keeping it simple and very natural.  You're at an age where you more than likely have beautiful skin so there's no need to wear things like foundation.  A bit of concealer and a translucent setting powder can go along way to conceal the odd blemish.  Steer clear of any sort of liners as they are just going to weigh down the appearance of your eyes. Other than that I would suggest mascara and a nice lip gloss.  Wearing pale and natural looking shadows every once in a while is another idea.

sMABbl71aa	Some hair produces oils much faster than other hair. I would suggest putting a little bit of baby powder in your hair, lots of girls do that at my cosmetology school to prevent their hair from looking oily. Add a little to the palms of your hands and rub it into your scalp to absorb the oil. You can add more as needed. If it gets on your face just take a blow dryer on low and dry it away.|`|0VHKslYPaa	In your case, I would advise you to wash your hair everyday because I know what you mean about the extremely oily hair issue. Your scalp already produces more than enough oil so I think you should wash it everyday and when you do get in the shower, put some shampoo on your scalp and let t sit for 5 minutes or so and rinse it out. Make sure you leave the concentrated product on your head. <br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure why exactly your hair tends to get so oily so fast. It could be genetic. Not sure, though.<br>  <br>  Oh and, I've heard of this stuff called hair powder or something than soaks up the oil in your hair. You may want to try it. [Kinda pricy for the good ones.] If you have like colored hair [Blond, dirty blond, etc.] then you can use plain baby powder.|`|8OMw9qtRaa	Wash your hair every day!!!!!<br>  You said that the reason you don't wash it everyday is because it will strip essential oils... well, it seems like you get plenty of great oils.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you really don't want to wash you hair everyday then you can by spray in shampoo that cleans your hair, and stuff, I've read they ork very well.|`|VjV6sfLKaa	i cant give you answer as to why, but i can help you out!<br>  theres this product called dry shampoo and its shampoo that you use with out having a shower/wetting your hair. you just spritz it in the roots and all over and it looks as if youve just showered! you could keep a bottle in your purse and spritz some when you think its getting oily, just make a trip to the little girls room. it works great btw.<br>  <br>  here are some different brands from sephora, but you could probably look other places too! good luck!|`|MHD7HuOhaa	this is going to sound strange but it works I've tried it! blow dry your hair, then after it's completely dry brush bleached white flour though it. it soaks up oils. Oh and make sure don't have white powder spots, ya know, like Granny. Above all KEEP YOUR HANDs OUT OF YOUR HAIR:)<br>  Mary|`|8vo6CRhZaa	try a dry shampoo that you can use throughout the day, baby powder also soaks up oil in hair, try using a heavier shampoo or talk to your doctor to get a perscription shampoo, or if you have to wash a shampoo try something gentle like baby shampoo
AA11853568	It's best not to cut your cuticles. The cuticle is to keep bacteria from entering your body, so it’s best to keep it where it is. But you must groom them. You need is a good cuticle remover to soften the cuticle and an orange stick.|`|u6Uky2Meaa	Never cut your cuticle off, you can push this down to speed up the growth of your nail but never cut it off.|`|zlXofrG4aa	No don't get rid of the cuticle!

f7gnRwcfaa	i totally know how you feel!<br>  <br>  my hair used to be sooo super damaged from swimming and heating it a lot... i was born with super-straight hair (i'm asian) but after all the damage and msitreatment to it it became like an afro, sort of.... thats how frizzy it was. but after using these products, and taking better care of my hair... its conditions are getting a lot better and i can see it straightening out. =D<br>  <br>  dedicate one day a week to deep condition your hair. i use burt's bees deep conditioner, you can get it for $8. it makes your hair feel soo soft! plus its good for repairing your hair and preventing future frizz.<br>  <br>  and the days you don't deep condition, use BIOSILK SILK THERAPY. I love this stuff. but its pretty expensive, like maybe $30 a bottle. this wil make your hair shiny, soft, and protect it from heat. I leave it on my hair overnight and by the time i wake up my hair feel's sooo silky =D<br>  <br>  hope this helped ;)|`|4EH5nGmsaa	i dont really have frizzy hair but i find that the john and freda range is very good|`|Pi16ggItaa	Nicky Clarke<br>  Smooth It Over Conditioner<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Nicky Clarke<br>  Mousse|`|Zw1rFaaUaa	Wetting your hair to calm frizzies will only make it frizzier once it dries. For the best results, shampoo & condition your hair, then squeeze your hair with a towel until it is damp. (Make sure you SQUEEZE the hair, most anything else just gives even MORE body.) Put in some smoothing serum, I find that "Superskinny" by Paul Mitchell or "S-Factor Smoothing Serum" by Tigi both work very well... but you can only find them at places like ULTA or professional salons. Then, use a round brush and hairdryer to dry your hair. Depending on whether you want a straight or curly look, you can either use a curling-iron or a flat-iron to finish it off. Good luck!|`|62z9bhRGaa	it depends what hair you have, ask your hairdresser what he or she thinks|`|5n2jp9P6aa	I have naturally curly hair and it gets SUPER frizzy if I don't use the right stuff on it!!  Just wetting it with water for me is also just a 5 minute fix...  I use Infusim 23 leave-in treatment on my hair and have not found anything that can replace it-it is the best de-frizzing product I have ever used/found!  It is kind of expensive ($6-7), but well worth it.  Infusium 23 has five different lines: Repair-ology, Frizz-ology, Moisture-ology, Color-ology, and Volume-ology.  Obviously, the Frizz-ology is the best, but I started out with the Repair-ology and that really helped.  One of my sisters has to use Head and Shoulders shampoo too, and she also uses Repair-ology Infusium to keep her hair from being frizzy and dry.  The dandruff shampoos can really dry your hair out, so you have to make sure to give them lots of moisture!  <br>  <br>  After I wash my hair and towel dry it, I put a fairly generous amount of Infusium on it, then comb it out with a wide-tooth comb.  After that, I go ahead and style it with gell and hairsprays like you normally would.  I also blow-dry my hair, so that makes it even more dry and frizzy so I have to make sure that I use Infusium so that it isn't frizzy and so that it stays healthy.<br>  <br>  I hope this will work for you as well as it did for me!  Good luck!

GfT2Fs0vaa	Okay that is a deep side part and the littler section has three french braids with long red ribbons braided into the braids. One in each braid. Then when off the scalp the braid continues but the ribbon is let free. Before that it looks like it was secure with a small rubber band to hold shape and make it look popped out a bit so it doesn't just fall and disappear.Cute it looks like this hair style I wore when i dressed Gothic for Halloween one time. But in stead of ribbons i sued Black hair extensions and did the whole front in stead of parting in and doing a small section.|`|AA10145591	id call it the " alicia keys". look up some pics from her earlier albums and you'll see it. its her signature style|`|vqM01n5gaa	It looks like cornrows.

Try searching for partial cornrows or cornrow hairstyles.|`|nWP3zCBIaa	I haven't seen any pics like that but I do love that hair style. When you want to explain it just say that the hair is parted in the middle and left hanging down straight but on the left hand side, the hair is braided to your head in three plaits that continues across you head to behind you ear and then let down with the rest of you hair, turning into just a free plait.

2XzfZ46Oaa	If you really want to make them guess you shouldn't just go dressed as a woman but as a woman in costume.  That way they will try to figure out who is the girl in the costume not the guy dressed like a girl.<br>  You could go as a sexy maid or nurse or Bo Peep.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to do a good job on your makup but there is a way to hide a little better beyond that.  Get a nice manicure with acrylic or gel nails to help hide your hands.  With the manicured hand you can hold a masquarade mask on a stick over your eyes or part of your face.  Be sure to practice your walk and mannerisms so you don't act like a guy.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|9eR6pNpRaa	Why do you seek to ruin your masculinity **shakes head**<br>  What has this generation come too?|`|RNeMdAb1aa	You need a good wig. No freaky colors cuz it'll draw too much attention. And wear cute pants. Men always make the mistake of wearing dresses, it makes it too obvious.

I have great sideswept bangs that i do myself. Because hairdressers generally don't know how to do that. part your hair to the side, comb forward a generous chunk of hair that covers your eyes, and cut it on a VERY diagonal slant starting right above your eyebrow. the slant is important or else they'll look flat. then, when you get it how you want, take the scissors and cut the tips upright to give it that choppy look.<br>  <br>  hope I helped :)|`|ZrJ3sA0Haa	<a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/selena%20gomez%20hair/krissykrissyx3/Selena-Gomez.jpg?o=3" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/selen...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/preppy%20hair/Luthana/Hairstyles%20and%20Scene%20Hair/hair-4.png?o=19" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/prepp...</a>

For instance, <a href="http://www.mixedchicks.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.mixedchicks.net</a> sells products for that hair type, assuming it's 100% human hair. <br>  <br>  Pick up some hair mags, I know there are some that are specifically for weave and they give tips on how to maintain them, including different texture weaves like wet and wavy.

That's the whole point and meaning of hazel eyes - they're mixed!)|`|S7ciZHDeaa	hazel-brown :)<br>  they are really pretty :)|`|kTBkwkWTaa	You have pretty eyes =)<br>  <br>  They look hazel, and kind of an almond shape.|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	brown|`|pRxzPiSbaa	i'd say theyre more brown than anything.|`|5Jvw2l7raa	You have a very round eye, I would say they are a hazel type colour with brown shades of green if that makes sense.|`|TanepNjdaa	I say Hazel on the brown side...heheh kinda like mine

kSlycVwnaa	I had my hair chemically straightened 3 years ago.  I paid about $450.  I asked at a few places and that was the cheapest quote I received (most expensive was $850).  Although I chose the cheapest option, I was happy with the results and there was no damage to my hair. <br>  <br>  The entire process took about 4 hours, but may take more or less depending on how long your hair is and also how curly.  <br>  <br>  Your hair will stay straight, until you cut it.  But your regrowth will continue to be curly.  After the process is finished, you won't be able to get your hair wet for about 48 hours.  Just wear a shower cap and don't go swimming.  I was also told not to have my hair in a pony tail, but I had to since I had to go to work that afternoon, but it didn't make too much difference.|`|yID9DF8naa	Oh no! Don't do it! Hahah, that sounds so cliche. Well, if I were you, I would load on those moisturizing treatments, and dye it bright red! Hahah. However, if you want it permed, it could be very pricey, at least several hundred dollars for a good job. I would think about just getting it relaxed, which is better for your hair, and just turns it into soft waves instead of harsh chemical straighteners. I've always wanted long, curly, red hair----but that's just me. If you feel you really need straight hair, go for it, and ask around at local salons that will do the job for their particular prices. Although curly hair is one of the most sexy and feminine hairstyles out there! It's your loss, so to speak :P. Cheers, dear! Good luck.|`|9ydlIWUNaa	i dont mean to be negative, but that doesn't sound too good for your hair. it could burn it off and leave it damaged like straw. i'd love to have curly hair. mines so straight, it's boring and when i try to curl it, it flattens, aaa

BB cream stands for Blemish Balm, a cream that helps cover blemishes as well as healing them slowly, it is a cross between moisturiser and foundation, so a bit like a tinted moisturiser.

I rake up about 200 a month on skin :( When I want to go for a complete full makeup look, or party, I do liquid foundation, concealer on top ALWAYS, RULE OF THUMB, and finishing powder.

dM1jwSGyaa	I love guys who wear cardigans, and apparently all your girl friends loved it too.<br>  Your guy friends are probably just jealous of your cutting edge style.<br>  They wish they'd thought of it first so they could get more female attention!|`|f2mokGcIaa	No, keep wearing the cardigans :D Luv guys who wear cardigans it doesn't make you look gay just makes you look like you care about what you are wearing and its not necessarily preppy either depending on what you pair it with!|`|AhBJT5xFaa	Yeah.. it makes them look kinda gay.

ixmaM395aa	Hmmm...<br>  <br>  well I guess the person has picked the answer they felt answered their needs the most. So while a make-up artist can give the more in depth answer & the correct way to do something this may not necessarily be what the questioner was after. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't take personal offense to it.<br>  <br>  Edit - I agree with you, common sense says body paint over eyeshadow. But it's like those people who ask "How can I lose weight quickly" and even though you give them the answer that it's to be done in slowly with diet & exercise they'll still pick the answer that says "Try this 'magic little pill'" Because they're too lazy to go for the correct option. <br>  <br>  So again, don't take it personally. It's just people looking for the easiest answer. Though it may not be the right one.|`|5IJO3bzpaa	huh............. <br>  <br>  bc people suck..<br>  <br>  acctually everytime i have asked a question on here i have never gotten even a close answer.

Half of the time, I doubt they are really a makeup artist, because the advice they give isn't even that great. I suppose some people are just that simple minded. "Oh, their a makeup artist! So they have to be right!" Go figure.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't understand how they were going to get eyeshadow to even show up on their entire arms and legs. Yes, the obvious choice would be to apply a face paint and I couldn't even think of anything that would work better while still being safe. I guess it's just part of the Yahoo! Answers experience. I've answered a few questions where the best answer picked wasn't at all detailed or didn't even pertain to the question asked.
W86sginbaa	If the sunscreen you use makes your face oily, then don't use that sunscreen because it means that the particular sunscreen does not penetrate in your skin but just forms an oily layer on it which is of no use at all. I would suggest using a sunscreen with SPF 15. Use a renown brand in case of cosmetics. I use Lakme or Nivea. They don't make the skin oily and are effective also. <br>  And as for the quantity...use a sufficient amount of cream so that it covers your face nicely and evenly. You don't need to over-do it or under-do it.|`|WgeuYyd2aa	Lotus matte effect.It wouldn't become oily.|`|af0b72ed299e90d692074ec452674336aa	I know Neutrogena offers sunscreen that is specifically for your face so your skin won't become oily and clog your pores when you apply sunscreen to it.|`|qamSsjXHaa	in india i think JOVEES sun-cover cream ( packed in tube ) is one of the best .<br>  <br>  for oily face just wash your face 3 to 4 times a day .<br>  <br>  dont use any cream at night .|`|inzOTV1Raa	Try using Aroma Magic's Aloevera gel sunscreen.

I'd recommend getting a smaller stud, because it's easier to take out quickly.

But its not like you can get it cut and wake up like that everyday. It takes a long time to make your hair that way, you have to first get some layers when you get it cut but then you have to learn how to use hot rollers and curling irons and round brushes to blow dry your hair everyday.|`|CgEQAgXhaa	You need some product.

That area is the thinnest and most delicate on your face.  Rubbing or pulling that skin will eventually cause wrinkles.  Try a light-weight eye wrinkle cream with at least spf 15, and dab it very gently around your eyes twice a day.  I also recommend using an oil-free moisturizer with spf 15 during the day.  Also, try to drink more water and get more sleep.  <br>  Good luck!|`|XmFT7fHnaa	hot tea bags 4 ten seconds

dIS08i1oaa	"Russian lab diamonds" and probably the one you are viewing on ebay are actually CZ.<br>  <br>  True man made diamonds come from only two companies.<br>  <br>  Gemesis Company located in Florida has been distributing diamonds since 2002.  All of the Gemesis diamonds are fancy vivid yellow color, so this makes them pretty easy to spot. A comparable flawless vivid yellow natural diamond would probably be on display at a museum, or available to be purchased by invitation only from an auction house like Southey's or Christie's.  If you are interested, there is a retail lo cater on the Gemisys website <br>  <br>  Appolo Man Made Diamonds are clean white and virtually impossible to tell from natural diamonds.  However, at the moment, they have very few points of retail distribution.  The main source seems to be their own online store. <br>  <br>   I have added the names of the only two companies that man made diamonds, plus a third reference on how to spot a fake diamond.|`|xjazE0xmaa	Actually, many mall jewelry stores have laboratory-grown diamonds in their showcases--whether they realize it or not.  Some put them in a seperate display area from natural diamonds.  Other places lump all of the diamonds together (natural and laboratory-grown), since they are very difficult to tell apart.  Both are considered "diamonds."  Things like CZ and mossanite are not considered diamonds by real jewelers.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking in a store, look for phrases in the display case that may be clues to origin: man-made, cultured diamonds, or laboratory grown.  While it is not required to be printed on the diamond's certificate, some jewelers use it in the cases to help steer customers toward what they want (whether it's lab-grown or natural).  <br>  <br>  Ask the seller/owner where the diamond originated. An honest person will tell you what he knows. <br>  <br>  The laboratories that manufacture diamonds ask that jewelers display their brand names. Look for names such as Gemesis, Apollo, Sona, Takara, and Chatham. <br>  <br>  Ask to see what is inscribed on the diamond. The laboratory manufacturing the diamond usually laser inscribes the company name, plus an identification number, after the diamond has been polished. <br>  <br>  If you are still in doubt over a particular diamond, ask a gemologist to inspect the diamond. A laboratory grown diamond may contain a small amount of nickel or other metal used as the catalyst. After intense ultraviolet light exposure, the trace catalyst can cause is a short-lived phosphorescence; most natural diamonds will not show the phosphorescence. Also, the gemologist can use an X-ray absorption spectroscope or a transform-infrared spectroscope to distinguish differences in the distribution of nitrogen defects.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
j6kyAhQOaa	I've had to do this! Get a razor, just a boring old 2 bladed Bic one, and shave them off. It's easiest if you're wearing the pants at the time, as it keeps the fabric taut.

See the colour of your foundation is darker than what your skin really is, the idea is to make your face just a tad bit lighter than the rest so it shows and catches attention. The eyes are too dark with the eye liner there, make lighter shades on the top of your eye and just dab a greyish brown below the eye. But yeah you definitely have the face for it. When posing, try to look like you are staring at something beautiful and not look directly at the camera. the second pic was perfect i think.|`|0stqNIpjaa	You know.Your Really pretty.Dont put these pics on the internet to see if your pretty.God made you as you are, and your pretty the way you are.dont let anyone get you down.YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.there is no reason for putting these pics here on yahoo asking.Because if you think you look pretty then thats all that matters.I LOVE THE WAY YOU DRESS and stuff.please do me a favor and Keep yourself the way you are.dont change.because the people that judge you has nothing better else to do.LOVE YA <br>  <br>  Nathan Concepcion|`|IEk0UV7Haa	:S did the chocolate factory let you out on parole or something? <br>  Mr wonka won't be happy!

M1PYqC3qaa	Well, the scent from the shower gel usually hardly lasts any amount of time, and when you put on clothes it tends to fade and you can only really smell it if you literally sniff your skin. So yeah, I think you should get the perfume to go with it, then people will get used to that as "your smell".

2inq4zHZaa	My husband has gone through this problem before and says it's the hardest part of the body (in terms of weight) to work off.  What he did was diet.  Dieting has SO much to do with losing weight.  He cut out soda, limited calorie intake, and started eating a lot more veggies.  If you are planning on working out then it is good to consume enough protein to build muscle.  Just don't over do it.  For working out he uses push up bars.  They are only about $10 (he got his at Wal Mart) and they make push ups more effective, and there are different ways to use them to work out your pectoral muscles.  If you are going to a gym, you can consult a personal trainer, and they can direct you better than me obviously.  He also bought a punching bag and started using that, it helped too.  I think you just have to find the diet/exercises formula that is right for you.  Check out some of these links, they might help.. I am sorry I can't help you more, I am a female, but I am trying :)  Good luck|`|OIhN9B9xaa	Exercising, do cardio and stay away from junk food, there's no point in exercising if your diet is crap. <br>  Remember, you are what you eat.|`|6GCAYAAiaa	if you want to lose weight try calorie shifting. apparently it works.|`|16xFfHvuaa	the obvious is lose weight and exercise|`|6mnjYFwpaa	JOIN GYM|`|q0Q8LuOcaa	Unfortunately I think surgery is the only way to get sure results.

He actually designed a dress for the Grammy’s for Amy Lee of Evanescence.<br>  <br>  But the coolest thing is that he can mix the three styles together and even add other styles to it.<br>  <br>  His brand has something like 15 subcategories and each one is different.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't particularly like punk, goth, and Loli, you gotta appreciate his talent.<br>  <br>  I put his web-shop below if you want to check it out... Part is in Japanese, but to the left there are his categories (hEAVEN, H…). He has so much stuff, so you probably can just look at the first page of each of his subcategories (Click on his categories, then you’ll see his subcategories.

ddXQeEvNaa	If you use henna once you HAVE to use it every other time you dye your hair. Something about the bonds doesn't let any other type of hairdye stick to your hair. It would just wash right out. So stay away from henna (or Natural Instincts, which is just a lower dose of it) and pick up a nice semi-permanent hair color like : <a href="http://www.clairolpro.com/products/demi_permanent/jazzing" rel="nofollow">http://www.clairolpro.com/products/demi_...</a>|`|5WP9rLTlaa	anything thats more than semi permanant will have peroxide or ammonia. Nearly all of the rinses are free of them though.<br>  <br>  Henna leaves a red tinge in your hair, although I have heard that there is a variety that sends the hair blue. Once you've used henna no other color treatment will take in the hair that has been exposed to it. You cannot perm or chemically relax it as it doesn't take. On the other hand if you don't mind the coppery reddish tones it leaves yur hair will be far stronger, glossier, smoother and grow faster! I personally love it but I am in the minority there and my hair does have natural red undertones.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Manic Panic, Special Effects, Raw.  None of those have chemicals and are vegetable based.
ddXQeEvNaa	I just started pushing mine over, maybe trim one side gradually to create more of a swoop for the time being.. When it gets long it'll have a lot of movement. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TRIM, not cut.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	taking vitamins can help but if its basically the problem that they wont stay on that side then i can help.  go to somewhere like sally beauty salon and get hair tape...you wear it at night and it helps train your hair to stay like you want it...thats what i did when i was trying to do side bangs (going from straight bangs)|`|6Qs1VnSfaa	I had that problem once, all u need to really is have a part in your hair and just pull your fringe back with it. You cant really do anything to make your hair grow quicker except for time.|`|AA11853568	I gather you have a full fringe? I had one too and wanted side bangs so I just let it grow and side swept it and got it trimmed every 6-8 weeks eventually you can thin it out and when side swept it will look exactly like a side bang...Goodluck!|`|T4kc0bQmaa	well, I guess my hair has similar problems. A fringe is cool but only to sum extent. But side bangs look cooler. <br>  When your fringe grows a bit, just part it to both sides and comb your Hair accordingly. <br>  <br>  (Hope that helps)

953b8d3b5ffbd99d49d2e5485e1d4d2daa	I don't know if it works for volume, because I use long term relationship, which does seem to make my hair feel longer. Anyways, I love the smell of Herbal Essences, and see what you mean. I think it might make your hair a bit more volumized, but you can't expect too much volume, it will probably just add a little. I have been using Herbal Essences for years, and out of the more recent types, the ones I've tried seem to do what they say. I would have to say, it probably will add some volume, but the only way to tell would be to use it and decide for yourself. good luck!
0LLekEuXaa	Tanning is bad for you no matter what! Doing it a lot can cause more wrinkles earlier in life, not to mention cancer. I have seen it happen!<br>  If you are insisting on still goin in, just going in for 5 minutes a day on a low setting for 3 days, the next 3 days go on a higher setting. after 2 weeks, go to whatever setting you would like and stay in 10 minutes, your body should be used to the bulbs by then. Keep increasing the time but DO NOT  go over 20 minutes in the bed!<br>  Always use some sort of lotion, the baby lotion is better bc it keeps you from burning less. That is why they make it for kids (they cry more, the less the burn the less the cry... you get it)
def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	stop coloring it. the process is frying off all your ends.<br>  <br>  plus if you straighten or curl your hair a lot you're probably doing even more damaging and breaking even more ends.<br>  <br>  when you get split ends they can break off and fall off. it will seem like your hair isn't growing because they fall off at the same rate that your hair grows.<br>  if you're not more careful they'll start falling off faster than your hair grows and you'll lose length.|`|5urq0LDyaa	ive heard of this shampoo, its called, fast. you can get it at quite a few salons. my dads friend used it. apparently it actually works. <br>  <br>  then theres some home remedies like deep conditioning, scalp massage, and brushing your hair 100 times before bed every night. <br>  <br>  good luck.
ddXQeEvNaa	You're not supposed to shave "against the grain" if you know what I mean. Make sure to do it in a warm bath next time, and instead of shaving cream use conditioner. When you're done put a warm hand towel over it and then put on plain, unscented lotion (so it won't burn). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Other than that you're 16, no need to be shaving the cat. Ahaha.|`|hzQDocWaaa	sounds nice|`|AlmBtA2eaa	you need to make sure when you shave that you have lots of soap or better yet use women's shaving cream. I use the intuition razors they work great becuz a soap bar is actually attached to the razor. Make sure you keep the intuition razor wet though. Also when I shave I usually give it about 3-4 days b4 I do it again cuz if i do it too soon I will get bumps no matter what I use. And shave down (with the hair) with the razor first then up to make it smooth and make sure to use a new razor everytime.<br>   <br>  These are the razors I use:<br>  <a href="http://www.schickintuition.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schickintuition.com/</a><br>  <br>  give them a try. They work great and won't leave you with any razor bumps.<br>  <br>  it probably also feels weird to you just becuz it's the first time you did it. I'm sure after awhile you will get used to it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Use shaving cream, if you don't have that, then use hair conditioner and shave the SAME direction the hair is growing! Then when it's short enough, shave in the opposite direction so that it's smooth. Also, wash the blade after each stroke.<br>  And after shaving, moisturise heaps. and heaps.<br>  <br>  Shaving does this to most people and it will go away after a few days. The more you shave, you skin will get used to it and won't irritate too much.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	It's normal, mine is always itchy, use a semi-expensive razor and some shaving cream and don't do it every day, try every couple days and always use a clean new razor! and you dont have to do all of it either, you dont want to look like a little kid lol! i dont really recomend nair either it stings too!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	i think it will only be like that the first couple times the same thing happend to me but to tell you the truth i dont like the way it looks down ther when it is completly shaved it look scarry so i dint shave i just trim really short|`|dsivvZm4aa	yes,in the starting it will be difficult but after that u will be  use to it.|`|VfbsGjYSaa	That happens to everyone, but there are things you can do to try to help. Exfoliate really well before you shave. There are products like "bikini zone" that can also soothe itching. Also, I think the more you shave and learn to take care of the skin down there, the less irritation you will get in the future.|`|3Tx7zeKRaa	how much does having hair there suck :/<br>  bahahah<br>  dw i did that too<br>  big regrets<br>  theyl go away<br>  just DONT touch it..<br>  vitamin e cream is great for that uhm<br>  try a sensitive hair removal cream or wax<br>  yep waxing hurts<br>  but you wont get the shaving rash<br>  and its only that bad because its your first time<br>  just trial and error babe<br>  x|`|gH5FPXURaa	ok hunny...dont go crazzy with a razor.....first of all summers coming and that means baby powder is ur best friend....the bumps do hurt..but its because of how u shaved....take ur sweet time...go with the hair first then up against it a second time..that will really help...dont shave often at all...it will make it worse...u know what only shave on the sides..(bikini line)...not the middle..just trim short ..this way ur skin can get used to it...remember the first time u shaved ur legs....skin in sensitive for a while hun..be easy|`|YoNMn90Maa	I always feel weird after I pluck/wax/whatever. The bumps could turn into ingrown hairs and those hurt. An aftershave type for sensitive areas is good to use.|`|ipCGjFSoaa	Keep it shaved!|`|EIS976Gvaa	yeh they go away,just make u clip it first then shave it off, it helps with the bumps|`|B23gd3wjaa	good for you|`|YWe1Gqidaa	Unfortunately, at least with myself, the bumps never seem to go away.  I can only shave once a week because of the irritation.  But some products that I use that help with the itchiness is shaving with a good razor (not disposable) and using Bikini Zone's Anti-Bump shave gel.  Then when I get out of the shower (I know it sounds weird) but I used Secret deodorant with olay conditioners.  I use this every time I get out of the shower for a couple days until the irritation goes away.  Good luck!|`|5mtOfLi5aa	shaving often will make the skin used to it and reduce irritation. also shaving down "with the grain" will be easier on the skin.|`|gFZaJUGjaa	Yea its usually like that down there trying warming the skin in that area next time and go with the grain.
YoNMn90Maa	I know you aren't supposed to pop your pimples but let's be honest, who wants to walk around like that?<br>  <br>  Do this after a shower because your skin needs to be warm and pliable. Use a clean needle and pierce the side of the pimple and very gently press the other side until it empties. You'll know it's empty when the painful pressure is gone.<br>  <br>  If you don't like the needle, just use thin, damp washcloth. <br>  <br>  Wash your face with something gentle and leave your face alone!!|`|tD12vQNiaa	use a pin or something sharp and small, and poke it open. <br>  <br>  btw, try not to hurt yourself too much.<br>  <br>  extra advices : i exfoliate and it helped me to keep acnes, pimples, whiteheads or blackheads~ i use a chemical exfoliate. it works more gently than a scrub~ but both works well!<br>  <br>  ^.^ good luck!|`|QY2GdPwSaa	You can get rid of them by popping them or using the tip of a sharp needle to get them out. But to keep them away, I've learned exfoliating is the best trick. For some reason, they seem to come when I don't exfoliate.|`|UH4lU7MEaa	yes it will help<br>  <br>  # Apply a hot, wet compressor on an existing whitehead to open the pore. Pop the whitehead with a sterile needle and gently squeeze it. Wash your hands and face before and after to avoid infection.
XaYHMNusaa	The common stud w/ the butterfly back is bad for fresh ear piercings.  The backs collect gunk which can cause infections and they don't allow enough room for swelling.|`|YoNMn90Maa	If I remember correctly, I was told that a small stud is best so there won't be much movement of the earring while your lobe is in pain and healing.|`|q0Q8LuOcaa	Yes, because your ears will be sore at first so small ones would be more comfortable.  And I believe surgical steel is the best.  But I'm not a dr so what do I know?|`|3Tx7zeKRaa	its better to have smaller<br>  but it really doesnt matter that much<br>  itll be fine =]<br>  x

qQqC2cHIaa	While sewing is the best, they can be glued on provided you use glue designed for fabric and washing.  You won't find it sold with pens and paper and other glue sticks and the glues for wood and construction might damage the sequins or the fabric.  Try a fabric or craft store, they have specialty glues made for permanently gluing sequins and jewels to clothes.  Many of these glues can be machine washed and dried, although I don't recommend placing sequins in the dryer as some sequins will melt in the dryer.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	If you want them to stay, sew them on.|`|Ei4WsjiTaa	depends on the type of sequins.. hot glue is pretty good, but sewing is probably the best way

LcAiHBsaaa	They call it lightening now :)  Doesn't sound as harsh... haha<br>  <br>  The process you are referring to requires a high level developer and lightening powder.  You mix the two causing a chemical reaction, then apply it to your hair either with foils in between for high lights, or all over for an all over blonde... the molecules basically "chew" through your hair, pulling out all color, making your hair colorless.  Imagine little pac-man with teeth... haha!  That's why it is so damaging to your hair... it is broken down and weakened to achieve no color... blonde!<br>  <br>  It will fry your hair for sure, but not turn it green... unless of course you have another color you have died it, or you go swimming 20 minutes after doing your hair... basically any chemical that could react with the chemicals you have just put on your hair will cause a reaction!<br>  <br>  If you have dark brown hair, lightening could take several trips to the salon to achieve a platinum blonde, the PROPER way. (But dark brown to me is almost almost black, so it may not take as many processes as I am thinking!)  Trying to do it all at once will RUIN your hair the most and could result in chemical burns, hair falling out, or hair melting off.  <br>  <br>  It's all about chemistry... you'd be surprised!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!
rVDBMc9caa	You need to do two kind of things: Blackhead prevention & Blackhead removal:<br>  <br>  1. Blackhead prevention<br>  <br>  The best way for blackhead removal is preventing it from appearing. There are many ways you can do.<br>  <br>      * Hormones are the major cause of overproducing sebum. Stress and food play important roles in the hormone levels. So, stress release is a good way for blackhead prevention. Diet is another good way: Always avoid too much intake of fat and junk food.<br>  <br>      * Use a gentle skin exfoliant to remove dead cells from your skin, and keep the skin as clean as possible.<br>  <br>      * Do not use harsh soaps, which may irritate the skin. Use only natural cleansers instead.<br>  <br>      * Do a clay mask once a week for those with oily or combination skin. A good quality clay mask could help you to remove excess oil on your face, which is a cause of the blackhead.<br>  <br>      * Avoid oil-based cosmetics and heavy make up, which could clog your pores and cause blackheads.<br>  <br>  2. Blackhead removal<br>  <br>  There are some ways for blackhead removal:<br>  <br>      * Use a facial steamer to steam your face for a few minutes. This helps you to open up facial pores, and expose the blackheads. Pat your face dry. Then, use a blackhead remover to remove blackheads. Place the hole of the remover over a blackhead, and gently press down. This will apply the pressure from underneath the blackhead, and pop it up. Then use an alcohol pad to clean it up to avoid infection. Avoid harsh squeezing or scraping at the blackhead. Excessive squeezing can damage the skin surround the pore and can actually increase the size of the pore, leading to more blackheads in the future.<br>  <br>      * You can also use a pore strip. The adhesive action of pore strips can actually rip blackheads out of your face. Since most strips are medicated, this will ensure you don’t get an infection from the rather rough extraction. Use a facial steamer to steam your face first, and pat it dry. Then, just apply the strip to the blemished area, wait the prescribed amount of time instructed by the user manual, and rip the strip off, taking the blackhead with it.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Clay masks used regularly helps pull out trapped oil and dead skin.Check out  <a href="http://useinfo-blackhead.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://useinfo-blackhead.blogspot.com/</a> for more useful tips to control blackheads.|`|UH4lU7MEaa	here are an amazing natural remedies<br>  <br>  <br>  # Put a small bit of toothpaste on the blackheads.

AA11627323	Somebody asks this question at least once a day, and nobody can really answer it well.  If you bring your design to the artist you want to do your tattoo, he or she will give you a price.  You can bring it to a couple shops if you want to get a better idea.|`|rjac15O0aa	Sorry you have been neglected, but no one is taking you very serious.  Is there a reason you want it on you arm?  To fit it all on your arm it would have to be small text and most artists won't do text to small cause it will eventually bleed all together (20 yrs).  You might want to relocate to the ribs or the back.  It would look good as a complete back piece with some bordering.<br>  Some places charge by letter, word, or hour.  So no one can give you a quote even close on this other than the artist that is going to do it.

BYHRjUa6aa	You have a warm skin tone. What you should dye your hair is brunette. Brunette is commonly confused with black, but, brunette is actually a very dark brown. I also think you should get medium brown highlights. Even though you have a warm skin tone, it's still very light, so to darken your skin a bit, try Dream Matte Powder, and I think the shade ' Latte' would compliment your skin tone and brunette hair. By the way, your eyes are gorgeous!  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Jessica Brown <><|`|T2isnQNKaa	dye your hair black|`|7wrko11Vaa	i think your a bit light olive something around that. but yes i think your hair should definitely be darker!

The first job was a artistic photoshoot for a studio in town and got paid 300$ an hour. The other is a promotional model type thing, where you endorse and hand out products .. that job got me 23$ an hour. Keep in mind that you will never make it big, but as my experience goes to show there are small, local jobs that might have a bit more allowance where height is concerned. good luck|`|kUhcypC9aa	Nothing that will be particularly high paid.

6YwLlYovaa	try using an eyeshadow base, so that the shadow has something to stick to and will be less likely to move to other parts of your face. the best bases i've found are too faced shadow insurance, and urban decay primer potion. <br>  or you could apply the shadow wet, I find that often helps with this problem. to apply a shadow wet dampen your eyeshadow brush (don't like drench it, just dampen it a little) with water, a mixing medium, or some fix + spray from MAC. <br>  then use the wet brush to apply your eyeshadow. (this usually works best if you apply the shadow with "patting" motions as opposed to the regular "swiping" motion you would use to apply eyeshadow.) <br>  hope this helps you!|`|lmZeJkEAaa	before you put on the eyeshadow, put a tad bit of moisturizer on your eyelids, then put the eyeshadow on the brush, blow on the applicator gently, it should remove any excess shadow, apply it in several swoops. after this, take a q-tip and gently (really softly, barely touching) go over your eyelid and wipe off the excess shadow.  by not putting excess on, and having the moisture on their, it should stay in place. <br>  <br>  answer mine?|`|oAGvwYY8aa	Use a bit of vasoline or moisturiser before you put it on your lids.<br>  Then it will stay on your lids and look lovely all day without smudgeing|`|PcBz0w2Raa	hiya!<br>  What you could do is put moistureiser all over your face, including your eyelids, it creates a sort of grip for the eyeshadow...<br>  Then just put on the eyeshadow! don't do it all in one go, put a little on your brush, and then put it on your eye lids, it's easier...|`|663WkvWcaa	If you go to<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medusasmakeup.com/glitter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medusasmakeup.com/glitter.htm</a><br>  <br>  And go about half way down the page, there is a product called 'The Fix'.<br>  Its an adhesive for glitter powder!

6YwLlYovaa	maybe try applying the shadow a bit differently. when you swipe your brush shadow can flick off and fall under your eye, so try using more of a "patting" motion. <br>  or you could apply your shadow wet. do this by dampening your brush with water, mixing medium, or fix + spray from MAC (only dampen your brush slightly, don't make it drenched.) when you apply shadows wet it's best to use the patting motion I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  a trick I learnt is to put extra loose powder foundation, or translucent powder under your eye before you apply your eyeshadow, that way after you're done applying the shadow you can just easily sweep away the extra powder, and any fallout that it caught, with a powder brush (a fan brush works best if you have one.)<br>  <br>  i'm not sure what brand of eyeshadow primer you're using, but it may be worth switching to see if that helps. try urban decay primer potion, thats my fave. if you're using that and it's not helping try too faced shadow insurance as I find it works quite well too.<br>  <br>  you could try holding a piece of card under your eye to catch the fallout, or use some tissue paper, i've seen people try that. to me it always looked a bit annoying to do, but if nothing else works, and you're desperate .. it may be worth trying.<br>  <br>  as far as the dark shadows goes, use an eye cream morning and night (nivea visage aqua sensation anti-shadow cream is working great for me.) also drink plenty of water.<br>  is the concealer you're using one with peach undertones? if not you may want to switch, as the peach will help to counteract the dark tones of your shadows while giving you the coverage you need.<br>  hope this helps!|`|eJd5CPXFaa	put a bit of tape under your eye to catch all the fallout :) once your done applying, take the tape off.<br>  <br>  use concealer for your dark circles.<br>  maybelline age rewind is good!<br>  <br>  edit: put a metal spoon in the freezer over night and then in the morning put them under your eyes. this will make them less noticeable :)|`|UYzzlHzoaa	for your eyeshadow -- use a base. like (MAC 'bare' canvas)<br>  for your dark circles -- use cold teabags and apply on your eyes for 20mins.|`|NdaU2BMXaa	use an eyeshadow primer|`|CXZzoxURaa	use eyeshadow primer|`|gY7D6Eboaa	Use concealer for the dark circles.|`|u81QMmV5aa	try this concealer called maybelline mineral power concealer its really creamy and i have really bad dark circles and it worked for me.. maybe it will work for you.. :)|`|AA11853568	pressed powder

Once you have it, you may hate it, and not want it to be visible.  <br>  <br>  Lettering tattoos can be difficult.  They don't age well unless they are done in a large, bold font.  Old English lettering over time looks like scribbles and is often hard to read if not done larger than 16.  If you were going to put that saying on your forearm, you would want it to be large, and would probably want to do it in two lines.  I am not a big fan of letter tattoos, but would never tell you not to do it.  I just want you to know what you can expect.  <br>  <br>  Again, get the tattoo, but maybe consider different placement.  Leg, back, ribs?  Just some things to think about.  Best wishes!!!|`|3eccb178dd548622010bf484df469c7baa	eh, the tattoo artist with size it for you while they are tracing it. Only thing you have to know is not to flinch because they hate it, and to keep up with the tattoo goo they give you. Oh and dont let anyone set your ink ( slap it) cause it kinda hurts. It hurts sometimes, but afterwards it just feels like a sunburn

It works wonders.
ODdLBfXYaa	For me, all i heard before I got mine done was how much it hurt and how its the most painful piercing, and when I got it done it really didn't hurt at all.<br>  <br>  I also have my frontal helix and my cartlidge done, and the tragus hurt less then both of those.|`|R92ZkNCHaa	Ive heard it does.<br>  but its up to your pain tolerance.|`|aXqtzNIraa	Age doesn't affect pain tolerance at all. You've said your previous piercings didn't hurt you, well that's a good guideline to by. Personally my tragus didn't hurt me (and neither did my other ear piercings) so it's probably not going to hurt you much. and if it does it's over with very quickly.|`|XaYHMNusaa	You'll probably feel some sort of pain...you'll have a needle through your ear.  But it'll be bearable b/c it'll only me momentary.

Then ask him/her(your hairdresser) to leave your fringe drifted to a side(you choose left/right whichever you prefer) also tell them to trim the fringe but keep it long.  You also want your whole hair to be thinned. Then tell your hairdresser to leave the sides and sideburns long(maybe a slight trim) and get your hairdresser to straighten your hair for you. If you want you can buy a hair straightener yourself, they aren't too expensive they can be at about 90 US dollars. If you do decide to buy a straightener i've got a tip which is to use a comb to hold up your hair and then straighten it so it doesn't get all oily. Also if you do get split ends from straighteners don't be afraid to trim off those few millimetres of your hair! It'll look much better than having split ends!
