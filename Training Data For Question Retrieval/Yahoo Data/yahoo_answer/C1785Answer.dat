"That's very important to note," producer Kevin Healey says of the selection process. "We're not just playing these wacky, crazy jokes on people who are unsuspecting. We work very hard with friends and family members to make sure that the jokes are appropriate for them, that they'll get a kick out of it, all that kind of stuff. That they don't have any health problems." That's one thing that the critics of the show fail to notice.

Gaddafi and through its support of the Jews to have a homeland, despite anger in Libya and other countries due to the aggression on Gaza. But he added that the only way to break the cycle of hatred of Israelis is to live with the Palestinians in one state. He put forward a proposal for the first time six years ago, at least to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The proposal to Libyan leader described as the failure of the two-state solution to resolve the dispute. Gaddafi wrote an article in The New York Times said, "while still Tschit Gaza, calls the two-state solution or partition is still in place. However, none of the options would not be feasible," he said, adding that it must reach a settlement is in the presence of "one country for all, Isratine that will make both of the two peoples feel that they live in all the disputed land and that it was not deprived of any part of it." Gaddafi says that it is impossible to establish an independent Palestinian state next to Israel because the Israelis will not accept to live in the range of Palestinian weapons. Meanwhile, the Libyan leader advised U.S. President Barack Obama to give Osama bin Laden an opportunity for reform, saying the new president said the man, who find America's request to seek "dialogue." Qathafi highly praised what he called a "positive signals" from the Government so far is that Obama's new determination to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. He was speaking to students at Georgetown University in contact via satellite from Libya on Wednesday. Gaddafi also called on opportunity to give a "historic global" of the new president, "Obama and the new America." He pointed out that there are positive signs now of American foreign policy, such as withdrawal from Iraq, and the revision of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. He added that it would be part of these positive indicators, "if the investigation into the Abu Ghraib prison and in the invasion of Iraq and the execution of (former Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Well, looks basically identical  to Bush's foreign policy:    http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/foreign...|`|cNVTtkgmaa	I'm sure that Bin Laden would have an earful for him.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	After only two weeks in office, I don't know what Obama thinks about foreign policy.

i7oHTo9haa	He doesn't have it in his power to "fix" Gaza.  Let him just do dmg control so the terrorists can't get anymore weapons.  The Gaza society is violent and repairing buildings, signing a peace treaty and doing a photo shoot isn't going to repair a failed society unless the people of Gaza actually want peace.    Edit to Peace (yeah right)    "US gave the weapons to Israel to kill Palestinians including 400 children"....   US also helped arm Fatah to do terrorism control over in WB and Egypt to do terror control over in Egypt, but I don't hear you griping about that.    "US gives three to six BILLION $s of US taxpayers money to Israel"...  It's not taxpayer money it comes from another fund and alot of countries get subsidies.. Israel has to spend the money back in America so it's a win-win situation so no griping    "US vetoed the UN ceasefire resolution"...  Yes, thank G-d we're the sane ones and trumped out all the Arab influence.. G-d Bless America!    "US knew that it was Israel that broke the six-month truce first..."  Says who? The mouse in your pocket? Israel broke no cease fire the Hamas only does tahdiah, they call it a tactical calm of which once they were re-armed they fired again.    "US knew that civilians were targeted (UN acknowledges it) including the UN building"...  No civilians were targeted. International law provides for civilian casualties there is no law that says there can be no civilian casualties.  You know how many people died in WW2? Me neither, but it's alot!  International law provides for attack on ANY building that is used for militaryi purposes, If you have issues with civilian deaths, take it up with Hamas.    "US knows that turning Gaza into a concentration camp and preventing food and medicine to 1.5 million people is a crime against humanity:...  All the humanitarian aid that gets shipped into Gaza is a crime against humanity because we've been robbed of our money to fund terrorists!

AA12245463	The Phony War Crimes Accusation   by Alan M. Dershowitz   The double standard against Israel.   Every time Israel seeks to defend its civilians against terrorist attacks, it is accused of war crimes by various United Nations agencies, hard left academics and some in the media. It is a totally phony charge concocted as part of Hamas' strategy -- supported by many on the hard left -- to delegitimate and demonize the Jewish state. Israel is the only democracy in the world ever accused of war crimes when it fights a defensive war to protect its civilians.   This is remarkable, especially in light of the fact that Israel has killed far fewer civilians than any other country in the world that has faced comparable threats. In the most recent war in Gaza fewer than a thousand civilians -- even by Hamas' skewed count -- have been killed. This, despite the fact that no one can now deny that Hamas had employed a deliberate policy of using children, schools, mosques, apartment buildings and other civilian areas as shields from behind which to launch its deadly anti-personnel rockets. The Israeli Air Force has produced unchallengeable video evidence of this Hamas war crime.   Just to take one comparison, consider the recent wars waged by Russia against Chechnya. In these wars Russian troops have killed tens of thousands of Chechnyan civilians, some of them willfully, at close range and in cold blood. Yet those radical academics who scream bloody murder against Israel (particularly in England) have never called for war crime tribunals to be convened against Russia. Nor have they called for war crime charges to be filed against any other of the many countries that routinely kill civilians, not in an effort to stop enemy terrorists, but just because it is part of their policy.   Nor did we see the Nuremburg-type rallies that were directed against Israel when hundreds of thousands of civilians were being murdered in Rwanda, in Darfur and in other parts of the world. These bigoted hate-fests are reserved for Israel.   The accusation of war crimes is nothing more than a tactic selectively invoked by Israel's enemies. Those who cry "war crime" against Israel don't generally care about war crimes, as such, indeed they often support them when engaged in by countries they like. What these people care about, and all they seem to care about, is Israel. Whatever Israel does is wrong regardless of the fact that so many other countries do worse.   When I raised this concern in a recent debate, my opponent accused me of changing the subject. He said we are talking about Israel now, not Chechnya or Darfur. This reminded me of a famous exchange between Harvard's racist president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, and the great American judge Leonard Hand. Lowell announced that he wanted to reduce the number of Jews at Harvard, because, "Jews cheat." Judge Hand replied that "Christians also cheat." Lowell responded, "You're changing the subject. We are talking about Jews."   Well, you can't just talk about Jews. Nor can you just talk about the Jewish state. Any discussion of war crimes must be comparative and contextual. If Russia did not commit war crimes when its soldiers massacred tens of thousands of Chechnyans (not even in a defensive war) then on what basis could Israel be accused of accidentally killing a far fewer number of human shields in an effort to protect its civilians? What are the standards? Why are they not being applied equally or selectively? Can human rights endure in the face of such unequal and selective application? These are the questions the international community should be debating, not whether Israel, and Israel alone, violated the norms of that vaguest of notions called "international law" or the "law of war."   If Israel, and Israel alone among democracies fighting defensive wars, were ever to be charged with "war crimes," that would mark the end of international human rights law as a neutral arbitrator of conduct. Any international tribunal that were to charge Israel, having not charged the many nations that have done far worse, will lose any remaining legitimacy among fair-minded people of good will.  If the laws of war in particular, and international human rights in general, are to endure, they must be applied to nations in order of the seriousness of the violations, not in order of the political unpopularity of the nations. If the law of war were applied in this manner, Israel would be among the last, and certainly not the first, charged.   http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/middlee...  .|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Government Against Zionist Actions|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Here is a comparison.

The government can't stimulate the economy.  The talk is a fraud.  To give wealth to some people to spend means taking it from others.      We got in this situation because the government interfered.  They arbitrarily set interest rates with no bearing to the actual cost of capital.  They flooded the market with money.  The encouraged, or even required lenders to commit moral hazard.  They promise large numbers of people income without labor or investment.   They waste an ungodly amount of wealth on non-productive uses.    The solutions are simple.  1) Money needs to be tied to some tangible thing, be it gold, silver, land etc.  Something that cannot be expanded by running a printing press.  2) Interest rates need to be left to the market.  If the cost of borrowing is high, that's the market telling you not to take a loan  3) Stop backing and/or requiring bad loans.  Leave lenders to decide what to loan and to whom.  They screw up, it's their problem.  4) Time to revisit the ideas of social security, medicare, medicaid, welfare, and a whole host of subsidies for poor and rich.  This guaranteed retirement at 65 when people are living into their 80s is a recipe for poverty for all of us.  5) Cut taxes on wealth creation and move the costs to wealth consumption.    6) And of course the one bit of interfering the government should be doing is making sure people don't drown in all of this.  Guaranteeing a person who could be employed a lifetime of leisure is one thing, but you can't leave someone who is looking for work to starve.    7) We need to get serious about this issue of fraud.

The 'terrorists' the previous American administration refused to negotiate with weren't threatening to blow up America and weren't capable of doing it.

When the Bush administration refused to negotiate with Iran, did they think they were punishing them? Because they weren't, they were behaving like toddlers refusing to talk. Even preconditions to talks are ridiculous. Stop your nuclear program and then we'll talk. Rather than engaging them in discussions about why they should stop it, they just ask them to stop. What was Iran's answer until diplomatic intervention from the UN? Um. No. Because they didn't care. If you had two children and one did something mean to the other, would you encourage the other child to return the favour and smash his/her sibling in the face?

Why not put a picture of little Darcey in his cell, to remind him of his little 4 year daughter whose life he mercilessly took away...|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Flung off the bridge would be my answer.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Castration would be to good for him.|`|iz8hh0vNaa	I reckon he should be ordered by the court that he suffers the exact same fate as his daughter, and if he survived, then he gets shot.    I can't believe such a person would do somehting like that to his DAUGHTER! I don't want to know what happened for her to deserve such a monsterous act!    Do you know what makes it even more sickening?  He tosses over the side of the bridge on the way to her first day of school!  And her siblings were in the car when he did that, imagine the horrible picture that is now forever going to live in their minds.

As a parent of a 4yo boy myself i can not imagine why you would do this to a poor child.

FLY AND BE FREE DARCY|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	I heard about this this morning, it's so sad her life was taken, especially considering they think it was over a custody battle.

I read this, and saw it on the news just before!  That man has a sick mind!    R.I.P Darcy.  I will think of her when I go over that bridge now.

Sadly, no one saw the pain his demented/lost in this world for whatever issue he had; dad was going through for had he been seen he would not have done this deed which is really to hurt everyone not just his family or Darcy.   God help us all.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	that is horrible.  i am from the us and hadn't heard about this until just now.  it makes me sick to think people can do things like this to their children.  my thoughts and prayers are with her family.|`|8mfFWUZpaa	I live in Australia and my every thought is with this poor family R.I.P|`|B9gm5hEbaa	Poor baby.

As far as I know, Iran has been behaving.|`|XLHrIFA4aa	I don't think so. The UN has a habit of debating things endlessly. I doubt they would place sanctions on Iran.

It's all you need to know.|`|AA12087731	Excerpts from interview with Ayatollah khomeini    As Khomeini himself put it: Islam makes it incumbent on all adult males, provided they are not disabled or incapacitated, to prepare themselves for the conquest of countries so that the writ of Islam is obeyed in every country in the world.But those who study Islamic Holy War will understand why Islam wants to conquer the whole world.      The goal of this conquest would be to establish the hegemony of Islamic law. As Khomeini put it: What is the good of us [i.e., the mullahs] asking for the hand of a thief to be severed or an adulteress to be stoned to death when all we can do is recommend such punishments, having no power to implement them?      Khomeini accordingly delivered notorious rebuke to the Islam-is-a-religion-of-peace crowd: Those who know nothing of Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war. Those [who say this] are witless. Islam says: Kill all the non believers just as they would kill you all! Does this mean that Muslims should sit back until they are devoured by [the non believers]? Islam says: Kill them, put them to the sword and scatter [their armies]. Islam says: Whatever good there is exists thanks to the sword and in the shadow of the sword! People cannot be made obedient except with the sword! The sword is the key to Paradise, which can be opened only for the Holy Warriors! There are hundreds of other [Quranic] psalms and Hadiths [sayings of the Prophet] urging Muslims to value war and to fight. Does all this mean that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war? I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim.    OK - Whats your answer !!    I was in Iran when he came back! We witnessed what he did to thousands of Iranians who opposed his return - all knowing full well what he intended, what he would do - what the country would be reduced to!    History has proved them to be correct.     And Iran is still today ruled by unelected perverted Islam clerical misfits!    Iran has not changed - will not / ever change - from that day that perverted Ayotollah spat foth in his vile speech to all inside/outside of Iran.    It still goes on! + today Irans Clerics are hell bent on possessing nukes! They don't know peace or what it means. Only to ultimately rule the world under Islam - or detroy it - if they cannot rule it!    The whole Middle East indoctrinated Islamc countries are all of the same elk. They will eventually let fly a nuke - Iran in all probaility - being the Number 1 to do it!     Irans President no more than an Islamic puppet doggy!     Sanctions and more have to be fully applied without let up|`|Wal4I5Foaa	TRUE-JUST BECAUSE OF NUCLEAR POWER THEY ARE CREATING.|`|dc11e42546ed6307d628d746dddbc7b7aa	Iran is facing sanctions not for terrorism, but for using its sovereignty to pursue a nuclear program.  Israel has well over 100 nuclear missiles but US turns a blind eye to it.  Keep in mind that US sanctions against Iraq caused the death of about 500,000 children in that country.  US is openly financing various terrorist groups in Iran, it is occupying Iraq and Afghanistan and is labeling Iran as a terrorist!  Except for the hostage taking incident what has Iran done besides having about 1,000,000 of its young people killed in the Iran/Iraq war in which US provided Saddam with the poison gas and other weapons.  Don't take my words, these facts and lots more are well documented, do some research on your own!|`|oz9h5Cmmaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR4-LIEYg...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwwMF6biC...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAzIgzuap...

But I already knew that.  I wouldn't have taken any money from them at all.    77.69% of Palestinian people voted in Hamas.  The highest precinct was Rafah that voted 89%.. all of Gaza had high voter turnout    84% of Palestinian population supports terror and murder of civilians. (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) They danced in the street after both events.    94% of the Palestinian children have been victims of domestic violence by their own family members in their own homes.    Taking money from Hamas as hush money for the damage Hamas has caused seems to be par for the course.    Edit to Palestine_will_shine:  That Rabbi did not distribute any literature so don't go ruining someone's reputation over fabricated stories.  Show some class.  And to let you know it ticks me off that you are writing from American soil close to my home town all these Arab falsities about Israel and supporting terrorists like Hamas.  If you don't like what we do here, then go back to Arab country. Otherwise, assimilate!|`|8KbcQGL0aa	It's just more religious propaganda to make the terrorist activity appear to be done for the sake of all mankind. A holy war to cleanse the world of the people that don't think the "right" way. I just recently spoke with a Christian that insisted that all the answers were in the Bible. This was one of the same fundamentalists that deride other beliefs thinking that their belief is the only way to a higher plane of existence after death. It's my well considered opinion that the ONLY way that the world will be at peace is when each belief with a God center views every positive aspect of each others belief. If there emerges a collective positive aspect which I believe will be love then all believers should embrace that aspect and the world will be one and at peace. I'll answer your question with a question. Are the actions of Hamas any different than the actions of the USA after WWII for all the countries that were with the Axis powers?|`|q6phm94caa	Israel have been using Gaza as a dumping ground for their unwanted Palestinians, and have had their thumb screws on the region ever since the creation of the State of Israel.   Has it been unreasonable for Palestinians to object to this? Are the Palestinians expected to accept a third class citizen status, because that's the way Israel wants it? Isn't it reasonable for Palestine to have control over it's own borders, and it's own politics.  If I was a Palestinian, I would be thinking Hamas are the good guys - payments or no payments.|`|nVQtiU5baa	certain policies and acts of hammas maybe classified as odd(like allegedly the complete eradication of israel) but don't forget they were elected  by the people of palestine in a fair election and are responsible to provide the palestinians basic rights to food security and shelter   taking care of the weak is  Their Responsibility as far as this Act Is Concern Its Good   Wether They are Good  Or Bad Thats Political In Nature|`|AA11304025	Israeli propaganda|`|mrI8mfFpaa	YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW THAT???

Hamas then fighting in the areas, drawing fire and running to hide amongst their nations, knowingly drawing more fire & inflicting more agony on their nationals!!

When is the Hamas leadership going to be cut down and terminated in total!?

I think it depends on where you go to school? I went to HS in New York and didn't learn about a lot of things that I had to learn on my own. Education seems to be way too repetitive, for example we would basically cover the same time-lines in history every single year, and did not learn much at all about foreign countries. I wish that they had taught us about the Middle East! Then maybe the war wouldn't be so confusing to so many people.|`|AA12134591	Cindy...  In defense of our youth  They are products of what has been made important for them by the system and by their parents for the most part.... And, in a system that is far more concerned about each individual's "self esteem" than it is of the actual knowledge that they receive..... And, in homes that fairly well allow the youngster themselves to "set their own course" by what they get into and stay involved with...  what more can anyone expect than to have tens of thousands of fad seeking video zombies chasing after whatever the newest "craze" happens to be... thinking that they are the best thing that has ever happened to the world ??    I am, on the other hand... amazed at the absolute superb intellect and, in some cases, down right genius, of a lot of these folks.... seeing the world that they are being brought up in and the pressures that they have to deal with on a daily basis .....  Here on the Y/A .. I have encountered some of the sharpest young people on the freaking planet..... Teenagers with the command of the language and ...one could even say... style... of expression....  And, some of these same youngsters can hold a pretty strong conversation with you about such things as history and ... a lot of other things as well....     Soooo... don't go writing off a whole generation of these kids simply because a good deal of them don't have... or... don't care to have knowledge about such matters.....for there are those among them that excel in such stuff... and, it is those...wherein our future truly has those that will remember and ... they are the ones that will carry the torch of understanding forward to the generations that will follow !!    ? ////|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Its always been that way.|`|i7oHTo9haa	They have been so spoiled.

So they didn't really watch any TV or listen to any radio i guess xD|`|ruenEu8Yaa	students just don't listen when they are taught... and if they do listen, they forget what they were taught.  The holocaust was taught to me in middle school in 7th grade.  that is one lesson i will never forget.  partly because they made a whole month or two long unit about it. all of the teachers (except math teacher) integrated the holocaust into their lessons.  we read the diary of ann frank in english, learned about the details of the holocaust and why it occurred in history class.  in science, we learned about how the people were able to stay alive in the concentration camps on nothing but dirty bread and starvation.    and how it affects the body.  we had a unit similar to this in 8th grade but only having to do with the environment.  all schools should do this for the MAJOR events in history and the most important topics to teach students.  doing this would help them remember and thus prevent events like the holocaust and world war two from happening again.        one of my most memorable experiences was one day my english teacher took the whole class and packed all 25-30 of us into a storage closet that could maybe handle 15 people.he told us that we were going somewhere but wouldnt tell us.  when we got into the closet he said "you guys are jewish citizens during the holocaust.  you are in a overpacked boxcar heading to no body knows where.  this is the how it was back then to be a minority living in germany or poland (i think thats the right country lol"    to this day, I remember exactly what it was like to be packed in that cold room and I'll never forget.|`|DytfqrkSaa	First of all, that's a harsh generalization. But it mainly has to do with the flooding of technology. Nobody really watches the news, again I'm talking about kids. And besides, we shouldn't really be looking to kids about world events. It is somthing that they should know about though, and it is taught in schools. As far as the middle east conflict, I have never been taught that. Some history teachers will talk a little about it. Personally I have a Jewish girlfriend, so I know about these topics.    Anti semitism, it's more of a stereotype now. Or the phrases have changed in meaning.     Take the word "Gay" used by most teens today, has now been changed to an adjective meaning stupid or pointless. This, in no way means that they hate gay people.     So when kids say "Dude, dont be jewish" Or "This school is jewish" I think they are just putting negetive stereotypes into day to day situations. Regaurdless it is wrong.|`|oAWEcd5Qaa	Playstation 3|`|hbtCPs5qaa	definately not just young people's problem. bet lots of middleaged and oldies don't know.|`|CZdFWit7aa	Oh i guess you know what EVERY youth in the world knows.

We invade countries and install puppet regimes sympathetic to US interests. Regimes that keep the cost of imported commodities low, and happily make room for our factories, so we can pay their hardworking citizens next to nothing while they make our jeans and hoodies. We say we're promoting freedom -- the freedom to drink Coke and smoke Marlboros. Our life of excess promotes the drug trade, which in turn promotes violence. Look at our history with Latin America. Its sordid at best, but you won't read about it in any history book.     And now we're biting our fingernails over Chavez and Morales.

For example the policies of the IMF and the World Bank you should investigate closer to see what I mean - You should note the aid that is given is in many instances, but a drop in the ocean, in comparison with the LOAN repayments many of the Third world countries make back in like to the West, and the interest paid.     Despite aid doing some good on a micro / local level - The west essentially receives more benefit from the Third world - unfair trade / cheap labour etc etc. The West has also carved up many a country in colonial times and raped and pillaged resources and established governing systems that were inappropriate for the countries themselves, but rather of benefit again to the West - Today we in the West still reap a great deal from the assets stripped at these times.    Again wars are instigated and financed, which also in turn is constructed to be of phenomenal benefit to the western economies in terms of armament deals and building reconstruction|`|D593aOQKaa	Yes.

If we ever thought you were going to acquire the anti-gravity technology, we would vaporize the technology or make it unworkable so you never discover the technology. So no, we are not afraid of you. Well actually we are, we are afraid of your annoyance spreading throughout the galaxy. That's why we are waiting for you to evolve, so that then we can assimilate you into a sentient mega form manifold that is embedded as cognizance all over the universe. Contacting you now would only cause problems for you and for us, so we might as well just wait. We could, give you technology, in order for you to evolve faster, but acquiring technology without wisdom, especially at a primitive stage, can lead to annihilation. You, as a race, will need to face some harsh realities in the coming centuries...Only then will you be mature enough for such technology. Furthermore, another reason we have not made contact is to keep the earth primitive, you see, it would harm our tourism industry if we made you advanced. Only by allowing earth to stay as it is can we make a profit on the best 'TV' (we have something similar but telepathic) show of all time, planet earth.

There are other explanations for these sightings too. There is no proof so far that intelligent extraterrestrial life forms exist.    But even if they exist and have found the Earth, I think wars are unlikely. If they are only a thousand years ahead of human beings in terms of technology, it would be no contest. Think about where human beings were a thousand years ago. If they are ten thousand years ahead or even more, the statistics become even more unfavourable.

J54q2aVtaa	Because the purpose of the news is to make everyone feel very negative about life.    When you watch the news, it makes you feel as though humanity is negative in general and that humans are naturally evil beings.    Notice the news almost exclusively focuses on people who commit crimes and kill people.    Now when you learn that these evil people only make up a teeny tiny fraction of the people out there, you start to learn that the news is practically a false source of information.    It gives people the impression that it isn't safe to walk out of your front door.      Don't watch the news! The only reason TV exists is so companies can advertise to the mindless drones of this capitalistic machine.  They justify watching 5 minutes of tv for 5 minutes of advertising, not realizing that this advertising is causing them to spend unnecessary amounts of money.    TV is a money making machine for all industries.  People don't think about it but they are entertained for a few minutes and then advertised to for the next few minutes.  This is the purpose of TV...to trick people into buying useless products.    If you want to make any difference in humanity...change the channel during commercials!    DO NOT BE FOOLS WHO FALL FOR COMMERCIALS!|`|GZfzVRykaa	mate thats the news for ya, some of the **** they show is a joke    i hate the news!!!|`|wIZ3XM65aa	Because the news media thrives on peoples misfortune.|`|54df98931c66560fbf9ffbb3359138e7aa	how we will get the truth about what really happened if they didnt do that|`|YomAtJn3aa	The media is trying to humanize the news by putting a person on TV.

CbQVcgSxaa	hey i'm french, we just strike because we want to keep our rights and our way of life without working 12 hours per days like chinese people.    we have the best health system in the world, our system of education is not so bad too, and the goverment wants to delete a lot of jobs. we just want to keep it as it is.    (sorry for my bad english...)|`|Aqy0vCRJaa	I have just posted this but very much doubt it will be seen as I often appear to scare the pathetic censors at Yahoo.    Frenchmen have balls... not like the pathetic english?  I see in France there are nation wide strikes. They are concerned about unemployment and the general mis-managment of their society.    Not here however, as our men have no balls anymore... oh no. Our lot just roll over and beg like a bunch of dogs. And allow the powers that be to abuse us. We really are pathetic arn't we.    http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20090129/twl-...|`|AA12126561	I agree, a natiowide strike involving everyone is exactly what we need, stop everything that keeps the Government going and carry on doing this untill we have Brown and his party of Cheap skates, Corruption, Neglectivity and Treason begging for mercy and then hopefully other countries will follow suit.    IT'S TIME WE SHOWED THE WORLD HOW WE WANT THEM TO VIEW THE UK!!|`|zB9LIz6Faa	Nationality has nothing to do this with this, it's the govenment who do what they want not what the people of their country want.    There's no way now for us to avoid the global economy coming to a hault, only slowing it down and the best way at the moment would be the use of tax cuts.|`|y39iNwFjaa	The Economic Crisis is world wide - a strike wouldn't help, in fact, it would affect already struggling businesses. Do you honestly think that Cameron and co would fare any better than Brown and his gang? Maybe the famous British stiff upper lip will help us all through - hope so, anyway!|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Both the citizens of France and Italy love to contest the government and its policies on a frequent basis.  If you live there it is very disrupting because they do it so often.  Everything stops and nothing is ever accomplished by it believe me.  So although the principle of that kind of contesting seems practical it really isn't.   Also the French love to debate, and debate more.  The art of rhetoric is alive and well there, that is why they have so many cafes so that they take the time and sit and talk about everything.  It is something we don't do at cafes so much but rather on TV.  They are not big TV watches and prefer to walk and sit in parks etc so the mentality is different.  Do I wish we were more like the French, no not really.  I do see your point though.|`|RgvIoRhBaa	Thatcher's children, scared of their own shadow. People have been conditioned to think there's something wrong with going on strike! Wimps, yes.|`|8tcaTrIvaa	British didn't do this because British is much smart than French.    In this economic crisis, strike is merely a lost-lost solution. Adding social responsibility to all employers and even government may be a win-win solution. That means, a peaceful negotiation would be much useful and constructive.|`|AA10310496	I would never want to be more like the French, and I give you the same answer that I gave to CelticSaint regarding his question in the same style of yours...    "It's a pity that the French didn't have more balls in 1914 and then again in 1939"    Who were the wimps then...|`|eu7vhkm7aa	The French are much more assertive that the British for sure.   As for those ninnies who accuse them of being 'wimps' you need an unbiased history lesson that mightn't be so flattering towards Limeyland.    The French repelled the Germans at the Marne  in 1914 and when on to suffer so many casualties inn WWI, particularly in their struggle in the battle of Verdun that made such a massive sacrifice of men and resources. that they hadn't recovered  to withstand the Great depression and the WWII ,which was started because the City of London the international bankers therein financed the National Socialist Movement into power.    BTW the one-sided Limes overlook that they could have been annihilated  at Dunkirk had Hitler wished but it was obvious that he was trying to sue for an honorable peace.  Not a chance with the bankers' Zionist Churchill in power.|`|xMvt8KhEaa	i never once wanted to be at all french|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Bladdy good point and something I've said for sometime!!!  Wimps or even Gullible it appears at times!!!|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	wouldn`t want to be like the french in any shape or form|`|kXwYz5EKaa	the French protest at the drop of a hat   job security is high on the French agenda with those in permanent (over-uninionised) positions being incredibly protected,  leaving those in temporary jobs (usually young people) to suffer the consequences of economic downturns|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	I think if you whine about things it makes you more of a wimp personally. That is all the French are doing. Seeing as the world is having an economic crisis it's a bit pointless protesting to the government. Sounds like the British are the ones who can take it whereas the French can't.

Research has shown that vegetarians enjoy greater amounts of the nutrients that help boost sexual health and performancesuch as vitamins A, C, and E and potassiumthan meat-eaters do.  Many argue that vegetarians do not receive as much protein as meat-eaters do, but studies show that a soy diet, when approached healthily, provides even more protein and energy as well as a better balance of amino acids.  A number of studies show that soy protein may lower "bad" LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without lowering "good" HDL cholesterol.  So, yes, as a general rule, it's safe to say that healthy vegetarians have better sex.|`|8II1frHiaa	Both.    example...  china a very non-vegetarian country have more population every year.

In spite of all this I'm very optimistic because I'm keen that the night is darkest just before the dawn..|`|UYmRjCY9aa	No, believe it or not the world is still more settled than virtually at any time in its history, by and large Europe is settled, there perhaps will be conflicts going on there like it did in Serbia, Bosnia, but not a world war, and then scientists are finding new cures for many of the diseases that once killed billions, and that one day will include cancer, even though there are variants. Unless someone presses a nuclear button, and destroys us all, because even if it was some where in the middle east, the fallout would affect all of us ultimately, i think that you are being a tad overwrought.    don't mind thumbs down, but why do you really think that this the most tragic period, after all we don't live in Victorian times, babies, children, dying that is at least in the west,  of diseases that once killed millions, most have a better way of life than their parents, no world wars, so why?|`|ivGzzGOdaa	just keep praying.|`|AA12087731	Were already in it - Up to our necks!

TuWqNHv6aa	It's going to get worse before it gets better. It will take a couple of years at least for the economy to get back on an even keel. The Government do not know what to do.

HCvJ0AGnaa	PANTS.... big pink frilly pants!    I have family in Spain, and we have visited often since the boys were little. It's very common to have tapa's and evening meals with wine being offered to all, obviously not glass fulls but a small sip every now and again has never been a problem for me. The bars are all child friendly and socialising is very much a family activity.    My own dad used to give me brandy in a bottle when i was a baby and  altho' i don't agree in that,  now in fact i hardly drink alcohol at all.    Just give it a month and another so called expert will provided us with yet another highly boring and annoying report on how we can bring our children up to their warped views....    maybe they should concentrate more on the state of the economy then so many adults won't be hitting the drink in desperation over job losses!!|`|gK7kuyQqaa	Its just the advice.

This they are unable to see.  I have given up trying to help in this.   Maybe only laws will make them change; not just direction.

That is the average, they read The Sun, spend most evenings in front of the TV or in the pub, eat prepared food from Iceland and spend little or no time with their children.     If the average Briton were to eat at the table with their children every day and perhaps on Sunday share a bottle of wine with dinner it would be safe to allow the children to have a small glass, but the average Briton gets lashed on cheap lager or cider and would not have the sense to monitor what the children were drinking or would find it hilarious if a child were drunk.     The average Briton is a character from "Shameless". This is due to the welfare state. We have 2nd and 3rd generation dolites out there now who just do not know any better. 40 and 50 year olds who haven't done a day's work in their lives, living on handouts.

I remember one mate at school who's parents were the opposite, he had never touched anything unitl his 18th b-day.

They got lions thru those tunnels for their zoo!  Drugged them put them in bags and dragged them miles.  Anyways, they have weaponry and training.  IDF defeated some militants that were smuggled out to foreign camps (Hezbollah, Iran) and smuggled back in to fight. IDF mowed them down.  They also had anti-tank shells, anti-aircraft cannons, phosphorous shells (all NATO and Arab armies have phosphorous) and rockets that shot farther into Israel than have ever gone before (school in beer sheva)  They did it by land and by sea. That is why there is such issues with the border crossings, they were smuggling in weapons in bags of flour.  Now Egypt vows to control the smuggling on their side of border and the allies and Israel are monitoring the waters.  I dont know about the defensive weaponry.

So I think that your assumption that the Israelis have whatever advanced technology we have is probably unsupported.  The Hamas rocket attacks are unguided and basically inaccurate.  The Qassams are terror weapons in that they have no precision and therefore little military use.  They are just point and fire weapons.  They are as likely to hit a day care center as a football pitch.|`|l9RDuthbaa	Both Patriot and Arrow anti-missiles systems are effective against ballistic missiles like the SCUD and Shihab, not against short/medium range missiles, like the Grad, Katyusha, and Fajr rockets that Hamas and Hezbollah have been using.  Israel now detects the rocket launches very well, and able to project their target and to sound an alarm in the specific area. The system wasn't deployed 2 years ago in the northern border.  Rockets are making their way into Gaza through tunnels in the the Gaza/Egypt border, and through the sea, by water-proof tanks released far enough from the shore.|`|yKA70D41aa	Israeli power rests in America. All else is fiction.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	It seems you're talking about the Patriot system. The rockets are too small and too close-ranged for the system to work, and it would only be adding to the mess if they did. Moreover, the Patriot that looked so wonderful on TV in the first Gulf War didn't do that good a job, though it has had upgrades since. There's simply no technological solution to protect against al Qassam rockets or from mortar rounds except what we saw in the end of December and the first of January. Fortunately for both sides, it seems the Israeli strike may have caused enough damage to give the moderates in Gaza a political opportunity to rein in the hard-line fighters.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	Auto defense systems and military equipments can't be operated without human power. Israeli solders are so coward to run or operate  any system during real war .They couldn't control neither their selves nor their auto defense  systems or military equipments out side their tanks, aircrafts or operations rooms . As soon as they can see and realize any rocket launched by Hamas fighters  around , the fall down and begin crying and shouting, accordingly their auto defense  systems or military equipments also fall down.|`|kqW5WdQcaa	There is no present military technology to engage anything smaller than a cruise missile.  A Katayusha rocket, the one frequently used by Hezbollah, cannot be engaged by missile defense systems because for one, they are small and undetectable by anti-aircraft radar.  Another reason is because they are unguided, so the radiation emitted by a radar or an inertial guidance system (such as those on cruise missiles and ballistic missiles) lock-on cannot be detected by warning systems, because it doesn't exist.  Engaging a rocket with a missile defense system is like trying to shoot down an artillery round, something never effectively accomplished in military history.  These "suicide missiles", or missile defense systems, are for large ballistic missiles (such as a SCUD, SS-18, or SS-20).
FUVoy02Uaa	On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda suicide hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower at 8:46 a.m., followed seventeen minutes later by a second team of hijackers who crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower. The damage caused to the North Tower by Flight 11 destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people while as many as 600 people were killed instantly or were trapped at or above the floors of impact in the South Tower. At 9:59 a.m., the South Tower collapsed due to fire which caused steel structural elements, already weakened from the plane impact, to fail. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for approximately 102 minutes.|`|GBC39wHAaa	Why you do your own research Google isn't that difficult to use.
VHNyiARCaa	Israel occupied the Palestinian lands, Oppressed the Palestinian people and deprived them from their basic rights..    The seed of this conflict was planted in 1882 when the Zionist movement started with a group of secular European Jews to establish a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Up to the 1930's, Jews lived in peace with Muslims and Christians in Palestine for about 1300 years (except when the European Crusaders killed all the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem 900 years ago). Most of the Jews who lived in Palestine till then were Arabs.    When Britain occupied Palestine during WWI, they gave a declaration (Balfour Declaration 1917) to the Jews that they will give them a homeland in Palestine. There was one big problem however: the land already was populated by indigenous Arabs (Mostly Muslim, but with significant Christian 6% and Jewish minorities 10%).    Britain opened the door to Jewish immigration from Europe, which escalated during WWII and after because of the Holocaust. In 1948 the Jews made up 33% of the population of Palestine, but owned only 5% of the land. The UN voted to split Palestine 55% for the Jews and 45% for the Palestinians to establish a Jewish and Arab States in Palestine, and to make Jerusalem an internationally controlled area. War broke out between the Arabs and Jews in 1948 and the Jews occupied nearly 80% of Palestine and established Israel on it. In the process Israel ethnically cleansed 80% of the Palestinians from the land they occupied and destroyed and depopulated more than 400 Palestinian villages, massacred thousands of Palestinians and made 3/4 million Palestinians refugees.    The UN voted in 1948 (Security Council Res. 93 and General Assembly Res. 194) to tell Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, but until today Israel never complied. In 1967 Israel militarily occupied the remainder of Palestine (The West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The Security Council again voted in 1967 and 1973 that Israel return to the 1967 borders and allow the refugees to return, but Israel never complied (Security Council Res. 237, 242, 338).    This gives you a brief history of the roots of the problem. The Palestinians now negotiate to get only the lands occupied in 1967 back to establish their own state on it, and for Israel to allow the deposed people in 1948 and 1967 to return to their original homes.    Israel is only accepting to return only parts of the lands occupied in 1967. The land they accept to return has no borders with the outside world (making it an effective jail guarded by the Israelis). They also refuse to allow the refugees to return. They also have built many illegal settlements in the West Bank and planted nearly 350,000 Israeli extremists in them. Israel has taken control of nearly 5/6 of the water resources in the West Bank, and has built an apartheid wall that dwarfs the Berlin wall around and through Palestinian cities and villages in the West Bank . They also refuse to return East Jerusalem, which is part of the West Bank, to the Palestinians.    Again this is a very brief background. It in no way describes the daily suffering, abuse, humiliation, terror and deprivation of basic human rights the Israelis inflict on the Palestinians..

I have facts, how many pages you want people can write books about this topic.     They claim that we are not indigenous to region but they know better.  Jewish people have always maintained settlements there: We had a claim of Messiahship out of Gaza, settlements here and there all over the place throughout history, even when the majority of our people were in diaspora.    And I claim that there is no such thing as a Palestinian people that they are simply Syrian orphans abandoned on Israel's doorstep.  Syria founded the PLO after the Arabs lost their wars with Israel to overthrow both Israel and Jordan. Syria still has their eyes on Lebanon as well to re-make their Greater Syrian Empire.  Similar to what Saddam wanted to do with Kuwait and Mesopotamia.   They all got their modern countries and just wanted more more more and leave Israel out in the cold. Arabs already admitted there is no such thing as Palestinian people.   No thanks on the violence from these people, after 60 years their violent and hegemonious intentions bred violence and hate in their children.  I pass. Next plan? How about they just put down the weaponry and make a skyscraper in Gaza because that is a task that requires two hands and a shovel not a fist and a gun.  We offer the Palestinian people a home they are fools to not grasp this opportunity. In the end we cant make them peaceful they have to want it too and until they figure that out we will continue to defend ourselves.    You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967.  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."

Since the beginning, Israel has never initiated any violence. It has only retaliated to try motivate the Arabs to stop attacking it.    The Idea of a "Palestinian" people is a scam. Before the 6 day war, the people living on the Golan Heights were Syrians. The people living in the West Bank were Jordanians and the people in Gaza were Egyptians.    Syria, Jordan and Egypt started a war with Israel and after 6 days the Arabs had lost The Golan Heights, The West bank, Gaza and a region in Egypt called The Negev. Because they were losing so badly the 3 Arab countries wanted a cease fire.    Israel would not agree to a peace treaty with the 3 Arab countries because none of them would agree as part of the treaty that Israel had a right to exist as a country. Can you blame Israel for that?    Ever since then the Muslim Arabs, mostly in Syria and Iran have been fighting a guerrilla war against Israel. They also have been using propaganda in this type of war. They blame everything on Israel. Israel has only used military force to try to stop the Muslim Arabs from destroying their country.    This idea of a Palestinian people who deserve their own homeland is a complete fiction. Why has Europe and America been so gullible about the Arab lies? Antisemitism is a big part of it.

They put the big blocks of ice in a warehouse in sawdust and covered with big comforters. The ice would stay frozen in the warehouse all winter. I've read that even the saloons in the American Old West had wagon loads of ice shipped to them and served drinks with shaved ice in them.    Since there was no refrigeration, there were no popsicles either. When the ice men came to deliver the ice for us the man would chip off pieces of ice for us little boys to suck on.

whfbEPPeaa	Social services always try and keep families together whenever possible so i seriously doubt the "Daily Fail" are telling the whole story. I always get so wound up when I read anything in that so called "news" paper.|`|145RUNQHaa	Sensationalised to say the least.i am sure they will get to see the children again as many adopted children stay in contact with their birth familes.the mother should have found the strength for the children and stayed off drugs.however i feel for the children they must be very confused they are old enough to take everything in they must be heartbroken.sorry but i do think being adopted by a gay couple will confuse them further.|`|tod8jy9Paa	I have to sat that I am completely against gays adopting children . What sort of home can they be getting with 2 fathers or even 2 mothers. If gays want to live together its their business but when they want the rights of normal couples well that's another matter NO MARRIAGES AND NO ADOPTING.They have chosen their lifestyle now they can live with it|`|HUlyRTrraa	Whilst I am not against Gay Couples adopting ruling out a 46 yr old grandmother because she is diabetic is disgusting. Not only that, the mother herself is a FORMER drug addict and should be given the proper support so that her kids can stay with her.    A sad story indeed. I think it is irrelevant what sort of couple adopt children, gay, straight, it don't really matter, but these kids should be kept in the family unit.|`|i2wbADHbaa	It wouldn't have even been picked up by the Daily Mail if it wasn't for the fact that two gay men were adopting.    Perhaps the mother should have looked after them so it didnt get to the stage of her having to give up parental rights|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	well, the children want to stay  with their grandparents, their mother wants them to stay with their grandparents, their grandparents want to keep them but, in spite of rules which state that their views count. Social workers have decided otherwise.    I personally find the decision to be a blow against family values by leftie loonies. There is plenty of evidence that taking children away from their families by force has a long lasting and detrimental effect on the children concerned, whilst there is no evidence on the effects of being adopted by gay couples has on the children concerned. So it is TOTALLY impossible to say that the children would be better off.    Meanwhile any thoughts on gay rights or anti gay opinions are totally superfluous. the only rights that count are the children's supposed rights, but what a fantastic excuse to shoot any objections down in flames Any objections on any grounds are immediately dismissed as 'anti gay'.|`|lVzBupUaaa	It's nothing to do with the fact that the adoptive parents are gay - that's not the issue - the issue is that those children should have been allowed to stay with their grandparents who love them and could care for them.    Sadly, the press see this as a chance to have a go at homosexuals.    Idiots.|`|Wgk5Q8Jbaa	That story was obviously biased against gay people. It is abhorrent that a child is taken away from a loving family just because of a MANAGABLE health condition, but why is it abhorrent to let a gay couple bring up children? Each circumstance would be different but if a straight couple were unfit to raise kids (drugs, alcohol, social standing, abuse), then it would be better for that child to be brought up by a loving gay couple. Of course there is always going to be instances where the child is going to question things like "why don't I have a mummy/daddy?" or "the other kids at school said..." in addition to adoption questions, but if that child is going to be cared for better in the hands of a gay couple then why should they be discriminated against?|`|zFSO29yYaa	Whole lot of em are probably on DLA|`|6b84153bfe2261ef2f364d1d441125dcaa	Only normal couples should be alowed to adopt children, until the day arrives that 2 guys can reproduce a child.|`|y39iNwFjaa	No doubt there's two sides to every story. I wonder when the mother became an addict and whether her upbringing was an issue at all? The two men will have been vetted and police checked but as a mother myself I find it hard not to feel that where there's a choice, preference should be given to a mother over two fathers. I know that many kids have to cope without a mum - but if there's a choice, the choice shouldn't be to deny them mothering. (by this, in this cvase, I mean adoptive mothering). The story is too biased for me to be able to make up my mind.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	im totally against gays adopting children,im not saying they cant make good parents . im just saying its wrong, children need stability and normality and being brought up in a gay household leaves them a sitting target to be bullied during their childhood|`|ClCQIjZHaa	I think its wrong|`|sk46uigvaa	Poor children|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Yes you have to take into account the childrens lives as they get older, peer presure and playgound taunts we have all suffered and children can be cruel in their immature views at times.  However, what harm other than this will they suffer?    With the ammount of children neglected, abused and murdered in so called happy homes,  taking into account those sad cases that have been in the public eye resently ,envolving the murders of children by their OWN biological parents (none of whom where in same sex relationships) I think rather than focusing on the sexual preference of the adults MORE concern should be given to the care, love and support individuals can give to children.|`|Uz16kQEYaa	It doesn't matter whether you are gay or straight,,it's how you are as a parent that counts.|`|7Z3hWNewaa	That story is such a load of anti-gay propaganda.    The mother is a drug addict, sure, but she's a better parent than two gay men who have a stable, safe and loving household. Uh, wtf.      The social worker is basically saying, "I have no problem with gay people but they suck as parents because they're gay." What the hell is her problem?|`|WMqYhDNMaa	I think it's more sad that their mother chose heroin over them. Everything these children are going thru is her own fault.
WMqYhDNMaa	No, it signals they don't want to be involved in his terrible "stimulus" plan. He's not helping the economy or the American people. He's helping organizations that have nothing to do with the economy.   How is this at all helping the housing crisis... how is this helping people who have lost their jobs because they were shipped over seas and took a 70% pay cut.... get real.. it's not helping us.|`|8tcaTrIvaa	Most republicans are capitalists. They only care how much workers or their employees to contribute to their pockets. Now government wanted them to contribute more to the society; they are in great pain.|`|AA10527991	No, I think it's still too early to say that.  There are some fundamental differences in political views as to how the economy should be handled.  I'm of two minds myself about it all.  I voted for Obama, but I'm not convinced that a bailout is, in the long run, the best way to deal with our state of affairs.|`|gRfqjemmaa	No, just means they are finally getting some balls. Plan is full of crap for Obama's crew of supporters. ACORN gets 5 billion, imagine that? Why are Liberals so one way? ACORN has done and never will do, anything for a conservative, so why should conservative dollars be spent with them? Yes, all tax dollars go into one pot, why do conservatives always be charged with putting less in, but no one says anything when liberals take too much out?|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	Maybe it was a bad bill?|`|wIZ3XM65aa	The Republicans don't want to be a part of Obamas stupid plan when the whole thing comes crashing down. The only reason Obama wanted the Republicans to be on board with it is so that when his plan doesn't work, he can point a finger and say "But the Repubilcans were for it too"  Obamas plan is all about spending and will do absolutely nothing to help stimulate the economy!!!|`|5liN3A1laa	Eleven Democrats ALSO didn't vote with him.  What this signals is that the Republicans might finally realize their strong suit is in FISCAL CONSERVATIVISM.      Had the Congress got rid of the pork in the so-called stimulus the Republicans probably would have gotten on board.      As it is, this stimulus package is NOT KOSHER...it contains tons of Pork.    This kind of "stimulus" almost always fails.  We are saddling our kids and grandkids with tons and tons of debt.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	and just because, here are some more statistics    The plan this week in the House would dedicate $550 billion to spending and $275 billion to tax cuts. A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office ("CBO") found that much of the spending would occur too slowly to create the jobs that President Obama seeks. According to CBO only 7% of the $358.1 billion in discretionary funds would be spent be spent in fiscal year 2009; 38% by the end of fiscal year 2010 (when the economy is expected to be recovering); and 67% in fiscal year 2011. Moreover, much of the spending would permanently grow government rather than providing temporary stimulus.

9SB2Y5r8aa	First step to start should be " A fair definition of terrorism" :  Who is a terrorist :     A freedom fighter such as Hamas fighters in Palestine,  or    Coward land occupier , such Israeli solders  occupying Palestine since 1948. Since that time they are  killing children, women and old people using phosphorous and chemical weapons, and forced  the natives to leave their homes and live a refugees in other countries since 1948 until now.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	-death  -family loss  -lack of hope - so its a mental strain becomes depression and illness.  -more protests    physically when terror happens buildings get destroyed so more money is needed to fix up comunities, buildings, homes family life etc|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	death, fear, hatred... just some ideas|`|WMqYhDNMaa	9/11    google it|`|wIZ3XM65aa	Well, if you are standing next to a suicide bomber when he blows himself up, you turn into soup!|`|bGuVAltxaa	Most people are devastated by it but they learn to live with it, but for some people it totally destroys their lives. I have lived in Belfast all my life and have seen at first hand what terrorism does to people, both the victims and perpetrators. I lost my cousin in 1986, murdered in his own bed, and while we have all learned to get on with life, his mother was never the same person after wards and probably died a lot younger than she should have because of the grief she felt.       I have also seen men who have never been the same again after committing murders and one in particular who took his own life because he couldn't live with what he done, terrorism always destroys lives, it never does any good, and that's for both the victims and for a lot of the people who commit them.
2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	He'll be voted out.    The reason he's pushing so hard to get Republicans on board with his plan is so he has the other party to share the blame come the next election.    Think about it. He doesn't need a single Republican vote in the House to get what he wants.  If his plan was so great, if YOUR idea was so great, why would you want to give your political enemies ANY credit?  You'd just say, "Screw you, I'm doing this, I don't need your help."  Then, when it all works, you are the genius and your enemies look like idiots, and you ensure that they won't win another election for a LONG time. But, if you have serious doubts about your plan (or don't know what the hell you are doing in the first place), you NEED someone to share the blame.    House Republicans were very smart yesterday.  Not a single one of them voted for Obama's pork-laden 'Stimulus' bill.  It passed anyway.    In the Senate, it's another story.  Obama needs a couple of Republicans there for the Senate version to pass.  He'll get one or two, the liberal Republicans from liberal Northeast states, who are more liberal than a lot of Democrats. They are the ones who will screw this thing up.  If the rest of the Senate Republicans stand firm and make Obama get his bill with his own people, then Obama will own it.  And he'll own the blame when it fails.    Of course, he'll have every media outlet except for Fox and talk radio doing everything they can to put the blame on Republicans.|`|L6BOtQ6haa	If his plans fail, we might as well have bush again for the next few years|`|oubC3TCOaa	There will be 4 years of change.

There over 600 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States.    Which begs the question - Why build 600 camps if you dont expect to have to use them.    duh|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	Change will come. I assume it will be bad as long as "the awaited one" is president. We will become a socialist country, we will all be more poor and the government will control everything except sexual sin. People will be able to do as much of that as they want.    Oh yes, single family homes will increase children will only have one parent.|`|uSkNn9YFaa	maybe you are referring to a specific change. nothing is constant in this world except change. either obama's policies become effective or not, there will always be a change either worst or good. looking on obama's backround, this harvard law graduate and magna cumlaude is not dumb. now, if you are referring on his ability unless you are not racist and anti-obama you will not judge him yet because its not right to make a conclusion when infact things are only starting...    if you are questioning obama's capability, why dont you include governtment to that question and let John f.
