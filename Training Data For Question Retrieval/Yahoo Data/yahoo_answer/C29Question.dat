20090220220801AAaFDKn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	When someone kills a police officer how do they know to give the death penalty  or lethal injection?	I think it's pretty crazy the death penalty, if you say it's wrong to kill someone, then turn around to kill them.  Or I don't think it's fair some can kill and get off easily. I guess it all depends on who's doing the killing and who's getting kilt.      If you kill a police would it be injection or become a life-e. how do the courts,judges decide it, what if they plead insanity. Do you think a good lawyer can get someone out of that.

Illegal immigrant arrested in document fraud isn't this how illegals get entitlements with those kind of documents ?   An illegal immigrant from Mexico with outstanding warrants for assault and domestic violence-related charges was arrested Wednesday by Valley authorities in Mesa after an investigation into a fraudulent manufacturing operation.      Francisco Javier Espinoza-Hernandez, 31, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated identity theft and possession of a forgery device at his residence, 52 S. Beverly, in Mesa, according to the Arizona Fraudulent Identification Task Force.      During the arrest, officers seized a computer, a cardmaker, a computer scanner, business card stock paper and numerous false identifications and several documents, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.      The Task Force consists of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, including DPS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

20090220221209AA4zven	Politics & Government;Politics	This has to do with President Bush, President Obama, Liberals, Conservatives, racism, and ignorance.?	I am a right wing conservative form a small town 15 minutes from Denver. I would have voted for Senator Mccain if i was of legal age to do so. Just recently i watched as President obama signed a new stimulus bill. It was on local news for me so i also watched the protests from right wing groups. Things were said that President Obama did make history and deserves to be in a museum, a museum of horrors. I was honestly shocked and appalled that patriotic citizens of The United States of America would say sorts of things about there leader. Leaders should not be judged on race, age, etc. It then came to me that i also saw this towards the ladder of President Bush's 2nd term. i Dont understand why we must be so incredibly divided that we try to take down our own leaders with words of discouragement. Regardless of who the president is or what party he is affiliated with we as Americans NEED to support our current president. They are only trying to make our lives better and safer, More efficient even. We have to remember that the president does not make every decision so everything cannot be his fault. We need to stick with our leaders through trials and tribulation and pray we survive and succeed in the future. We cannot dwell in the past, all we can do is learn from our mistakes because as we all know history repeats itself. We are set up for disappointment and failure like many great empires and civilizations before us if we don't unite. All the ignorance in the world which is what America is gaining is not helping us. We are so judgmental to leaders who are trying there best, with ignorant conservatives saying ignorant negative things towards President Obama, and ignorant liberals (FAR TOO MANY!!) bad mouthing former President Bush. 99.7% of all Americans are never going to amount to the knowledge, know how, or success of either of these men so KEEP NEGATIVE COMMENTS TO YOURSELF!         final note   -WE SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED PRESIDENT BUSH MORE!   -WE NEED TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA THROUGH HIS TERM!      Who agrees?          Signed,   A leader of the better, stronger, well rounded youth of America!!            (I wrote as ideas came to my mind so i am sorry if it sounded like i was rambling.)      please no negative comments towards me. just state your opinion like a civilized person.

20090220193341AAnGh9l	Politics & Government;Politics	Instead of the left/right prism, why don't we view politics on the basis of short-term versus long-term?	For instance:      Tax cuts paid for by deficits - short-term.   Tax hikes* to fund public investments or pay down the debt - long-term.      Torturing alleged terrorists to prevent a conventional bombing - short-term.   Ending the practice of torture to improve our reputation and garner international cooperation - long-term.      Drilling for oil to bring down energy prices now - short-term.   Preserving our strategic reserves for the future, when oil will be more scarce - long-term.      And so on. It seems to me the constant focus on short-term quick fixes is what's so corrosive, not the policies of the left or right per se. If we had a political culture focused mostly on the long-run, do you agree that this would produce better results all around, regardless of the particular party in power?      *In normal economic conditions

My story: I filed with the state 2 weeks ago to establish paternity with my child's father, who was not cooperating with me. As soon as he got notification he decided to comply with my request so we set up DNA testing privately. Once we did this, I contacted my state Child Support Services office and asked them to close the case, however they will not. They state that it is not my case vs. the father, but State of WY vs. father, and say I can close the case once paternity is established. However, on their website it states that all I have to do to close the case is to put it in writing (which I did) as long as I don't receive public assistance (which I don't). Will the father signing the Paternity Affidavit stop state proceedings?      Also, the father and I live in different states. Can I just notify his state that I no longer wish to pursue paternity testing?

20090220192701AABomDf	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My mom is being sued in a case of retaliation, is there a case?	My mom used to be best friends with this woman from another state.  She helped us out in time of need by giving money to pay for some important expenses we had which we were grateful for.  Then when she was here she was starting to take some of our bills off of our counter and pay them with her money which we never asked for.  It probably would have been wise for us to say no, but we thought she was a good person trying to do good so we didn't think it would be a problem.      Anyway, after awhile we found out some things about her that weren't too good.  She got into a relationship with an ex-con, they were mistreating one of my mother's friends, and she was calling my mom night and day bothering her about unimportant matters.  After awhile my mom stopped answering her calls, then she changed her phone number.        She then decided to retaliate against us for my mom breaking communication by saying all the money she gifted to us was actually a loan, and now she hired a lawyer to sue us for 14 thousand dollars plus interest (whatever that means).      The problem with her case is she has no agreement in writing, no verbal or proof of verbal agreement, no witnesses, no calls, e-mails, or anything agreeing to pay it back.  She knew we wouldn't be able to repay her and she said we never had to until she got mad at us and wanted revenge.      What kind of case does she really have without any proof?  Are they allowed to just take her word for it?

Although the cost was a bit steep for me- being a single mom, I could still afford it with child support, and I thought it would be very good for him. As the months went on, I realized that that was just the base pay, and that every month there were some sort of additional charges, from field trips, to belt promotions, to tournaments, to uniforms and equiptment.    At the end of last school year, I was releaved that I had made it through (scrounging all the way) and the year was over. Unfortunately I then learned that when I enrolled him, it was a 3 yr contract!!! I am now in the middle of year 2, and with the economy the way it is, plus the fact that I am no longer receiving child support, I am financially UNABLE to pay his tuition. How can I get out of this contract? Is it possible?

20090220183254AARrnlR	Politics & Government;Military	Question for the current or former Marines.?	First of all, this post IS NOT mean to stir the pot so to speak.  Yesterday, I had asked a question and stated that Jacksonville, North Carolina had left me a little disgruntled with the Marine Corps.  In one of the replying posts a gentleman decided to say I was x,y, and z etc and also that I was anti-military.  For the record, this is simply NOT true.  Also, for the record, I have in my possession an HONORABLE form DD-214 as well as an HONORABLE form DD-256 (that's what you get when you are REALLY out of the Marine Corps).  What is true is that Jacksonville, N.C. made me a miserable SOB while I wasn't deployed.  When I was in the Corps it seemed as if all of the married Marines didn't mind J-ville because they had family support.  As for us single guys, all of the single women were in the college towns of Wilmington and Greenville, N.C. and I and my buddies learned that we weren't welcome in those places so we quit going.  So, long story short, there wasn't a whole lot to do on the weekend except sit and drink in the barracks.  Again, this isn't meant to p*** anyone off, but I did have to clarify my position.
20090220184117AAnzRsZ	Politics & Government;Immigration	I think I am in trouble. Please help!? I don't know if I should file my taxes.?	Hello, I am 17 years old, but in a week I will be 18. I came to USA with a visa F1 almost 4 years ago. It is going to expire May 30 (I am going to graduate high school). I have a SSN and driving license. I am from Spain, Europe.      Some months ago I decided to work for a while at a fast food restaurant and then I discovered I wasn't supposed to work, and so I quit. Now it is tax time, and people are saying that if I file taxes I will get deported for working, and if I don't file them I will get deported for not filing them.      I am engaged to an American natural born citizen and we plan marrying in April. I am pregnant and my due date is supposed to be May 30 (right when my visa expires!) This wouldn't be such an issue if it wasn't for the working thing, because I can get visa extensions to stay longer.      I don't want to get deported or leave, because my baby will be a US citizen, in fact, I won't even be able to leave, because I will be 9 months pregnant at the time.      Could they deport me after having the baby? What should I do? Can I file my taxes next year when I am already a resident, since I am 17 years old right now? HELP!
20090220183936AA2Y3ke	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can an employer change vacation payout policy, and then layoff employee without giving the payout?	I was hired by a small company who had a policy of vacation time pay-off upon leaving the company.  About 6 months after I was hired, they changed the policy so that there is no vacation pay-out upon leaving the company for any reason.      About two weeks ago, I put in a request in at my job asking for two days off due to my reserve military obligations.  I noted there for the first time that I would like to use part of my 50 hours of vacation time to make that work week total 40 hours.  On the day right before to my next work day, I got a call from them that they are laying me off--effective immediately, but that I am ELIGIBLE for rehire when business picks up again.      I feel that this is merely a diversion for them to not give the vacation pay-out.  So my question is:  Are they allow to hire someone and then change benefit policy midway just so they do not have to deliver the promised fringe benefit(s) upon hire?  This is in the state of Virginia.  I was hired March 2008.  The policy change was introduced around September or October, I believe.  And I was laid off without warning February 2009.

20090220193503AAa3Ce4	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should I sue a well known Restaurant for Broken Glass served to me?	My girlfriend and I had plans to go to a hockey game on Friday, Feb 20th, 2009.  Before we were going to attend the game, we decided to go out to dinner for a quick bite to eat and drink.  In the process, we were on our way to, "The Pub."  We arrived and could not find a seat so we decided to sit by the bar (not a table).  Our waiter came over and asked us if we would like drinks and we replied yes.  We ordered some appetizers and drinks.  The waiter brings our drinks out to us and moments after our apps.  Halfway into drinking my drink, I felt the taste of blood in my mouth.  My girlfriend asked me what was the matter and I said, I didn't know.  I then looked at the glass I was drinking out of and noticed it was chipped with a sharp edge on the lip part of the glass.  We then told the waiter and he told me that he will send the manager over.  I took pictures right away.  The manager came over and asked us how we were, and my girlfriend jumped in and said that I had cut my lip on one of your glasses you served us.  The manager was apologetic and told us that our meal would be on the house.  I called my dad and asked him what he thought and he said that he would take all precautions before leaving the restaurant.  I then confronted the manager and asked him if I could have the glass that I cut my lip on and also asked him if he had noticed any glass in the bottom of the glass.  He replied to me that if he has the glass still, i could have it and he also said, he doesnt know if there were any glass particals in the broken glass.  He went back in the back and then ten minutes later, brings out a glass that appeared to be my glass that was broken but looked as if it were a different glass like he didn't want me to make a big deal out of it.  I then asked him if I could take pictures of the glass he brought out to us and refused to let me as well as reminding us that the meal and drinks were taken care of as if that should be more than enough.  Basically like he was nervous or something.  He was then mean to me since that after like he wanted us to leave now.  I have many questions that are going through my mind now such as, should I sue?  What if the broken glass he served us was served to another person before me and they cut their lip and didn't know it then was served to me and I cut my lip, would I then get some kind of disease like AIDS?  What if I had swallowed glass and then started having problems.  This happenned tonight by the way at "The Pub" in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Rookwood area.  Very scary, the thoughts going through my head right now.  Okay, now that you know the facts, here are the evidence I have.  Cut lip, possibly cut throat or stomach, pictures of the broken glass that was served to me, my girlfriend as a witness, the receipt, the managers business card with cell number and the waiter that was also a witness.  What should I do?  Please help.  I am not used to this kind of stuff.  I'm 31 almost 32 and a little worried about the situation.  Oh, by the way, we went to the hockey game and I then wanted to leave early cause I wasn't feeling good to my stomach so we left.  What should I do?

I am aware that it will stay on your record indefinatly, but not on the CRB which is the primary interface employers search and check for convictions.  If for some extenuating reason however an employer would like to know if you EVER had a conviction, i believe there is another extensive database which can be accessed(but this isn't common i believe or easy). The CRB is a service that is used/bought by employers to reveal personal details of a subject. But the individuals details expire from (this) database so as to redeem the subjects ability to get job equally. basically by law, as this suggests that they have been punished and are now fully rehabilitated and ready to become members of society again. The conviction however will always stay on your own personal record held by the goverment, no doubt.

So during the presidential campaign the Dems when all up in arms after Joe the Plumber asked Obama about his tax plan.  Coming to the defense of Obama they dug into Joe's finances and found he owed some back taxes.  They took it to the media and down went Joe, being deemed a criminal for evading his (relatively) minor tax bill.  Enter President Obama and his appointee Tom Daschle.  Daschle bilks the U.S. economy out of nearly $200k and Obama, the same guy who lambasted a guy for owing considerably less, stands up and says it is o.k.      There is a lesson here for all of us.  They say the first 100 days define a president.  Well, we are getting all sorts of defining now and this is just one more little piece of the puzzle falling into place.      Hmmm.

Now, Daschle himself, knows that he will be ineffective as Health Secretary (due to the heat of the scandal) that's why he decides to remove himself from the nomination.      Why didn't President Obama foresee this? He could have prevented the whole thing from happening, by removing Daschle from nomination the moment the scandal was out. But he stubbornly pushed for him.        Another thought comes to mind, did he push for daschle because he thought the people and media would let the scandal go, like they did for geithner?

20090220212111AA2C5Y1	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Internet Scams??????????????????	Internet Scams?????????????????????   With the rise of the internet that has been a rise in internet scams. Sites like Craig's List and other sites offer payday loans and other services to people across the globe. My question is, if a person receives what they think is a legitimate service (check, payday loan, cash advance, etc..) through a service over the internet and cash the check or receive the service and it turns out to be a fraudulent check who is held accountable. I am sure the receiver would be financially responsible to an extent, but are they criminally responsible? For instance if a person got a payday loan on the internet or through some service and cashed it, and received money and later the check was found to be a fake would the person who cashed it be guilty of uttering and publishing, or are they a victim too? I have always wondered about this. Another scenario that I can think of that is on this basis is if a person is working for a person or business and the business owner provided the employee with a fraudulent check who is the guilty party? Basically, if an unsupecting person is given compensation for work done or for a loan of some sort by a shady person, is the person who cashed the check guilty of fraud or whatever crime it would be?  I read and hear about these things all the time in the news so I am wondering how guilt or innoncence is proven in these cases.  It seems that many people could be taken advantage of and end up in jail, or do DA;a and LEO's go for the person who is providing the fraudelent service?

I told the recruiter before going to my first initial MEPS visits about the current issues that I have had..      1. Fractured nose (baseball incident) Perfectly fine, not crooked and I can still smell ;) (happened about 7 years ago)      2. Fractured foot (baseball injury again) Again, perfectly fine and no issues/pain whatsoever. (happened some 12 odd years ago)       3. Rolled ankle, went to the emergency room for this because we thought it was broken. It was just a sprain, but it was swollen and hurt for a month. (happened 4-6 years ago)      4. Fractured 3 fingers (don't remember what hand and have absolutely no problems. This was a basketball injury). Happened some 8-12 years ago.      5. I had back x-rays at one point for lower back pain, was diagnosed as weak back muscles. I work out and no longer have this problem.      6. I've had a wisdom tooth removed.      7. I had seizures when I was a newborn/1 year old, haven't had them since then.      Well, I'm not going to blame this on my recruiter or his SNCOIC, they told me to lie but it was my choice to follow through. Since then I have regained my integrity and I want to spill my beans even if it means a DQ or I don't get the job I initially selected.      My questions are, when can I get the paperwork corrected? Should I go to MEPS myself or must I deal with the recruiter who continues to tell me don't worry about it? If my injuries are over 10 years old, how would I show medical records in regards to these injuries if the hospitals do not hold them over 10 years? My recruiter stated that I would have to go up to MEPS on my ship day and do a RENO then. Can I not go before hand to get it straightened out as quickly as possible?      I changed my mind because one of the core values of the Army is Integrity. I don't know where I would be if I went in already compromising myself and my fellow soldiers. I don't want a career of living a lie. Please help.      Thanks.

They repeatedly asked the company to provide them, in writing, with a list of the missed payments -- probably the simplest thing you could ask for -- and the company gave them a class-A runaround and would simply not do this.      My parents eventually talked to the DA and Consumer Affairs office, who wrote the CC company a letter for them.  The CC company eventually issued a court summons to my parents, all without ever addressing these basic questions.      My parents requested a stay, I believe it's called where they kept corresponding with the DA and delayed the court date.  This was a few months ago.  They were never informed of when or if a new court date would take place.      Just a few days ago my mother was called into the accounting office at work where they told her a judgment had been made against her and she was supposed to have her wages garnished.      My parents called the court, and were told that it was the plaintiff's responsibility to notify them of the court date, which they did not.  My parents scoured their phone records and email junk folder for any kind of notification, but it really appears the CC company scheduled a court date without telling them, and when they of course did not show up to the court the CC company won by default.  As it happens, my mother had surgery, which had been scheduled several months in advance, on the court date they were not informed of...so they would not have been able to attend anyway, and would have had to try and move the date.      The court told my parents to write the judge and explain things.  Meanwhile, they had a whole presentation of their records worked up to present in court, proving that they never missed any payments.  From what I know, it seems open and shut that if they had just been able to show this evidence they would have won.      Any legal people out there have any ideas or advice on this?  It seems like complete BS to me, but apparently legal...that you can file a judgment against someone, they go through a legitimate channel to postpone the date, then you just schedule a new date without telling them and win.  How is that even possible?!?

And no,  we do not just date fat White Women,  who are   considered to be trash or wh*res.   A diversified man will date anyone   of any race.  So why should it matter to you ?

20090219111024AAqHtMH	Politics & Government;Immigration	Do U feel ICE made the right call here ICE agent removes man, 31, during church service given his background?	Do U feel ICE made the right call here ICE agent removes man, 31, during church service given  what his background was and number of times deported ?   On a Sunday morning, in a church sanctuary near Conroe, an off-duty immigration agent tapped Jose Juan Hernandez on the shoulder and asked him to step outside.      A 31-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico with three prior deportations, Hernandez quietly followed the agent and promptly was detained on suspicion of illegal re-entry after deportation, said Gregory Palmore, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman in Houston.       The case would be unremarkable, except for the setting. The fact that Hernandez was detained in church has sparked controversy locally. Hernandez was arrested Oct. 26, pleaded guilty to the re-entry charge this month and is scheduled for sentencing in April. He remains in federal detention in Conroe. Hernandez’s attorney, Rick Soliz, said he plans to file a complaint against the ICE agent in connection with the arrest.      “I wonder what the agent was thinking, if he was thinking at all,” Soliz said. “How do you decide to do that in the middle of a religious service?”      ICE has demonstrated a long-standing reluctance to detain suspected illegal immigrants at churches and schools. The agency waited more than a year before arresting Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who publicly took sanctuary in a West Chicago church to avoid being deported and separated from her U.S.-born son. She was picked up after she left the church and traveled to Los Angeles in 2007 to launch a national campaign for immigration reform.      Palmore confirmed that Hernandez was arrested at the church in October, calling it an “unusual circumstance.” But he defended the agent’s actions as fulfilling his “sworn duty to enforce the nation’s laws.”      He said the agency has guidelines related to arrests “in sensitive community locations.” Palmore said those guidelines are internal and cannot be made public, but they allow agents to make arrests at churches in specific circumstances.      No record of violence   Hernandez is expected to be deported after he serves his sentence. According to court records, he was convicted of a felony drug charge in Montgomery County and deported in 2000. He was deported again in 2001.      Hernandez was convicted in Montgomery County for DWI in January 2004. In October of that year, he was convicted of driving without a valid license. He was deported for a third time in 2004, according to ICE records.      Palmore said the ICE agent took part in one of Hernandez’s earlier arrests and recognized him at the church.      Soliz said his client had never been convicted of a violent crime and had no outstanding warrants at the time of his arrest. Although the agent had legal grounds to make the arrest in the church, Soliz said, doing so appeared to go against ICE’s general practice, specifically citing the Arellano case.      “It’s unbelievable to me that an agent can be so ignorant,” Soliz said. “Just a short time ago, his superiors at the highest levels purposely waited a year for a woman to come out of a church, yet this renegade with a gun and a badge decides in the middle of a religious service to make an arrest.”      ‘They have no respect’   The arrested man’s mother, 51-year-old Ana Maria Hernandez, said she was particularly upset to learn that her son, who has been in the U.S. illegally since age 6, was detained in a church.      “A church is a sacred place,” she said. “They have no respect, not even for that.”      Hernandez regularly attended Conroe First Assembly church, but was at a different church in Montgomery with a friend when arrested.       Michael Moak, a pastor at the church where Hernandez regularly attended, said word of the arrest upset some members of his congregation.      “I think it was distasteful, the way it was done,” he said.      Moak suggested ICE could have arrested Hernandez at his job or home, and “could have been a little more professional,” instead of singling him out at church.      Curtis Collier, president of the U.S. Border Watch group based in Spring, which advocates stricter border controls, said it “might have been a little more prudent” to wait until after the service.      But without knowing all the details, Collier said, “I have to go with the agent’s judgment.”   I think the agent preserved the sanctity of church by peacably removing a wanted fugitve from the presence of the otherwise law abiding worshipers .Note he asked him to step outside.

I see yes and no coming from the media and I'd like to just get the good old facts on what this bill will do and whether it really is a wise decision. Is our country going to come out of the economic turndown or will we just end up with more debt than we started with? I have basic overview of macroeconomics, but it would help with more info.

I found out last week that I have a pedophile living downstairs from me, I always new he a little on the odd side but I thought it was because he was an "artist."  I heard rumors that he molested a child but I'm not one to believe gossip that is until I did some checking online, I found him on the California Megan's Law website. I brought it to the attention of only one other person (outside of my marriage) that was my landlord he was already aware of the information, and claims that he would have never rented an apartment so close to children if he had been the one to rent to him. (as it turns out the former landlady was his friend)    The point is, I really feel uncomfortable living with a pedophile so close, although he is being evicted (for something unrelated) I just want to know if anyone has any tips of protecting children. The only thing I know about his case is, he molested a 10 year old boy, he had sex with him, and un knowingly gave him a fatal STD.       Also I have this fear that he is going to break into my home and snatch my 5 year old       any tips on how to deal with this? Any advice? how can I protect my boys?

20090219111949AAolDqb	Politics & Government;Politics	Who is REALLY responsible for the U.S. financial crisis?	It's not who you probably think.  Read on for some well-suppressed facts, especially you irrational Bush-hating libiots...        Pelosi and her followers would have you believe this all happened because of President Bush and his loyal Senate lapdog, John McCain. Or that big, bad predatory Wall Street banks deserve all the blame.     "The American people are not protected from the risk-taking and the greed of these financial institutions," Pelosi said in 2008, as she vowed congressional hearings.     Only one problem: It's untrue.     Yes, banks did overleverage and take risks they shouldn't have.     But the fact is, President Bush in 2003 tried desperately to stop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from metastasizing into the problem they have since become.     Here's the lead of a New York Times story on Sept. 11, 2003: "The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago."     Bush tried to act. Who stopped him? Congress, especially Democrats with their deep financial and patronage ties to the two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie.     "These two entities — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — are not facing any kind of financial crisis," said Rep. Barney Frank, then ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. "The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing."     It's pretty clear who was on the right side of that debate.     As for presidential contender John McCain, just two years after Bush's plan, McCain also called for badly needed reforms to prevent a crisis like the one we're now in.     "If Congress does not act," McCain said in 2005, "American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system and the economy as a whole."     Sounds like McCain was spot on.     But his warnings, too, were ignored by Congress.     To hear today's Democrats, you'd think all this started in the last couple years. But the crisis began much earlier. The Carter-era Community Reinvestment Act forced banks to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers, mostly in minority areas.     Age-old standards of banking prudence got thrown out the window. In their place came harsh new regulations requiring banks not only to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers, but to do so on the basis of race.     These well-intended rules were supercharged in the early 1990s by President Clinton. Despite warnings from GOP members of Congress in 1992, Clinton pushed extensive changes to the rules requiring lenders to make questionable loans.     Lenders who refused would find themselves castigated publicly as racists. As noted in an IBD editorial, no fewer than four federal bank regulators scrutinized financial firms' books to make sure they were in compliance.     Failure to comply meant your bank might not be allowed to expand lending, add new branches or merge with other companies. Banks were given a so-called "CRA rating" that graded how diverse their lending portfolio was.     It was economic hardball.     "We have to use every means at our disposal to end discrimination and to end it as quickly as possible," Clinton's comptroller of the currency, Eugene Ludwig, told the Senate Banking Committee in 1993.     And they meant it.     In the name of diversity, banks began making huge numbers of loans that they previously would not have. They opened branches in poor areas to lift their CRA ratings.      Meanwhile, Congress gave Fannie and Freddie the go-ahead to finance it all by buying loans from banks, then repackaging and securitizing them for resale on the open market.     That's how the contagion began.     With those changes, the subprime market took off. From a mere $35 billion in loans in 1994, it soared to $1 trillion by 2008.     Wall Street eagerly sold the new mortgage-backed securities. Not only were they pooled investments, mixing good and bad, but they were backed with the implicit guarantee of government.     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac grew to become monsters, accounting for nearly half of all U.S. mortgage loans. At the time of their 2008 bailouts, they held $5.4 trillion in loans on their books. About $1.4 trillion of those were subprime.     As they grew, Fannie and Freddie grew heavily involved in "community development," giving money to local housing rights groups and "empowering" the groups, such as ACORN, for whom Barack Obama once worked in Chicago.     Warning signals were everywhere. Yet at every turn, Democrats in Congress halted attempts to stop the madness. It happened in 1992, again in 2000, in 2003 and in 2005.  Since 1989, Fannie and Freddie have spent an estimated $140 million on lobbying Washington. They contributed millions to politicians, mostly Democrats, including Senator Chris Dodd (No. 1 recipient) and Barack Obama (No. 3 recipient, despi

20090219120504AAUuajQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What's the best way to deal with a cease and desist letter from a large corporation?	I own a few small internet stores. A couple of them have registered trade marks in their domains.       Here is an example of what happened. To protect the names of the corporation and myself I will use the term BigCorp in the place of the actual company's name. I make it clear on our stores' websites that we are not BigCorp and that we are not affiliated with BigCorp. We just sell stuff that works with other items that BigCorp Sells.      Let's say I own a store on a domain called BigCorpStuffForSale.com      I then get a Cease and Desist letter from BigCorp who wants the following:   Do the following and respond in two weeks to this agreement:      You agree to    1. Cease use of all trademarks and logos   2. Cease making and or selling all items that bear or incorperate our trademarks and logos   3. Transfer all domain names that include the name BigCorp to BigCorp.   4. represent and warrant to BigCorp that the domains we found you using are the only ones that infringe on our name.   5. by no later than (two weeks) un-register all trade names with the name BigCorp with all government offices you registered them with.   6. represent and warrant the following information:    a. tell us how many unauthorized items you sold while using our trademarks and logos    b.Tell us gross revenue made on unauthorized item sales    c. Tell us how long you have been selling unauthorized items    d. Tell us who bought the unauthorized items and what they bought    e. Tell us who made the unauthorized items.   7. Pay us 25% of gross sales of unauthorized products or $25,000. (Whichever is greater)      You also agree that not following this agreement will cause irreparable harm to BigCorp and that you will be entitled to entry of both a   preliminary and permanent injunction against you. You also agree to pay all costs incurred to enforce this agreement.      You also agree not to do this again.                  Fortunately, I do not sell unauthorized items. I just sell items under a domain name that include BigCorp in the name and has their logo on the page. My plan is to do the following, please tell me if this seems OK:      1. Shutdown all stores that use BigCorp in the domain name.   2. Xfer the domain names to BigCorp.   3. Stop using their logos from now on.   4. I do not plan on signing any agreement.   5. I do not plan on giving them any more information.

The Democrats take control of both the House and Senate.      11-4-2008 The Dow was at 9925.28.  B. Hussein Obama is elected President of the United States.      Today the Dow is at an abysmal 7526.64 and falling.      It would seem like everything was fine until the Democrats took control of the House and the Senate...but since then we have LOST 4630.00 points in the Dow.         http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/cha...       Yeah...yeah...I know it's all Bush's and the Republican's fault.  But how do you explain this:      11-9-1994 The Dow was at 3830.74.  The Republicans took control of the House and the Senate.      11-7-2006 The Dow was at 12,156.77.  The Democrats took control of the House and Senate.        Today the Dow is at 7526.64 and falling.      Twelve years of Republican control produces a gain of 8326.03.   Less than two and a half years of Democrat control produces a LOSS of 4630.00.      I know...I know...it's all Bush's and the Republicans fault.  Yeah...Yeah...couldn't have anything at all to do with the Democrats.  Yeah...Yeah....it's about more than the Dow....Which is why before the Republicans took office unemployment was at 7.5% and now that the Democrats have been in control for over two years we are right back there!

I had to sign his name but I was told that that was ok since I have his Power of Attorney.  This year I will have to sign again for him because he isn't quite back yet but will be though after the tax deadline in April.  Also, is he going to Pardon Blagoevich and Burris.  My grandfather told me that Richard Nixon (a former US President) was forced to resign from office because of tapes that linked him to malfeseance.  Obama might be able to get the tapes from Illinois surpressed if he simply pardons the two men and the tapes could be destroyed by the Justice Department so Obama's involvement will not be known.

I came back....  and police arrested me....  they read me my rights...   and anything I say and be silence...   so I chose to be silence...

Then there were papers I had to sign...   I couldn't read those papers....   my lawyer wasn't there to explain them to me...   So I signed them.      Then I went in court,,,  I didn't know what I was charged with, I had no interpreter....          That was over....          Then I found out I pleaded guilty (the paper I signed) and I am a Felon.   That was 1996.       My lawyer didn't tell me anything about the explugement or post... or whatever...  I had no trial...

Obviously, in Obama's mind, no one needs to earn more than $500,000 per year.  And yes, professional sports teams are subsidized by the government.  Usually in the way of facilities to play in and in some cases tax breaks.

20090219150801AAEfXkQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Getting desperate to leave  shared housing... What can I  do? Please help?	Hi, i'm a student in a shared house 7 months in on a 11 month fixed term agreement with a letting company.      I am desperate to leave because other tenants (formerly friends) are not respecting my right to live here in peace.      They enter my room without permission when im away, caused quite abit of damage to the property and not reported it themselves, have tried to intimidate me to stop me from contacting the letting agent about such things.       However, there is one major problem - one of the tenants has allowed his girlfriend to stay for a total of 10 months continuously. Its against our tenancy agreement as he needs to inform the letting agent and pay a charge, but she is still here and the tenant is forcing me to keep his secret!!!       This is costing me because of higher than normal utility bills, and because i have asked why she is still here (it changed from a temporary to permanent basis). Both tenants have both turned against me... they never question each other some solidarity bs.      My question is - What do i do? Should i report them? I worry about the financial consequences i may face and what legal rights do i have?       Please help,      Kind Regards.

I hire attorney to help me find life insurance of the unexpectedly passed away boyfriend. When I received attorney’s contract I realized that it could cost too much money for me and I decided to cancel his service. He was trying to convince me to continue his service but I refused. I received his bill and according to bill he charged me for all those convincing e-mails which he send to me after I cancel his service. I would like to know if attorney can charge money for all those e-mails. I sent concerns regarding his bills to him and now he is charging money for explanation regarding my concerns also.       Is it correct? Can attorney charge money when client would like receive explanation why he is charging money for any correspondence just between him and me after service was canceled?

We the People of the United States cannot sit back and laze around like our generation has been brought up on... we have to act now and act fast because the Federal Government cannot fix this crisis on their own. Our economy is slipping and I as a person want to do something about it! does anybody out there have any ideas as to what I could possibly do to stimulate the economy myself with the help of the rest of the nation? I thought about writing a paper/letter and mailing it to every major newspaper, news corporation, city hall, and yes... even to Capitol Lane such as; the White House and the Capitol Building. And also email the letter to a majority of the email accounts listed on the internet of every major city in the United States, and in that letter I would state what and when We the People should do and how to it..... but I STILL need some advice people so please please answer/ or you can email me at We.the.People.50@gmail.com

Came home got ill, re-admitted to hospital to realise i caught group a streptococcus bacteria and all hospital staff who spoke to me knew i picked up the bug from there - without admitting it. I was in hospital for 2 weeks without my baby she suffered too i actually thought i wasnt going to make it thats how bad i got. Now im thinking should i sue them or not go throught the hassle as i have a newborn now? serious replies only please as this could happen to you or someone you know very easily,       The staff were not all that caring either and the strangest thing is a doctor DID NOT come to see me for discharge as they knew i wanted to know how i got the bug in the first place.
