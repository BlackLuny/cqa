jDY8KsvTaa	Here's an email you should send out at the next available opportunity (I'm calling the manager you were emailing Jack Spratt, and the mean consultant Jill):<br>  <br>  "Mr Spratt,<br>  In regards to my previous email, it has been very publicly brought to my attention that it may have been misconstrued as an inappropriate expression of impatience.  If this was your impression, I wish to apologize and assure you that I will refrain from engaging in any form of casual communication while assisting yourself and Ms Jill with your department's project.<br>  <br>  Kind Regards,<br>  Sam."<br>  <br>  Make sure you CC Jill and your manager (even though he's not there currently).|`|ColDKgGuaa	You're right. She probably has a bit of a crush on your manager, and was jealous.|`|JX0I6x1paa	From what you've said her reaction was totally over the top.  I suggest you speak to your supervisor and explain how her behaviour made you feel.  Say that the recipient of the email did not have a problem so you can't see why this other manager got so bent out of shape over it and that her dressing you down in front of everyone was not only uncalled for but made you feel very uncomfortable.  Your supervisor should speak to this woman on your behalf and put her in her place.  I feel you are owed an apology and it should be in front of the people who were present when she yelled at you.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	In the mean time, ignore her, if she makes her presence to again, let her know you have no reason to answer to her, and leave it at that. If she continues to be an ***, just walk away,|`|2ca6c2e28b7d99283f08c3248b8b6a44aa	Hmmm....well did that manger who you were writing to...did she address you in the e-mail as "Hello there" or was it by your name or just "Hello"? If she was informal then it would be ok for you as well.<br>  <br>  SOmething like this happend to me. You seem calm...i almost started to cry and quit the next week! I used to intern with this financial services company. The manger there is usually calm and jokes around a bit you know. So one time I joked about something and he went ballistic. I mean in front of the WHOLE office-5 people- one of them being the regional head, he yelled and said "don't joke like this this is not very professionl...this is how rumors get started. you are here to work blah blah blah." THEN we went in private and he repeated what he said earlier in a better way. The joke was jsut me saying "ohh so you go drunk thsi weekend huh." He was talking about his weekend with the rest of the mangers. I went to the bathroom and cried. And I quit the next week.<br>  <br>  You should talk to your manager about this and see what he/she advices. Be clear and say what you intentions were and what your position is and clearly that was unnecessary and unprofessional. You shoudl talk to your the manager directly above you and maybe they can set up a meeting (b/w the 4 of yall) where that bi*chy manager apologizes to you!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	I've been in both shoes and then owned my own business.<br>  <br>  She was out of line to chastise you in front of other employees.<br>  This should be done quietly or in private.<br>  <br>  Not knowing the full conversation by email, and not knowing your full relationship with your manager, I can't judge that.<br>  I once had a very personal relationship with my super, we had many friendly letters back and forth, but we both knew my abilities and still maintained professional respect.<br>  You may have crossed the line, in as much as you sent a CC to another manager, even though she was not your immediate supervisor.<br>  <br>  I will say this.<br>  As unprofessional as she was, take the criticism and learn from it.<br>  <br>  I once had a boss that might be considered the worst.<br>  When I owned my own business, I always remembered that I learned from him, "what not to do" with my employees.|`|mQZDizMVaa	That "manager"/consultant crossed the line and wanted an audience. She wanted to show her "authority." You handled it very well.<br>  <br>  Request a meeting with that manager, and yours. Explain to your manager exactly what happened, that "manager's" behavior to you and in front of others, and request that if there's any discrepancy in the future, it be discussed behind closed doors. Document the fact you held a meeting and her behavior was discussed; also document the results. How would she like it if someone blasted her out in front of others? She owes you an apology.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Therefore His crucifixion would not have been documented so much. Even so it is recorded in the following.<br>  <br>  It is documented in the Gospels by more than a couple of authors.<br>  <br>  Non Christian sources:<br>  <br>  Josephus wrote in Antiquities, Book 18 , Chapter 3, mentioning Jesus and that he died on the cross.<br>  <br>  "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day. "<br>  <br>  Tacitus, a Roman wrote in Annals, Book XV.<br>  "Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus,(Jesus Christ) from whom the name (Christians) had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea,"<br>  <br>  It is even recorded in the Talmud. Written by Jesus' enemies.<br>  <br>  On the eve of Passover they hanged Yeshu* [= Jesus]. And an announcer went out in front of him for forty days, saying: 'He is going to be stoned, because he practised sorcery and enticed and led Israel astray. Anyone who knows anything in his favor, let him come and plead in his behalf.' But not having found anything in his favor, they hanged him on the eve of Passover.<br>  <br>  As for the exact date. 9am (Mark 15:25), on the 14th of Nisan. The year was probably 30 AD. Time keeping wasn't as developed as it is now.<br>   <br>  The mere fact that it did happen and three days later Jesus Christ rose from the grave gives us assurance that He has conquered death and offers the free gift of eternal life to all.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	The last supper was a passover, so he was crucified Nisan 15 and raised Nisan 17.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, if you go through the Old Testament and look at the events which happen on Nisan 15 and 17, you will discover some astounding types.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: @ all the less-than-educated answerers above me, go to wikipedia and look up "Christ myth theory". You are making yourselves look REALLY dumb.<br>  <br>  Here's the basic outline:<br>  <br>  Richard Burridge and Graham Gould state that the questioning of Jesus' existence is not accepted by mainstream critical scholarship.[8] Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the Jesus never existed thesis as "effectively refuted".[9] Graham N. Stanton writes, "Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically. There is general agreement that, with the possible exception of Paul, we know far more about Jesus of Nazareth than about any first- or second century Jewish or pagan religious teacher."[10] James Charlesworth writes "No reputable scholar today questions that a Jew named Jesus son of Joseph lived; most readily admit that we now know a considerable amount about his actions and basic teachings ..."[11] Michael Grant believes that the Christ myth theory fails to satisfy modern critical methodology, and is rejected by all but a few modern scholars.[12]<br>  <br>  However, the question of Jesus' historical existence is an ongoing inquiry, with initiatives such as the Jesus Project actively investigating the available evidence. Earl Doherty states "after a survey of the history of research into the historical Jesus, Van Voorst tackles 'the noisy side current' of Jesus mythicism. He notes that over one hundred books and essays during the last two centuries have denied the existence of Jesus. Their arguments, he says, are dismissed as 'weak and bizarre' by contemporary New Testament scholars. Van Voorst is quite right in saying that 'mainstream scholarship today finds it unimportant.' Most of their comment (such as those quoted by Michael Grant) are limited to expressions of contempt."[103]<br>  <br>  Doherty sums up the problem:<br>  <br>  Van Voorst’s opening sentence of Chapter One is worth commenting on: "Jesus of Nazareth is arguably the most influential person in history." There are few who would dispute this; and even mythicists could agree if the word “person” were changed to "figure," since it would leave open the question as to whether such a figure as is found in the Gospels actually existed as an historical individual. But the comment worth making is this. Quite apart from what may be Van Voorst’s own confessional interests (which I will not presume to know), this statement, one shared by so many, religious and otherwise, demonstrates what a sea change would be involved, what a shocking reorientation would be required for much of the world, if strong doubt on the very existence of that "most influential person" could be established. It is not surprising that interests, both religious and secular, have traditionally mounted a campaign against it, a tooth and nail struggle, a disdainful dismissal of the very idea and those who promote it. [103]<br>  <br>  Referring to an early article (Challenging Doherty: Critiquing the Mythicist Case) Doherty states that mainstream scholarship is guilty of a "notable lack of proper understanding of the mythicist case and effective arguments to be brought against it."[104]<br>  <br>  "The issue of credibility is a subjective one. Quite apart from a disposition to examine, or refuse to examine, an alternative scenario, one must be able and willing to think outside the box before alternatives can impress themselves upon one. There are those, scholars and laypeople alike, who regularly assume that something 'big' and unique, some powerful figure, had to be responsible for the Christian movement. But if one has consistently misread that movement, failed to recognize its antecedents, the steps of its development, imposed preconceptions upon it, they will be forever forced to make the same erroneous assumption, and alternatives will not commend themselves."[103]|`|YUAegpPoaa	Which calendar would you prefer I use?<br>  <br>  Seriously, If you cannot give me the exact date something happened you can decide it didn't?

RNKSq3iEaa	It is a false statement to say that criticizing Islam makes you racist. However, this misunderstanding probably arose because the majority of people who criticize Islam ARE racist. In the West, many people have a very limited understanding of Islam. Many associate Islam with brown skin, or use "Arab" and "Muslim" interchangeably. We think of the Middle Eastern culture in general when we think of Muslims. And when the criticisms come, they seem to be aimed at Arabs in general.<br>  <br>  I have heard many intelligent criticisms (mine included) but sadly, most people who bash it do so simply because it's seen as a weird, foreign religion to Westerners. In fact, most people who criticize ANY religion make really stupid arguments.<br>  <br>  In my country, a Sikh temple was victimized by an arsonist after 9/11. Why? He saw brown-skinned people there and thought, "Oh, they're Muslims!"<br>  <br>  See the American election - which candidate got suspected of being a Muslim? The white one or the brown one? Both claimed to be Christian. Did anyone doubt it when the white candidate made this claim? Hmm. If McCain's name was "Ahmed" and he had brown skin, do you think this would still be the case?<br>  <br>  The stupid people speak the loudest. This is always the case. For every knowledgeable person who has studied Islam, knows the difference between race and religion, and forms an intelligent and articulate argument against Islam itself, there are ten people who think Arab = Muslim and proceed to bash the Middle Eastern cultures and all Arabs.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It's just muslims capitalizing on the obvious notion that racism is bad.<br>  <br>  You know, it's like calling people who disagree with you communists.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	persecution complex|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	It's an excuse.<br>  Islam at one moment BRAGS it is of all races. Then at the next moment if it suits them they declare they are a RACE. The proof they are NOT race is idiotically simple.<br>  <br>  can you change race? because according to some muslims you must! When you convert into Islam your RACE changes... and if you apostate it changes also.<br>  <br>  anyone can see how blindly stupid that thinking is.|`|mM8HUQMzaa	Duh on them!<br>  Islam is not a race!|`|koXcq0l1aa	I know, people are so quick to pull the stupid race card these days.  Personally disgusts me.|`|vmv1rP76aa	^agrees with Isobel. <br>  <br>  Yea, just like if you disagree with Christianity you're "persecuting them" and you're "in league with the devil". <br>  <br>  Personally, I'm probably going to be considered racist for believing Israel is manipulating American Christians to do their bidding by forming a "fellowship" between "Jews and Christians", meanwhile Israel gets its right to war while Christians believe they're doing "God's work" by contributing to Israel and demonizing the "enemy". But yea, Israel's got the fundamentalists on a string, that's for sure. It even gets more political with Messianic Jews corrupting the Jewish religion, this all being under the guise of the evangelicals who want to convert Jews. Goes to show you. <br>  <br>  But yes, off-topic rant aside, I disagree with the major monotheistic faiths, but I am not racist. I am merely criticizing mentalities and actions, which I'm sure is what you're doing.<br>  <br>  PS I'm not saying the middle east is right or any better, especially since many islamic countries are in fact bad, and many followers of the muslim faith aren't ideal, but who's to say the same about christians who persecute others and act like they have the "right" religion or some jews who are elitist and frown upon gentiles, some not even associating with them (been there, dealt with that). <br>  <br>  Edit: Paperback, I'm only saying I feel some are being manipulative. I'm sorry if I offended you any, I usually love your posts and how you speak well for Judaism. I'm just saying not all is right with certain organizations either. <br>  <br>  And yes I KNOW Messianics are Christians. But they're in league with some of Israeli government too, so that's why I'm a bit concerned. I actually wrote an article about the deception of "Messianic Judaism". <br>  <br>  Its not Israel, its just some politicians and a lot what goes on here in the USA isn't right. That's all.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	edward said whose an atheist from christian origin made it clear how islam is deformed because it's a semite religion. and now when it became unpopular to attack jews, they attack islam because it was founded by the semite arabic people. <br>  the question is are you reasonably criticizing islam, which i do my self, or do you have hidden racist agendas like many European and american racist scholars had.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Well said.<br>  <br>  There is nothing remotely 'racist' in stating FACTS about Islam. Islam is a racist, supremacist, sexist ideology. If I stated that the KKK was like that, which it is, would that be 'racist'? No, just a statement of fact. Same with Islam.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying most or all Muslims are racist; but their RELIGION is.  It's all there in the Quran, in black and white.

6a9AfhsLaa	So you were clan hopping, eh? And now you want a  new clan to protect you, and to find that clan, you are using the internet? Interesting tactic. <br>  <br>  Here is my advice to you, I suggest you take it. <br>  <br>  Learn to protect yourself. Lycs and vamps are NOT the most of understanding energetic beings. Nor are they the most loyal, as you have probably guessed. Your knowledge of vampirism and lycanism seems to be a little, new, for want of a better word, and I would suggest doing some research before going too far with something you may not (Not saying you don't, but your info isn't the most, erm, well put together vat of information on the internet. No offense) You need to be able to protect yourself (energetically, obviously) I am a solitary, and I still need help from time to time, but protection isn't really my strong point, so I know that it can be difficult. But you need to know how to mold your energy into what you need it to be. Do you know how? (Email me for more info) In the world of vamps and lycs, you can only depend on yourself. And you need to do that. Email if you need more info, and next time, don't cross fences without knowing what you're getting into.|`|96AQZUGyaa	Join the local goth crowd.

vhlORK4Waa	So you want to become Jewish?<br>  <br>  Well, you're not alone. While there are about 5.6 million Jews in America (representing roughly 1.5% of the population), over 200,000 of them are converts. But before you choose to join the party, consider this: converting from one religion to another is always a big step, but converting to Judaism is different; you're not joining a religion, you're joining a culture. Because of the history of anti-Semitism, the Jewish community is a tight-knit group, connected on many levels above and beyond the technicalities of religious beliefs and practices<br>  <br>  MAKE SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO CONVERT TO JUDAISM<br>  Sound like a stupid piece of advice? Well it's not. There are many good reasons to become Jewish, but those reasons do NOT include: <br>  To spite your parents.<br>  Because you're bored.<br>  Why not? <br>  The most common reasons people give for converting include:<br>  <br>  "I am converting because I am marrying a Jew."<br>  "I find the spiritual beliefs and cultural characteristics of Judaism profoundly appealing."<br>  "I wish to give my children a clear religious identity." <br>  So how can you be sure that you want to convert? One word: research. Read as many books about the Jewish faith as possible, and try to get a sense of whether Jewish values and beliefs resonate with your own. You can find a comprehensive list of books about the Jewish faith at www.jewishnet.net/subjects/lib.html. Some of the most basic foundations of the Jewish religion are the belief in one God who is kind and loving, that people always have free will, and (this one is a biggie) that Jesus Christ was not the messiah. Instead, Jews believe that the messiah has not yet come. <br>  These are some of the religious foundations, but there are also many cultural foundations to Judaism, most prominently a huge importance placed on the values of family and education. As you are probably aware, Judaism is more than a religion, it's a culture.<br>  <br>  FIND YOUR DREAM RABBI<br>  Once you have firmly decided to become Jewish, the next step is to find a rabbi who will be your sponsor for conversion. This rabbi will take you through all the necessary steps, and will proclaim you ready for conversion only when he thinks that you're ready. So it's important to pick a rabbi you like and think you can get along with. When picking a rabbi, you have to consider many things, including location, whether you have to pay (and how much you have to pay) to be a member of the temple, and the temple's level of religiosity. There are four basic levels of religiousness: <br>  Orthodox<br>  Conservative<br>  Reform<br>  Reconstructionist<br>  <br>  At this point, your course of study will be overseen by the rabbi. A typical course of study may last 6 months to a year, but it can take longer, especially for conversion to Orthodoxy. Most temples have special classes for those who are planning to convert. A typical course of study will include basic Jewish beliefs and religious practices, including prayer services, the history of the Jewish people, the Jewish home, the Jewish holidays and life cycle, the Holocaust, and Israeli history and politics. The study of Hebrew is also included, which means that you'll have to learn a whole new alphabet (it's not an easy language to learn, but that really doesn't matter. You just need to show a willingness to at least familiarize yourself with the language).<br>  <br>  As you embark on your quest for Judaic knowledge, the rabbi will ask you to start implementing some of the Jewish practices in your home, such as keeping kosher, so be prepared to make a full-fledged commitment. Judaism is not interested in active recruitment or garnering "paper" members.<br>  <br>  HAVE A CONVERSION CEREMONY<br>  OK, it's one year later, and the rabbi thinks that you are ready to officially convert. There are four main parts of a conversion ceremony: <br>  Facing a religious court<br>  Immersion<br>  Circumcision (men)<br>  Picking a new name<br>  <br>  Good luck in your spiritual quest. Being Catholic won't make it harder or easier, <br>  <br>  Halcon|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	No, it won't. Judaism doesn't recognize any other religion as an "identity", just whether someone is Jewish or gentile, so your being Catholic-confirmed or not-won't make any difference.<br>  <br>  Halcon's answer is worth reading thoroughly (although the temple/synagogue isn't really relevant to choosing a rabbi for this).<br>  <br>  I'm an Orthodox Jew, so please feel free to e-mail me with any questions you might have on the subject.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	The fact that you were a Catholic won't be a problem if you are really serious about converting to Judaism. <br>  <br>  I can relate to your dilemma:<br>  <br>  I was raised in a Fundamentalist Christian family; when I got older I found out that my mother had been Jewish before she married my dad and converted to Christianity. <br>  I too was drawn to Judaism (my mother's previous faith) and I later was able to return to Judaism by doing Baal Teshuvah (repentance).<br>  <br>  I am very happy that I was able to return. <br>  <br>  We will be more than happy to include you into the Jewish fold if you really feel it in your heart to join us. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck on your spiritual journey. ( :<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is some info. on the conversion process:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.convertingtojudaism.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.convertingtojudaism.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aish.com/literacy/judaism123/Conversion_to_Judaism.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com/literacy/judaism123/...</a>|`|8I9uduIiaa	No problem; anyone who really wants to is welcome to join the Jewish family :)<br>  <br>  I recommend:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messiahtruth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.messiahtruth.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.becomingjewish.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.becomingjewish.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|wT9PTRgtaa	you can jump into any boat,but think twice before you act...but i support you leaving catholic church which does idolatry in the name of god.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	No.  Provided that you're ready to *completely* give up the idea of Jesus as any sort of savior, it will make no difference at all.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	if u want to be jewish then nothing should get in the way.<br>  <br>  ceremonies are just rituals that only mean as much as u value them|`|0yTM98Odaa	I don't see why that would affect you being able to convert.  Confirmation is just a Catholic ritual.  I know when people convert to Judaism it's a long process but I'm sure it will be worth it!  Good luck!|`|UIJorsD7aa	Having been a Catholic will not make it more difficult for you to convert to Judaism.<br>  When converting to Judaism according to Jewish law (which nowadays means an Orthodox conversion), your sponsoring rabbi will try to dissuade you in order to determine your sincerity.  (This is done about three times).<br>  In my Orthodox community, there are a number of converts of all colors and backgrounds; they have all completed their conversion process successfully and have been embraced by the Jewish community.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	The fact that you were raised Catholic will not make conversion to Judaism more difficult - anyone is allowed to convert to Judaism if they are truly sincere.<br>  <br>  However, I imagine that Catholics may personally have a harder time accepting the tenets of Judaism than people of other faiths, because the two religions directly contradict one another in so many ways.  For example, Catholics believe in the trinity, and yet still say they believe in only one G-d.  For Jews, that is impossible - as soon as you accept multiple versions of G-d (or a "triune god"), it is no longer monotheism.  Jews also consider the Catholic practice of icons - statues of Jesus, Mary and the saints - to be a direct violation of the commandment against graven images, and considers praying to those statues as idolatry.  (Please note that this is NOT a slam against Catholicism or an attack on Catholic beliefs, just an explanation of how Jewish thinking differs.)  So if you grew up fully accepting Catholic dogma, it may be harder for you to accept the Jewish point of view on these subjects.  But that is a matter of your own personal struggle for truth, and not an indication that it will automatically be harder.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, having seen your other question, I do have to say that if you hope to convert, you will have to give up the plan to marry your non-Jewish fiance.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: No, you wouldn't have to give up your non-Jewish fiancee if you convert to Reform Judaism - there are Reform rabbis that wouldn't marry you in a religious ceremony but they would recognize your secular marriage.  Orthodox and Conservative Rabbis wouldn't marry you and a non-Jewish man.<br>  <br>  I was raised Christian, became a pagan and I'm now studying Judaism and I am loving it!  I do understand the draw.  Find a nearby synagogue in whatever branch you feel is best for you, talk with the rabbi and take an Intro to Judaism class.<br>  <br>  Orthodox conversion takes the longest, is more detailed and strict and is recognized by all branches, including the religious officials in Israel.<br>  <br>  Conservative is a little less restrictive and takes a little less time.  You can immigrate to Israel but you can't marry another Jew in Israel or be buried in a Jewish graveyard unless you're Orthodox (although marriages conducted outside of Israel are recognized, no matter what branch).<br>  <br>  Reform and Reconstruction Judaism takes less time than a conservative conversion.<br>  <br>  All require dedication, a LOT of study, sincerity and a joy of learning.|`|AA12245463	More than half of my conversion group were former Catholics.  Catholics, more than anyone else, were delighted to find that not only are questions allowed in Judaism, they are encouraged!<br>  <br>  It is my experience that most former Christians had more trouble giving up Santa than Jesus.  All of us are inundated for more than two months with Santa and commercialized Christmas.  It is particularly annoying during the conversion process!<br>  .<br>  .|`|6jAVElX7aa	you have to be able to give up your faith in Christ Jesus as Lord and Saviour, also the rosary as they dont believe in the virgin Mary. and I dont believe they believe in the confession box.

If you knew God had completely forgiven you, then there wouldn't be any reason for you to have fear of death and hell.<br>  <br>  But is this possible? Yes!—and the reason is because Jesus Christ has already taken upon Himself the punishment you and I deserve. You see, you are right about one thing: You and I deserve to be punished for our sins. God is holy and just, and even one sin would be enough to banish us from His presence forever. The Bible solemnly warns, "It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Hebrews 10:31).<br>  <br>  But the Bible doesn't stop there! It goes on to tell us that God loves us—and because He loves us, He sent His only Son into the world to die for our sins. We deserve to die and be separated from God forever—but Jesus Christ took our place. He was without sin, but when He died on the cross all our sins were placed on Him, and He took the punishment and hell we deserve.<br>  <br>  And that is why you don't have to fear God's punishment any longer! What must you do? The Bible's answer is simple: Believe Christ died for you, and then receive Him into your life. Trust Christ and invite Him into your life today—and when you do, God has promised to forgive you, completely and fully. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|d407489328e11c77cf619f10536fe91faa	Read the islamic Guidance Quran and the life history of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)|`|AA10847209	Like many others, you might try reading the Bible looking for loopholes.

Many women do use the silent treatment as punishment, again because she is either angry or her feelings have been hurt and she wants him to suffer the only way she knows how to make that happen.  If it's an occasional thing then the man should just placate her because she is waiting for him to apologize.  If this is ordinary behavior then let her sulk until she's ready to apologize to him and open the door to calm, adult communication.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It is effective punishment.|`|9NniKJcEaa	lol.

mQZDizMVaa	It's either:<br>  <br>  1-She's friendly with someone higher up<br>  2-She's a relative to someone higher up<br>  3-She's kissing up to someone higher up...and if your boss writes her up, it could cost him his job. I've seen it happen. By the same token, he shouldn't have to quit because of her.<br>  <br>  One of the above may apply, especially since your boss isn't comfortable around her, she gets paid for doing nothing and complains whenever your boss gives her something to do. She's an opportunist-using her bad attitude to get over, has found her "niche" and figures she's there for life. Big Mistake. Realilty's been saying no job's permanent-look what happened to Lehman Brothers, Linen & Things, etc.  <br>  <br>  I worked with someone like her and I figured it out: You Really Don't Know Who Knows Who. You don't know who calls/sees who on weekends/holidays/after work/even on birthdays(!)<br>  <br>  Make sure your boss put in writing the fact that you'll assign tasks to her from him. If he gave you a title, or title upgrade, include that also. If she refuses to do anything, or gives you a hard time-document: date, dept., your full name/title, her full name/title/Project title, her attitude when she received it. Describe exactly what the project consisted of and due date, give a copy to your boss. Maybe when he sees documentation something could be done-but I doubt it, if she falls under one of the 3 points I mentioned above. Your documentation may or may not make a difference, but it's worth a shot.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile try toughing this out. The only other way I could see this changing is if/when new management comes in, or, heaven forbid, your company starts downsizing/closes/lays off. In any event, good luck.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	OK as I see this your boss gave you a job to do, you either do it, or talk to the boss; or quit.

Just force her to do the task you assign to her and tell her as her superior, you have the right to assign her the task. Tell her that as an employee there, there are rules to follows like following the superiors' orders. Tell her that her job is competitive and that if she keeps complaining about the tasks assigned, with the bad economy now, the company will notice that she is not keeping up with others and does not have a good attitude towards her work. If she wants to keep her job, she have to do her part. Dont worry, no one likes her anyways so they cant be bothered with her when she complains.
AA10246871	No, it means "submission." <br>  <br>  Salaam means peace. Since it's one of the Semitic languages, it's very close to the Hebrew word Shalom, which also means peace.<br>  <br>  My father is Arab, and I have spent a great deal of time in the Middle East. Alas, I do not speak Arabic, as my father was trying to master English when I was a baby, and he thought it best to use English with me. Additionally, he was leery of using Arabic, as my mother is American, and he was afraid that I would become confused by the use of two languages. (So much for that, I was fluent in Spanish by the age of 6, and there was no confusion. I have also added French and Latin to my skills, and still no confusion, though they are, all, dormant right now.)<br>  <br>  One of my father's best friends (now deceased) was a professor of Middle Eastern languages at the American University in Cairo. When I was a teenager, I spent my summers in Cairo, and he and I spent a lot of time talking. He was fluent in his native Arabic, as well as English, French, Hebrew, German and Yiddish. (He learned German to make it easier for him to learn Yiddish.) He explained the whole submission vs. peace thing to me in great detail, going into roots and branching out from there. It does, definitely, mean submission.<br>  <br>  My one question is could it be possible that some of the Muslims making this mistaken claim are actually not fluent in English, and are saying Islam is a religion of peace? I know I have found some very convoluted explanations of Islamic teachings which even I, though not a Muslim, know to be incorrect. When I read them carefully, it becomes clear from the English usage that a great deal is being lost in translation.<br>  <br>  Salaam.|`|AA10248239	The American Heritage Dictionary describes it thus: "[Ar.

If someone tells you otherwise, then they're not good Muslims. If someone cant' tell you that this means peace through submission in Dar al-Islam (the house of Islam) then they're not good Muslims. Of course, the different sects of Islam will have different means to achieve this goal. So what you should do is study it like you would any other religion and make the best informed decision that you can. Any faith is dependent on the individual's interpretation and their interaction with the world around them. So in other words, beware the radicals/fundamentalists and the overly liberals and understand that any religion claiming to be about peace will attempt to guide you (not tell you) how to live a peaceful coexistence with people around you.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	The Arabic root of Islam is "Salami" - excuse me, "Salame," meaning peace, purity, submission, and obedience.

GrRXAjF7aa	It has to do with the days when god created the earth.<br>  This is why 7 is a lucky number - because on the seventh day God saw that it was good, and he rested, and that day became the sabbath, a day of worship for all men to rest.<br>  On the sixth day, God created man. And a few years later, man obeyed the devil, and committed the first sin, and was cast out of Eden. <br>  The sixth day was the day when God made the creation that would turn against him, thanks to the devil. So 6 became a sign of mankind, and by extension, of the devil that lead them astray.<br>  After that, 3 became a sign of humankind, because we are caught between heaven and hell, and for some reason that makes us a 3 instead of a 6.5...<br>  3x6 = 666 (or something like that, lol)|`|KTNqah9eaa	I wouldn't get too hooked up on this since in many cultures 666 is a fantastic number.|`|quYLRIrgaa	616 and 666 are both called the 'number of the beast' (there are more than one source for the book of Revelations and they have different numbers. 666 is the most widely accepted, but some folk think 616 is the better interpretation)<br>  It's said in the book of Revelations something along the lines that Satan will put this number on everything as his mark.|`|V7f6pQy6aa	I think the number 6 is known as a bad number in the bible and 3 also is a bad number so thats why three sixes is a bad number, i have heard of a 619 but that is that name of a fighting move done by a wrestler called rey masterio, but yeah, i dont read the biblt at all but i learned that in highschool.|`|crHWAoaWaa	666 was a symbol in numerology  (an ancient way of fortune telling) I believe it was associated to satan, the hebrews believed.|`|tedOdb7jaa	Gods number is 777<br>  and satans number is 666<br>  <br>  Satan will always be lower than god.

Included in this is a deception. The whole world is convinced that a certain individual or antichrist is the true christ when it is really not. The scriptures give clues about who this character is, to include a number that has to do with who it is. What is interesting is what is revealed using the two numbers 616 and 666. 666 is vstr in Hebrew which is vav, samech, tav, resh. Vav is a prefix and str means secret or hidden. Others have discovered similar information. Below is one example:<br>  <br>  by queenannie38<br>  tav (400) resh (200) samech (60) vav (6) <br>  <br>  ???? <br>  <br>  (truth/perfection)-(the wicked)-(divine presence/holy of holies)-(man/redemption) <br>  <br>  Check out the traditional meanings of those letters: <br>  <br>  tav = sign/mark (literal) covenant/to seal (symbolic) <br>  resh = head (literal) person/head/highest (symbolic) <br>  samech = a prop (literal) support/turn (symbolic) <br>  vav = nail (literal) secure/hook/add (symbolic) <br>  <br>  Very ODD how 'head' or 'highest' (as in ruler) is also 'the wicked.' <br>  <br>  I know both of these representational systems work consistently work throughout all the Hebrew scriptures - but I prefer the more esoteric symbologies, myself - because they have taken me a level deeper into my understandings. <br>  <br>  Does this shed any light on '666?' <br>  <br>  Whoever wrote this has absolutely no affiliation with our family nor any acquaintance. We used a source that is not connected with us to help establish the information we believe. Nail, Prop, Cross, and Head are the elements of the crucifix and are revealed as the image of the beast. Interestingly jesus adds up to 616, j=yod=10, e=niqqud, s=shin=300, u=vav=6, s=shin=300. The scriptures state that many would come in his name this is to include the antichrist. The Messiah states in Revelation he will give his new name to those who overcome and the Messiah also states he has a name that no one knows but he himself. The true Christ will reveal his name to those that are his at his coming and at the same time the antichrist will be completely destroyed. The antichrist until then will deceive the world and at some point anyone who doesn't worship him will be forced to either bow down or be killed. The history of Christianity itself is well documented to have done similar things in the past, like forcing people to be baptised. Another unaffiliated source, just did a quick search for forced baptism and this is one example that came up <a href="http://therefinersfire.org/christian_apology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://therefinersfire.org/christian_apo...</a> . Especially noted is during the times of the reformation. Heavy persecution is one of the main reasons why the so called "pilgrims" came to the "new world". According to the scriptures an image of the beast will be placed in the temple of God. Many believe this will be in Jerusalem, which means there will be a crucifix placed at the site of the Dome of the Rock.|`|3R4WcWLWaa	666 is the devils number, or so everyone says but its actually 636.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what 616 is.<br>  <br>  you call 999 in England if you want to call the police, or the ambulance service or the fire brigade. Nothing to do with devil as far as i'm aware.

lUSTFw94aa	Which do you mean.....American English or British English?<br>  <br>  The two are very different.<br>  <br>  Each are heavy with cultural slang.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you are European. I have lived in Northern England and Belgium and I think I know what you are asking.<br>  <br>  Here is a basic rule for the United States of America version of the English language:<br>  <br>  No one, no person, nobody goes to "University" in the USA.<br>  <br>  Even if a person did go to an American University; nobody uses the word "University".<br>  <br>  In America, everyone, (that is , those who go) goes to "college".<br>  <br>  This is regardless of whether they attended a State University; or a Private College or a Community College. <br>  <br>  The word "College" is functional to asking this question. Americans go to College; the Belgians I know, they go to University. It is the same thing.<br>  <br>  NOW, for a big however....unless you know someone well enough personally or professionally to ask a person what type of education they have, it is best to AVOID asking this question. It is an insulting question. <br>  <br>  In America, if you think someone is intelligent, then they are intelligent. School has a role for tracking football and Alumni but has no direct bearing on personal relationships that may cross class line. American is a relatively class-absent society. <br>  <br>  We cross lines all of the time. Are you not European, but perhaps, from India?<br>  <br>  Please remember that Americans do not believe that they have to obtain a formal "University" Education in order to be successful in life and their profession. Of course, it is the best path, but not totally necessary.<br>  <br>  The United States of American does value higher education, but so many successful Americans have done so well without one, just look at Abraham Lincoln, for example. <br>  <br>  Lincoln only had a total of 20 months of formal schooling. For the rest of his learning, President Lincoln did  his course work on  his own time.<br>  <br>  So, please be careful when asking Americans about "College". Especially when the European World and the Hispanic World , that I know,  call what we Americans call "High School" ...they call College or in Spanish "Collegio"<br>  <br>  Sorry if I sound irritated, but we Americans are always being asked to empathize with the rest of the world and though questions such as yours here, I can tell that no one outside  of the USA really knows anything about American Culture.|`|7E5v3xDwaa	Does he study at university? or Is he already studying at university?|`|fbPWn3q7aa	Is he a Uni Student?
TVJsOEKNaa	Since I seem to be the ONLY Jewish person who has answered this question so far: I starred it for my contacts.<br>  <br>  Let me clarify first by stating that NO Jews believe in Jesus. "Jews for Jesus and Messianic Jews" are Christian Evangelical groups with the SOLE purpose of evangelizing Jews. No branch of Judaism excepts them (it's like stating you are a God believing atheist).<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  The term "completed Jew" is codeword for "messianic Christian"<br>  <br>  It is important to note that the OT and Tanach are not the same when making theological comparisons the same way the OT/NT and the Qu'ran are not the same.<br>  <br>  It is also important to note that none of these prophecies include anything about a SECOND coming: Meaning -- They have to be fulfilled the FIRST time around.<br>  <br>  Here are some translation differences:<br>  <br>  Psalm 22:17: "Hikifuni ca'ari yaday veraglay"<br>  Means: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"<br>  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the Tanach do the words ca'ari or hikifuny mean anything resembling the word pierce.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14: "Hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"<br>  Means: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."<br>  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."<br>  <br>  In Hebrew, 'ha' means 'the' and 'almah' refers to young woman. Betulah is Hebrew for virgin and is used in the Torah.<br>  <br>  The term mashiach literally means anointed one and refers to the practice of anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The word does not mean savior. Every King/High Priest was anointed with oil, each being referred to as a mashiach/messiah.<br>  <br>  We believe the messiah *WILL*:<br>  -------------<br>  <br>  -From the line of David on his fathers side (Jeremiah 23,5)<br>  *If Jesus was the product of a virgin birth he couldn't have been from David's line on his father's side genetically.<br>  <br>  -Observant of Torah commandments (Isaiah 11,2-5)<br>  *It's noted that Jesus didn't observe some commandments: "He does not observe Shabbat!" (John 9:14)<br>  <br>  -A normal human who doesn't possess supernatural abilities<br>  *Jesus had 'supernatural' abilities.<br>  <br>  - Born of human parents<br>  *Jesus was a product of a virgin birth..Not two parents*<br>  <br>  What the messiah will do:<br>  --------------<br>  -Bring political and spiritual redemption to the Jewish people<br>  *Are Jewish people in political/spiritual redemption? No.<br>  <br>  -Bring all Jews into Israel (Is:11-12; Jer:23,3; Hosea 3,4-5)<br>  *Are all Jewish people in Israel? No (I'm in NYC ;))<br>  <br>  -Establish a Torah based government in Israel (Is: 2,2-4; 11)<br>  *Israel is a democracy, not a theocracy.<br>  <br>  - Rebuild the third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28)<br>  *Is the third temple rebuilt?

It did not end just in 1492 it carried into the New World.<br>  <br>  "The accused, sometimes for trivial reasons such as wearing clean clothes on Fridays, were taken during the night without warning and not seen again until their auto-da-fe. Under torture confessions came readily. Their property was confiscated, part going to support the Inquisition, part to the Queen and part to build churches and monasteries. Punishment could consist in being burned alive (to avoid the shedding of blood). Others had hands cut off before being burned or quartered. Mercy was shown to some by strangling them before being burnt. The lucky ones were deprived of all property, prohibited from government and other offices and ordered to wear the San Benito for the rest of their lives. At their death their San Benito was prominently displayed in the local church as perpetual reminders. Some can still be found in Spanish churches today. The edict of expulsion was not repealed until Dec 1968<br>  <br>  The Inquisition continued for 350 years into the nineteenth century.

Furthermore, the Jewish Messiah is/was not going to be God, but a man. There is no doctrine of "Trinity" in Judaism. <br>  <br>  Also starring for my Jewish friends, so they can give you more details.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I am never sure why people ask this question of Jews.  We have our religion, Christians have theirs.  Hindus and Muslims, for example, never get asked this.  I presume it's because Jesus was born a Jew and because Christians sort-of use the Jewish scriptures as part of their own, albeit in a form that is a bit different and with totally different interpretation.  But that doesn't mean that Judaism and Christianity have anything much in common.  I also note that no-one asks Christians why they DO believe this, at least certainly not with the monotonous regularity the question is asked of Jews (at least once a day on here, often more).<br>  <br>  The idea of a messiah was a Jewish idea.  We have 23 prophecies of the moshiach, but the word only means 'annointed one' and in fact refers to many people throughout history. THE messiah is in potential in every generation and we don't know when he'll come; in general, we don't focus a great deal on this, not least since this messiah can only come when we've done a rather better job of getting the world repaired.  That's our task.<br>  <br>  Christians have a very different concept of messiah, totally unlike ours.  They find prophecies of this 'messiah' in their scriptures (the ones which are adapted from ours).  Their interpretation of the passages they cite is totally and completely different from ours, and often looks to us like wilful refusal to address errors in translation, to read in context, etc.  Among the rather major differences between our concept and theirs is that the Jewish messiah is an ordinary human, in no way divine, and doesn't perform miracles.<br>  <br>  I tried to find the book you mention online.  The only reference I managed in a quick search suggested it was science fiction.  I would happily answer further if you can explain something about the book and/or give us a link to some information about it, but it's hard to know quite what it was in the book that made you ask the question.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  As always, I'm fascinated by the motivation behind thumbs-down.  People on here answer the question accurately and receive huge numbers of TD.  Is this because these 10 or so people don't like the fact that Jews don't believe Jesus is the messiah?  Are they unable to cope with different opinions?  Ah well, I'll never know.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Hey what about the rest of us, or are you just interested in the Jewish point of view - fair enough, here's some Jewish reasons to be going on with<br>  <br>  The true Messiah is to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem—but Jesus lived while the Temple was still standing. Jeremiah 33:18 <br>  <br>  The Messiah will reestablish Jewish religious law as the law of the land. Jeremiah 33:15<br>  <br>  The Messiah will save Israel." In the case of Jesus, the very opposite took place. Not long after his death, the Holy Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, Jerusalem was laid to waste, and the Jews went into exile to begin a 1900 year long night of persecution, — largely at the hands of the followers of this self-styled Messiah!" <br>  <br>  He will establish a government in Israel that will be the center of all world government, both for Jews and gentiles (Isaiah 2:2-4; 11:10; 42:1).    <br>  <br>  The Messiah will return all exiles to their homeland. Isaiah 11:11-12<br>  Jeremiah 23:8; 30:3<br>  Hosea 3:4-5<br>  <br>  Christians often maintain that Jesus will fulfil these at His second coming, but this claim that Jesus will fulfill the Messianic prophesies when he returns does not give him any credibility for his "first" coming. The Bible never speaks about the Messiah returning after an initial appearance. The "second coming" theory is , for Jews, a desperate attempt to explain away Jesus’ failure. The Biblical passages which Christians are forced to regard as second coming don’t speak of someone returning, they have a "first coming" perspective.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon - neither Jew nor Christian but a keen observer of faith|`|8I9uduIiaa	Exact same reason YOU don't believe any of these would be Christians is Jesus:<br>  <br>  All of these claimants state that they were Jesus reincarnate:<br>  <br>  John Nichols Thom<br>  Jim Jones<br>  Marshall Applewhite<br>  Suma Ching Hai<br>  <br>  Other Christian Messianic Claimants:<br>  <br>  Simon Magus and Dositheos the Samaritan<br>  Montanus<br>  Adalbert<br>  Tanchelm of Antwerp<br>  Ann Lee<br>  Bernhard Müller<br>  Arnold Potter<br>  Hong Xiuquan of China<br>  Bahá'u'lláh<br>  William W.

So this is where Jews got it right:<br>  <br>  1-Messiah is not GOD but ordinary man.<br>  2-Messiah means anointed one.<br>  3-Messiah is messenger of GOD<br>  4-Christians tweaked the translation to make the OT say what they  want to hear.<br>  5-There is only one “True” GOD worthy of worship.<br>  This is what Jew got wrong:<br>  1-They did not believe Jesus was the messiah while he was the true messiah.<br>  2-They rejected Jesus, so they no longer following the path of GOD since rejecting one messenger of GOD is as you rejected all the messengers of GOD coz they all came with the same message “to worship GOD alone”.<br>  3-They waiting on fulfillment of prophecies based on their holy books, but their books is not pure words of GOD here was tampering and addition throughout time, and during hard times some might write stuff like this to give hope to people that someone will come and reestablish the nation and so on, with time they will believe it as it was real.<br>  4-They did not believe Jesus was born miraculously of a virgin.<br>  5-Messengers of GOD has the power to change the law (or some details about the law, for example the Shabbat), coz they are inspired by GOD, however, they can not contradict the basic message of all GOD messengers “to worship GOD alone”. It is human nature they don’t like the change even if it was for the better. <br>  6-Jesus performing miracles do not contradict his human nature; GOD can give certain miracles to his messengers as required. Moses himself was able to split the sea by miracle of GOD, and it did not contradict his human nature.  There is big difference between Miracles granted by GOD and magic. <br>  7-They confused some of the prophecies that supposed to belong to the final messenger (Prophet Mohammad) to the ones belong to the messiah (Jesus). Such as Re-establish the worship in temples. Prophet Mohammad re-established the prayer in mosques as Muslims do now. But this is off the topic. <br>  8-Jesus did not preach to worship him or “trinity”, so Jesus never preaches to worship new GOD(S), He preaches to worship “his GOD” the same GOD Jews and Muslims worship. <br>  9-GOD does not belong to the Jews only, He created all humans and he can send other messengers to other nations not only to the Jews. The fact that GOD sent many prophets and messengers to the Jews, does not mean he cannot or will not send other messengers to other nations in the earth. <br>  <br>  This is where Christians got it right:<br>  <br>  1-Jesus is the true messiah.<br>  2-He was born miraculously from the Virgin Mary. <br>  <br>  This is what Christian got wrong:<br>  <br>  1-Messiah means anointed one. It does not mean Savoir.<br>  2-Messiah was a man (send by GOD) not the son of GOD. If GOD can create Adam without mother and father, surely GOD can create Jesus without a father inside Mary womb. <br>  3-Jesus was created by GOD not begotten by GOD. <br>  4-Jesus is the “word” coz he was created by GOD through the word “BE” and Jesus was created.<br>  5-Jesus Miracles was granted by GOD, it does not mean Jesus was GOD.<br>  6-They worshiped others GOD(S) such as “trinity”, however, it was invented after Jesus time. So Jesus is innocent of the “trinity”. So they no longer following GOD path since they worshiped others with the true GOD. <br>  7-Christians tweaked the translation to make the OT say what they want to hear and believe, they took great liberty editing the Gospels as they see “fit” so they mislead themselves and the people who followed them.<br>  <br>  Quran 4:171<br>  <br>  “171. O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘?sa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, ("Be!" - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (R?h )[1] created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: "Three (trinity)!" Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One Ilah (God), glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.[2]”<br>  <br>  Quran 19: 16- 38<br>  <br>  “16. And mention in the Book (the Qur’an, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.<br>       17. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibr?l (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.<br>       18. She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah."<br>       19. (The angel) said: "I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son."<br>       20. She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?"<br>       21. He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: ‘That is easy for Me (Allah): And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by Allah).’ "<br>       22. So she conceived him,[1] and she withdrew with him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem).<br>       23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date-palm. She said: "Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!"<br>       24. Then [the babe ‘?sa (Jesus) or Jibr?l (Gabriel)] cried unto her from below her, saying: "Grieve not: your Lord has provided a water stream under you.<br>       25. "And shake the trunk of date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you."<br>   26. "So eat and drink and be glad. And if you see any human being, say: ‘Verily! I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah) so I shall not speak to any human being this day.’"<br>       27. Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: "O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariyy (a mighty thing). [Tafsir Al-Tabari]<br>       28. "O sister (i.e. the like) of Har?n (Aaron)[1]! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman."<br>       29. Then she pointed to him. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?[2]"<br>       30. "He [‘?sa (Jesus)] said: "Verily I am a slave of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet;[3]"<br>       31. "And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Salat (prayer), and Zakat, as long as I live."<br>       32. "And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest.<br>       33. "And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!"<br>       34. Such is ‘?sa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute).<br>       35. It befits not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son [this refers to the slander of Christians against Allah, by saying that ‘?sa (Jesus) is the son of Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) be He (above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: "Be!" - and it is.[4]<br>       36. [‘?sa (Jesus) said]: "And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the Straight Path. (Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His Prophets)." [Tafsir At-Tabar?]<br>       37. Then the sects differed [i.e. the Christians about ‘?sa (Jesus) ???? ??????], so woe unto the disbelievers [those who gave false witness by saying that ‘?sa (Jesus) is the son of Allah] from the Meeting of a great Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, when they will be thrown in the blazing Fire)[5].<br>       38.

It's not part of their belief system.|`|DTog0VZWaa	In short here are the reasons Jesus is irrelevant to Judasim (he isn't mentioned, isn't a teacher, or rabbi, nor prophet):<br>   <br>  - There is a list of expectations of the messiah (someone else has it & I'm sure will post it). Jesus didn't do any of them. He did miracles which is a sign of not-the-messiah.<br>   <br>  - the Jewish messiah concept is a human being who does things like bring peace with the help of God. The Christ concept of being saved from sin by human or human-God sacrifice is totally alien to Judaism & to the Jewish messiah concept.<br>   <br>  - The OT is not the same as the Jewish Tanakh. It's quite similar, however there are small changes throughout that result in support for Christian theology. All those predictions go away when you use the Tanakh & the in-context Jewish understandings of them.<br>   <br>  - Judaism in general is very different than Christianity in many ways. While a Christ concept is central to Christianity, the focus on it when looking at Judaism pretty much misses most everything there is of importance in Judaism.  Briefly, Tikkun Olam (focus on this world & repairing it), a steady dialog for over 4000 years of how to live THIS life morally based on Torah, a style of doing that dialog that isn't in Christianity but is central to being Jewish, a whole complicated list of wonderful religious days, a way of being just one religion amoung others where non-Jews too can have a place in the world to come.<br>   <br>  Hope that helps. This is the first question every Christian seems to ask us.

They are Christians in belief. They<br>  originally called themselves Jews to make it easier to convert Jews.

The book delves into it including on the plague.... Jews keep separate water wells from the Christians & pursuant to Jewish rules, they buried their dead very quickly while non-Jews threw them down their wells & burned them.  So Jews had much less spread of black plague & were blamed of....conspiracy theories to kill non-Jews.

At times, these missionaries have used torture and other coercions to gain their goal, such as during the Spanish Inquisition. <br>  <br>  More recently, Christian missionaries have employed different techniques-using friendly arguments and slick propaganda-for the same purpose. Lately, they have  resorted to using Jewish names and Hebrew songs to mislead Jews into thinking that they are Jewish. Thus, we have the rise of the "Jewish Christians" who claim that the only "fulfilled" Jew is the one who believes in JC.<br>  <br>  The missionaries show a dangerous degree of intolerance towards Judaism, implying that it is a false religion. <br>  <br>  Missionaries say that JC is both the son of G-d and the long--awaited Messiah. Jews reject both claims, for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  No Man Can Be a G-d: <br>  <br>  The Torah makes it clear that there is only one G-d: <br>  "The L-rd He is G-d; there is none else besides him" (Deut 4:35)." <br>  <br>  JC himself accepted G-d's uniqueness: "And (JC) said unto him, 'Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, G-d." (Matthew 19:17). <br>  <br>  How, then, could a mortal man-one who was born and died on a cross-be a segment of an immortal, indivisible G-d? The Torah states clearly: "G-d is not a man" (Num 23:19).<br>  <br>  JC did not accomplish the tasks of the Messiah: <br>  <br>  The Messiah will bring about universal peace and tran-quility: "And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more" (Isaiah 2:4). <br>  <br>  He will bring about universal respect for G-d, and lead all people to follow His ways: "The knowledge of G-d will fill the earth. The world will be filled with the knowledge of G-d as the water covers the sea" (Isaiah 11:9). <br>  <br>  He will cause an ingathering of the Jewish exiles: "Then the residue of his brethren shall return with the children of Israel" (Micha 5:2) and will bring about the rebuilding of the Beis Hamikdosh:. "In that day will I raise up the Tabernacles of David that is fallen" (Amos 9:11). <br>  <br>  He will bring physical cure to all who are sick: "Then the eye of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. Then the lame man will leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb will sing" (Isaiah 35:5-6). <br>  <br>  He will accomplish these tasks within his lifetime: "He shall not fail or be crushed until he has set the right in the earth" (Isaiah 42:4).<br>  <br>  JC did not fulfill any of these tasks. The Temple has not been rebuilt and Jews are in exile. Suffering and pain exist and the world is less religiously inclined today than it was during JC's day. Immorality, corruption and crime are evidence to this very day. <br>  <br>  If the Messiah came why is the world in such a sad state?<br>  <br>  Christians have come up with the explanation that JC will reappear during a Second Coming when he will fulfill the Messianic prophecies. There is no reference to a delayed second coming of the same Messiah anywhere in the Torah. <br>  <br>  JC promised his followers that he would succeed in his own era: "Verily I say to you that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done" (Mark 13:30). But things were not done and JC was killed.<br>  <br>  JC did not keep Jewish law: <br>  <br>  The Messiah is expected to keep all the laws of Torah, and inspire others to do likewise. (Deut 13). At times JC considered himself above the law: "For the Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:8). <br>  <br>  He broke the laws of the Sabbath -part of the 10 cmdments and reviled the Rabbis who are accorded great respect by  Torah. <br>  <br>  JC did not even always espouse peace: "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace but a sword" (Matthew 10:34). <br>  <br>  Lack of Jewish support: <br>  JC lived at the time of Roman suppression of the Jews. The Jewish people eagerly looked forward to the arrival of the Moshiach. They were certainly well-versed in the requirements to be filled and would definitely have accepted the Messiah if it was clear that he had appeared. <br>  <br>  Yet the Jews of that time and especially the Sages rejected JC claims. They knew and saw JC and found him wanting; on the other hand, Paul of Tarsus, who established the Christian religion never knew JC personally. <br>  <br>  If JC were the Messiah, why did his fellow Jews, who had every reason to want a Messiah, almost unanimously reject him?<br>  <br>  Missionaries often say that they have Biblical proof of JC' divinity or Messianic role. However, these arguments often rely on misquotes and faulty reasoning.<br>  <br>  One such "proof" is the verse in Micha 5:1: "But you, Bethlehem Ephrasah, which are little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of you shall come forth ' onto Me that is to be ruler in Israel, whose going forth are from old from ancient days."<br>  <br>  Missionaries claim this refers to JC, who they say was born in Bethlehem. But the verse refers to the fact that the Messiah will come from the line of David who was born in Bethlehem. JC had no earthly father.<br>  <br>  There is "proof" from Isaiah 53, which refers to a "Suffering Servant". Missionaries say this means JC, who suffered on the cross. The term "servant" when used elsewhere in Isaiah, refers to the Jewish nation whose members are G-d's dedicated servants. They have certainly suffered throughout the years-yet they have survived for a long time, unlike JC, who died childless at the age of 33, and the verse refers to the servant's prolonged days and "seed" (children).

It's a bit smaller and it doesn't have the same learning capacity, but there still is an element of consciousness there. So the question of whether a chimp has a soul is the same as the question of whether humans do.<br>  <br>  Now, personally, I'm of the opinion that there's nothing separate from the body and that the mind is just a product of the brain. So equally I don't believe chimps have souls. But if I turn out to be wrong and humans DO have souls that are separate from their bodies, then so would chimps.|`|2GaJFMqQaa	I don't think any living thing has a soul per se. However, every living thing is made of energy that we can feel. We can often feel the nature of the energy as well. Have there been times you've known someone walked into a room when your back was to the door? Or felt someones energy?|`|al400aZlaa	OK I'm no theologian but the best answer I can come up with is:<br>  Bible-based Christians believe neither chimps nor humans nor any other things have souls.  To HAVE a soul is a Catholic concept, since adopted by some mainstream Protestant denoms, not supported by the Bible.  This theology has people having immortal souls that remain alive after we die, and go immediately to heaven or hell or indeed purgatory.<br>  In the Bible the preponderance of references to souls is in the sense that a person IS a soul.  Also according to the Bible when we die we lie "sleeping" in the ground - we know nothing.  It is not until the day of the end when Jesus returns that we revive and go to heaven (those of us who are headed there).  <br>  According to the book of Revelation people spend a millenium in heaven then return to live forever on the earth which has been renewed and returned to its former glory in the interim.<br>  I know, it sounds fantastic if you're not a regular and dedicated Bible student.  I was extremely dubious when I started but now .... well why don't you try studying it regularly and see how you feel.  I get up earlier each day to make time for study.<br>  As for chimps, the Bible does allude to animals in heaven.  I would expect there would certainly be chimps on the new earth, and they won't be inclined to bite people's faces off.|`|wncdhUxDaa	Does anybody have a soul?<br>  I'm not even sure I know what a soul is. You say conscience, which is a moral sense of right and wrong. Chimps, I do believe have a moral sense of right and wrong so in that respects yes, they do have a soul otherwise they'd be going around mindlessly killing each other. <br>  I'm not sure that your right in saying our soul is always looking for our creator as there are many atheists out there who live a happy and fulfilled life. <br>  I hope this helps|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Animals do not have souls because God did not give them any.Chimps are animals so no they do not have souls.|`|y0zVfzBfaa	haha if it lives and you believe in god it has a soul.<br>  what differs us from other living organisms that would mean only we have a soul. thats selfish. that first guy who answered is satan.|`|QHGHX0WIaa	no, chimps are not sentient beings. they have about as much soul as a plant. they are not aware of their own existence. much less a creator.|`|dgJyU7xkaa	Everything in the Universe has a Soul!|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Assuming the answer-fallacy.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	no1 is supposed to have a soul but humans<br>  <br>  do u have a pet? well they're going to hell.|`|AOScvauzaa	Souls don't exist|`|cmx9ftEuaa	YES!!!bec all all of us have souls even animals|`|PdmIUD8faa	say what??|`|oiIUDLKIaa	you betcha!<br>  <br>  Koko the Gorilla is sittin up there with Jesus as we speak
1TQz3uryaa	I'm a native French speaker, and this is a kind of French slang called ''le verlan'' that consists of changing the order of the syllabes in a word.

It just goes to show you how accurate the Bible is when at 2 Co 4:4 it states his/her mind is blinded, but we know that their eyes were working, unless someone else typed it for them.<br>  <br>  The reason why the Trinity is a mystery is because God is an author of confusion, " O H", I'm sorry, I got that backwards, the reason they can't prove the Trinity is because God is N O T an author of confusion, that's why you don't see it in the Bible.

B29DwYKLaa	I don't watch a lot of news, but have heard recent protests about Tibet for a long time now. Why is it such an issue? Why can't the Chinese government just give it back? What will happen if the Chinese pick their own Dali Lama? If some other country intervenes, would there be another war?<br>  <br>  Before I begin i want to start off by saying that i am a tibetan student living in the U.S. Tibet used to be an independent country, its history goes back to the 7th century. In 1959 Chinese military illegaly invaded Tibet by saying it was a part of China.Which is FALSE,Tibet has its own people, religion, currency, leader, morals, etc. SInce then Tibetans in TIbet have NO basic rights. His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama is the Leader of the political and spiritual leader of the Tibetans. In Tibet it is illegal to have a picture of him. What kind of B.S is that? Tibetans in Tibet don't have Freedom of Speech, they also dont have any human rights. So the main thing is China is violating Human Rights in Tibet. Since 1959 1.2 Tibetans have been killed by the military of Chinese. Last year only 200 Tibetans were killed.Tibetans are starting peaceful protest in Tibet and China just releases military too kill all of them. If the protesters aren't killed they are might serve their whole life in prison. Not only that their family will also get in trouble. Now prisons in TIbet arent like the ones here in U.S. over there they torture you, and they can basically do anything to you. Nuns are raped too. As you can see if you are a Tibetan you will get fustrated with all these news. And thats not it. The horrible news keeps going on and on. BUt the thing is the U.N is not doing anything about it. THats the fustrating thing. So us as in TIbetans living outside of Tibet think that it is our responsibility to speak up for Tibet and give a voice when we can use the Freedom that the U.S gives us to our benefit. So yesterday marks the 50th year of when Tibet lost its independence. 50 years!!! THats right. Half of a century. Its our responsibility to speak up for Tibet when our brothers and sisters can't. Tibetans are losing their life protesting in Tibet. Now us as refugees has to do something about that.<br>  His Holiness the Dalai Lama also believes in Non-violence. he doesnt believe in violence. His Holiness also won the Gold Medal award in Oct of 2007, which is the highest award a citizen can recieve. <br>   For those who says that what we are doing is stupid and Tibetans are stupid, clearly doesnt understand what is happening in Tibet. IF they do they are very sick to think that raping nuns, killing tibetans is o.k.<br>  <br>  so ask i wrap things up i want to give you a couple of websites you and others can go to to learn more. Because what i stated above is not nearly as close in what TIbet is. <br>  <br>  www.phayul.com         it has tibet news that are updated couple times per day<br>  <a href="http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org</a>        Members of an organization that fight for Tibets Independence<br>  www.savetibet.org          website that have some information on TIbet<br>  www.rangzen.org              website that have some information on Tibet<br>  also you can google Tibet and see what you get or even youtube it.|`|AA10676836	Many governments oppose large churches because they are organizations.

385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	I think you should tell her.  It's not really her business but you do live in her home and living with a couple is not the same as living with two single and unconnected people.  And why would you want to be sneaky and underhand with someone who you describe as nice.  As long as you are not sitting around her house snogging and touching each other up I can't see what objections she could have although it would also be polite to keep your err "intimate" noises to yourself. Her  having to listen to your lovemaking is the quickest way of you having to find a new place to live.|`|0bs8X7Nvaa	it all depends on how serious your relationship with your housemate is....if you think its serious and it is going to last then you should definetely sooner or later break the news to your landlady, how she reacts to this news is unpredictable but the right thing is for her to know whats happening in her own household and if she's really as sweet as you say she is and she'll be ok with it, you will all be happy because there will be no sneaking around anymore|`|KPSQcnwbaa	like you say she probably has a idea, if i was you tell her now and make sure you say that you wanted to be honest and not sneak behind her back as you respect her to much and was worried it would affect your friendship just be honest and sit down with her and tell her.as people see more than you think and she should respect you for telling her yourself not someone else hope this helps|`|bEFHzitFaa	just say to her " i think it might be of your consern  that blah and i are seeing eachother. ijust didnt want to make you feel awckurd or something about the situation"<br>  <br>  hope it helps!|`|eO1o511daa	You should tell, because eventually you will be found out for sure, then who knows.

I would think she may have some idea already but as you are both adults an cause her no problems then she says nothing, but if you feel awkward then perhaps you both should find another place to live but there is nothing wrong with speaking to her an letting her know you are now seeing each other as a couple an ask her if she minds. You may not get the answer you want but at least you will not have to sneak about any more. My guess is she won't mind but would like to be told.|`|AA10871086	1 she won't care as long as the rent i being met<br>  <br>  2 she will already know|`|KlkUj6uFaa	As you said the chances are she already knows, so my guess is that she hasn't got a problem with it, or else she would have probably mentioned it to you by now. <br>  <br>  She may be waiting for you to bring up the subject in conversation, so why not just be honest and stop sneaking around like teenagers.<br>  <br>  Like you said, you pay board, the bills, and have nothing to be ashamed of.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I would say nothing at all.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	I think you aught to watch the tv series "Spaced" where they have to pretend to be a couple.<br>  <br>  I think she'll have figured it out - I don't think it makes any difference and she can't kick you out / be angry - things happen naturally and she'll understand this.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Sounds like she has noticed already to me.<br>  <br>  Umm, I would tell her - I don't think she will kick you out just because of it, and then you can stop sneaking around - it's not a nice way to live.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Be truthful about it, things never work when you're sneaky.

AA10858522	No, there are no gods except the ones found in story books. As a general rule though, monotheistic societies spend a lot of effort trying to kill each other to get their point across while the polytheistic societies don't seem to mind another persons beliefs and respect everyone. All the religious violence is associated with jews christians and muslims.

IdTenBtNaa	I wouldn't necessarily call you weird, you're just different from most thirteen year olds. But being different is what makes people unique, and uniqueness is something I think the world needs more of. Thinking about death and such, maybe you have an overactive imagination, or maybe you just like over thinking things, complicating things, creating theories, etc, and that isn't a bad thing. As long as you aren't thinking about suicide, it's all good. As for your scars, you're right. They do tell stories. They hold memories, and memories make you who you are today, so remember to never be ashamed of your scars. <br>  You seem like a very interesting person.|`|2qREaMmraa	No, you're not weird. Most teens think like that, they're not as stereotypical as the papers and movies like Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging or whatever make it out to be.<br>   I would hate to be just like your average teenager, chasing round after guys, talking about nothing but hair, make up, fashion, shopping, guys, magazines. I think about very different stuff (:|`|BgdwgVtKaa	It seems evident that you're a teenager (I'm one as well, so I know what it is!)<br>  Your actions and reactions are completely normal.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	WEIRDO|`|rifjjQ2laa	A typical teen.
LrGmpacOaa	In a standard person, not much. There are differences of education, and, some studies suggest, even IQ. But these differences are trends, not rules.<br>  <br>  However, in non-typical individuals, the differences are more obvious. For example, people with schizophrenia or left hemisphere brain injuries are more likely to be religious.<br>  <br>  Atheism is the decision to look at the world rationally. Religiosity is the decision to not look at it at all. And while some people are never given the opportunity to make their own choice early in life (religious indoctrination usually starts young), anyone is capable of making that decision.|`|AA10858522	My opinions as an atheist are dependent on real things that I can see hear touch and smell. I would say a christian's argument has something to do with i just believe because somebody told me to  and i don't need to ever see proof because if you wish for god hard enough he will appear when you die.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	About the same difference as someone who needs remedial English (like you) and one who doesn't (like me).|`|c0KKHMsAaa	one wants to have the answers,<br>  the other wants to find the answers.|`|8aW6f0Byaa	Atheists prefer reality, christians prefer imaginary.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	Both are equally prone to all psychological conditions. The physical make-up of our brains are the same; we both co-exist in the same societies; we are both exposed to the same media and education.<br>  <br>  If you are using psychology as a loose metaphor and actually mean, "What is the difference between Christians' and atheists' thought process regarding religion", then I'm afraid there are simply too many of both groups to answer that without stereotyping.|`|dKPFjQymaa	Well nowadays, a Christian thinks similarly to an Atheist.  The majority of them for the most part, in the U.S. especially.  There are more atheists turned from Christianity then any other religion.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Christians are dependent while atheists are independent.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	You could say it was the extra A stands for Actual. Atheist -Theist.|`|KYCyj3nkaa	Well Christians would disagree with evolutionary psychology as it explains human behaviour in terms of our ancestral traits.  They probably wouldn't like the work of Freud either because he was a huge Darwin fan and most of his work coincides with Darwin's evolutionary theory, i.e. that our behaviour is led by our sex drive (animal instinct).  I did A level Psychology last year, there was a Christian student in the class and she used to just argue with everything the lecturer said when it came to evolutionary Psych lol.  <br>  <br>  Apart from the evolutionary side of things I guess Atheist and Christian Psychology is exactly the same???|`|paRGbr7Xaa	That depends on the individual Atheist and Christian. You can't generalize the entire psychology of Atheists and Christians, it varies with person to person. Psychology is more an individual-based science and depends on a myriad of different personal factors.|`|xPeIvywdaa	atheists do things in order to enjoy this life<br>  <br>  christians do things in this life in order to enjoy the afterlife|`|doha66YWaa	Atheists life for life<br>  Christians live to die for some afterlife...|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	The medicinal dosages.|`|v811KD7raa	atheists have stable temporal lobes|`|rLCx5ljQaa	are u serious?|`|JOankL0eaa	an H

SRmNJCdiaa	Quite negative responses.  <br>  <br>  First off I'm an Atheist, but I understand that many people want to try different religious paths before they find out what works in their lifestyle.  So even though people are going to tell you lots of things about how silly it is, Paganism, Wicca and things like that are kind of the direction I would imagine you're going with this question.  I read about many different religions when I was in high school until I found what I believe (or don't believe)<br>  <br>  Understand that you're looking into an entire religion, not just calling yourself a "witch" or "practitioner" or whatever title you want to give yourself.  Each belief system that would be what you're looking for has their own beliefs about God(s)/Goddess(s) and the like.  So before you decide you just want to be a "witch" sit down at a local book store in the occult/alternative belief section and pick a book about it and read it cover to cover, and repeat with the next book.  See what it means to call yourself a "witch" or what have you.  <br>  <br>  Some books will talk about really elaborate set ups with daggers, candles, chalices, and what have you, but to me that seemed more of a sales pitch than anything having to do with religion or beliefs.  <br>  <br>  If you want, you can email me and I'll give you my AIM info if you have any questions, since the responses you're getting are not very tolerant.|`|nEc0L0MRaa	<Sigh>   I suggest you get a book and actually try to understand the hows and why of witchcraft before you attempt any spell work.  <br>  <br>  I could go off here about how witchcraft takes years of study and practice to use, let alone master, but I'm sure at 14 you know everything, and are not at all interested in the advice of those who have already walked this path and are experienced in what you are trying to accomplish.<br>  <br>  Also, since all you can come up with is candle magic, I get the sense you haven't looked very hard.  Mundane magic can use all sorts of tools or none at all, candles are not a necessity to magic.  Magic is not easy, if this is what you want to do, be ready to do some real hard work.<br>  <br>  Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|PSojABqMaa	a witch just means your religion is Wicca. one of the oldest religions.<br>  <br>   its not a religion that consists of flying on broomsticks and casting black magic on your enemies. <br>  <br>  Yes its a wonderful religion, as most religions come down to the same thing. (so does Wicca) yes there are spells, but they are basically prayers. essentially sending out what you want or what your blessing in energy form, thru rituals and such. most people like this, b/c it is much more tangible, your putting your thoughts and emotions into something. its more comfortable.  its a religion that has been manipulated by the media and other forms of slander.<br>  <br>  being a witch at 14 is not that different from being a Christian or a Hindu at 14, they are religions, but most definitely NOT who you are.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	being a witch is doing the pratice of witchcraft. . . if you want to do it then you'll need to study and read alot about it.  It doesn't happen over night and it isnt as easy as one might think it is. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you read a book, and that you keep reading until you come to a better understanding.|`|uFyHVPyyaa	Do what you think is right and what feels magical to you. <br>  Eg. For me, making up my own spells is more power full than looking them up in the internet. Although even more (magical/power full) feels when I find the spells in spell books (which you have to look hard to get one).<br>  <br>  I'm making a Book Of Shadows. Try that. You can try potions too. Candles aren't needed that much.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Looks like you will have to wait until you can use candles.  You might want to seriously think about it before you start messing around with things like that though.<br>  ..|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Nothing.......because no matter what hocus pocus crap you try, you will NOT be a witch because "witches" don't exist.............(sigh).|`|QC7vlfPPaa	I wanted to be a fireman when I was 14. I am not one, but at least they existed.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	do not rely on anything you find on the internet.  real witches don't need candles for anything, tho most like to use them.<br>  <br>  what you need to do is get books on astrology, tarot and other forms of divination, herbs, physics, psychology, sociology, world cultures, and any other topic that interests you and start reading.  you can't be a witch without a deep and well-rounded education.<br>  <br>  if spells are the only thing that interest you, you are not a witch, you're a magician.|`|oiB4KATuaa	You can still follow the Wiccan religion without having to use the magical instruments, its really about nature, so why not learn about it first and then if you decide its something you believe and want to follow when you're older you can practice it?

My mother dabbled a bit and my old nanny is a full solitary(I think) Practitioner, although I don't think they would be happy with me bringing it up now....a little uncomfortable. I go to a religious school which, whilst they are tolerant in theory, I wouldn't want to broadcast wicca, if I decided to go down that path. There are some very good spells etc here, and quite a few are not specific to items, some are visualization. e.g there are many practices which build up your ability you can do anywhere!

Also you cannot report someone just because you don't like what you hear, that is extremely immature and juvenile.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Oh what fun! I don't think there's anything you have to do with candles except make sure they don't set anything alight. I would suggest you just do whatever you want and tell everyone you're a witch. I hope you're going to be a white one and bring more happiness into the lives of all around you. Have a good time!|`|YXGdwwTJaa	At 14 you have plenty of time to decide what you want to be.  <br>  <br>  A reputable place would not encourage you to do anything but read and learn; perhaps go and commune with, or watch the natural world; learn some crafts, older ones like baking bread, making clothes or herbal teas.  These will be very useful if you decide to go ahead with your desire to be a witch.  Spells make me wary.<br>  <br>  Beware websites as anything may be on them and not everyone knows what they are talking about. Some books are better than others.  Time and experience are the only guides.  Candles are not that safe because of the risk of fire, and hard to get off clothes.   learning about witchcraft, what it means to people now, and what they do, is reasonable but it is best to wait until you are older and more settled to practice anything yourself.|`|dFBccLExaa	I'd tell you to pick up some books, or check out a different set of websites to better learn the core concepts of magick. You can perform any spell with no tools at all, if you are able to visualize well enough. And if you learn how to create your own spells, you'll be able to create spells that utilize the tools that you happen to have at your disposal. <br>  Best thing to do is always expand your knowledge until you are in a situation where you can perform magick freely.|`|ngLwXT23aa	yay magic! im 15 and wish i could be a witch or something like that. i am currently trying to expand on what i have alredy got. u should do the same! everyone has something down inside them, u just have to dig a little to find what your looking for.|`|jLL7sDILaa	You don't "need" to do anything. It's a personal craft. If you still want candles, just don't burn them. It's really the symbolism that makes them useful.
4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	Easter is the name of the season when Christians celebrated the events surrounding Christ's death and Resurrection. It includes celebrations of Christ's entry in Jerusalem (Palm Sunday), his last meal with his disciples (Maundy Thursday), his passion and death (Good Friday), his Resurrection (Easter Saturday/Sunday night vigil) and his encounters with his disciples (Easter Sunday and following week).<br>  <br>  There is no historical evidence of any connection to paganism. The date of Easter derives form the Jewish Passover around which time the events are said to have occurred,<br>  <br>  The significance of Easter is that through Christ's resurrection, his conquest of death, we all have the hope of resurrection to new life in Him.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Easteris the most important religious feast in the Christian liturgical year Christians believe that Jesus was resurrected from the dead three days after his crucifixion, and celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day or Easter Sunday(also Resurrection Day or Resurrection Sunday), two days after Good Friday. The chronology of his death and resurrection is variously estimated between the years 26 and 36 A.D.<br>  <br>  Easter also refers to the season of the church year called Eastertide or the Easter Season. Traditionally the Easter Season lasted for the forty days from Easter Day until Ascension Day but now officially lasts for the fifty days until Pentecost. The first week of the Easter Season is known as Easter Week or the Octave of Easter. Easter also marks the end of Lent, a season of prayer and penance.<br>  <br>  Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. Easter falls at some point between late March and late April each year (early April to early May in Eastern Christianity), following the cycle of the moon. After several centuries of disagreement, all churches accepted the computation of the Alexandrian Church (now the Coptic Church) that Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day (the ecclesiastic "full moon") is on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastic "vernal equinox").<br>  <br>  Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover not only for much of its symbolism but also for its position in the calendar.<br>  <br>  Many cultural elements, such as the Easter Bunny, have become part of the holiday's modern celebrations, and those aspects are often celebrated by many Christians and non-Christians alike.|`|xN5fyQwNaa	Overview:<br>  <br>  Modern-day Easter is derived from two ancient traditions: one Judeo-Christian and the other Pagan. Both Christians and Pagans have celebrated death and resurrection themes following the Spring Equinox for millennia. Most religious historians believe that many elements of the Christian observance of Easter were derived from earlier Pagan celebrations.<br>  <br>  The equinox occurs each year on March 20, 21 or 22. Both Neopagans and Christians continue to celebrate religious rituals linked to the equinox. Wiccans and other Neopagans usually hold their celebrations on the day or eve of the equinox. Western Christians celebrate Easter on the Sunday on or after the full moon that follows the nominal date of the Equinox -- MAR-21. The Eastern Orthodox churches follow a different calculation; their Easter celebration is often many weeks after the date selected by the Western churches.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Rabbits and eggs are both symbols of the fertility goddess Eostre/Ishtar/Ostara. Her symbol is also the moon, in which some cultures see a rabbit instead of a face. Eggs also symbolize the moon and are the ultimate symbol of creation and new life. The basket is a symbol of the womb in which this new life is carried.<br>  <br>  The feast day is pagan and was widely celebrated way before the time of Jesus. Like pretty much all holidays, it was adopted by Christians to help get more converts. However, since the point is to celebrate new life and the hope of continuance, Christian symbols of a Resurrection day and the old pagan symbols mean the same thing. Just like Christmas, we are all celebrating the same thing, just using different symbols.|`|va8quhPtaa	Meaning is the reason why we celebrate easter.

Assure her that It is just temporary period of time that she is in the hospital and she will get discharge soon. <br>  <br>  Tell her the surgery is definitely 0% danger. <br>  <br>  Tell her that wherever you are, you are always thinking of her every time every minute and you will always be there.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you will be waiting for her to recover and after she recovered you two will go to the beach and take a stroll and enjoy. <br>  <br>  Just tell her to picture those scene in her mind to help her relax.|`|z7aGxtznaa	Be honest with her, let her know that you are scared, but that everythings going to be fine. I know it must be hard knowing that shes going to be in pain, but its not unnecessarily is it? Shes having an operation to help her, the pain will be temporary and the operation will have positive outcomes. Just support her, listen to her if she needs to talk and try to keep your emotions for someone else, after you have gone home or are with a close friend, thats when you can freak out! Just be there for her, everythings going to be fine, dont worry.|`|DG3lYbkfaa	The only way is not to be too emotional. I'm sorry if this sounds really stupid. BUT, if you really wanna be there for her, to support her, try to be strong. Don't ever cry in front of her. Besides, how r u gonna help her if you're not even right at her side (cos you can't stop yourself from crying) anyway?<br>  <br>  Anyways, i'm sorry to hear the news. I sincerely wish a speedy recovery for your gf. Good luck. =)|`|WeR0E56eaa	just keep in mind that she is the one who's going to be operated<br>  <br>  and you are the one to support her morally<br>  <br>  it's normal for you to be scared, but strenght should overpower it<br>  <br>  goodluck =)|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Let her know how you feel. Communicate and be open with her - and let her do the same. It's normal to be scared. When I had to have operations, my (now) wife would hold me and we'd talk and cuddle. I didn't want her to have to mask her feelings or thoughts. I worried about her having to be the "strong one" all the time. Feeling her touch and knowing I'd see her face after I woke up from the anesthesia was comforting too. Good luck to you both. ((sending calming thoughts))|`|yXg1ojQoaa	It's totally normal to feel emotional pain for your girlfriend when she is  about to go through this tough time, in fact it is a sign of just how much you care about her. You should try your best to be there for her, even though it is tough for you. <br>  You can probably help her most by physical comfort, i find that physical comfort is the most reassuring thing for me. Be there to hold her, have your arms around her, hold her hand. The Comfort of physical touch is really one of the most helpful things when times are tough, aside from that- if you're feeling up to it- she will benefit from you saying words like "It will all be alright" or "Nothing could go wrong"<br>  Even if you don't really believe those words yourself, it will help her alot.<br>  <br>  I wish her all the best in her surgery, and i hope you feel better too :(<br>  Things will be fine, and you'll feel much better once this is over.<br>  Hugs xoxo!<br>  Kasey|`|DWwv3v9Raa	You have to try to mask your feelings because she needs you to be her rock right now, She is very scared and she don't need her fear enhanced by yours. Keep your fears to yourself until after the procedure and recovery process is over, then you can express your feelings of the fears you had during this process.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Make sure you clear it with her nursing/doctor/ caregivers that you are her girlfriend. This ensures you being able to be with her if they ask if you are her family. Speaking of...is this cool with her family. They may not want you there. Again, realize that she will be going through quite an ordeal. Will your workplace allow you time off? I know in NJ companions can take leave to care for partners. We are registered in the the state as domestic partners and 2 years ago when my companions mother past away, I was able to be off 5 days for funeral leave paid. Please look into that as well wherever you live.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	its  ok  to  show  her  how  much  she  means  to  you but  to  avoid  her  because  you  cant  be  strong  for  her  may  send  the  wrong  message. i  would  rather  my  guy  bawled  his  eyes  out  than  avoided  me for that  reason<br>  <br>  maybe  she  can  be  strong  for  you.  it  may seem  selfish but people  in that  situation  go through all the  same  feelings  but  when  its  you  who  faces  the risks you come  to think of  different  things  than when  its someone  else.|`|z2DmmhqJaa	Support her and tell her how you feel about her. I've been in your position. I know you're scared, just remember to leave her on a positive note. And when she gets out, tell her how you have missed her so. <br>  <br>  I wish you and your girlfriend the best of luck.
l9RDuthbaa	The citizens of Israel are Israelis, regardless of their religion.<br>  There are Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs (of which there are Christians, Muslims and Druze).<br>  There's no such thing as "Christian Jews" or "Muslims Jews" just like there can't be "Christian Muslims".|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Israeli is the term used for a citizen of Israel. This applies to all citizens of Israel no matter their religion, race or ethnicity.<br>  <br>  "Jew" is a term in Israel which means a person is jewish according to halacha. If you are a jew by these standards it will be marked on your identity card and you will be permitted to marry other jews within the state of Israel but will not be permitted to marry non-jews within the state of Israel.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by "christian-jew". If you mean someone who has one jewish parent and one christian parent, if it was the mother who was jewish the person is considered a jew. If it was the father who was jewish, the person is not considered a jew, as religious matters in the state of Israel are controled by the office of religious affairs and the rabbinate follows the rabbinical concept of who is a jew.

BOxqd0lXaa	I see your point but I disagree.<br>  <br>  My father always say that there are three main reasons a person chooses to worship Allah:<br>  <br>  1) The person, like you said, finds Paradise appealing.<br>  <br>  2) The person finds the thought of Hell too scary to risk.<br>  <br>  3) The person worships Allah just because Allah is so amazing.<br>  <br>  The only people who fit into the third reason are extremely amazing people such as the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh).<br>  <br>  Most people fit into the first two reasons, but personally I would think that the second reason secretly holds more people within its grasp.<br>  <br>  For example, being totally honest with you I would probably fit into the second reason. As much as I find Paradise appealing I am more concerned with the fact that I don't want to go to Hell than the fact that I badly want to go to Heaven and I think this is the same with most people.<br>  <br>  Maddy x<br>  <br>  Edit: Basically I agree with Dawn and Troll.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: Noor, it is not for us to decide who is a 'correct Muslim' and who is not. Fajr is as Muslim as any other Muslim. You are indeed being very narrow minded and unfair about this.|`|AA11097451	yes, i think so.......... <br>  <br>  because it takes a lot of knowledge and wisdom for one to understand that it all comes from the love of Allah and then it takes a huge amount of courage to live for this love ............ so i am guessing that not alot of people have these characteristics.<br>  <br>  @ - Dawn<br>  i think what the Questioner means by "eternal life" is the "materialistic rewards/punishments" that Allah offers (@ questioner-correct me if am wrong) ........... so many people do strive for this more than they strive to gain more of the love of Allah.|`|zKQKl9mZaa	Is that what most Quranites only look forward to?|`|ColDKgGuaa	Yes|`|9jo37B3saa	You have asked a very sensitive and a very good question. <br>  <br>  It is very easy for people to deny the eternal life after death and do what they like to do. There will be no restrictions after disbelieving in eternal life and a person will feel free to do anything good or bad, because he thinks that neither he will be rewarded for good deeds nor punished for the bad ones. Therefore, a person who wants to live his life freely without any restrictions and commitments, will never believe in eternal life after death.<br>  <br>  We can say that the promise of eternal life is not the greatest appeal but it restricts a person in his actions and words. The belief in eternal life is not because it is promised but to seek refuge of Allah from His anger and wrath.Whether one believes in eternal life after death or not, he is going to have an eternal life, even an athiest, and it will be either in Paradise or Hell fire. <br>  <br>  All the Prophets of God called their people to worship God and to believe in life after death. They laid so much emphasis on the belief in life after death that even a slight doubt in it meant denying God and made all other beliefs meaningless.<br>  <br>  The explanation that the Quran gives about the necessity of life after death is what the moral consciousness of man demands. Actually, if there is no life after death, the very belief in God becomes meaningless or even if one believes in God, it would be n unjust and indifferent God, having once created man and now not being concerned with his fate.<br>  <br>  Surely, God is just. He will punish the tyrants, whose crimes are beyond count - having tortured and killed hundreds or thousands of innocent people, created great corruption in society, enslaved numerous persons to serve their whims, etc., because man has a very short life span in this world and because numerous individuals are affected by one’s actions, adequate punishments and rewards are not possible in this life. The Quran very emphatically states that the Day of Judgment must come and that God will decide the fate of each soul according to his or her record of deeds:<br>  <br>  But those who disbelieve say, <br>  “The Hour (i.e. the Day of Judgment) will not come to us.” Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you. [God is] the Knower of the unseen.” Not absent from Him is an atom’s weight within the heavens or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register - That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness and noble provision. But those who strive against Our verses [seeking] to cause failure (i.e. to undermine their credibility) - for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature.  <br>  (Quran, 34:3-5)<br>  <br>  The Quran also states that this worldly life is a preparation for the eternal life after death. But those who deny it become slaves of their passions and desires, making fun of virtuous and God-conscious persons.|`|lljK4HfHaa	No u got it wrong, the greatest appeal is not to spend your "eternal life" being tortured.<br>  <br>  edit : Dawn's answer is just like mine.. hmm..

If he's already got a hook in ya, you just need to break contact.<br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  The only way you could continue to hang out is if you had a very solid shield. I don't think you have one yet.<br>  <br>  You could tell him before you give him the boot, but seriously, if he's a drainer, it's where he gets his energy and you can only decide if you want to be his battery. If not, you need to unplug and go.<br>  Chances are he'll get nasty when you try to do this.

Anybody against Jesus hates hearing the name. <br>  <br>  You can also very quietly, in a low whisper, but outloud say, in the name of Jesus I bind you  from draining any of my energy from me ever again, and in the name of Jesus I bind you from ever draining anyone elses energy ever again, this I command in Jesus name.<br>  <br>  The last part is penalty, if he really makes you mad, and stops him from ever doing it again.<br>  Parasite is what he is.

Anytime I was around this person I would start seeing things in my mind which really scared me.<br>  <br>  The advice I was given was to say "God, guide guard and protect me" into myself, and to ask for any bad thoughts being sent to me to be given right back to the person anytime this started happening, or even just when this person was around.<br>  <br>  My advice to you on this case is the same, anytime this person is around ask for them to be blocked from you, and you can also say "God, guide guard and protect me if you wish"<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! It did help me.

This realm is the Paradise which Jesus told the thief on the cross next to him, they would be. The closest to hell our theology comes is that within Paradise there is a place called Spirit Prison which those who did evil in this world go while awaiting the Day of Judgment. While in this spirit prison they will be taught the Gospel and if they accept it, may leave and enter Paradise. On Judgment Day all will be judged and those who are not Sons of Perdition will enter a kingdom in Heaven. Sons of Perdition will be sent to The Lake of Fire (hell).<br>  <br>  Now, if this is all a sham, we won't know it will we?|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	My faith and relationship with Christ is unshakable.

Civilization, however, has drawn women out of their homes, rent their veils, and corrupted mankind. For family life continues through the mutual love and respect of man and wife.

The Apostle of Allah turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma', when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands.[12] Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4092<br>  <br>  <br>  Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: The Prophet said: Allah does not accept the prayer of a woman who has reached puberty unless she wears a veil.[11] Sunnan Abu Dawud 2:641|`|p5cglKf0aa	The Twenty-Fourth Flash<br>  <br>  On Islamic Dress for Women<br>  <br>  [While being the Second and Third Matters of the Fifteenth Note, this treatise was made the Twenty-Fourth Flash because of its importance.]<br>  <br>  In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.<br>  <br>  O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons [when abroad] [to the end of the verse].<br>  <br>  This verse enjoins the veiling of women. However, dissolute civilization opposes this command of the Qur’an; it does not consider the veiling of women to be natural and says it is slavery of a sort.<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : We shall explain only four of the many instances of wisdom in this injunction of the Qur’an, showing that it is entirely natural and those who oppose it are opposing the innate disposition of women.<br>  <br>  FIRST INSTANCE OF WISDOM<br>  <br>  To veil themselves is natural for women and their innate dispositions demand it. For women are weak and delicate, and since they are in need of a man’s protection and help for themselves and for their children whom they love more than their own lives, they have a natural desire to make themselves loved and not loathed, and not to be rebuffed.<br>  <br>  Also, seven out of ten women are either old or ugly, and they do not want to show their age and ugliness to everyone. Or they are jealous, and they do not want to appear ugly in relation to others who are more beautiful. Or they are frightened of assault or aspersions, and want by nature to cover themselves so as not to suffer assault, nor to be accused of unfaithfulness in the eyes of their husbands. If noted carefully, those who hide themselves most are the elderly. And out of ten women, only two or three may be found who are both young and beautiful and are not discomforted at displaying themselves.<br>  <br>  It is clear that people are discomforted by the looks of those they do not like or find tedious; they are upset by them. If a beautiful immodestly dressed woman takes pleasure at two or three out of ten men who are canonically strangers looking at her, she is bored by the seven or eight. Also, since a woman whose morals are not corrupted is sensitive and easily affected, she will certainly be distressed at dirty looks whose effects have been physically experienced, indeed, are poisonous. We even hear that in Europe, the place of open dress, many women are fed up at being the object of attention, and complain to the police, saying: “These brutes keep staring at us and disturbing us.” This means that present-day civilization’s unveiling women is contrary to their natures. And together with being in accordance with their natures, the Qur’an’s command to veil themselves, saves women—those mines of compassion who may be worthy companions for all eternity—from degeneration, abasement, what is in effect slavery, and wretchedness.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, by nature women are fearful of men who are strangers, and anxious at them. Fear naturally demands the veiling of women. For in addition to suffering the difficulty of bearing the load of a child for eight or nine months, which certainly embitters the eight or nine minutes’ pleasure, there is also the possibility of suffering the calamity of bringing up a child for eight or nine years without protector. And since this happens frequently, by creation they truly fear strange men and by nature want to hide themselves from them. Being weak, their creation demands that through veiling themselves they do not excite the appetites of men outside the stipulated degrees of kinship, nor allow any opportunity for assault; their weak creation gives powerful warning. It shows that their cloaks and coats are shields and fortresses. The fact that, according to news received, the bare-legged wife of a high-ranking man in the world was accosted in the country’s capital, in the market-place in daylight in front of everyone by a common shoe-shiner, deals a slap in the shameless faces of those opposed to the veiling of women!<br>  <br>  SECOND INSTANCE OF WISDOM<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2924&t=The+Twenty%2DFourth+Flash" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2924&...</a>|`|cLdpKqxeaa	it is optional, we are living in the 21st century for goodness sake why should women have to cover themselves up if they don't want to.

There seems to be a correlation between thinking positive thoughts and then positive things occurring to you, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Since this is not scientifically proven, however, it would be also safe to say that a large portion is coincidence, or because you feel happy people treat you differently due to this outward projection (an example would be you smiling because you've had a good day so far, and a person going out of their way to be kind to you because you're smiling).|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	Way too amazing to be coincidence?

bkr5Nm6aaa	This is what Buddism says about soul.<br>  The Buddha taught that what we conceive as something eternal within us, is merely a combination of physical and mental aggregates or forces (pancakkhandha), made up of body or matter (rupakkhandha), sensation (vedanakkhandha), perception (sannakkhandha), mental formations (samkharakkhandha) and consciousness (vinnanakkhandha). These forces are working together in a flux of momentary change; they are never the same for two consecutive moments. They are the component forces of the psycho-physical life. When the Buddha analyzed the psycho-physical life, He found only these five aggregates or forces. He did not find any eternal soul. However, many people still have the misconception that the soul is the consciousness. The Buddha declared in unequivocal terms that consciousness depends on matter, sensation, perception and mental formations and that is cannot exist independently of them.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	I was going to answer but I see its directed at Christians.

It's that voice that you hear in your head, minus your body.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Use of the terms "soul" and "spirit" in the Bible is very complex. Often in the New Testament, they are used synonymously to refer to the immaterial part of man; at other times, they are used with fine distinctions. In those cases, the term "soul" seems to refer to man's more basic psychological functions as he interacts with the world, while "spirit" seems to focus on man's relationship with God. In the Old Testament, "soul" is sometimes used to refer to man in his totality.<br>  <br>  Theologians struggle with the question of whether man is made up of two parts, namely body and soul/spirit, or three parts, namely body, soul and spirit. The latter position has been popularized through the teaching of many Christian psychologists and teachers, since it furnishes such a handy way to distinguish between man's material nature, his psychological structure, and his spiritual relationship to God.<br>  <br>  Illustrations from the Bible would be as follows: In Genesis 2:7 the Hebrew word for soul is used in reference to man in his totality as created by God. A situation in the new Testament where soul and spirit appear to be used synonymously is Luke 1:46-47. An instance where soul and spirit (used as adjectives) seem to be in contrast, soul referring to man's lower psychological functions and spirit to man's higher spiritual function, is 1 Corinthians 2:14-3:4.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	It is a ghost which lives inside your head and does all the things bits of your brain ought to be doing<br>  <br>  If you die, are brain damaged, brain washed, or whatever, the soul will helpfully pretend that it is likewise damaged<br>  <br>  Fun soul facts;<br>  - Never been seen<br>  - About as likely as we-are-all-brains-in-jars|`|3aVxJYf6aa	You may remember that the Bible was originally written mainly in Hebrew and Greek. When writing about the soul, the Bible writers used the Hebrew word ne′phesh or the Greek word psy·khe′. These two words occur well over 800 times in the Scriptures, and the New World Translation consistently renders them “soul.” When you examine the way “soul” or “souls” is used in the Bible, it becomes evident that this word basically refers to (1)?people, (2)?animals, or (3)?the life that a person or an animal enjoys. Let us consider some scriptures that present these three different senses.<br>  <br>  People. “In Noah’s days .?.?. a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1?Peter 3:20) Here the word “souls” clearly stands for people—Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Exodus 16:16 mentions instructions given to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna. They were told: “Pick up some of it .?.?. according to the number of the souls that each of you has in his tent.” So the amount of manna that was gathered was based upon the number of people in each family. Some other Biblical examples of the application of “soul” or “souls” to a person or to people are found at Genesis 46:18; Joshua 11:11; Acts 27:37; and Romans 13:1.<br>  <br>  More recently, when The Jewish Publication Society of America issued a new translation of the Torah, or first five books of the Bible, the editor-in-chief, H.?M. Orlinsky of Hebrew Union College, stated that the word “soul” had been virtually eliminated from this translation because, “the Hebrew word in question here is ‘Nefesh.’” He added: “Other translators have interpreted it to mean ‘soul,’ which is completely inaccurate. The Bible does not say we have a soul. ‘Nefesh’ is the person himself, his need for food, the very blood in his veins, his being.”—The New York Times, October 12, 1962|`|NjPjpewlaa	Hi! <br>  we are all made up of body, soul, and spirit.<br>  the body, is well.. the body.  our flesh and blood.<br>  our soul, is our mind, our will, and our emotions.<br>  our spirit is the part of us that connects with God.  or not.

This was done by inserting the word AND in the place of OR in verse 27, chapter XI of the First Corinthians. The original reads: "Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink this wine unworthily, etc."<br>  <br>  St. Matthew 6:7 is made to read in the Protestant text: "When ye pray, use not vain repetitions." This is aimed at the repeated prayers of Catholics while saying the Rosary, as if repetition of the "Our Father" that Christ taught, and the "Hail Mary full of grace" salutation of the Angel Gabriel, were "vain." The Catholic text, of pre-Protestant origin, reads – "But in praying, do not multiply words, as the Gentiles do." It was not "repetitions" but "much speaking" that was condemned, as Saint Augustine said fifteen centuries ago: "Christ does not forbid much praying, but much speaking."<br>  <br>  Luke 1:28 is made in the Protestant Bible to read: "Hail, you art highly favored," when the Angel Gabriel said – "Hail, full of grace," as it appears in the Catholic Bible. The authority of the Latin Fathers, and the codices of Alexandrinus in the British Museum, the Epraenus rescriptus in Paris, and the Bezae in Cambridge University, stand as present-day evidence to sustain the Catholic translation.<br>  <br>  I'm only giving a sampling of changes.

Therefore, if a Muslim girls takes out her Hijab one day (may be because she was angry or wanted to impress her boyfriend) will mean less that if should would drink alcohol or commit zina or much worse kill someone. <br>  <br>  However, if she denies that Hijab is compulsory, that is one big major sin.

Civilization, however, has drawn women out of their homes, rent their veils, and corrupted mankind. For family life continues through the mutual love and respect of man and wife. But immodest dress has destroyed sincere respect and affection, and has poisoned family life. While worship of the human form in particular has shaken morality in appalling fashion, causing the abasement of man’s spirit.|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	It is commonly said by Islamic scholars:<br>  <br>  "Do not consider the size of the sin... but rather consider the Greatness of the One (Allaah) being disobeyed."|`|p5cglKf0aa	The Twenty-Fourth Flash<br>  <br>  On Islamic Dress for Women<br>  <br>  [While being the Second and Third Matters of the Fifteenth Note, this treatise was made the Twenty-Fourth Flash because of its importance.]<br>  <br>  In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.<br>  <br>  O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons [when abroad] [to the end of the verse].<br>  <br>  This verse enjoins the veiling of women. However, dissolute civilization opposes this command of the Qur’an; it does not consider the veiling of women to be natural and says it is slavery of a sort.<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : We shall explain only four of the many instances of wisdom in this injunction of the Qur’an, showing that it is entirely natural and those who oppose it are opposing the innate disposition of women.<br>  <br>  FIRST INSTANCE OF WISDOM<br>  <br>  To veil themselves is natural for women and their innate dispositions demand it. For women are weak and delicate, and since they are in need of a man’s protection and help for themselves and for their children whom they love more than their own lives, they have a natural desire to make themselves loved and not loathed, and not to be rebuffed.<br>  <br>  Also, seven out of ten women are either old or ugly, and they do not want to show their age and ugliness to everyone. Or they are jealous, and they do not want to appear ugly in relation to others who are more beautiful. Or they are frightened of assault or aspersions, and want by nature to cover themselves so as not to suffer assault, nor to be accused of unfaithfulness in the eyes of their husbands. If noted carefully, those who hide themselves most are the elderly. And out of ten women, only two or three may be found who are both young and beautiful and are not discomforted at displaying themselves.<br>  <br>  It is clear that people are discomforted by the looks of those they do not like or find tedious; they are upset by them. If a beautiful immodestly dressed woman takes pleasure at two or three out of ten men who are canonically strangers looking at her, she is bored by the seven or eight. Also, since a woman whose morals are not corrupted is sensitive and easily affected, she will certainly be distressed at dirty looks whose effects have been physically experienced, indeed, are poisonous. We even hear that in Europe, the place of open dress, many women are fed up at being the object of attention, and complain to the police, saying: “These brutes keep staring at us and disturbing us.” This means that present-day civilization’s unveiling women is contrary to their natures. And together with being in accordance with their natures, the Qur’an’s command to veil themselves, saves women—those mines of compassion who may be worthy companions for all eternity—from degeneration, abasement, what is in effect slavery, and wretchedness.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, by nature women are fearful of men who are strangers, and anxious at them. Fear naturally demands the veiling of women. For in addition to suffering the difficulty of bearing the load of a child for eight or nine months, which certainly embitters the eight or nine minutes’ pleasure, there is also the possibility of suffering the calamity of bringing up a child for eight or nine years without protector. And since this happens frequently, by creation they truly fear strange men and by nature want to hide themselves from them. Being weak, their creation demands that through veiling themselves they do not excite the appetites of men outside the stipulated degrees of kinship, nor allow any opportunity for assault; their weak creation gives powerful warning. It shows that their cloaks and coats are shields and fortresses. The fact that, according to news received, the bare-legged wife of a high-ranking man in the world was accosted in the country’s capital, in the market-place in daylight in front of everyone by a common shoe-shiner, deals a slap in the shameless faces of those opposed to the veiling of women!<br>  <br>  SECOND INSTANCE OF WISDOM<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2924&t=The+Twenty%2DFourth+Flash" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2924&...</a>|`|NBbrdhsNaa	Oh my god!

XZKh86qsaa	I suppose being really scared of hell is an unpleasant experience and feeling guilty must be the same.  I think that you probably already feel as if you are in hell.  Stop and consider for a moment where you would be without thoughts of heaven and hell and what is allowed and what isn't allowed.  I bet you would feel free to enjoy the company of this person spontaneously in each moment.  I would imagine too that the great qualities you see in this person you also see in yourself. Does your religion teach that all Love comes through God?  Can you understand that nothing that comes through God can be sinful?  Can you see that by putting yourself through this hell now you are preventing yourself from experiencing God's Love through the wonderful relationship you have with another loving Being?  There is only an eternal now and it is your choice whether or not to make it an eternal hell or heaven.  <br>  Follow your heart and intuition and know that nothing you can ever do can ever offend God.  Ultimately it is your own choice whether to let go of the suffering and experience the bliss of beingness in this moment or to submit to the fear and conditioning of a past which no longer exists except in memory.  Best wishes.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I believe in a God but not a hell.  Hell is ridiculously extreme and actually comes from paganism.

If you knew God had completely forgiven you, then there wouldn't be any reason for you to have fear of death any longer, would there?<br>  <br>  But is this possible? Yes!—and the reason is because Jesus Christ has already taken upon Himself the punishment you and I deserve. You see, you are right about one thing: You and I deserve to be punished for our sins. God is holy and just, and even one sin would be enough to banish us from His presence forever. The Bible solemnly warns, "It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Hebrews 10:31).<br>  <br>  But the Bible doesn't stop there! It goes on to tell us that God loves us—and because He loves us, He sent His only Son into the world to die for our sins. We deserve to die and be separated from God forever—but Jesus Christ took our place. He was without sin, but when He died on the cross all our sins were placed on Him, and He took the punishment and hell we deserve.<br>  <br>  And that is why you don't have to fear God's punishment any longer! What must you do? The Bible's answer is simple: Believe Christ died for you, and then receive Him into your life. Trust Christ and invite Him into your life today—and when you do, God has promised to forgive you, completely and fully.|`|qA0VCdn5aa	Explain it to the guy what you are going through and if he is worth it, he will understand.<br>  If you believe that dating is wrong, you should tell him and maybe he will wait for you.<br>  I think you are doing the right thing but i also believe that if you are forgiven, you are forgiven. <br>  So take some time to ponder that over and think - are you REALLY forgiven?<br>  Pray about it, and it will all work out.<br>  God Bless!|`|QS4SPmeuaa	fack it. do what you want.  truth is god and jesus didn't even exsist.  just because people who are bigger than you say so doesn't mean its true. question authority. question your parants, and question your faith.  do you think all the other faiths are wrong... does that not mean that yours is wrong one way or the other.  date girl.  sheeet.  how are you going to know if you lke someone if you don't date.  you say your religon says no... how were the people who say that or wrote that born... sex... yes thats right.  it's human nature.  fack it.  do what you do.  find your own balence.  listen to your own voice.|`|5qqHNpmcaa	sweetheart, the way i see it you have 2 options;<br>  <br>  convert to wicca, in which there is no hell and love is considered the most pure thing there is (yes i no i sound very manipulative but im in wicca missionary mode.)<br>  <br>  Or pray your guts out.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. love is eternal, but rare. dont waste it.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	ugh....<br>  <br>  believe what u want. dont listen to any1 else.<br>  <br>  if u want to live ur 1 and only life feeling guilty 24/7 for sh!t u have a right as a human being to do then go ahead|`|XsI7ISqsaa	no you should free yourself from the chains of clearly an oppressive religion. dont worry you wont be going to hell because hell doesnt exist|`|WeR0E56eaa	see how religion inhibits ones happiness|`|SGiVFN9taa	When you say holy book...<br>  you mean the (Holy) Bible?<br>  Which I suppose you do read?<br>  <br>  <br>  First, let me tell you something about myself.<br>  I no longer have religion, because for one,<br>  it is an invention by man (and has nothing<br>  to do with THE DIVINITY).

I believe dating should be allowed, as long as it does not go to far. All i ask is that you consider this part of my advice to be the most important to take. Save yourself for marriage, if not, it will be the biggest regret you will ever have. You cannot have the relationship you can have with your spouse if you give yourself up to someone else. Think of it in this way. Someone is stealing from your spouse if you do so. Sex is the utmost powerful thing in a relationship and should be only be done under marriage, at least under my views. God will convict us on judgment day, but he can forgive us for any sin that we may have committed. Just be sure you are not homosexual or commit adultery. 1st Corinthians 6:9  says something like this. No homosexual or adulterer will inherit the kingdom of God. So if you screw this part up...well its up to God. I think if you repent this if you have messed up or will and truly repent it will all of your heart, that he can forgive you. But i wouldn't advice slapping him in the face by doing it again. Just remember. God can forgive any sin and all sins, if we bring our sins to his alter and truly repent for him. Once we give up our sins, he will remember them no more, and cast them as far as the east is from the west.|`|nMLomteraa	Do you love him or do you love God? Dating can lead to lust, so be careful.

It is still only about 10 percent. On the other hand; any child who is raised by same sex parents is considerably less likely to be rejected by their parents just because they happen to be one of the 10 percent... <br>  <br>  Genetics is kind of like a "lottery" and it still requires that the right combination of approximately 30,000 genes to produce -any- individual.

Or to give another example of genetic probabilities it takes something like a dozen different genes to produce an albino; If someone has albinism, but not their spouse, all their children will be carriers of the gene, but the chances of actually winding up with albino children isn't very large - assuming, of course, that the spouse's family has no history of albinism. In the general population the ratio of carriers of the genes for albinism is about 1:17,000.

GY2RtnuRaa	Regarding meat eating and abstain from killing<br>  <br>  There seems to be some confusion between eating meat and act of killing in Buddhism. To understand this, we will need to understand how Buddhism defined killing. Basically, if an act satisfied the following criteria, it will be consider as an act of killing:<br>  <br>  * The target is a living being<br>  * The person aware or know it is a living being<br>  * There is an intention to kill or to end its life in that person<br>  * The person commit the volition or the activities in the killing<br>  * The being died due to this action.<br>  <br>  Thus, eating meat alone is not consider as an act of killing. Unless, of coz', the person is directly involved in the slaying of the being in order to eat its meat.<br>  <br>  One thing we to know regarding the attitude of eating in Buddhism. We eat for the purpose of sustaining this body, which allow us to carry out our daily activities as well the cultivation for enlightenment. Buddhism do not encourage we eat for the purpose of satisfying our craving. But I admit this is quite hard sometime. Our teachers also say, in the minimum, we should at least eat with moderation. <br>  <br>  As for animal rights, I am not sure what issue does it got to do with Buddhist. Since we are encourage for abstaining from killing, we should be considered as being pro-animal or animal friendly.|`|AA12059478	This has been an ethical delimma for me for many many years.<br>  Even before I became consciously Buddhist I strove to be vegan.<br>  When I collapsed at work one afternoon and taken to the clinic the doctor said my blood sugar had plummeted dangerously low and asked mewhat I was doing.<br>  I told him and he said that I must keep up my protein intake.

A good discussion is described in the first section of the Seventh Talk in Zhuan Falun on the web, relating eating meat and killing to the Buddhist practice.  <br>  <br>  Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books about Falun Gong are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions.<br>  <br>  Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China.

About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide, enjoying a bill of good health through meditation and spiritual practice.<br>  <br>  Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China.

In order to win support from other monks, Devadatta tried to be more strict than the Buddha and show Him up as indulgent. Devadatta proposed to the Buddha that all the monks should henceforth be vegetarians. The Buddha refused and repeated once again the regulation that he had established years before, that monks and nuns may eat fish or meat as long as it is not from an animal whose meat is specifically forbidden, and as long as they had no reason to believe that the animal was slaughtered specifically for them.<br>  <br>  The Vinaya, then, is quite clear on this matter. Monks and nuns may eat meat. Even the Buddha ate meat. Unfortunately, meat eating is often seen by westerners as an indulgence on the part of the monks. Nothing could be further from the truth -|`|kSWgbH9gaa	Eating meat deliberately, is endorsing others to kill/take an innocent for your personal greed and satisfaction. Whether doing it yourself or endorsing others to do the same deed, is really no different from each other. Both are sourced from selfish greed and disregard in inflicting suffering on others.<br>  <br>  So the person that answered, "REALITY", is way off. In terms of the precepts, eating eat is NOT okay. Do whatever you want, but the consequences are a debt to be repayed.<br>  <br>  Eating meat, killing, endorsing the slaughter, you are a cause of that suffering. You are the cause of that animal being killed for your consumption and pleasure. That's the debt you have. That animal never said you could eat him. Yet you feast on his body. That's like me going to a restaurant and not paying for what I've eaten. <br>  <br>  Being vegetarian is considered "taking a loss" because we miss out on the flavors and "pleasure". We take the loss in this case so that we don't create such debts which have to be paid back later. <br>  <br>  Eating meat is not taking a loss because you are gaining flavors and eating pleasure. However, you gotta pay for all those animals you ate. No free lunch!<br>  <br>  ----<br>  NOTE: this answer does not pertain to the monastic practice of the begging bowl. The monastic eats just to eat and takes whatever is given to them. Their mind is not fixed on discriminating flavors or food. They do not CHOOSE to eat meat. Their minds are thus pure. <br>  <br>  As for us, who have the ability to choose, and we choose meat when we don't really need it, then that's just a greedy/selfish mind.

So killing is not accepted, but eating meat is OK. Because it is our intention that becomes karma not the deed it self.|`|O4q4JTIuaa	At least according to the Pali texts — that the Buddha and his followers did eat meat so long as certain conditions were met. These conditions were that a monk should not have seen, heard, nor have any reason to suspect, that the meat was from an animal killed specifically for him. If these three conditions were met then the meat was said to be ‘blameless’. There are some four references to the ‘blamelessness’ of eating meat-once in both the Majjhima and Anguttara Nikayas, and twice in the Vinaya. However, for a householder to have an animal killed in order to feed a monk was reckoned to result in great demerit. In the Sutta Nipata a previous Buddha, Kassapa, is admonished by a brahmin for eating ‘stinking meat’. Kassapa replies with a long list of unskilful mental states and declares that such are ‘stench’, not the eating of meat. There is also the notion from the Vinaya that meat and fish are ‘excellent food’ for those who are ill. Interestingly, in the Chinese ‘equivalents’ to the Majjhima and Anguttara Nikayas, the sutras dealing with the ‘blamelessness’ of eating meat are absent.<br>  <br>  <br>  In contrast to these few canonical references to the conditions under which meat might be eaten, there is an overwhelming abundance of exhortations to be ashamed of roughness, full of mercy, and dwell compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life. The Buddha also teaches that we should refrain from harming plants and seeds, not to speak of sentient beings. Is there not, therefore, a tension in the texts themselves? Is it really possible to dwell kind and compassionate to all living creatures and to eat their flesh knowing that it was taken in an act of violence?<br>  <br>  It can be argued that as the Buddha lived in a meat-eating, non-Buddhist society, he taught the monks simply to accept what was offered to them, given the conditions above, as a practice in even-mindedness. In so doing, the Buddha was simply going along with the standard practice of the shamanic community. But should not the situation change when that society has an increasing number of Buddhists within it?<br>  <br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>> Is there an ethical link between the killing of an animal and the eating of its flesh?<br>  <br>  To say that eating an animal’s flesh has no ethical connection with the brutal act of killing it and the fear and terror experienced by it shows a thoroughgoing insensitivity to life, a poverty of imagination, and an incapacity to reason. Although one may not have killed the animal oneself or had someone else kill it for one, one is not freed from responsibility for the killing. A butcher or slaughterman kills an animal not for himself but for a market of consumers. If there were no market of meat-eaters there would be no point in butchering animals except for one’s own consumption. Therefore if one decides to eat meat one has also decided to become part of the market of meat consumers. And if one has become part of this market one is connected with the demand to which the butcher or slaughterman responds. There is a very definite relationship between the meat-eater and the brutal act of killing, between one’s desire to taste flesh and the actual pain and suffering undergone by the animals.<br>  <br>  If one is trying to practise the teachings of the Buddha by becoming kinder and more compassionate to all creatures it is quite obvious that one relatively easy step to take is withdraw from the market for animal flesh. Surely, in our age, no form of meat eating can be said to be entirely ‘blameless’.
AA12245463	Jews had lived in those countries for many generations and considered themselves to be loyal citizens just the same as any other citizen.  No one could ever have imagined the level to which mankind would sink!!!  Who could imagine that their neighbors and co-workers would use twins and children for experimentation.  Who could possibly imagine that any people would openly use human skin to make lampshades and such?<br>  <br>  What would YOU do if your neighbor was forced to clean the sidewalk in front of your house with his TONGUE?

Well neither did the Jewish Germans, Poles, Austrians, etc.  When the situation became intolerable, to where would YOU escape?  Would you take your family or leave them behind?

You should be living the Bible without even reading it. And Ms. Jailbird, I don't know what "church" you go to or what "Bible" you read from, but sex before marriage is the same as fornication from the Bible point of view.

(Genesis 2:16, 17) "The wages sin pays is death," wrote the apostle Paul. (Romans 6:23) Adam paid for his sin with his own death. He was given life, he chose to sin, and he died as a penalty for his sin. (Genesis 3:19) What about the condemnation that the entire human race came under because of that sin? A death was needed to atone for their sins. But whose death could justly cover the transgressions of all mankind?<br>  <br>  God's Law to the ancient nation of Israel required "soul for soul [or, life for life]." (Exodus 21:23) According to this legal principle, the death covering mankind's transgressions would have to be of a value equal to what Adam had lost. Only the death of another perfect man could pay the wages of sin. Jesus was such a man. Indeed, Jesus was "a corresponding ransom" for the saving of all redeemable mankind descended from Adam.—1 Timothy 2:6; Romans 5:16, 17.|`|qKE52yb0aa	King Prahlad (Krita Yuga) is said to have told his followers that animal sacrifices mentioned in the religious texts were not referring to the actual living animals but the evil qualities in us..

There are verses praying to reveal the truth only for this reason..<br>  <br>  In our own times when Sri Sathya Sai Baba was conducting a massive yagna in those days, people used to run to fetch costly offerings including gems etc and the Baba told them that it was important to mentally offer the sins and evil qualities into the sacrificial fire and not go by the literal offering of the materials alone.. Even simple things like flowers and fruits can be offered formally while offering our infirmities mentally in exchange for blessings to reach perfection..<br>  <br>  A vedic verse lauds the merit of sacrifices "na karmana na prajaya dhanena thyaagenaike amritava manasuhu.." meaning, it is not by good karmas (like charities), not by bringing forth good children, nor by (accumulating) wealth (of knowledge, skills, materials of utility).. but by sacrifice alone one can attain immortality..! The sacrifice obviously refers to voluntary giving up of one's comforts (for the sake of serving the needy).. even oneself (to save another like in a righteous war).. or one's ego (vanity) to glorify the divine..!<br>  <br>  So if one looks at these sublime angles, the context in which the sacrifice is eulogised would be evident.. not if we simply look from literal contexts!<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|NjPjpewlaa	God never said you had to smash your own head.<br>  <br>  in fact, our compassion Creator God sent Jesus to be a sacrifice for us, so we no longer have to continuously sacrifice for our sin.<br>  there is no other religion has anyone close to doing that for us.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	It's not that it "pleases" YHWH who says, "I desire mercy & not sacrifices."<br>  <br>  It's payment.

His Father is in Heaven, so if Jesus had not ascended to Heaven, where had he been?<br>  <br>  Paradise is a place between the mortal realm and Heaven. There are two parts of this realm, Paradise where the spirits of all good people go and Spirit Prison where the spirits of all bad people end up and suffer until Judgment Day.

RNKSq3iEaa	Obviously not. In the Christian religion, there are two end goals: Heaven and Hell. Good or bad. Black or white.<br>  <br>  This is one of the problems I have with Abrahamic religions. Nothing is purely good or purely evil. According to the Bible, I am headed for Hell because I am an atheist. The good things I do - my charity work, the love I share with my friends, the driveways I shovel for senior citizens in the winter, my hard academic work, etc - mean nothing, because I simply don't believe in God. I am labelled as evil. However, according to the Bible, a Christian is headed for heaven. The bad things they might have done - petty theft, insults during quarrels with their family members, getting drunk, teasing and gossipping, etc - mean nothing to God. <br>  <br>  In fact, according to the Bible, a serial killer, rapist, and pedophile who lived off welfare, beat his wife, and drank all the time, can accept Jesus and go to Heaven, while a pagan who dedicated her life to saving the environment and raising awareness of the conditions children face in third-world countries will go to Hell. <br>  <br>  I converted from Christianity mainly because of this. Christians are not better people than me. Non-Christians are not all bad people. I do not deserve Heaven more than other people; and I don't deserve to be called evil and sent to be tortured forever just because I'm not perfect.<br>  <br>  Nobody deserves eternal torture, anyway. Not even Hitler.|`|T0xLpygfaa	listen son,  discard all this religion rubbish and begin to think about the world in rational terms.  you never know, one day, you might get to start appreciating the world for the real wonder which it is. without having to fog up the picture with unnecessary gods.|`|cXXJVz64aa	God doesn't exist.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	He's blind|`|2GaJFMqQaa	God doesn't see anything quite the way we do.

BTpNkxoeaa	They are out there.  If you're looking for a girlfriend who will accept you and not just some girl who is turned on by MTF's, you will have to look for a girl who is bi or lesbian who is accepting of having a trans girlfriend.  There are also MTF's who date other MTF's if you're cool with that.  What I suggest is that you start getting to know some girls in the bi/lesbian scene, let them get to know you well, and go from there.|`|Nsw0mJBNaa	OMG yes, well not everyone. But for real this is a topic I know lots about. There are many females who will accept you, maybe even most. They do not feel threaten and will even invite you the inner circle of fun and laughter. They will accept you. Then there are females who are very much excited and turned on by you.<br>  They are all over, several ways of meeting them. You just have to be open to it yourself. If the sense that you are a guy in a dress, forget it. That is not what it is about. But if you as a male are a feminine creature in who how move and express yourself and are truly feminine then that will peak their interest.<br>  Topics of fun talk? Talk about shopping and retail therapy to rid o you of the stress and of course you can always talk about guys. Two of the top fave e subjects for any female, genetic or by female by choice.<br>  You do know that in the womb you were 100% girl for the first 6 weeks? So in a way it just means that the testosterone bath you were subjected to just did not take. Which the way I view the world is a good thing, a wonderful thing. <br>  Hope this makes sense.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i don't think there are VERY many but i'm sure there are a few who could be down with that. not this girl though. but somebody.

Their mental perspective, despite all appearances, was false.  Keanu Reeves had the ability to do superhuman acts simply by denying what his senses perceive.<br>  <br>  The question becomes whether what we perceive is real or an illusion.<br>  <br>  If we cannot make a decision either way, we still have the ability to change something:  our reaction to how things come.<br>  <br>  There is a Chinese, maybe Buddhist or Taoist, story about an old man who lost a horse.  His neighbors said, "you lost your horse, that is unfortunate".  The man replied, "how do you know?".<br>  <br>  The horse later came back and brought a herd of wild horses with it.  The old man's neighbors said, "your lost horse came back and brought more horses with it.  It is very fortunate".  Again, the man replied, "how do you know?".<br>  <br>  The man's son rode one of the wild horses and had an accident and became lame.  The old man's neighbors said, "your son became lame because he rode one of the wild horses.  That is unfortunate".  Again, the man said, "how do you know?".<br>  <br>  Later, that kingdom went to war and the king conscripted every able-bodied man to fight in the war.  When the war was over, very few of the men conscripted came back but the old man's son was spared because the son was lame.<br>  <br>  We cannot control what our minds perceive but we can control our interpretation of it.  Our identity always existed apart from our sensory reality.|`|0ENFApaAaa	The problem with this question is that 'mind' and 'self' are not clearly defined concepts.  Indeed many would deny the existence of either or both, and those points of view might well be correct.  <br>  <br>  'We' suggests that you are referring to the physical presences (bodies) experienced as 'you' and 'me' - the subjects of social interaction.  What is wrong with being satisfied with material appearances ?  'We' are then simply what we appear to be - complex material organisms with certain behavioural traits.  We experience consciousness, and self-consciousness, but these can be seen simply as a functions of our constitution as material entities.  Why complicate the issue by inventing spurious metaphysical suppositions whose validity is highly dubious ?|`|aHaZ1IcHaa	we simply are.  beneath all the identities that we take on, there is simple existence.|`|PYD9JyIzaa	children of god filled with the holy spirit - peace be with u|`|FOZGMadaaa	Mankind.

uji29VvRaa	No, there are many Witches out there of various paths.<br>  <br>  The term Wizard isn't really used amongst people who practice any Pagan religion. A witch is a male or female that practices witchcraft. <br>  <br>  Also, it isn't just about spells. In fact, that is one of the least important things. Most modern day Witches are Wiccan, or follow one of the other many Neo-Pagan paths. It's a wonderful religion focusing on nature and deity. <br>  <br>  If you're interested in such things, I recommend looking into a couple of books -<br>  Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham<br>  Wicca for One by Raymond Buckland<br>  <br>  really any books by either of those two authors are worth looking into<br>  <br>  as far as websites go, there are lots out there, and a lot of them are full of crap. be weary of sites offering classes in magick for a fee, and be weary of books targeted towards a teen audience as most of those kind are filled with nonsense.<br>  <br>  websites i'd recommend:<br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://proudtobepagan.com/" rel="nofollow">http://proudtobepagan.com/</a><br>  <br>  witchvox also a huge link listing to other Pagan websites out there with more info regarding the various paths.|`|4TX26viFaa	You are very much a beginner, by what you're saying.  Wizards no longer is a term used by people who work in the Craft, we use the term 'witch', which covers male and female.<br>  <br>  You need to learn some basics before you can do spells.  Grounding, sheilding, centering and meditation are the foundation of all the work that comes after.  The words in spells only cover 10% of what you need to know.|`|TeJuytjZaa	Yes, there are many people that practice witchcraft.<br>  I don't know much about it, though, so I can't tell you more.Sorry.|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	no You aren't teh only one try witch vox to se covens and peopel in yoru area. covens usually take in peopel and teach them I am actually lookig for one myself but be dore warned if you are nto sure you wanan become a witch then don't you have o be sure of what yu want that is teh beginning and i'll tell you teh same thinsg I was told read as much as you can. theera re store that sell books an dyou can also fidn one  on witch vox close to youa nd I wouldn;t go aroudn saying wellI read becasue just because you read a cook don;t make you one. secondly books (i.e. the book of shawdows the  book for solotary pratciners by silverraven wolf.) can tell you about simple spells and thegs but spells hem selevs are presonal,|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Try doing some reading in books or magazines.  <br>  If you think that witchcraft is only about doing spells then it would be a good idea to learn more about what it is now and then decide if it is still for you.  Do not go by what you seen on  TV and films.  They are fictional which can be more exciting than real like, which is often plain boring. <br>  Good luck with what you do.

zEsfFPGfaa	After harvesting and curing, tobacco leaf is transported to manufacturing sites all over the world. The tobacco is allowed to age for up to three years in controlled environments to enhance its flavor.<br>  <br>  Then the tobacco is prepared for processing and cigarette production. Transporting and humidifying the now brittle leaf has to be done with care, allowing for the fine art of blending to take place.<br>  <br>  The major ingredient in each of our cigarettes is tobacco. A number of other ingredients may be added to the tobacco, including processing aids, humectants (which keep the tobacco moist and pliable), preservatives and brand-specific flavors. After the tobacco has been cut, it is stored in giant silos before entering the cigarette manufacturing process.<br>  <br>  Manufacturing cigarettes is a fast-paced, highly automated process; machines produce between 8,000 and 14,000 cigarettes every minute. Spools of cigarette paper up to 6,000 meters long are rolled out and tobacco is placed on it. The paper is closed over the tobacco, making one long cigarette known as a "rod".<br>  <br>  Machines slice this super-sized "rod" into much shorter lengths, insert filters, and finally cut the shorter lengths into individual filter cigarettes. Every single cigarette is checked at three different stages for the quality of its construction.<br>  <br>  The cigarettes are then sorted into pack-sized groups, wrapped in foil to preserve their aroma, packed and put into shipping cases.<br>  <br>  Although the manufacture of cigarettes is a highly automated process, it will never lose its human element. Supervision of the production process is vital: inspection of the leaf, blending, and quality assurance of the final product can never be left solely to machines.

NH3IBuSiaa	When I was with a guy, I felt nothing and when I'm with a girl, it's like fireworks and warm fuzzies. That right there told me I was a lesbian but it did take me years to finally trust my feelings and pursue my true desire to be with a woman and ultimately that's what makes me happy.|`|wV19G0CLaa	well i thought i was bi at first.. was interested in boys as well as gurls..but suddenly i wasn't into boys any more..and i was with a guy at the time and it just felt totally wrong.. kissing was as far as i went with a guy too.. but with a gurl things just felt right.. i felt like i knew what i'm doing and was sure of what i'm feeling.. that was when i was 16...so that's when i totally accepted that i'm lesbian..and never imagined being with a guy..couldn't even see myself with that guy i was with! everybody had bfs and i thought i should too.. then i learned that what i'm feeling is the only thing that's important..and people's talks mean nothing to me... and once i accepted that and became alright with myself i felt alot more at ease and confident and just myself!.. i am 18 now and totally okay with being lesbian.. i surrounded myself with friends who understand and support me... straight AND homosexual friends..and that's what we all need, specially when we're fighting this issue, cuz at first you'll fight it..and then you'll realize there is no way you can be fully happy and go against your nature at the same time.. and you need friends to help you through and just be there for you..<br>  <br>  Don't let labels play tricks on your mind now.. you're most probably lesbian.. but don't worry about it..don't think of it.. or else you'll pressure yourself over nothing.. just let time fly by.. and go with whatever feels right inside you..if you end up with a gurl you know you are lesbian..|`|Mnv3wUcVaa	I knew I was interested in girls when I was... wow, i think somewhere around 6 or 7. I realized I was bisexual when I was about 16. I realized that I was a lesbian when I was 21. I'm 23 now and this year I really really accepted who I am. It took some time to come to terms with it because of the disapproving stares (i live in a very small town where everyone is bigoted and religious). i didn't think that i was going to fit in anywhere and it was hard to accept a life where i didn't think i would ever be accepted by anyone around me. now i have job that offers benefits to same sex couples and there are a few gay people at my job (including my girlfriend). i've gone into the city (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) where there's gay/lesbian bars and wow - I'm not alone!!! That really helped me to understand that I'm not alone and I'm not weird! Well... at least not due to my sexuality! :) It's human nature to want acceptance and I felt I had none, so it was hard to accept myself because I really wanted to be straight so i could just live how everyone around me was living and not worry about how everyone around me would feel about me if i were a lesbian. <br>  <br>  Now i just don't care. I am what I am, I'm not alone and people in this tiny city can stare all they want! <br>  <br>  Acceptance can be a long road if you let it. You don't have to label yourself, you could just be with who you're attracted to and acceptance of yourself will come in time. Just live how you want.|`|V1FuXBYraa	It's really hard to be honest with yourself, especially when it feels like you're living a lie and trying to cover it up.

AA11142708	If you desire to walk the path to the end, you will take into your mouth only that nourishment which helps you along the way. No alcohol or drugs there, but if you are like me, and consider Buddhism to be the most highly evolved  religion/philosophy (it seeks to eliminate all unnecessary suffering) then you will remain as close to the teachings as possible, even if that means you are only a hopeful person with spiritual aspirations. True, because the middle way has a learning curve for adapting appropriate Buddhist behavior (in thought, word, and deed) built into it, a change to moderate drinking would still be considered, by some Buddhists, to be consistent with the "practice."  I, myself, have practiced Buddhism in this way (I still like my beer though). Don't take this the wrong way, but the famous Zen practitioner, Allen Watts,  a student of T.D. Suzuki, a Zen master, late in life, went back to drinking alcohol and basically died because of it. Suzuki, his teacher, still gave him a Roshie funeral, a Zen master's funeral. Like they say "to err is human," Buddhism is, if anything, compassionate. Take care, and good luck.|`|FfBll2n8aa	One of the important aspects of Buddhism is "mindfulness" and control of the self using the mind.<br>  If you are intoxicating your mind with alcohol or any other drug, you are prohibiting yourself from gaining the high level of mind control required to advance spiritually. <br>  If you are simply wanting to introduce some Buddhist concepts and morals into your life, then I'm sure a drink occasionally would be ok- getting drunk though is counterproductive to everyone - whether you're a Buddhist or not, and I can't imagine anyone who wants to advance themeselves spiritually to a higher level would see heavy drinking as anything but destructive to the cause.<br>  However, unless you want to become a monk/nun in a Buddhist monastry/convent, or become seriously involved in the religion, this rule would not be enforced without exception. After all, there are Buddhists that eat meat, even though the religion itself is against the harming of other living creatures. It's like any religion - you can take it as far as you choose.|`|J0GE7Wiraa	From my understanding, yes. Alcohol violates one of the Five Precepts, which is not to consume alcohol. Alcohol is negative because it clouds up your mind, when one of the most major goals of Buddhism is to have a totally clear and pure mind. The effects of alcohol are only negative, and this is why it violates the teachings of Buddhism.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	looks like its already done its damage<br>  <br>  "If i want to become a Buddhist , does this mean i have to give up Alcohol completely?" - ok stop right there! clearly you have not researched Buddhism extensively.<br>  <br>  i suggest you do before you launch into a whole new way of life (no, it's not a typical religion)<br>  <br>  "If so, why?" - because it defeats the purpose of becoming buddhist|`|jc4xttvkaa	Well, not entirely sure, but most of it's teachings are about the middle path, which means everything in moderation.|`|sfuClptYaa	Sure , no bro|`|AA11199370	If you just want to be a Buddhist, you can be as you wish even you are the bad one who can kill everybody. Many people who called themselves "Buddhist" or even some Buddhist Monks love Alcohol, Betting and do many bad things.<br>  <br>  But! If you want to be Real Buddhist who want to get out off the cycle of suffering by following Buddha ways, Learn more about Buddha Teachings and try rethinking about your question again. I'm sure that you will know an exact answer by yourself.|`|362db0ff453c6ed340e6f2a68b1df5c7aa	hemmmmm ... yes...

fmHyfVmVaa	LOL Panda. I have been thru so much change in the past year I wake up in the morning & must introduce me to myself! The result of this much internal & external change has been that I can pretty much stay out of my own way now. I have learned the best way for me to handle change is just to accept it & roll with it. As someone said, Spirit, the Divine, the Powers that Be (what ever your favorite term is) have nothing but my best interests at heart in the form of what I need to unlearn the lies & programming that has held me captive for longer than I can remember. Fear, resistance, & sometimes even just trying to figure it all out translate to resistance, & that causes pain in any period of change. This does not mean that I don't participate. When I wake up & all is new, I simply do that which I know is right at the time & the next thing that is in front of me to do.  But the biggest thing I can do at any time be it a time of change or  a time of rest is to Be Present, Be Awake. If I am not here now, I generally miss something vital!<br>  Blessings!|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	To be born of His Spirit, cleansed by His blood, is to be born of God. It is a positive change. A new birth. A new creation in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  That would be a personal spiritual change.<br>  <br>  A spiritual change could be an opportunity or threat.

I think the challenge is to confect thoughts that will allow one to efficiently, and smoothly flow into the physical representation of our non-physical thoughts, accompanied by a balanced emotional state of eager anticipated expectation. <br>  <br>  In addition, it is training ourselves to be aware of what energies are conducive to the design that we desire.  Doubt, equals - low self-esteem, equals - low confidence, equals - a restriction of energy, equals - anxiety fear frustration, anger,  depression. The challenge is to find a way where we flow towards our destination in a light hearted elevated joy of relaxed happiness. With out this state everything else will seem to be a threat. It is the energy that inspires inspiration and movement and rapid transformation.

The master says (basically), "Have I miss treated you?  Dealt unfairly with you?  Did I not give you what you agreed to?  Then why do you complain?  Why do you have a problem with my generosity?"<br>  <br>  So Scripture has already answered that for you & for me.

It would be impossible for anyone regardless of sex, religion, or anything to not go back to where they came from.  In the end the universe all contracts back to what it was originally, that includes everything.  In other words, we are really all one, separation is just an illusion.<br>  <br>  Um, and this little part of the universe needs more coffee at 6:30 am.  Good luck on your quest for answers!|`|S2aHg67yaa	Homosexuality is NOT a sin, or a choice. Do you get turned on by people of the same gender? If not, then you are heterosexual.

He did not give us freedom TO sin but FROM sin. <br>  it is also wrong to even consider that homosexualities will go to Heaven because christianity is a relationship not a religion. <br>  if the person has not allowed God into his or her life to transform him or her , God is infact not a savior in their life.<br>  <br>  and lastly, you cannot say that God is not merciful because He sents people to Hell.<br>  They had a choice like how everyone does to choose what they want to believe.<br>  God merely gave us the key back to eternal life when we were sinners <br>  and dammed to Hell.<br>  The bible says"Ephesians 2:5 (New International Version)<br>  5made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved."<br>  <br>  We are the ones who made the decision to even want to know more about Christ and not to mock the doctrine.<br>  and futhermore, i wont say that i am in Heaven if the "god" had agreed that this standard of holiness could be compromise.<br>  thats not heaven my friend, dont fool yourself.<br>  what you were made to be is what you meant to be.<br>  <br>  i would sympathiese will the homosexual because i know she/he is in bondage. and i would like to say is there is freedom in the name of Jesus. and i have walked through it before. trust me, it is possible to change, experience the real power.

You can put the finished product inside a hollwed out bread stick in the form of 'Pan Bagnat'. <br>  <br>  The ingredients for Salade Ni?oise are basically lettuce, tuna fish, French vinaigrette dressing with a bit of garlic added to it, anchovy fillets, green pepper, balck olives, hard boiled eggs and lightly cooked green beans.  The lettuce, green beans and tuna are tossed with the salad dressing.  The other ingredients are arranged over the tossed salad in a decorative style, and then the remaining dressing is pured over the top of it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you could make a Mexican or Te-Mex style salad by crushing some nacho chips over the vegetables, sprinkling some grated cheddar cheese on top and using chipolte salad dressing or a spiced up Thousand Islands type of drressing.  <br>  <br>  Another idea is to make a vegetarian pita bread sandwich.  In addition to lettuce, cucumber and tomato, you would use red onion, maybe some alfalfa sprouts, a bit of grated carrot or any other kind of vegetable that would work in well with the mixture.  Cream cheese could be spread on the inside of the pita bread to give it the right flavour.  Whole wheat pita bread is really good for this type of sandwich.|`|bZM4R2gDaa	Now tats like a gud old soul making lunch 4 ur wife,lol.<br>  <br>  U can basically add anything green salad u can add red cabbage(which is not green), parsley, carrots, & wat ever u like the dressing is best wen u use olive oil, lemon , salt & pepper.<br>  <br>  For a creamy salad u can use left over grilled chicken,meat or tuna, cooked pasta, olives, boiled potatoes, any kind of  canned beans, chedder cheeese cut into cubes& ......<br>  Dressing could be made by, mayo or yogurt, cream.<br>  <br>  Full fat salad is real yummy though,lol.<br>    Have fun enjoy & a broken heart can be fixed like a mirror but can's take away the scars.

One of the guys said "Why do want to go there? They are all Arab terrorists!" I was of course in shock and told him that I am Muslim and from Pakistan so he and I started to argue and he didn't even apologize but said that "Oh I didn't say that all of them are terrorists."

And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:<br>  <br>  For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&t=First+Chapter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...</a>|`|h87y0K3caa	To strengthen your faith you should have faith on ALLAH.....Truth,honest,trust...are keys of faith....if you are having exams then read surah YASEEN at night and morrning.pray five times a day and one more thing for all of you..WHEN THE AZAN STARTS AND YOU ALL ARE SITTING AND LISTENING TO IT.

0VftAjEJaa	Religion is an open ended question. I study religion a lot and work around it very closely. That doesn't make me inclined to any one particular religion. I actually have a doctorate in the Occult Sciences, so I guess that makes me a specialist.<br>  <br>  Religion, at it's bare, is very close. I believe, and have researched, that all the world's religions are so similar they could be the same. Some isolated religious sects from the ancient world are different, but not by a great degree. <br>  <br>  For me it is all the same. God, the Source, Universal Divinity all come from the same energy. Interestingly enough all of them have a section totally devoted to the mystical energies we now call 'magic'. <br>  <br>  I was raised baptist but that didn't pan out.|`|aHaZ1IcHaa	my religion revolves around the Bible, and the acceptance that it is all true, there must be no cherry picking.  I love it because it is real and true, and it gives me strength, love, and understanding.  the One true God is my God.  there is only one, God male and female, united together in one sacred body,which is the creative principle.  I also accept the trinity.  Nobody is perfect, including myself and the people who share my faith.  But they forgive me my flaws, and I forgive theirs.  I was converted by missionaries.  I knew the Bible (more or less) but I didn't understand it, and therefore didn't believe it before I was born again.  the missionaries showed me the truth about what I didn't understand, and I accept my faith from where I found it, and remain loyal and true to the teaching I first jeard and understood.  God bless you, I hope this helps.|`|ZNfWnQjlaa	class 37 worship association, basically worshipping the hellfireness of diesel locomotives|`|QF4W5aYRaa	There is ONLY ONE GOD!! And you can get all one needs to know from your "human"owners manuel, The Bible. I was brought up Catholic, and left the "church" when I was 17. Spent 20 years living  the life, married twice, had money, lost all of it, and one night put my new truck in a Montana river. With the truck filling up with water, and a stuck seat belt, and only my nose sticking out of the water, I repented for all my wrongdoings, and told God if He saved me, I would straighten out and serve His Son, Jesus Christ, with that thought, my seat belt fell off, and I crawled out the passenger side of my truck. 4 years later, He , by the prompting of The Holy Spirit, allowed me to be the vessel that saved my daughters life. What I love about Jesus, is that we have a close, personal relationship. It is not a religion, it is a continuous, constant personal relationship. What I don't like is people who say they are Christian, and can't tell you about anything that is in Gods written Word, no scripture in their heart! I have a real problem with the Catholics, too much rituals and tradition, I now go to several "churches", home based, and evangelical, The Lord leads me as to where to go, He hasn't led me astray yet, it's been 13 years!Praise God!<br>    Not that it mattered to me, but in the last few years, there have been many amazing facts brought to light. The Bible is the ONLY prophetic book with a 100% accuracy track record, and true, pure science validates The Bible at every encounter!

I was brought up an atheist, my whole family is, I can't really say why I converted, I just went through a really bad time where I hated life and being alive and he brought me back I guess,  I just knew there was more, that there was a higher power, people say why doesn't god just show himself, but believe me he does!|`|Fqi7sgRMaa	My Religion is Christian.

Another thing that i love about my religion is that i am loved by my God no matter what i do and how i bad i screw up, he does not discriminate and he does not judge.

Below are verses from the Glories Quran.<br>  <br>  Informing the Angels About  Adam <br>  Allah the Almighty revealed: And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth." They said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while we glorify You with praises and thanks (Exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners) and sanctify You." He (Allah) said: "I know that which you do not know." Surah 2: 30 <br>  <br>  Teaching Adam<br>  And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), then He showed them to the angels and said: "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful." They (angels) said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise." <br>  <br>  He said: "0 Adam! Inform them of their names," and when he had informed them of their names, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?" <br>  <br>  And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam." And they prostrated except Iblis, he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)." Surah 2: 31-34 <br>  <br>  The Fall from Paradise<br>  And We said: "0 Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrong-doers)." <br>  <br>  Then the Satan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: "Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time." Surah 2: 35-36 <br>  <br>  Allah's Mercy on Adam <br>  Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful. <br>  <br>  We said: "Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever." Surah 2: 38-39<br>  <br>  As you can understand the Satan (devil ) cannot hold you or grab you, the Satan (devil) can play with your mind. So when a person is lost in belief and wonders on blind and never understands his reason here on Earth and commits sins, Allah will conceal the heart and you will wonder blind and deaf. <br>  <br>  I do believe in Islam because my heart accepts it, no one told me to brace Islam, but I read the Glories Quran in English translation and I found clear signs and understanding of this short life. You would ask yourself for miracles and signs. Just close your eyes and open them.<br>  <br>  Allah has mentioned in the Quran,<br>  <br>  Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth). <br>  <br>  “He it is Who made for you the night that you should rest therein, and the day to see. Surely in those are signs, indications of His Oneness, exalted be He, for folk who are able to hear (those who think deeply).”<br>  <br>  Can you see why there are nearly 2 billion Muslims in the World and the fastest growing religion. It is not a race but a faith chosen for mankind. I do promise you, Allah does not mention convert to Islam or else. It’s your choice and path. Allah will be the judge not me. <br>  <br>  Here are some web sites, for you to look on about Islam. Our five pillars we submit to and follow. <br>  <br>  The 'Five Pillars' of Islam are the foundation of Muslim life: <br>  ?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

She was 9 YEARS OLD.  Why can't some of you see that!|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Is it right that the Catholic church excommunicates a raped 9-year old for an abortion but not Adolf Hitler?<br>  <br>  Wow!  Adolph Hitler had an abortion?<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It seems that the church is only wishing to excommunicate the caring individuals that are trying to help this poor girl.<br>  <br>  I am not Roman Catholic, but I understand the Roman Catholic viewpoint in this case.  That viewpoint is simple:  abortion is murder.  Now, is rape bad?  Yes.  Is rape (or molestation) of a 9-year-old bad?  It's vile.  Is raping a child as vile as murdering a child?<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church has instituted a policy designed to reduce abortions among Roman Catholics.  The reason is that abortion (from their view) is the murder of **your own child**.  However, calling it "abortion" and claiming (as many do) that it is a "right" make it seem - to the public - much less murderous than taking a golf club and bashing in the skull of your 5-year-old.  However, it is in fact (from that view) **the same thing**.  The difference is only a *legal* one - there is not one iota of difference, morally, between having an abortion and paying someone to violently murder your own child.<br>  <br>  The policy that the Roman Catholic Church has instituted is one of **automatic** excommunication.  Regardless of what any bishop says, any Roman Catholic who causes an abortion to be performed is excommunicated - automatically.  Here are the details<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/abortio2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/abort...</a><br>  <br>  SO, the bishop who was publicly announcing that these individuals would be excommunicated was only repeating Roman Catholic policy.  He was not making **any** effort to excommunicate anyone.  Quite the contrary:  he was warning them of the consequences of their actions, consequences that he is powerless to override.  In other words, the bishop wasn't saying, "better not do that or I'll excommunicate you, you bad people you".  What he was saying was, "if you do this, you will be excommunicated, and there's not a thing I can do to change that - so consider all other options before proceeding."<br>  <br>  <br>  NOW, *given* that I am not one of the mother's doctors, nor am I Roman Catholic, nor do I know the risks of all the options available - in other words, given that all I know is what is in the article - I agree with the Roman Catholic stance on this issue.  **All 3 lives** are equally precious.  *All possibilities* should be considered with the view in mind of saving as many of those 3 lives as is possible.<br>  <br>  Immediate termination means that 2 of those 3 lives have 0% survival chance.  I strongly suspect that there are other medical options which allow a greater chance for all 3 to live.<br>  <br>  Of course, I could be wrong - maybe there is literally no chance that the 2 children could survive.  Maybe the risk to the mother is so great that allowing the pregnancy to continue to the 24 week mark - the point at which 50% of premature births survive - would almost certainly result in the deaths of all 3.  I don't know.  But I *suspect* that immediate abortion does not provide the best chance of saving as many lives as possible.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|AA11796124	<<Is it right that the Catholic church excommunicates a raped 9-year old for an abortion>><br>  <br>  Yes. There are no circumstances in which abortion can be considered the morally proper alternative. This girl and EVERYONE who in any way served as an enabler of abortion was excommunicated.<br>  <br>  As evil as rape, especially the rape of a child, is, it does not compare to the evil of abortion because abortion constitutes the destruction of absolutely innocent human life.<br>  <br>  It's easy to see the evil in rape, especially child rape. For a lot of people, it's not so easy to see the evil in abortion. But isn't that the nature of the worst evils; that they don't appear evil at all?<br>  Right? Am I right?<br>  <br>  <br>  <<but not Adolf Hitler?>><br>  <br>  Adolph Hitler was brought up by Catholic parents, but he forsakened his Catholic Faith and left the Church as an adult. There was no need for the Church to excommunicate him since he had already left the Church entirely on his own accord.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<It seems that the church is only wishing to excommunicate the caring individuals that are trying to help this poor girl. So that's perfectly acceptable then! They are blackmailing adults against helping a raped 9-year old girl. Nice !>><br>  <br>  Again, you are blind to to evil of abortion. That is why you think the Church is out of whack. From the Catechism of the Catholic Church:<br>  <br>  2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: <br>  <br>  You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. <br>  <br>  God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. <br>  <br>  2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society. <br>  <br>  2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. <br>  <br>  2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. <br>  <br>  Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	Hitler was born catholic but as an adult, liked eastern beliefs.<br>  <br>  Hitler and Pope Pius signed a concordat.

As for the raped nine-year old, the child was not excommunicated, the people who helped give her an abortion were.  Catholics oppose abortion, if they are standing by their beliefs of not supporting abortion, it would be hypocritical for them not to excommunicate those that commit it.  Not to mention the danger they put the nine-year old in.  My guess is the child may have self-aborted at that age anyway considering her age and the stress of the situation.

Bb6fQtl0aa	To ask the dead, or people who are absent, to help you in anything is a form of polytheism. The dead and absent are not able to hear our prayers, nor are they able to respond to them. Nor do they share power with Allaah such that they can bring us benefit or avert from us harm. Nor are they able to "bring us closer to Allaah." It is a crime to call upon others with Allaah and its punishment for the one who dies upon this sin is eternal punishment in the Hellfire. In fact, this act is polytheism and this is the sin that Allaah does not forgive for the one who dies upon it.<br>  <br>  "Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin."<br>  (Qur'aan 4:48)<br>  <br>  This practice, of asking the dead or the absent for help is one of the greatest things that Allaah's Messenger, peace be upon him, was sent to forbid.<br>  <br>  Even in the first chapter of the Qur'aan, that we read in every prayer, we are commanded to recite:<br>  <br>  "You Alone do we worship. And You Alone do we ask for help"<br>  (Qur'aan 1:5)<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Allaah specifically condemns those who claim to call upon others besides Him under the pretense that they are a "catalyst" to bring a person nearer to Allaah's Pleasure:<br>  <br>  "Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allaah only. And those who take protectors, helpers, lords, etc. besides Him (say): 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.' Verily, Allaah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allaah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever."<br>  (Qur'aan 39:3)<br>  <br>  This is an affair oft-repeated in the Qur'aan. Rather this is the genuine monotheism that the very religion of Islaam is based upon.<br>  <br>  "Say (O Muhammad [peace be upon him]): 'Call upon those – besides Him – whom you pretend... They have neither the power to remove the adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person.' Those whom they call upon desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allaah), as to which of them should be the nearest; and they hope for His Mercy and fear His torment. Verily, the torment of your Lord is (something) to be afraid of!"<br>  (Qur'aan 17:56-57)<br>  <br>  In the above mentioned Verse, Allaah shows us that no person in the grave, no matter how righteous, is able to assist us. Rather, that righteous one in the grave is hoping for Allaah's Mercy and fearing His Torment.<br>  <br>  So to call upon them or other than them, (by saying "Yaa Ali" or "Yaa Abbass" or "Yaa Muhammad" or "O Jesus! Help me!".... is futile and it is the greatest sin a human can commit on this earth.<br>  <br>  Other Verses that clearly illuminate this point:<br>  <br>  "For Him (Allaah, Alone) is the Word of Truth (i.e. none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah). And those whom they invoke besides Him, answer them no more than one who stretches forth his hand (at the edge of a deep well) for water to reach his mouth, but it reaches him not; and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but an error (i.e. of no use)."<br>  (Qur'aan 13:14)<br>  <br>  "Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allaah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful." (Qur'aan 7:194)<br>  <br>  "Do then those who disbelieved think that they can take My servants as lords, gods, protectors, etc. besides Me? Verily, We (Allaah referring to Himself) have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers." (Qur'aan 18:102)<br>  <br>  <br>  "And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad [peace be upon him]) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright." (Qur'aan 2:186)<br>  <br>  BENEFICIAL NOTE: Common Doubts raised by polytheists and deviated cults:<br>  <br>  1) "Allaah tells us in the Qur'an to 'seek a means of approach' to Him. Or to make 'tawassul' "<br>  Answer: Yes, Muslims seek to get nearer to Allaah by the means that Allaah actually legislated. Calling upon the dead or absent was never the practice of the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.<br>  <br>  2) "Those whom I call upon are not dead, they are righteous martyrs that Allaah told us not to consider dead."<br>  Answer: In Islam it is not only shirk to call upon a dead person, it is also shirk to call on someone who is absent (whether living or dead).<br>  <br>  3) "There are hadeeth were people ask the Prophet, peace be upon him, to ask Allaah for help."<br>  Answer: It is not shirk to ask someone living and face-to-face to make du'aa for you. Those who asked the Prophet, peace be upon him, to pray for them, did so face-to-face and they did not ask the Prophet, peace be upon him, for help after his death.<br>  <br>  4) "Allaah refers to intercession in the Qur'aan."<br>  Answer: As for intercession, as taught by the scholars of Islam, then it is of two types. The affirmed intercession and the rejected intercession. Allaah confirms that the righteous can intercede for other Muslims who only worship Allaah. However, this special intercession is sought ONLY from Allaah, and not from the intercessor. This is the affirmed intercession. The rejected intercession is that which is sought from other than Allaah and what is sought is something only Allaah alone can give. And as mentioned before, the dead and absent are not able to hear our prayers nor can they help us in anything.<br>  <br>  5) "I know the person I supplicate to cannot help me without Allaah's permission."<br>  Answer: There is no proof from Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, that there is any dead or absent person who has EVER been given permission to hear, respond, and grant the prayers of a supplicant in this life. Worshiping Allaah upon doubt is clear error. Based on such faulty logic one can worship trees, stones, pigs, etc. as "I don't think they can help me without Allaah's permission."|`|qPSkkPqwaa	i dont know what barelvi's do but according to hanafi fiqh they are out of fold of islam..<br>  <br>  IF we invoke - it means calling upon someone to grant our wishes to come true.

But if it is something that he is not able to do, then it is not permissible for you to ask him, such as asking a man to let you be one of the people of Paradise, because he is not able to do that even if he is a righteous and pious man.<br>  <br>  2- The person who is asked should be capable, such as one who is alive. It is not permissible to call upon the dead, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>  “And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone).<br>  <br>  If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you [Faatir 35:13-14] <br>  ____________________________<br>  <br>  Tawassul: Islamic vs. bid’ah : <a href="http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/3297" rel="nofollow">http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/3297</a><br>  ____________________________|`|N6rHtZ4qaa	Just leave them man.

I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man.<br>   <br>  I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects. <br>  <br>  Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be. <br>  <br>  In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:<br>  <br>  We can be as honest as we are ignorant.

Hosea 4:6;" My people perish for lack of knowledge" Proverb1:7; "The beginning of wisdom and knowledge is the fear of The Lord." Proverb 8:13; "The fear of The Lord is to hate evil."

zZxX5PXBaa	Why would you reintroduce something that's already there. At least in some dialects of English.<br>  <br>  Try Yorkshire, for example, where the thee form is still used for informal speech, though it's been localised to some extent. 'Tha' for 'thee' often, for example, or 'Thi' with a short 'i' for 'Thy'. Thissen for Yourself, and so on.<br>  <br>  In Scots it's more subtle, and it's often more of a shift between Scots for informal speech, and something closer to Standard English for formal situations. So you'd move between 'yersel' for informal speech and 'yourself' for formal, for instance. But I've found Yorkshire often understood in Scotland, at least among Scots speakers.<br>  <br>  My guess is that if you look for it you'll find the distinction in many dialects of English; it's just that you're not going to find people using 16th or 17th Century Standard English forms. Well, not outside of Yorkshire, anyway. The 'y'all' and so on that you describe in the US is doing the same job. None of these forms need to be 'raised to standard' because standard English is just one more English dialect, it's not superior.|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	NO i like Englands language as it!!!

Scandinavian countries are in the process of dropping their formal 'you'.  It survives with older people, but that, obviously, is limited in time.  The French constantly are worrying about which type of address to use to people.  Could you honestly envisage situations where schoolchildren are given punishment for the incorrect use of 'you', like they are in France.  <br>  <br>  This would be the height of pretension.  There's a reason that English has dropped this sillly affect and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the Germans drop it too.<br>  <br>  You say that a plural is useful, but actually we survive without it very well.  No European language uses the inclusive and exclusive form of 'we' that you find in Malaysian ('us excluding the person being spoken to' and 'us including the person being spoken to').  There would be situations where it would useful, but can you honestly say you are hurting because it doesn't exist?

Be firm but matter-of-fact -- even faintly surprised-sounding, if you can carry that off.<br>  <br>  Likewise, matter-of-factly respond to, "You know, you need to start learning how to be independent" with a decisive "You're assuming I don't already know how."<br>  <br>  Throw her assumptions back at her like this, simply, firmly, self-assuredly.  You put her in the position of either dropping her point pretty lamely, or pursuing her point further -- which can only be done by more openly & explicitly insulting you.<br>  <br>  It may take some time to learn how to *instantly* home in on what her assumption *is* for each new comment -- timing is everything -- but this bothers you enough that I bet it won't take you long.<br>  <br>  BTW, you'll meet people who do this all through your life.

Is the unborn child (‘fetus’) a human being? <br>  <br>  2. If so, is it ever acceptable to kill the unborn? <br>  <br>  The answer to both questions is in Genesis. <br>  <br>  Genesis 25:21–22 states: ‘and Rebekah his [Isaac’s] wife conceived. And the children struggled together within her; …’ Note that Rebekah’s unborn twins, Jacob and Esau, are referred to as ‘children’ (the Hebrew word used, banim (plural of ben), commonly refers to children after birth, and often has a more specific meaning ‘sons’. <br>  <br>  The New Testament uses the usual Greek word for baby, brephos, to refer to the unborn John the Baptist, who ‘leaped in her [Elizabeth’s] womb’ because of the presence of the unborn Christ Luke 1:41–44). <br>  <br>  Unborn babies are not disposable clumps of tissue, despite the claims of many pro-abortionists. And they are always human right from fertilization, because all the DNA coding needed to build each individual’s physical features is there in the fertilized egg.<br>  <br>  The second question is also answered in Genesis. Genesis 1:26–29 and 2:7–23 make it clear that man was created distinct from the animals, made in God’s image. In Genesis 3 we read how this image was corrupted by the sin of the first humans, Adam and Eve. Only one generation later, Cain committed the first murder, a destruction of this image, thus a grievous affront to God. Violence (and other evils) spread throughout the world, so God destroyed all people apart from the Ark’s passengers with a globe-covering flood (Genesis 6–8).<br>  <br>  Right throughout Scripture, murder — that is the intentional killing of innocent humans — is regarded as a heinous sin (Exodus 20:13, Matthew 19:18, Romans 13:9). Since abortion kills an innocent human being, it is nothing less than murder. So all the usual ‘hard cases’ pushed by pro-abortionists, e.g. ‘What if the woman was raped?’, ‘What if the child is deformed?’, ‘What if she can’t afford to keep the child?’ are completely irrelevant. We should also remember Ezekiel 18:20, which prohibits executing a child for the crime of his/her father — this means that even the tragic cases of pregnancies due to incest or rape are no justification for killing the innocent child conceived.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	2 Kings 15:16 (King James Version)<br>  <br>  Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:9 (King James Version)<br>  <br>  Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. <br>  <br>  He doesn't sound very Pro-Life.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	I am nor religious but I read this,<br>  <br>  Titus 2:4 -- Young women should be taught to love their children.

If we can respect each human being, and animals as well, what an enlightened world we would live in. Can you imagine how we use animals as tools? as means of food? that's ridiculous. God would not want us to do that. To raise animals in cages? (Google CAFO, factory farms on wikipedia). animals, pump them full of chemicals, antibiotics and growth hormones? let them stand in their own filth? Would you feed this to your child? God told us to be good stewards of our earth, to take care of the weak (humans AND animals both!).

It is, indeed, alive creature!<br>  <br>  If "it" is not alive, then why:<br>  If you murder a pregnant woman, you can go to prison for two deaths??!<br>   hmm.... interesting!|`|Vz7snVz2aa	Exodus 20:13;  "You must not murder"<br>  <br>   well, after all the embryo is a life. imagine a one day old baby,does anybody accept to kill him? even if he was mentally retarded the law doesn't accept that he will be killed!! 2 days ago it was ok to kill him?!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22, 23;22 “And in case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. 23 But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul."<br>  <br>  God considered killing an embryo just like killing a man.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	What does the Bible say about abortion? Absolutely nothing! The word "abortion" appears nowhere in any translation of the Bible. Out of the 600 so-called laws of Moses, none comments on abortion. One Mosaic law on miscarriage specifically contradicts the claim that the Bible is anti-abortion. "If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit fully depart from her...he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth." (Exodus 21:22-25). The Bible therefore orders the death penalty for murder of a human being, NOT FOR THE EXPULSION OF A FETUS. This scripture makes it quite clear that an embryo or a fetus is not a human being.<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, life BEGINS AT BIRTH, when a baby draws its first breath (Genesis 2:7, God..."breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL)."<br>  <br>  Most true (i.e., unbiased) Biblical scholars and translators agree that the prohibition against killing applied only to the murder of ALREADY BORN Hebrews.<br>  <br>  "Happy shall he be, that takest and dashest thy little ones against the stones." (Psalm 137:9). God sets a bear to grind 42 children into mangled meat for teasing a prophet (2 Kings 2:23-24).<br>  <br>  Here are a few more verses to show that God is not pro-child or pro-life:<br>  Numbers 31:17; Deu 2:34 and 28:53; Isaiah 13:16 and 13:18. There are many more, but you get the picture.<br>  <br>  The teachings and contradictions in the Bible show that anti-abortionists do NOT have a "scriptural base" for their claim that their God is pro-life. <br>  <br>  As is evident, the "morality" that Christians claim comes from their Bible is wholly MANUFACTURED.|`|lqP9ayLKaa	Well dreamstuff entity pretty much beat me to what I was going to say.<br>  <br>  All the bible is subject to human interpretation so claiming "Thou Shalt Not Kill" is the prohibition is flawed. By that standard all war needs to cease immediately, as does the death penalty. There is no clause for the commandment saying "thou shalt not kill unless its thine enemies" or even "thou shalt not kill unless it is to save others."<br>  <br>  As humans we rationalise and reinterpret the bible constantly - for instances, places where abortion is prohibited but the death penalty is allowed. If people were really so concerned about making sure every fellow human survives why isn't there universal healthcare that is free at the point of delivery?|`|gEvvmkJPaa	It doesn't specifically say you can or can not rip out your unborn baby. Any more than it says you can't run a pyramid scheme. The Bible says you can not steal. The Bible says you can not murder. I want to correct the misquotes on killing. There is a Hebrew word for kill and a Hebrew word for murder, just like in English. The prohibition is against murder, which is shedding INNOCENT blood. Obviously, a baby is innocent. <br>  <br>  The idea that a woman would want to murder he child probably didn't come into the mind of God. As he says of other atrocities men do. For example;<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 32:35<br>  And they built the high places of Baal which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.’ <br>  <br>  But that is getting off track. <br>  <br>  Don't lose track of shedding innocent blood, versus those that are guilty. For example, Scott Peterson and OJ Simpson deserve to die. <br>  <br>  Specific to a baby not born, the Bible couldn’t be clearer. <br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22-23 <br>  <br>  If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman’s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life,<br>  <br>  If an unborn baby is harmed, punishment is proportional. Life for life.<br>  <br>  Abortion is murder.|`|5t9stUYjaa	Saying that He already knew you while you were formed in the womb suggests that even in early development stage, a foetus is still considered a human being, which falls under the Thou shall not kill.|`|yKQKzKwMaa	As many have said before, "Thou shalt not kill". However, it is equally wrong in God's eyes to judge a woman for carrying out the process. We should not judge one another, because none of us are without sin!

rLCx5ljQaa	god didnt use english.<br>  <br>  The bronze age goat herders that made him up after spending wayyy to much time out in the sun spoke the dialect u see in the bible|`|skEzGOE7aa	It stems from a basic misunderstanding of Hebrew. The Rabbi called "Jesus" probably actually never said this. The Jews understood that their God was not a man and that he never changes...<br>  <br>  In Exodus 3, God (actually German "Gott") said "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh" meaning 'I will be who I will be'. <br>  <br>  What God was saying here is that he defines himself. We can use ideas and words to try to define him but in the end he is not comparable to anything or anyone. There is nothing or no one like him. No sons in the way in which the New Testament teaches and of course no trinity. <br>  <br>  God is alone, he says it many times. There is no one to compare  to him, he says many times unlike the New Testament teaches that Jesus was God and that he was WITH God (which actually makes two Gods.) <br>  <br>  Look at the words of Jesus...<br>  John 17:3  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<br>  <br>  John 14:28  Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<br>  <br>  Jesus calls his father the "only true God" that is "greater than I" so he is saying that he is not the only true God and that God is greater than himself.<br>  <br>  He is not God unless he can be:<br>  <br>  1) less than himself and <br>  <br>  2) a false (not the only true God)<br>  <br>  while being God. <br>  <br>  It is one of the many conundrums that faces Christianity. <br>  <br>  I am Jewish so... I don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Zechariah 14:9  And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be ONE LORD, and his name ONE.<br>  <br>  No mention of two, three, or more Gods IN THE END GAME. There is no mention here of any numeral other than one.<br>  <br>  So even if Jesus did use the confusing language "Before you was, I am" he was incorrect so it doesn't matter IN THE END.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	Actually it was the prophets that the god supposedly used to speak on his behalf who were moronic.... and that of course for believing that there was a god and claimed that they have spoken to him.|`|9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	The old testament was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and the new testament was written in Greek.<br>  <br>  There is not much Aramaic in the old testament compared to Hebrew (Aramaic is a slightly modified version of Hebrew).  I am of the opinion that Aramaic was used to cover up or blot out what the original authors intended to write.<br>  <br>  For instance, Daniel 2:4b through 7:28 is all in Aramaic.  It also happens to mirror the entire book of Revelation (disagree? email me for the correlating scriptures).  <br>  <br>  There is one verse in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11) that carries similarity with Revelation 5:3, Daniel 2:10 and Daniel 2:28 and helps the reader understand that "the heavens" refer to outer space instead of the christian version of heaven, culminated (bastardized, if you will) from several different people's opinions.  Any description of "heaven" would be based off of an irrational dream and can make sense if it were explained as a dream because many of them are epic in nature.<br>  <br>  To more fully understand translations (at least, to get as much understanding as time will alow) one would have to go back to the original words and re-define them.  This goes not just for the bible but for any ancient works of writing.|`|xPeIvywdaa	ad hominum

Not everything that happens is what 'God did' but God lets some things happen even though the people who are doing them think they are doing what ever they like. He uses it all to the advantage of those who love Him and are called according to his purposes. Even people who think they are defeating God inadvertently serve Him (see the crucifixion of Jesus, for example). He even allows people who aren't even aware of His existence do things that bring Him glory.

And even people that say they are not religious, when some terrible catastrophe happens they are usually the ones that say things like "Please dear God, save us or help us" or "Oh my God" so deep down they must believe. I know I do.

God loves you, and no prayer goes unanswered.<br>  <br>  Jesus once told a story about a poor widow who repeatedly asked a corrupt judge to do what was right. (You can read it in Luke 18:1-8.) Repeatedly the judge refused—not because her request was wrong, but because he just didn't care. But because of her persistence, he eventually gave in and granted her what she deserved. In a far greater way, Jesus said, God (who is righteous and does care for us) hears the prayers of His people, and we must never give up.<br>  <br>  But let me add two things. First, realize that sometimes God is actually answering our prayers when we don't realize it—and the reason is because His answer may be "No" or "Wait." Yes, we think we know what's best for us—but God sees the whole picture, and sometimes He lovingly refuses to give us what we request, because He knows it isn't according to His perfect plan.<br>  <br>  Second, remember that we have the privilege of coming to God only because Jesus Christ died for our sins. Have you given your life to Him? If not, let your first prayer be one of confession and faith, asking Him to come into your life as your Lord and Savior. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com

zEsfFPGfaa	"Karotte, Maulwurf und die erste Liebe" is the title of a children's book.<br>  <br>  It's about the school of Walter, Rob, Annemieke, Herman, Sjaak und Linda, which is an experiment. They only have two rules: 1) Behave courteously because your freedom ends where the freedom of somebody else starts. 2) If you decide to do something, then do it as well as you can. The rules are checked by teacher "Mole" (Maulwurf), who looks like one. He is a teacher the way every student would like to have one: Whatever you do, I'm always available for you. This is actually necessary, because Rob suddenly loses his hair, Walter falls in love with Annemieke but Annemieke with Rob, and, and, and…|`|Nd6uItCDaa	well, i can't tell you what the first part means but<br>  'und die erste liebe' means and the first love.
Yfv1AvScaa	GOOD PEOPLE are kind and compassionate they are considerate they have good heart they care, they would help this society to be a better place to live.<br>  BAD PEOPLE are selfish they lie,cheat,steal and kill|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I believe this saying to the letter.<br>  <br>  "There is no such thing as good or bad, thinking makes it so."---Shakespeare|`|z2xRXM5Laa	I guess what makes one good or bad depends on one's own judgment and viewpoint. But every person has good and bad in them, even though we all lean more towards one  or another.  How we are raised, the adult lives we live, our environment, our education and personal experiences can all affect what we consider a 'good' or a 'bad' person.  Good and bad is often a point of view, not a fact. Some people base their opinions through religion.  Doing good or bad things doesn't necessarily mean that those people live good or bad lives.  It doesn't mean that they are good or bad people, either.  <br>  But I'd say that if a person tends to do things that are abusive, harmful and damaging to others repeatedly without care or remorse, then there's a good chance they are bad.|`|XZKh86qsaa	There is no such thing as a good or a bad person.  These are just judgments which are really unhelpful in seeing that all people are beings and that all people are doing the best they possibly can according to how they see reality.  Who is good or bad when in a deep sleep?  Who are good and bad when very young?  Ultimately we just are here and now, as Love and it is only our thinking and conditioning that separate us from experiencing that Love.|`|S2aHg67yaa	There are no good people and bad people. Just people, who are not entirely good and not entirely bad. Therefore, due to the seed of decency all people have, any "criminal" or "evil-doer" can be rehabilitated quickly and easily, using the right techniques.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	yes to both questions..everyone have a good side ..its just that some people did more bad things than good..you will know it by observing them..the actions, movement of eyes the way he talks|`|so5CCmmJaa	there is no such thing as a purely good or bad person. We are all human and we do a variety of types of actions. We all have strengths and weaknesses, hopes and fears.<br>  <br>  I don't determine if a person is "bad", I judge their actions, motivations if I am privy to them, etc. People may be really messed up in some areas, but have others in which they are true heroes.<br>  <br>  Humans are very complex, so don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, or be two quick to judge a man a saint. We are all capable of an entire spectrum of acts.|`|AA10852554	Yes.In my society, we have a saying that "good nature[intentions] cut the nanny goat tail short." Sometimes a person has a mind which says to do good to all.But one has to draw the line.  A student may have a project and ask you to do it for him/her.Assisting that person with research,organization of information and even proofreading is good; but doing the project and allowing the student to sit back and relax is wrong- unethical.<br>  You meet an alcoholic who is asking for money to buy food.Your heart reaches out to the person.It is easier to pull out money,give it and move on. You can feed the drug habit or you can offer to buy the person some food. Some people go a step further and try to help the person to be free from the habit.others ignore the person and brand him/her a bum. Something/someone triggered the lifestyle.<br>  As a person thinks in the heart, so is the person. Out of the mouth comes the things of the heart. Actions speak louder than words. No matter how good a person seems, there is a streak of greed and selfishness. When a person conquers these 'foes',the 'good' begins to shine through in that life. There are no 'good' people or 'bad' people because everyone makes mistakes. The philanthropist who gives away money may be regarded as 'good' because the wealth may be used for a beneficial purpose. But that person may have accrued wealth by selling a popular product that does not benefit mankind.  As a writer, if I expose such evil, popular opinion may brand me as a 'bad' person. People are blind to 'good' and welcome 'bad'.Every time I see a youth -teenage mother- I realize she is not the 'bad' person. Like the 8 year old bride who was married for the benefit of the family.What does she know about a conjugal relationship? This question has its complexities.|`|BgdwgVtKaa	There are no good or bad people. It's just thet everyone, without any exception, has both good qualities and bad ones as well. In different situations the person reacts differently.|`|AA11787105	It is completely ambiguous and dependent on culture.  More details would be necessary to answer this question.

AA11736322	While the real goal of the spiritual path is the same for all, there are many different roads that one can travel and one may even travel without a road.<br>  <br>  Also the goal may be described in different terms without always recognising that it is the same goal. <br>  <br>  This is so because we all have different starting points and different preferences and opportunities. <br>  <br>  Many spiritual travellers will not expect to reach their goal in their present lifetime, while others may realise that they do not really need to travel anywhere.|`|60303894b298b261e863d683d3b7c896aa	(Matthew 7:13-14) “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; 14?whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.|`|355JLlcLaa	I like to explore where there are no paths.

We choose our own paths.|`|NjPjpewlaa	What about the all important destination?<br>  Jesus IS the only way to our Father God.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I guess, I don't really know what you mean, but in the spirituality sense I believe all religions are a path to God.  And religion is just about having a specific journey and not the destination.|`|AA11849917	If you're traveling East, and I'm traveling West, I doubt seriously that our paths are even remotely similar.<br>  <br>  For instance, Jesus said that the ONLY way to God is through Him.  This sounds rather narrow-minded on his part, but he even said that the road is narrow, and the gate is narrow, and few actually find it; whereas (again, according to Jesus), the road to perdition is broad, and the gate is wide, and the multitudes are on it.<br>  <br>  So, if our walk is different - say, for instance, you're on the narrow road while I'm on the broad road, (or if YOU are on the broad road, and *I* am on the narrow path), our paths can never be the same.<br>  <br>  (Oh, by the way, the broad way is broader than we realize - it includes all the "in between" paths, those that aren't quite good enough to be on the narrow path.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	that depends.... if your walk involves asking God and Jesus along & following THEIR way then -- yes.  if we were standing face to face in conversation when Christ comes back to earth and He tells all people to turn to your right and walk forward toward me.... you and i would turn facing away from each other and walk forward -- while we would be going in opposite directions - eventually we would reach our destination - we would just be on different paths.  that's why i contend there is more than one version of the same incidents in the Gospels.|`|YOt6uTSzaa	We all start out on the same path and the quest seems to be the same..seeking the truth, seeking peace, seeking that one love that can not be found, the ultimate fulfillment and freedom.<br>  <br>  Although there are many side roads along way and we take different routes to get there....I believe there is only one major highway to reach the final destination.|`|LjsRfaskaa	We each have our own paths to tread.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14.

Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It is the only "god" name that translates into all languages, i.e. 1st person, self-existing God.  It is said that pronunciation is lost w/o the vowels.  The closest guess I've ever heard was that since "Judah" is spelled w/ same 4 letters & an added "D" (or daleth), & Judah is pronounced, "Ya-HU-da" (since there was no "J" until the 1700's), that Ya-HU-wah is best guess.  Or Yahweh in shortened form.<br>  <br>  Ironically, as the story goes, when Israelites were taken into captivity in Babylonia, they were mocked by mocking their God.  As followers of Ya-HU-wah, they were called Ya-HU's.  (See the irony while we are on Yahoo!)  So such mockery was intolerable to Hebrews who decided to hide The Name so that it could never be mocked again.<br>  <br>  There's a whole lot more.  That was the part I found most interesting.

But when a animal does that, it is nothing much but a animal confused or trying to take higher rank.|`|xEmIhOc3aa	being gay was never said to be a sin..u just hear it from the retarded pll who can't accept the difference in people...and plus there are so many different versions of the bible nowand days im sure there have been more changes than one in it..and God loves everyone ...hard to believ even murders if they repent..the only sinners are the ones who dn't believe in god..he thinks thats a crime far worse than murder|`|qcQm8eIbaa	I've noticed that myself.<br>  <br>  I guess....<br>  <br>  Well, I suppose that may be gods way of saying.<br>  <br>  "See? it doesn't matter what your attracted to....

I've been seeing waaay too many depressing stories for my own good<br>  <br>  Congrats on winning the Macbook Pro! I remember the time I won a disco boombox in middle school, I felt like I was God's child :D. Haven't really won anything after that though, haha<br>  <br>  I heard EVERYONE in Australia's always in a long term relationship (2 years+) from my friend in Australia who's not so happy, and you actually add to his comment haha<br>  <br>  Good luck, and live happy.

I'm happy that your life is great.  But for me.  Life is tough.  It ain't 'goo goo ga ga' over some girl I meet...Once you move out, go to college...you need to support your self.  Don't even get me started with the family problems.  I don't believe in true love or friendship.  Everyone that I thought was my friend turned out to be a dick to me.  So I ditched everyone and decided that I'm better off on my own.  My path in life is a world apart from yours...<br>  <br>  Have you ever<br>  <br>  Joined the Army?<br>  Killed someone?<br>  Kicked when your down?<br>  Witnessed  poverty at it's worst?<br>  <br>  <br>  Didn't think so.|`|ssHD6Uvfaa	Well you see, the problem is that there aren't too many good things in my life.

A new challenge will come.  It is how we handle it that determines our outcome.  Congrats on your growth and looking forward to the future. You are reaching out to others.

7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	I'm with you on this one.  I know ***** mean black but come now. This is 2009 not 1910. We are not in Spain or South America. They need to change that shtt.  I read a  story about an African American woman who brought an couch that was  labelled N*77er-brown. I was so shock when I heard that. She complained too. They don't do that for white folks or any other race but blacks.  It's humiliating, offensives and disrespectful to African Americans. I never see Blanco, hon8y or craka for white.  It's just another way to try to dehumanize and disparage blacks.  Why does shtt like this always happen to black folks?  It doesn't make sense to me. ><<br>  <br>  FYI, <br>  <br>  Apr 11, 2007 ... this black family bought a couch and the tag on the underside of it read 'ni((er brown' <br>  <br>  True story. Racial slur on sofa label stuns family, reports the Toronto Star, April 6. <br>  <br>  When the new chocolate-coloured sofa set was delivered to her Brampton home, Doris Moore was stunned to see packing labels describing the shade as “Ni((er-brown.” <br>  <br>  She and husband Douglas purchased a sofa, loveseat and chair in dark brown leather last week from Vanaik Furniture and Mattress store on Dundas St. E.<br>  <br>  Moore, 30, who describes herself as an African-American born and raised in New York, said it was her 7-year-old daughter who pointed out the label just after delivery men from the Mississauga furniture store left.<br>  <br>  “She’s very curious and she started reading the labels,” Moore explained. “She said, `Mommy, what is *** … ger brown?’ I went over and just couldn’t believe my eyes.”<br>  <br>  She said yesterday each piece had a similar label affixed to the woven protective covering wrapped around the furniture. <br>  <br>  "In this day and age, that's totally unacceptable," Moore said.<br>  <br>  Douglas explained the origins of the word to daughter Olivia, telling how it was a bad name that blacks were called during the days of slavery in the United States.<br>  <br>  "It was tough, because she really didn't understand," Moore said. "She'd never heard that word before and didn't really understand the concept of it."<br>  <br>  Moore, who has a younger son and daughter, said she's heard the word used many times, although it has never been directed in anger at her.<br>  <br>  "But it's a very, very bad word that makes you feel degraded, like you're a nobody," she said.<br>  <br>  Moore said she called the furniture store the following day and three other times since, and feels discouraged that no one has returned her calls.<br>  <br>  When interviewed yesterday by the Star, Romesh Kumar, Vanaik's assistant manager, passed the buck to his supplier, Cosmos Furniture in Scarborough.<br>  <br>  "Why should I take the blame?" he said. "I'm a trader, I don't manufacture. I sell from 20 companies, maybe 50 companies. How can I take care of all of them?"<br>  <br>  He said that he would check similar stock and make sure other labels were removed. <br>  "That's terrible, that's a racial ... something?" Kumar said. "This is entirely wrong, but it's not my fault. It's my job to sell good product to people."<br>  <br>  He said the best he could do is to give Moore the telephone number of his supplier, so she could take it up with him.<br>  <br>  The owner of Cosmos Furniture, Paul Kumar, no relation to Romesh, said he was upset to learn packing labels on products he sold carried a racial epithet.<br>  <br>  "I import my products from overseas," he said. "I've never noticed anything like that. This is something new to me."<br>  <br>  He passed the blame to a Chinese company, but apologized for the labels. He said he would contact the furniture maker in Guangzhou and demand they remove all similar labels.<br>  <br>  Moore said she's not sure she wants the sofa set in her home.<br>  <br>  "Every time I sit on it, I'll think of that," she said.<br>  <a href="http://www.racewire.org/archives/2007/04/niggerbrown_couch_packaged_and.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.racewire.org/archives/2007/04...</a>|`|96AQZUGyaa	I think it is fine because the word is a literal reference to the colour in Spanish.

E7PwbMuXaa	I have a couple, for you. The first ghost, I saw, was in a old asylum, that had been empty, for thirty years, or, more. It was built, in the 1900's, and, was home, for about 200 people. Most of them, were there, since, they were young adults. And, it goes with out saying, that, they died there, as well. At any rate, the business, next door, which was a salvage yard, wanted the land, for more room. There were always reports, from the workers, about seeing people, in the upper most windows, of the asylum. They assumed, it was other kids, messing around, in there. But, that was impossible, as all doors were  locked, from the outside, So, there was no way, to get in. Many of the workers, had seen somebody, or, something, in those top windows. So,  the salvage yard, got the land, along with the old asylum. I was a friend, of the owner, of the salvage yard, and, he gave me permission, to go into the old building, and, look around. I didn't see anything, right then. But, as I was walking down a set of stairs,  A person, or something, came towards me, I didn't notice, at the moment, but, the thing was actually floating, just above the floor. As it passed me, I turned around, and, that is when I saw, that it was just floating, along, on the floor. It did nothing, to me, though. Just passed me, and, disappeared. I saw nothing more, the rest of the time, that I was in there. But, I did hear plenty of weird noises, though. Not your average old building, stuff. These were creepy sounding, indeed. I then decided, to get out, as I had enough of that. The whole time, I was in there, one of the workers, said, that there was a person, at the top window, again. Wast the one, I saw? Who knows?  I was able to see the records, for the old asylum, and, some of the people, there, died nasty deaths. Eventually, the salvage yard, tore down the asylum, to make room, for their business. Even though, there is no more building there, there are still strange goings on, there. One night, they saw headlights on, in the center of the yard. Thinking it may be thieves, they called the law. When they arrived, to investigate, what they saw, was not to be believed. It was a car, with the headlights on, as bright as can be, but, the car had no battery, in it, or no other means of power, what so ever. The batteries, are removed, for safty reasons. it is their policy. One other time, something like this happened. A worker, was down in the rear portion of the yard, and, heard music, coming from one of the cars. here again, no battery, or anything, yet, the radio was playing, as clear, and loud, as could be. The thing was, not only was their no battery, in the car, but, the wiring to the radio, was gone, as well. I seen this, and, heard the radio playing, as well. It was weird. Naturally, that worker, quit, that very same day. That radio, played, till I took a hammer, and smashed it , till it quit. There are still weird things going on there. I still visit the salvage yard, from time to time, and, the stuff hasn't stopped, yet, nor do I think it will ever will.|`|lfjTRFzFaa	Only one.<br>  <br>  I was mucking about with some friends with a Ouji Board and we "contacted" a Ghost and started asking it questions.<br>  I was fairly dismissive of the whole experience and got up to get a drink.<br>  The others continued to play with the board.<br>  <br>  Without going into to many details because I choose not to they asked it a Question, for a name, that the only person in that room who would know the answer to the question was me and i wasn't at the board at that time.<br>  The Ouji spelt out the first and second name that was the answer to the question.<br>  <br>  Bit weak I know but its always stuck me when I think back about it as a weird experience.|`|DOVhPN03aa	Yes i have.

nyqoPvL2aa	In my experience, the proof almost always comes back to "It's in the Bible". Which is totally circular reasoning, and therefore meaningless. I have asked the same question, with the stipulation that the Bible cannot be used as part of the proof, and I've never gotten a good answer.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there's proof that ought to exist, but is utterly missing. For example, the Romans kept very extensive records of their government, including accounts of things like crucifixations, and the names of people performing them. No record of the supposed Crucifying of Christ exists in the Roman accounts, and the accounts for that time period/region are quite complete. And if I recall correctly, there was no person named Pontius Pilates working for the Roman government in the area where Jesus was supposedly crucified.|`|bEeozqacaa	The proof is an old fairy tale known as The Bible.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Gawd did it dear, that's the proof....|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	An empty tomb is proof of your god?<br>  <br>  Seriously?<br>  <br>  Do you even know what specific tomb this nonsense was supposed to have occured in, let alone whether or not it is empty at all?<br>  <br>  If it even exists at all, I'll lay odds that it's being used as someone's storage space.<br>  <br>  Cabbitsd:  New York is a real place:  Therefore Spider-Man exists!|`|gFqeMs22aa	i've gone so fat for trying to find the proof, i was told it's in the pudding and i've eaten way too much of that.<br>  <br>  as to proof in the bible and archaeology....<br>  <br>  there are many findings around israel and jordan that relate to stories that appear in the bible, or at least in the tanak, but as any writer of historical fiction knows, you can integrate many facts into your fiction but it won't make it true. i.e. the 3 musketeers.|`|tGkFPA82aa	"Well today there is no physical proof...just whats in your heart, soul, and mind..."<br>  <br>  My 'heart, mind, and soul' says you guys are full of it.<br>  What?

God bless. <br>  Kisses Tonya.|`|CxhH2xSQaa	I answered a similar question about contradictions in the Bible and how people were trying to prove/disprove it based on it's contradictions:<br>  <br>  "Yes, but was also written in a time before what we call "The Enlightenment" ..this is not meant to be condescending. What I mean is, "The Enlightenment" beginning around 1650 was the ascent into what we now know shapes a lot of Western ideology. It was a movement for everything to be based on "logic" and "reason" and empirical proof.<br>  ---<br>  Before this, people agreed on a simple notion of "mythos" and "logos" aka, people didn't try to prove that everything in the bible was "true" or "false"...and for the most part, except for religious officials (who were mostly just vying for power and money in complete opposition to their teachings), most people were too busy trying to survive past 30 to really start to ask these questions about the bible...then came Martin Luther and Protestantism and Henry the 8ths divorce and oh boy...<br>  <br>  Anyway, the problem is people now take the bible out of its historical context and beat it to death by either tearing it to shreds because of it's lack of "logic" or tout it to death by trying to skew history, sociology, and science to bend it to their will. Both seem a bit too harsh to me.<br>  <br>  I think religious people have tried to adjust to the Enlightenment, but maybe the old "mythos", "logos" dynamic would be kind of nice to return to...if we could just be okay with the fact that maybe noah's ark, adam and eve, and the Resurrection are metaphors/myths/legends/occurrences in the Nth dimension, rather than straight fact then people wouldn't be so worried on trying to "prove" or "disprove" religion and start to understand how to deal with it...cus...sorry Bill Maher, it's not going anywhere anytime soon."<br>  <br>  <br>  So besides that, people will tell you things like "can you 'prove' love exists?", or happiness or whatever other amoebic emotion or feeling based on a type of faith...and in a way, there's a point to that. I mean the whole "proof" for people isn't truly about proving the facts. (unless your a crazy fundamentalist..which, most people aren't...and the numbers of those who are fluctuate according to the economics and social marginalism of the time)  <br>  <br>  For most believers (in almost any religion) they believe because of what religion brings to their lives: a sense of peace, a new lease on life, less fear about dying, a feeling that there is someone to turn to when times get rough, a feeling that there is someone to listen to you when you are alone. And for a some, they truly do utilize religion not only to benefit their daily lives and curb their fear for death, but to actually help people in need and truly live loving and caring lives. None of which is really about "proof", although they will staunchly claim the big things like the "fact" that Jesus is the messiah because that belief is intrinsically tied to the previous statements of inner peace etc....<br>  <br>  So maybe you're asking the wrong question. The question is not "where is the proof" the question is "why does one want to believe with or without proof?" this gives totally different answers and raises much more interesting questions.<br>  <br>  Don't play into the ideology you were born to!<br>  <br>  Good religious writers who explain the history of religion and the problems:<br>  Karen Armstrong and Jack Miles<br>  <br>  My personal fav philosopher:<br>  Nietzsche (Beyond Good and Evil is great)<br>   <br>  And from Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Which is basically his very own version of Jesus) my fav quote:<br>  <br>  "But he who is wisest among you is but a discord and hybrid, of plant and of ghost"|`|6QuxbE3Raa	Hi there...well first of all its not where is Christianity you become a part of Christianity when you believe in Jesus Christ as Lord..The teachings of Christianity are available to all just read a bible..Allot of people give Christianity a bad name and as a result people start to question the teachings of Christianity but the bible says let God be true and every man a liar...Every body wants proof but the bible says God will reward those who will seek him in faith God operates in faith and no other way if a person says they will not have faith well it will be there lost cause the bible says the ways of God will never change...The nature of man will always challenge the existence of God because man only has limited knowledge of what they conclude to be right...|`|6xoTZYpZaa	Athiest believe that God is an absolute negative, (that is, He cant be physically observed- so you can neither prove nor disprove His existence scientifically) and they believe in things that can be demostrated through the observation of science.<br>  Others believe that the scope of science itself is God. (there is a seeming contradiction here that if what we know of science is right, then God has nothing to do with anything, that everything is bound to laws of physics - this flies in the face of people who believe in miracles, those people can believe in this idea and believe that God is holding the universe together and He still performs miracles)<br>  Others believe that you need no scientific proof, that God has proven Himself in the heart of man, that, "God made man in His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them (our physical bodies, are like His spiritual body)" (Gen.) They believe that we are both spiritual and physical beings in one. That we have two natures and are, to some ratio, conscience of both and therefore can accept science for what its worth, and, can also see that spiritual things cannot, and would be unnatural and unholy to, search for them in the physical world, "It is an evil and preverse generation that looks for a sign, I tell you that no sign will be given" (Jesus - somewhere in new testament)|`|pVXDZ033aa	I think it mostly does just come down to faith, but for me personally the "proof" that I have isn't scientific and it isn't really factual either. It's like this for me: A lot of people think that there is no God because how can some "magical being" be the creator of all of this? But I see it exactly opposite. How can "nothing" or "science" have made us so complex? I think about how deep we're able to feel, and how complex we can think. I think about how (most of the time) when someone dies, you can't just fix them like a machine. You can if they're "broken" but not if they're dead. The ones who are "fixed" after being dead... well they all have strikingly similar stories of the afterlife and seeing heaven. If you really think about "life", about how it's impossible for us to "make" a robot with human emotions that can "pass away'...there's just got to be something more. Not to mention ghosts and spirits. I know a lot of people don't believe in that either, but I do because I've experienced that as well.  <br>  <br>  So it really all  comes down to your perceptive. To me, life itself is proof that God exists, where to others, it's proof that He does not.

This desire is good, however just like a sharp knife it can be deadly. God has a specific plan for sexuality. He says you can be as sexually active as you want in the context of a marriage contract.<br>  <br>  One man, one woman in agreement can express the joys of their passions without committing sin. <br>  <br>  Not only is this the right thing, but it is pure and good. No man wants to marry a woman who's slept around with other men. We should desire a woman pure and chaste, who saves herself. In the same way we should be chaste and pure, saving ourselves for marriage.<br>  <br>  Instant gratification seems to be the cultural norm, but there is something good and powerful about a pure marriage relationship. That's what we desire for our children if we love them.<br>  <br>  Do it the right way and there will be amazing rewards from your relationship and you'll save yourself a ton of pain.

It is man who has chosen to ignore God's will and to follow his own path. <br>  <br>  God's glory is revealed to us everyday but it is the individual that chooses to either see it and believe what his heart and mind already knows or to harden his heart and close his mind.  God has allowed everyone this freedom to choose.<br>  <br>  Romans 1:18-25<br>  The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.<br>  <br>  For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <br>  <br>  Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.

It's the same god, just different ways of worshiping him.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	It's not only Catholics who say that. Jews and Muslims and Christians all worship the same deity.

In our time, when day by day mankind is being drawn closer together, and the ties between different peoples are becoming stronger, the Church examines more closely her relationship to non-Christian religions. In her task of promoting unity and love among men, indeed among nations, she considers above all in this declaration what men have in common and what draws them to fellowship.<br>  <br>  One is the community of all peoples, one their origin, for God made the whole human race to live over the face of the earth.(1) One also is their final goal, God. His providence, His manifestations of goodness, His saving design extend to all men,(2) until that time when the elect will be united in the Holy City, the city ablaze with the glory of God, where the nations will walk in His light.(3)<br>  <br>  Men expect from the various religions answers to the unsolved riddles of the human condition, which today, even as in former times, deeply stir the hearts of men: What is man? What is the meaning, the aim of our life? What is moral good, what sin? Whence suffering and what purpose does it serve? Which is the road to true happiness? What are death, judgment and retribution after death? What, finally, is that ultimate inexpressible mystery which encompasses our existence: whence do we come, and where are we going?<br>  <br>  2. From ancient times down to the present, there is found among various peoples a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers over the course of things and over the events of human history; at times some indeed have come to the recognition of a Supreme Being, or even of a Father. This perception and recognition penetrates their lives with a profound religious sense.<br>  <br>  Religions, however, that are bound up with an advanced culture have struggled to answer the same questions by means of more refined concepts and a more developed language. Thus in Hinduism, men contemplate the divine mystery and express it through an inexhaustible abundance of myths and through searching philosophical inquiry. They seek freedom from the anguish of our human condition either through ascetical practices or profound meditation or a flight to God with love and trust. Again, Buddhism, in its various forms, realizes the radical insufficiency of this changeable world; it teaches a way by which men, in a devout and confident spirit, may be able either to acquire the state of perfect liberation, or attain, by their own efforts or through higher help, supreme illumination. Likewise, other religions found everywhere try to counter the restlessness of the human heart, each in its own manner, by proposing "ways," comprising teachings, rules of life, and sacred rites. The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men. Indeed, she proclaims, and ever must proclaim Christ "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6), in whom men may find the fullness of religious life, in whom God has reconciled all things to Himself.(4)<br>  <br>  The Church, therefore, exhorts her sons, that through dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other religions, carried out with prudence and love and in witness to the Christian faith and life, they recognize, preserve and promote the good things, spiritual and moral, as well as the socio-cultural values found among these men.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	The Jews and Muslims worship the God of Abraham like Christians do.  The difference is the Jews do not believe in the New Testament or that Jesus is the Messiah.  The Muslims believe Jesus was a prophet and Mohammad "corrected" the teachings of Jesus.  But technically we all go back to the same God.  It's Jesus that they question so that's where "they do not believe in Christ the way the Father told us" seems to come from.|`|nS83ag9raa	would you shut up with all the catholic questions already...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jesus has told me he personally is goign to come down and slap you|`|AA11466759	because they do.

Jesus came to earth die on the cross to save us, and He prayed before His death that we would be ONE with our brothers and sisters in Christ. But that is on the essentials of the Christian faith, and then loving each other anyway, even when we disagree on the non-essentials.

For example, some Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount does not apply to them! So of course, those who admire that Sermon are going to disagree.<br>  <br>  And the source of this division can be found in the extremely opposing teachings of Christ.... and the one who terrorized the first followers of Christ, Paul/Saul.

G4SVG7tKaa	Israel is located in southwestern Asia, touching the uppermost tip of the African continent. At the time of the fictional Jesus, his contemporaries didn't know diddly about Africans except for the fireside stories regarding God, Moses, and the Egyptian Pharaoh (Egypt is in Africa). The NT implies that JC fed the "multitude" in front of him, not all the world. However, today's interpretation exhorts Christians to believe that JC died for ALL of humanity to cleanse them of "original sin." Christians can believe that to their heart's content - I find it quite ridiculous.|`|J7KSKm54aa	You mean there was an Africa?|`|DZCFD0p2aa	No....Back then Africa was a bountiful land.

We then give the money we would have spent for those 2 meals to help support those who are in need.

Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX.

The Torah and the Bible (Old Testament) were sent down from God, and the final book was of course the Quran. Allah sent down the Quran as a final reminder because so many people were deviating from the truth and not paying any attention to what our Prophets had to say. (And yes, we believe that Jesus and Abraham are 2 of our Prophets.)  The New Testament of the Bible was written by men who were not even around during the time of Jesus. <br>  <br>  The Quran was written within a 23 year time span, during a time of constantly changing circumstances. During those 23 years, different laws were needed, so it's not impossible to imagine that some laws cancelled out others. Here is a verse from the Quran regarding <br>  abrogation:<br>  <br>  "And when we put a revelation in place of (another) revelation and Allah knows best what He reveals -- they say: you are just inventing it. Most of them do not know.

mVsWyu0yaa	Danielle:<br>  What have I missed???  I linked to your website and fail to see the relevance (the Jewish idea of an afterlife) to your question about punishment.  Precisely which Christian belief, rejected by Judaism, do you refer to?<br>  <br>  As to punishing children for disobedience or disrespect:  it is more to appease anger than to instruct the child... which can be done, reasonably without undue punishment. The 'spare the rod and spoil the child' mentality of most bible thumpers has lead to incredible 'child abuse' in Christian (and Orthodox Jewish) communities...one notorious case involved parents beating their daughter TO DEATH while shouting bible verses at her. Her 'sin'....failing to obey quickly enough!!!!<br>  <br>  God as an eternal punisher is too loathsmone a doctrine to be given much credance by thinking individuals.  In THAT sense I am a better parent than any god...for I would NEVER consider punishing my child (or even the most rebellious child) for all eternity.  And I would never consider taken my disobedient son 'outside the camp and stoning him to death'.|`|ybFg4umCaa	My children have all become adults and respect amongst us is mutual. My grandson is only 11 and he occasionally gets angry and frustrated and says some things he shouldn't. The only punishment he needs is to let hm know that he has hurt my feelings or for me to tell hime that he shouyldn't talk to his mother that way. He realises that he went too far and feels guilty<br>  <br>  Anger is a desctructive emotion and yes, I'n a better parent than god. He has said that he is vengeful and jealous.

And as such we are just replications of God in every race and tribe and tongue.  So no we are like God to our children.  Every child will criticize their parent later and say they will be better than them.  But when they turn the corner and become adults themselves with their own children.  Only then will they understand their parents and the role and responsibility of being one.  And know why God is the way he is with his children.

This disobedience and prideful attitude is what prevented Moses from entering the promised land.<br>  <br>  In answer as to how this effects us today.... ask yourself... are you doing as God is instructing? Or ... are you doing things your way and expecting God to ordain and bless it anyway??<br>  <br>  Edit: As to the first poster stating that he committed one sin, friend Moses committed many sins, murder not being the least of them, Moses was not perfect but he was a prophet called of God, his disobedience after coming to know the one true God is what put him in this situation. But God still loved Moses, the scriptures tell us that when Moses died God himself buried Moses. God loved Moses greatly, but even someone he loves is not exempt from his chastisement.|`|hHtJOeu5aa	To them who is given much, much is required.  Moses had an important job to do with God.  Because Moses lost his temper in the desert and struck to rock to bring forth water rather than speaking to it, he sinned and recieved the credit for the miracle rather that giving the credit to God.  This is why he was unable to enter into the promised land.

Poppy|`|DJLeObm4aa	Yes we had monitors for everything, totally confusing. There was as you say the milk monitor, don't recall an ink monitor, then there was the class monitor who supposedly ensured the class didn't speak when the teacher left the room. Next there was the paper monitor who for a week gave out all the books and papers because the teacher was too lazy to do so herself. Also the dinning hall monitor who kept check that everyone behaved during school dinners and the playground monitor that nobody got out of control at intervals and so it went on and on and on............when you think of it the teachers had little to do but give you the belt!!!|`|Um8osMNuaa	We used to take it in turns to be milk monitor, we had to go outside and bring the milk crates in and hand out the straws. l loved those little bottles, my favourite part of the school day, well, second favourite after home time.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	No, just the classroom monitor when the teacher stepped out of the room for a few minutes.

A couple days I was sent to the cafeteria to fill the glasses.   And in Kansas one week I was a school crossing guard, they used the 5th graders to help the little kids go across the busy streets back then. Not a choice and it was before and after school, now days parents would bring a lawsuit for their child being forced to do something before and after school.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	In elementary school everyone had a job, and we switched each week.  Cleaning the chalkboard and erasers, collecting milk monies, feeding the classroom fish, taking notices and attendance slips to the office, etc... The teachers kept us very busy by coming up with new duties, by the fifth grade we had a menagerie in the science room; guinea pigs, chicks that we hatched in an incubator (and they were allowed to roam in the classroom as they grew), a few different aquariums.  The students took turns taking the guinea pigs home over the weekend...LOTS of fun!|`|Emk4xuTuaa	No, what I did- was at lunch time the school sat up a table with tablets, pencils, erasers, rulers, etc.- I was in charge of selling these items to the other kids.<br>  Sometimes I had to clean the erasers that the Teacher used, but everyone got a turn at that.<br>  One year, two people were selected everyday- to go outside, take the Flag down and learn to fold it the right way and then unfold it and put it back up on the flag pole, this was done until everyone in class had done it.|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Both.The milk used to be placed on the hot water pipes and they got warm at the bottom but stayed cold at the top.!!<br>  Sometimes blotting paper was jammed into the ink wells and when your pen went in the soggy paper came out on the nib and spread ink all over the desk.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	Yes, all those mentioned by other readers.  One I have not seen was lavatory monitor.  If a student took more 1 paper towel from the stack we were to report them.  I hated that job and resented the tattle-tale mentality the nuns MADE us participate in.|`|AA12185428	Of the classroom jobs assigned for a week, the two best were eraser cleaner (you had to go outside and whack the two together)and plant waterer.

You are right, our hair tends to be very curly/coily so it takes many years to grow that type of hair to mid back length without straightening it. <br>  <br>  I cant wait for my hair to grow to this length!<br>  <a href="http://spd.fotologs.net/photo/29/46/120/emanueladepaula_/1139092481_f.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://spd.fotologs.net/photo/29/46/120/...</a>|`|CvSKPHiqaa	because they like variety. they love something new every week so they change up their hairstyle by using wigs, weave, plaits etc...<br>  <br>  its not about wanting straight hair cos i see african women wear afro wigs! also some don't want to keep messing with their own hair so they use wigs.<br>  <br>  if people are saying that they can't grow hair then they are being stupid. ignore them. black hair doesn't grow as fast as caucasian hair, but that also means less body hair and i like that!|`|ka6lb9nXaa	Because the media has told black people that Natural black hair isn't beautiful, which isn't true, but makes them want to have Caucasian looking hair.<br>  My grandma has a weave cause she likes Caucasian type hair.<br>  But a lot do it just for convenience too, black hair needs a lot more maintenance compared to white/asian hair types|`|ONTzkwSqaa	Im not so sure.

iCgpyrmUaa	Ishmael is mentioned in the Bible.Isaac the legitimate son was to be sacrificed not Ishmael.God asked Abraham to sacrifice his legitimate son Isaac and also to note Ishmael was not the one as he & his mother were sent away in the earlier chapter.It' s not only the Bible that says that Isaac was to be sacrificed even the Torah (Jewish scripture) also maintains the same thing. <br>  <br>  Both the earlier texts says the one to be sacrificed was Isaac but the quran states otherwise and to back their claim they say that the earlier texts are "corrupted" just because they do not agree with their texts.Convenient isn't it? But since theirs is the last text shouldn't the quran be in agreement with the earlier texts? They at one time claim that the earlier texts are "corrupted" and at the same time refer to those very "corrupted" texts to try to prove their claim that mohammad is mentioned in those very "corrupted" texts.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	He's in Moby Dick.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	It does mention him, he is born of a maid servant, because wife couldn't bare children, when she was able and had Isaac, she told Abraham to rid of Ishmael and his mother, so they were sent out into the desert, but god gave them water, and promised many children from him, many tribes that will be more than the starts in the sky, and sands on the beach...|`|PrqDtAFKaa	I thank you for being honest that you are not well up on the Bible. Your additional details proves it. Abraham had two sons the legitimate son Isaac through his wife Sarah and ishmael from the slave woman hagar. The Torah does mention that Ishmael existed.Isaac was going to be sacrificed but was not sacrificed instead a ram was sacrificed in his place. And Ishmael was never going to be sacrificed as he and his mother were sent away in the earlier chapter. mohammad has corrupted rather told lies about the whole incident as he did wanted ishmael to be superior by claiming that he was going to be sacrificed and he told these lies as he is the descendant of ishmael.|`|5fcM3HLsaa	No, but he is in Moby Dick, which is a superior work of fiction.<br>  <br>  'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.'|`|iAXmdQOEaa	Ishmael was one of Abrahams sons.  He was born of Sara's handmaid, Hagar.  He was 86 when he had Ishmael.   Gen 16-25  contain his story. Abraham had 6 other children.  Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.|`|373KJjiOaa	It mentions him. He was the son of Hagar, he was not sacrificed instead of Isaac. He left with his mother long before that event occurred.|`|AA10858522	He was Abraham's first son that he had with Hagar, Sarah's servant (slave). After Sarah had Isaac she got jealous of the other woman and demanded that her husband get rid of her which he obliged and threw them out. He emerges later in the bible after the death of Abraham and he and his brother Isaac bury their father. Arabs believe he is their ancestor and Isaac was the Jews' ancestor despite the fact that there are already people living there.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  If you stupid people do some research, a slave in that time or concubine was yours to do with as you pleased and she could bare your children and they would not be considered illegitimate. Nor does procalaiming it make your religion better than anyone else's.|`|Qun4OXeLaa	Isaac was Abraham's son born of Abraham's legitimate wife, Sarah and Ishmael was the Abraham's son born of Sarah's handmaiden Hagar.<br>  <br>  The Bible says it was Isaac that was almost sacrificed because Isaac was the legitimate(meaning higher social standing) son.  The loss of a legitimate (meaning higher social standing) son is a much heavier sacrifice than the loss of the son of a handmaiden.<br>  <br>  Whether it was Isaac or Ishmael isn't really important.  The important thing was that Abraham was asked to sacrifice the most important thing in Abraham's life and not somebody else's treasured thing.<br>  <br>  Everyday, God does ask us to let go of many things we hold dear, like wealth, pride or even our self-importance.  In the end, we can only hope in God's mercy and compassion, just as Abraham did.<br>  --------<br>  <br>  Added:  Since I'm the only one who mentioned the word illegitimate, I used the term to differentiate the two sons.  One is the son of the wife, the other is the son of a concubine.  In the eyes of the society then, the son of the wife takes precedence over the son of the concubine.  It is only when the wife does not have sons that sons of the concubine/s are considered to be "legitimate" or next in line.  Perhaps it was the wrong word to use but since someone complained about it directly, I can no longer change the wording to something more appropriate.<br>  <br>  The point of the differentiation between the two is not to put one religion down but to point out the cost of the sacrifice being asked.  I'm sure that if a man of Abraham's time were asked to sacrifice his son by his slave, it would be considered a lesser sacrifice than if the same man were asked to sacrifice his son by his wife.|`|HrnlBc4Laa	God had promised Abraham an heir, he was eighty five or about and Sara was seventy five.  Sara had been barren all those years so she decided for Abraham to have an heir, it would have to come from some other female if at all.  She gave her handmaid to Abraham, a woman of another race and tribe.  Ishmael was his name, and is the father of the Arabic Nation.  Not the heir God promised to Abraham.   Ishmael was about fourteen when Isaac was born. The Israelite came through his blood line.  Isaac was the one on the altar when God was testing his faith.<br>  <br>  Genesis 17 pretty much tells this part of the story of Ishmael's life.|`|syBBnsCAaa	Ishmael is in the Bible. He was the first son of Abraham, by a slave girl. It was through the line of his son Isaac (whom he had by his wife) that we got Esau and Jacob (also known as Israel).|`|W3mN3EBuaa	Yes. Ishmael is introduced in Genesis 16, when his mother Hagar, (who was Sarai's maidservant), was running away due to Sarai's jealousy of her pregnanct and was intercepted by the Angel of the LORD. (Typically regarded as a pre-incarnate Christ.) He told her to name the son Ishmael, who is regarded by Bible-believing individuals as being the father of the Arab nations. <br>  <br>  Ishmael is then later expelled from Abraham and Sarah's presence after he harasses Isaac in some way (the wording is unclear), along with Hagar, and the Angel of the LORD again provides sustenance. Ishmael is also older than Isaac, incidentally. I know nothing of reports of him almost being sacrificed instead of Isaac, though that's not in the Bible.

But he ain't done yet.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	he does. but only if they're salamanders.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Some ppl are born without a limb & others have them amputated. Both of them have struggles. <br>  <br>  The bigger question is why does God allow physical injuries that cause daily suffering, accidents that cause death, wars to ruin the lives of everyone involved, famine, natural disasters, etc. <br>  <br>  Suffering has existed as long as man has been in existence despite millions of believers of every faith praying. <br>  <br>  (1)For the ppl who will suggest a person's sins-what about babies who are born w/hardly a chance of survival & spend their childhood if not whole lives struggling. <br>  <br>  (2)For the ppl who suggest a person's life plan-why does an all-powerful God allow a physical ailment that makes a person's life difficult all in the name of a 'game/plan' to influence other ppl's lives. That's causing suffering in an innocent creature u supposedly care about only to change the minds of other ppl because you care about 'them' so much. Why not chg the 'others' minds w/out having ppl suffer-you're all knowing.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I have no answer for you question. I've just heard a lot of the mysterious ways mumbo jumbo and 'higher purpose' and have witnessed waaay too much suffering. Plenty of true believers are sick despite the 'name it & claim it' religions...not to mention the hundreds of world religions. *None* of the gods cure them...<br>  <br>  EDIT: u commented on Jove re: Zeus. I think many ppl w/diseases have heard plenty of times they have lack of faith. Jesus himself sd it required the faith of a mustard seed. Sadly, this lack of faith comment tells the patient they not only brought this upon themselves, but they don't have faith to ask God to take it away. <br>  <br>  Ppl w/disabilities show more faith than most ppl in the genl population, in my exp. They've got to work 2-8x as hard for the activities of basic living and are grateful for all they can do (not focusing on what they can't do). They take very little for granted. Faith keeps many of them going. Some of their disabilities give them more time to pray, study God's word & share w/others. Once again, YOU can only see the outside of a person-you don't know how much faith ppl have or how much time they spend in the word/prayer. Moreover, why didn't the prayers of their friends, family, church, or world cure them??? Maybe one of those ppl would've had more faith than the amputee? (for this theory to work)<br>  <br>  This specific statement of Jove's is outright verbal abuse to ppl w/disabilities, because it says their condition is their fault. It puts you in a place of superiority & judgment-is that something that sits well within your spirit? Neither of these is your position. It's Gods. Perhaps U should pray for the amputees! Surely your prayers for them will be answered, as no doubt all of your own have been. Make sure you take the day off work, though. I've known some amputees to be in prayer anwhere from 3-16 hours in a day.|`|7RQ6XQnPaa	IF HE DOES AS PER YOUR WISHES YOU WILL BE RINED TAKE A EXAMPLE OF MIDAS WHO WISHED TO BE GOLDEN TOUCH AND LATER REPENTANT  IF HE GIVE YOU PLENTY OF WISHES TO BE COMPLETED IMAGINE THAT YOU WILL BE MORE WORRIED BECAUSE YOUR ALL WISHES BE CONTRADICTED WITH EACH OTHER AND WILL CLASH WITH YOUR LIFE AND IT WILL BE RUINED AFTER WORDS SO HE WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FEEL IT DEEPLY THAN ASK HIS WAYS|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	Because God hasn't caught up to the whole stem cells/extracellular matrix-latticework concept yet.<br>  <br>  Give it 20 years, mankind will heal amputees.|`|B667elmWaa	The rational answer is that since there is no god, how can anyone be healed in this way?|`|8ZPchcEgaa	God does work in mysterious ways.

Everythin Jesus did (healing, miracles, etc) are not in the bible, just a few things, the bible itself says that they are enough books in the world to possibly write down all the things Jesus did, but still...no one ever said he cant, and no one ever said he had to!<br>  <br>  <br>  well considering im talkin about the biblical god and i dont beleive in zeus....NO!    but im sure u understand what im tryin to say.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	You are assuming just because one is different from everyone else that there is something wrong with them.

Your final quote from Ecclesiastes is largely irrelevant or are you going to tell me that you have never heard the terms sunrise and sunset?<br>  <br>  Thank you for including quotes though it was appreciated.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Dear god in heaven i hope that you're joking.<br>  <br>  BTW, you obviously haven't read the entire bible.<br>  <br>  "He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing."

355JLlcLaa	I've read the Bible right through several times in both the Douay and New English Bible translations, and often refer to them and other versions (including the KJV for those who are fixated on it). Using this forum motivates me to do that as well as the interest I already have.<br>  <br>  I've also read other mythological texts, though not as often, such as Enuma Elish and the epic of Gilgamesh, from which the Genesis creation and flood stories appear to have been derived. And of course, I've read about Greek, Roman, Nordic, Celtic, Persian, Chinese, and other myths and religions of other peoples.<br>  <br>  I've also read the Qu'ran and the Book of Mormon, but I need to read them again a few times.<br>  <br>  I also read books about religion by theologians, other religionists, agnostics, atheists, those for religion, those against it, and those who are neutral. And of course about sciences. I can be pretty boring company at times; hopefully not all the time. <br>  <br>  I've had an interest in religions, mythology, folklore and related things since I was a child. You can never say you know it all though, because new things are being discovered, for example the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage - nearly 40 years ago - that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science, including the theory of evolution, explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. I'm still interested, and am fascinated that people still believe in what to me seems untrue.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	I don't just read the Bible, because I don't think it's the kind of book you can just read and then claim to be knowledgeable about. <br>  <br>  I study it and compare various Christian scholar's commentaries to what the Bible itself says.

AA12238560	Hi Michelle,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately Spells do not "deliver results" within a specific time-frame.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the Spell itself, and what rituals are entailed in the Spell, basically speaking "a Spell will only deliver when the Universe deems it so".<br>  <br>  As well, in order for a Spell to really work, the Practitioner needs to have already exhausted every "mundane" (ordinary, non-magickal) way of achieving the desired result.<br>  <br>  Have a lovely rest of the evening.

P7phsL52aa	It's hard, being gay and falling for your straight friend. You're not the only one whose been through this situation. <br>  <br>  You need to isolate yourself from him for awhile. Find something to keep you occupied and your mind off him. If you stick around him still, you will probably never get him off your mind. It's not healthy, liking someone you know you'll never have. Things will get better if you are willing to try and get over him.
yB0nVXfWaa	You seem to have picked up a problem from when you were young.  Think back, and pray, and see if you did anything at that time, had any experiences, that let it in.  Did you play with the occult - ouija board, tarot, or things like that? If you are a Christian, you can confess all of this before the Lord, whether you know what caused it or not, just bring it before him.<br>  <br>  I call these 'tormenting dreams' and I have occasionally had them in my life (now sometime past), though never to do with the devil, as you have.  However, I have concluded that the evil one does take a pleasure in tormenting us while we are asleep and more vulnerable than in our waking hours.<br>  <br>  Actually, whilst you are asleep, you are nevertheless still conscious, and you are still able to 'take control' - you don't have to passively 'let it happen' actually.  Maybe that's why these kinds of dreams don't come to me anymore, because, even in my sleep, I was able to come against what was happening and rebuke the thing.  You can do that, if you belong to Jesus, you know.<br>  <br>  So, I suppose the question is, do you belong to Jesus?  Because, if you do, you have the power to rebuke the thing and tell it to depart and worry you no more - yes, you have.  You can do using Jesus' name,  because you belong to him.<br>  <br>  I see you cling to Psalm 4:8, so it would seem you may be a Christian, or at least have some faith that He is able to protect you.  So, no you are not doing anything wrong, using this prayer, but you can't use it like a 'charm' to ward off 'evil spirits'.  For those whom the Lord makes to 'both lie down in peace and sleep' are those who belong to him, for this is a prayer of David, a believer.<br>  <br>  It is not a prayer, or a formula, or whether you are doing something right or wrong, that makes any difference.  No, it is about who you are, and therefore whether you have the authority in Jesus Christ over all evil, which every Christian has, who knows what his Lord has given to him.|`|F93FZyo1aa	take a look at your life...if you're sinning then the devil can come in and attack. get into a church and pray. get to know the people in your church and your pastor. they can all help you.|`|WbaN6osZaa	I prescribe a holiday from all religion and superstition.  You OD'd at some point.|`|1yJWrccXaa	Bless you and I am sorry to hear about your troubled sleep and the nightmares.  It is hard for me to know exactly what your circumstances in life are so I have to guess this; you are religious and love our Lord.  But you may be spending too much time dwelling on the subject.  I have run the gamut of Christianity and I have been through similar times that you are experiencing.  This is why I say this to you.  I believe that God knows what is in our hearts and He knows good people from evil people.  He made us in human form and we have complex emotions and needs and minds that can think about all kinds of things.  He would not want you to be troubled.  He would want you, and all of us, to experience life, do different things, have fun, horse around, learn and do a wide variety of things.  If you focus or only think of the Bible and religion and nothing else your mind will become too narrow and create all kinds of things to trouble you.  I will tell you the Devil is not in a second by second battle with you for your soul.  By faith we are forgiven and allowed into God's kingdom.  Not by every little second and action and thought of the day.  Doing that could make us all a little overwhelmed in the mind.  I know because I have been where you are.  If you believe in the Lord, John 3:16, and are a good person your name is aleady written in the Book Of Life and you will go to Heaven.  Please get out of the Bible for awhile.  Keep it in your home and read it but keep things in perspective.  Please don't let yourself get wrapped up in so many troubled thoughts of evil and the devil attacking you.  The devil has probably already lost you to God.  Enjoy your life, lighten up, have fun.  We can't take ourselves totally seriously all the time.  Best wishes.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	I had nightmares since I was young, too, and they were similar to yours.  They went away when I 1) got rid of the all the stress and oppression and false teachings in my life that were imposed on me by the neurotic and ignorant people around me 2) learned how to clear out the noise in my own mind through meditation and other disciplines, 3) got into balance physically and hormonally so that I could get a good night's sleep.|`|yluVQqcRaa	The Bible says not to repeat our prayers are you creating them as you say them? It is not easy, at least for me, I'll admit. You may want to find a church leader with holy water or a special time of blessing to see if it/they will help.<br>  In the Old Testament men had nightmares and they were metaphoric messages of their futures.|`|nQPcbjLKaa	May the Lord bless you and keep you and shine His face upon you and comfort you.

Psalm 23, is one that I would start to memorize. God's Word is what defeated satan and his angles into the lake of fire forever. <br>  <br>  Jesus is your answer. If these dreams persist then I would talk with your pastor and elders of your church, (hopefully they are a Christ centered church), This is about Jesus and belief in Him. <br>  <br>  The devil comes only to kill, steal and destroy, but Jesus has defeated him. Permanently. <br>  <br>  We are to trust in Him who saves us from our sinful nature. Jesus is that belief and He will give you strength and peace.<br>  <br>  I would like to pray with you if you will say this with me we are in agreement and Jesus said if we believe He is faithful.<br>  <br>  Jesus, I am a sinner, I need you to come into my life and change my heart. I want You to come into my heart and never leave me. I want to know You as my Lord and Savior, please show me how to live. In Your name I pray. Amen.  :)|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	I mean this in a completely serious, non-insulting way: Have you ever considered that your own fears of the devil are what's causing your nightmares? It's a well-known fact that dreams are just made up of your own thoughts and worries that you have during the day. The more something's on your mind, the more likely you are to dream about it. You're not being attacked. Dreams don't mean anything; they can be very, very unsettling and frightening, but they don't mean anything. If you stop worrying so much and realize that nothing is actually attacking you, then the nightmares will go away.|`|6qGY4cljaa	This is probably going to attract a lot of smart-aleck answers. For that I am sorry. My answer will also leave out religious connotation as I'm agnostic and since the existance of God can neither be proven or disproved, it's not my right to speak about that.<br>  <br>  Dreams are windows of the soul. Created because out minds are trying to compute and store the day's events, sometimes people have vivid dreams because of this. It is possible that something in the waking world is bothering you and your mind as transformed it into a devil. Perhaps that is something you need to work on, as it's causing you to have a disturbed sleep? Or a phobia perhaps caused by too much emphasis on a certain thing?<br>  <br>  When you dream, have you ever been aware of yourself dreaming? If you can catch yourself in a dream and know it for what it is, your are lucid dreaming. This kind of dreaming actually enables you to take control of your dream and makes you more powerful than any devil or monster that is hounding you.<br>  <br>  A lot of times, people have vivid dreams because their diet has changed and they are either consuming too much dairy or sugars before bed. One suggestion is that about 4 hours before you go to be, don't eat anything  or drink anything other than water.<br>  <br>  Some people might say that such a dream is a portend. But really, it's meaning can have so many different connotations, it would take a good year or two to run though all the possible meanings of the dream, and by then either something will or won't happen, and because of such vaguery, thinking of dreams like this is usually rubbish.<br>  <br>  So, overall, if you have such troubling dreams try to realize the dream for what it is and control your dream, and don't eat dairy (milk or cheese)  or sugar before bed. If you still have such dreams after these changes, then you should either seek out a priest/pastor to talk about it with him/her, or possibly look into psychotherapy with a therapist.|`|QOJpXVxzaa	you are being attacked. pray to God and see what He wants you to do about it. don't consult people. consult God.|`|8ZJdjfMOaa	If you stopped obsessing about ghost, demons, monster etc, they wouldn't bother you. Any presence, significance they have is all your own mind projection. You're giving them life in your mind and so they feel real, stop placing significance on the devil, being bad, thinking you're a sinner, you're not worthy. Try empowering yourself for once, hopefully with non religious thoughts.<br>  <br>  Take it from me, I had a sleep paralysis episode before and saw demons in my mind, and deconstructing their meaning in my life was how I stopped having any presence sense in my dreams or after dreams.|`|ee3a07b5bc44e88ee23f161d42fd30a0aa	Well if I were you, I would first pray. Focus and trust in God. Some prayers you can memorize and do are the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the St. Michael Prayer and the Rosary.  Second remove any sin and especially occult things in your life (Ouija boards etc.). Confession if you are Catholic. If this isn't merely medical and you think their could be something sinister behind this talk to a good priest.

cTvP6j7Haa	Just explain how you can evolve, downwards. (That would be devolve.)<br>  Very few angels were ever humans, they are a species by them self. The only way is up ---------> godlike.

We're just animals, although far more intelligent than any other animal and with an amazing ability to adapt and thrive.  If we evolve, it will be the same.|`|d21602968207c0c2d97e342c8834fc7aaa	Isn't it possible that animals have just as much a "soul" as we do?|`|cdFqekzZaa	We have billions of years to worry.|`|trCoXkHJaa	If people evolve into a new species, we may not have the souls we have now, but we will have better, evolved people souls, which are even better than regular people souls. Animals will then evolve into people and get souls.<br>  <br>  Souls can only be upgraded to super souls through rare spiritual endeavors. Super souls are very rare, less than twenty cases are reported by doctors each decade. <br>  <br>  Though people may suddenly sprout wings and gain the ability to fly, people cannot grow halos because halos cannot be grown, only received and placed on the head.<br>  <br>  All of this is very possible, with enough practice, focus, and a little bit of luck, we can become angels. Until then, we must do the best we can to not devolve into soulless animals, or worse, plants.|`|RnxxYn8gaa	According to the bible, we will be put higher than the angels. <br>  <br>  That's why some Christian scholars have theorized that Satan rebelled. They theorize that his pride couldn't accept that we would be put higher.<br>  <br>  Of course now we sinned, and we'll never know unless we make it to heaven because those who don't will never be higher than angels because they will be sent to hell, a place reserved for the angels who gave up their high positions in heaven for the sake of usurping God. The people that go to hell will at least be equal to the angels though because all will be suffering who get sent there angel and human alike. None will have authority, likely none will even have contact with eachother,  and even if they did, I don't think they will much care because there is nothing else you can do but just suffer the punishment of deciding their sin was better than following God.<br>  <br>  However, if you watch Stargate SG-1, they had an idea that we would evolve until we were so advanced that we could simply make ourselves into eternal ascended beings, having the knowledge of the entire universe. Until, that is, in later episodes when you learn things that make you wonder if they really have much more knowledge or wisdom then you or I do.<br>  <br>  Anyway, as far as evolution is concerned, I don't believe in it, but even if, hypothetically, it were true, I don't think we have much to look forward to. People survive regardless of problems. And as our mercy as a species grows, so will our medical technology. Eventually, we may save most people from most ailments. Which means that survival will no longer depend on circumstances except deciding not to get ourselves killed. I.E... drunk driving, STD's, suicide, all completely preventable. <br>  <br>  In short, my point is, that in time as medical knowledge progresses, we will all survive, and nothing will lessen or increase our chances except that which we ourselves decide to do. I.E...drunk driving, STD's, suicide, maybe war.<br>  <br>  So we won't evolve, it's impossible, unless we become a heartless species who cares nothing for each other, and refuses to help our fellow man, we will never evolve because all will survive to reproduce. The only thing that might happen is we might lose all of our homosexuals, if, hypothetically, it's all genetic. In which case we should have lost them all already, I mean we are talking billions of years here, not billions of days. <br>  <br>  Other then that, who's going to evolve? Really, who? We will all survive. Now before any of you take to heart anything I've just said, keep in mind where that kind of thinking will bring you. Hitler was a bad man, and he carried it to a whole new level, don't be guilty of the same thing.|`|fwrfIxIaaa	we'l just keep getting smarter and physically weaker|`|yCTxg4t5aa	If we had a sudden "spurt" of evolution, (even though that probably can't happen) More than likely those few that evolved would be sent to science labs for the rest of their lives, Or they'd be lynched by the public for being something new, or even being accused to be the "Spawn of Satan" or something. A person is smart, but People are Dumb. It's natural for people to fear what they don't understand.<br>  <br>  On another note, apparently Indigo, Rainbow and Crystal children/people are Evolution, so maybe they're already here and people are medicating them to try and make them just like everyone else. If you don't know what Indigo, Crystal and Rainbow Children/people are then i suggest you look it up, it's actually quite interesting.<br>  Everything has a soul, Animals, Plants, Us.

AA10244921	There is no ultimate goal in evolution.  Things don't progress toward some perfect form.  Evolution is a constant race just to stay where you are.  It is certain that either humans will evolve into a different species or go extinct.  I've always liked the book "The Time Machine".  In it, the humans of the distant future have evolved into two different species, both of which retain some features of humanity, but neither being what we would consider fully human.  The Traveller reasons that at some point in the past humans must have managed to solve problems like disease and hunger, but ended up losing their intellect, and ultimately their humanity, without any major problems to think about.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	It's possible, but we'll never see it, so why worry about it?
PRzciqwZaa	When you use a phrasal verb, in Italian it is like in English. <br>  You always have to use the formula "first verb's tense+ second verb's base form". The second verb is always base form, it doesn't depend from the first verb's tense. So, If you have a "Posso" (present tense) as first verb, the second will be "Parlare" (base form).<br>  And the same with Imperfect tense. If you have a "Potevo" as first verb, you'll have in any case a "Parlare" as second verb.<br>  And it's the same with all the other tenses.<br>  <br>  I repeat, hoping that I was clear, that the thing is that the second verb is always, in any case, base form (in Italian called "Infinito")|`|36n1Rn35aa	in italian we don't say "posso parlare italiano" ma<br>  "so parlare italiano"<br>  imperfect "SAPEVO parlare italiano"|`|2VPwHtCKaa	Potevo parlare Italiano.<br>  <br>  Quando andai a Firenze 5 anni fa, avevo già imparato Italiano in una scuola serata. Dunque potevo parlare Italiano con loro.<br>  <br>  When I went to Florence 5 years ago, I had already learned Italian in an evening school. So I was able to speak Italian with them.<br>  <br>  You use "io" only to stress that it is you and not sombody else.|`|CNIBl1hJaa	Correct: Io potevo parlare l'italiano.
Xx0ruq45aa	Personally, what with it being mayday and all, I would bring iron with me. Hide it, wrap it up in a rag that you've left outside for a week. Then soak it in some water along with apples, leaving it smelling like dirt, mold, and slightly of apples. This is actually an effective screen against faeries sense of smell.<br>  <br>  In truth, anything that reminds a fey of civilization will work to repel faeries. That is why they are getting harder and harder to find, they keep on being pushed further and further back away from the back roads and country houses. If you have a cell phone, wrap it in another cloth, and keep the battery wrapped in a separate cloth.<br>  <br>  As for the comment that faeries don't live outside of England, that is quite inaccurate. Faeries tend to follow the English, and since the English were such a colonial power, you can find Faeries almost all over the world. The most interesting place that I have witness a faerie was in south africa, where a small clan of english faeries were taunting Anansi, who was goading them onward and allowing them to get caught in his net. What followed was rather gruesome.<br>  <br>  But as long as you live somewhere connected to England in it's past, you should be able to find Fey. Be careful of battlegrounds where the English fought, however, as these are breeding grounds for goblins and ghouls.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Keep a Gnome with you.

But if you do find some, in some legends a Fairy Flag, a piece of cloth from the Fairy Flag, can protect you since the flag is some sort of supernatural Order Keeper. Also if your looking for Brownie like imp faeries then take sparkly dust, since they will be drawn to the sparkles.<br>  <br>  Also are you talking about Imps, like mischevious little elf-goblins or fairies like tinkerbell just mischevious since normally Faeries are Human-sized Fairies.|`|ffAwH6Seaa	Any tree that bears thorns will protect , some more than others  but you should'nt need any protection as those you speak of will not hurt you or anyone unless provoked .

EG00oN53aa	no thats haram. well it would be stealing. .i think you should ask the guy 1st b4 taking a "pomie". lol. like u said. <br>  <br>  Theres a story i heard a long time ago, when i was a little grl. My mom used to tell me it all the time. There was this man,walking past his neighbors yard, and he took an apple from his tree and ate it. Well what i can remember from the story is he told the profit that he had taken an apple from the mans tree, and the profit told him that was considered stealing. so inorder for the man not to take back his sin he had to go tell his neighbor that he stole an apple from his tree and ate it. <br>  <br>  So the man walked back to his neighbors house and told him what he had done, and he asked for forgiveness, but his neighbor told him i will only forgive you if you marry my daughter. So the man said, okay no problem. But his neighbor siad: i have to warn you though, shes blind, deaph,paralized, and she doesnt speak. So the man took a deap breath and excepted the the deal inorder for his neighbor to 4give him. he thought to himself, well, i desereve this becase i stole from him any ways. so then his neighbor told him, i want to introduce you to my daughter before you leave. so he called out on his daughter and she came out. the man was baffled and took one look at her and turned to his neighbor and said, i thought you said she couldnt hear, and she couldnt walk, or speak? finally the neighbor siad, yes, she doesnt speak of words that will give her sins. she doesnt walk to places that will make her sin, she doesnt hear the things that will make her sin, and she doesnt talk or see the things that will make her sin either. so the man said i thought u were punishing me. this is a gift. he said this is a gift to you my good man because you were the 1st honest man to tell me you ate an apple from my tree....|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	If he is not overly grumpy, why not ask him if you can have some.

It is wordy, I will give you props for that.  But the only other alternative is Jesus Christ's church of Latter day Saints. <br>  <br>  Only in English do prepositions become a bit entangled. Other languages don't have that problem, it's normal to have prepositions like that in other languages. For example La maison de Sarah. French for Sarah's House or literally translated the House of Sarah. <br>  <br>  But for the sake of clarity, it works better with the two prepositions.|`|AA11714512	Guess you need to go back to school because it is grammatically correct.  The way you wrote it would mean  it is the Church of Jesus and the Church of Latter Day Saints. Or in other words it is Jesus's Church and The Latter Day Saint's Church.  It is not the Latter Day Saints church.  It is just Jesus's church.  It is a church of Latter Day Saints meaning that Latter Day Saints are the members of the church.<br>  Much like if I say  I want to borrow a book of Jack's of recipes.

Even at-will states have to have a reason to sack you.<br>  <br>  Here in the UK, no job is protected to a certain extent.  Yes, there is more protection than in the US BUT at the end of the day, if a company doesn't want you there, they will FIND a way to get rid of you, whether it may  mean leave a paper trail (write ups) for the silliest reason, so be it.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	No job is safe anymore|`|jeCvLt9saa	i live in london and some jobs are not protected at all<br>  you can be sacked for "no cause" that is masqueraded as "a good cause"<br>  if you want jobs that are actually protected here then you have to go to college and uni|`|eskZfVBkaa	God forbid if the US swapped employment cultures with us British.

MhbEQoJYaa	Chapter 33:41     <br>  Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of ALLAH, and the SEAL Of The Prophets and ALLAH has full knowledge of all things.|`|p5cglKf0aa	THE NINETEENTH WORD<br>  <br>  [About the Prophethood of Muhammed (PBUH)]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I could not praise Muhammed with my words; rather, my words were made praiseworthy by Muhammed. <br>  <br>  Yes, this Word is beautiful, but what makes it so is the most beautiful of all things, the attributes and qualities of Muhammed (PBUH). <br>  <br>  Also being the Fourteenth Flash, this Word consists of Fourteen Droplets.<br>  <br>  · FIRST DROPLET <br>  <br>  There are three great and universal things which make known to us our Sustainer. One is the Book of the Universe, a jot of whose testimony we have heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the Thirteenth Word of the Risale-i Nur. Another is the Seal of the Prophets (Upon whom be blessings and peace), the supreme sign of the Book of the Universe. Now, we must become acquainted with the Seal of the Prophets {Upon whom be blessings and peace), who is the second and Articulate Proof, and must listen to him. <br>  <br>  Indeed, look at the collective personality of this proof: the face of the earth has become his mosque, Mecca, his mihrab, and Medina, his pulpit. Our Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him}, this clear proof, is leader to all the believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the remembrance of God comprising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose living roots are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their wonderworking confirm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: There is no god but God! And all on left and right, that is, those luminous reciters of God's Names lined up in the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their consensus in effect declare: "You speak the truth and what you say is right!" What false idea has the power to meddle in a claim which is thus affirmed and corroborated by thousands?<br>  <br>  · SECOND DROPLET <br>  <br>  ................<br>  <br>  The Nineteenth Letter<br>  <br>  THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED (PBUH)<br>  <br>  The Miracles of Muhammed (PBUH)<br>  <br>  In His Name, be He glorified!<br>  <br>  And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise.<br>  <br>  In the Name of the God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. <br>  He it is Who has sent His Prophet with guidance and the religion of truth to make it supreme over all religion: and sufficient is God as a Witness. * Muhammed is the Prophet of God... [to the end of the verse] <br>  {Qur'an, 48:28-9} <br>  <br>  <br>  [Since the Nineteenth and Thirty-First Words concerning the prophethood of Muhammed (Upon whom be blessings and peace) prove it with decisive evidence, we assign the verification of that side of the subject to those Words. As a supplement to them we will merely show here, in Ninenteenth Signs, some of the flashes of that great truth.]<br>  <br>  FIRST SIGN:<br>  The Owner and Master of this universe does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that are apparent to us. Since the One who creates knows, surely the One who knows will speak, since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who have consciousness, thought, and speech. Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings. Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts. <br>  <br>  Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so. <br>  <br>  SECOND SIGN:<br>  <br>  ..........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&t=The+Nineteenth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&...</a>|`|6jCe21Plaa	Prophet Muhammad(Saw) is the last Prophet.|`|cLdpKqxeaa	all prophets after John the baptist ar false and should be ignored and condemned|`|e3PWZYsAaa	the conceot of Khatamul NABUWAT has nothing to do with the Imams.......<br>  even Prophet Mohammad (PBUH&HF) said there will be 12 Imams after him.......<br>  <br>  <br>  as we all know, it's Khatamul NABUWAT, not Khatamul IMAMAT........<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  you and your friends are so funny....<br>  i literaly laughed at this "those muslim who does not have any knowledge of isalm"<br>  <br>  well maybe you should realize your one of them.......<br>  <br>  you can try and try and try.....<br>  but i will NEVER accept what you say as long as it's against what the Holy Quran says........<br>  <br>  you have no idea about Imams........<br>  <br>  you have no idea about 2:124...........<br>  <br>  a person with a healthy brain would NEVER chose your croputed theory over the word of Allah SWT........<br>  <br>  better luck next time kido..............

gGmMw2vDaa	The English is extremely good. Yes, there are a few places where I do not agree with the grammar, but most people do not use what I would consider perfect grammar. So what. For the most part, this is the English of someone who knows English well.<br>  <br>  > did your dad might open a new shop?<br>   did might? This is not right.<br>  <br>  > Especially how you can follow a mail conversation is very<br>  useful <br>  <br>  This sentence is poorly phrased.<br>  <br>  I suspect that he is not a native speaker, but that he learned English as a second language. He did a pretty good job of it.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	His English is easy to understand but the passage still contains quite a few errors. I have to say that I am speaking as a Londoner in my forties. Most younger people probably don't write as well as that person and would probably think his English is excellent. I don't think it matters that there are some mistakes in it; the important thing is that he likes good English. Perhaps he just needs to be a bit more modest about his abilities.|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	yes, his English is pretty good and if i didnt know he was foreign, i would think he was just native. except where he says "at the moment there is still winter time here, Japan time is 8 hours before Swiss time" thats not quite right. It should say "It's still winter time here, japan is 8 hours behind Swiss time" or something like that, but its really good|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Its not perfect, but its not bad. You dont need to refer to British English ... just saying English is fine|`|OKVRwX2Caa	No he has made a lot of basic errors, but even us English often do the same.|`|vhlORK4Waa	His grammar and syntax aren't perfect, however his English is perfectly understandable, but in no way is he a fluent English speaker.<br>  <br>  Even if you hadn't explained that the writer was foreign, I should still have known that he was from his use of the language.<br>  <br>  His English is a lot better than my Swiss German or French, but it is the little things that always trip people up, and these are essentially where the writer has phrased things as they might be phrased in their native language, and not in standard English (e..g. "did your Dad might open a new shop" and "Japan time is 8 hours before Swiss time) - just stilted, which is not unexpected when one is probably mentally composing sentences in the structure that one is used to.<br>  <br>  A for effort<br>  D- for arrogance<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|eeKp9mStaa	His English is crap.|`|2f26838b56bf3bf335cfd0076639a2dcaa	"May you" should be "Can you" but there isn't really much wrong with any of his english, it's all just very formal. Most people add their own personality into writing, such as using words that only they use. <br>  Its just very formal, and I suppose formal english is the same in all countries, nothing to stay its specifically British I dont think.<br>  Besides Britain is made up of 4 countries who all speak and write differently so saying your work is British is very broad|`|bR4BgFLlaa	He does not speak perfect English. You're right about the 'may you', in that context it is not correct. "I'm very happy to know that you are fine and alive." Is also a very very strange thing for a native speaker to say. As is "did your dad might open a new shop?" this is wrong. I'd say his english is quite good, but far from perfect. <br>  <br>  In saying that though, many native speakers are just as bad as demonstrated by the appalling grammar of many english speakers on yahoo...<br>  <br>  Its hard to tell if he learnt British english or not, there are very few differences between English speakers aside from colloquialisms, there are none specific to British english in this message. Otherwise there are small differences between American and British spellings, such as colour (British) and color (American) but there are none if these words used in the message.

Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

They think they are above the frailties of common people. In this state of mind they are easily tripped up. Ironically, proud people seldom realize that pride is their problem, although everyone around them is well aware of it.Ask anyone you trust whether self-satisfaction has blinded you to warning signs. He or she may help you avoid a fall.|`|RnxxYn8gaa	What?! Are you 12? Look don't worry about it if people say that, they are just being either ridiculous, stupid, or just plain silly. They are just saying that because they can. Trust me, it won't matter when your like 23 and don't really care what people think of you. Some may be jealous a little bit, some may just be going along with the crowd. If I were you, I'd just ignore it because when you graduate high school, you'll be moving on and trying to learn to do a job you'll love so that you can work hard and actually enjoy it. That's what you should focusing on in the long term. Forget people who bother you because they think they know you when they know squat. They think that they can read you, but they don't have the first clue of who you are. Only you have the first clue, and it's up to you to make something of it. Not them.<br>  <br>  Well good luck anyway, and if it makes you feel any better, everyone ends up ugly eventually, so you'll have your day as well.|`|xSdnsSojaa	Probably for the same reason he made you so modest. ;-)|`|wzxrvTmdaa	HAHAHA!

HQ0OKwc2aa	I think the best thing you can do is to place an advert in a place where you live, in which you will just ask for private lessons in exchange for a proper fee, or in exchange for teaching your own language. If you can teach English, it should not be a problem to find someone who could teach you Polish.
wc6N5sxOaa	No we are not born with "evil" in us. We are trained from the start to think and act a certain way because of society. Society sets the standards of what is "good" and what is "evil". They are man made concepts, people have just used the Bible as a tool ( in certain areas) to set the standards of how a society works.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	Since you believe that way you might want to look into Thomas Hobbes. My belief is that people are born with a blank slate and their actions, intent, and faith determine whether or not theyre good or bad which is influenced by society. People make choices and theyre either good or bad. Keep in mind that there are 3 main things that affect someone's decisions. Environment (society/how they were brought up), situation, and genetics (barely though). Some stories in the bible are fake, like the adam and eve story. But thats just it theyre stories. Theyre stories to help you live your life in a good way. Each story has a moral to it and scientists and archaeologists have found that most of the stories are actually true. Theres a reason the Jewish scribes put those stories in there, and its because those stories have the best representation of whats good and bad. Don't just look at the fact that it says Babylon will fall. Look at the reason as to why it would fall.|`|9Duha1k4aa	Ever read Lord of the Flies before? It's my favourite book lol ;D<br>  <br>  I think that we are born with evil within as well. Obviously, we have been born into this modern society where we are moulded into these law abiding citizens. But what would happen if we left a child out in the wild to fend for themselves till they are older? Would they become a cold-blooded killer. The simple answer is yes. <br>  <br>  Without today's world, with the rules we have to following by, we would still be like the lions and other predators. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. If God was real, he has just created the most evil things imaginable. Humans. Us.

But He does care what happens to us! He doesn't want us to drift through life without any meaning or purpose, nor does He want us to throw our lives away or destroy them. He loves us, and He knows all about us; Jesus said, "Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered" by God (Matthew 10:30).<br>  <br>  Never forget: God is far greater than we are. No, we can't imagine trying to keep track of every person on earth—but God can do it because He is greater than we are. The Bible says, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9).<br>  <br>  How do I know God loves us and cares about us? I know it because He sent His only Son into the world to save us and bring us back to Himself. Sin has separated us from God—but on the cross all our sins were placed on Christ, and He took the penalty we deserve. Yes, God loves us—and He loves you. Respond to His love today by giving your life to Christ. Then ask Him to show you His plan for your life, and He will. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com

There were previous attempts, and it was common knowledge then as a few serious attempts were foiled and publicized in TV news and newspapers through the 90's.  I see Arabic type writing like a signature or something on the bottom left of the picture, so, coming from that perspective, the picture is suspect of the perpetrator's ambitions, its scary, but not freaky in the sense of ESP or anything.  <br>  <br>  It should definitely be removed from public showing, for respect of those who were victims of the fight between George Bush and Bin Laden.|`|RVWyPicKaa	eeeek!<br>  <br>  makes me wonder.... emergency call: 911? and twin towers: 9/11? see the connection. oh, maybe i am being too suspicious..... you never know though, you never know.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Those look like cylinders than skyscrapers, and the smoke on the top probably represents a chimney fire or something.

(a 2 year old would not understand the concept of course).<br>  <br>  Fasting, however, only applies to people between the ages of 14 and 60 for health reasons.<br>  <br>  You do NOT have to have on Sunday what you have given up during the rest of the week.

After lent is over ie, Easter, you get to have whatever you gave up during lent.  <br>  <br>  Lent came about because of the forty days in the desert, hence the length of lent...  Hope this helps|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	everyone has to do the giving up. only 14 and oldre for fasting on ash wednesday, friday's and the holy week. everyone has to abstaine from meat unless medically unwise or you're a senior citizen

Also keep in mind not everyone is similar. Islam puts attention to cleanliness. If that person is going according to Islam then it  is okay otherwise dont try to change him for his personal affairs. <br>  If you find fault in someone look at urself and see ur negative side, then improve yourself first.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a blessing of Allah. The happiest marriage is the one which is least burdensome (i.e arguments and quarrel with spouse etc...). <br>  <br>  He might put the ear wax or tissue paper for future use or it may be clean or he can wash it. If you dont have money wouldn't you save your food so you can eat it later? He might be doing similar. <br>  <br>  As for you saying "what is wrong with men?" - Do you know what men say to women who say stuff what you say? they call her dirty names and get pissed off. In this 21st century, modern class men dont like women to interrupt their hygiene. This has no basis iin Islam. What i mean is no matter what gender you are, you have to be clean (Note: Allah loves Cleanliness too). <br>  <br>  You say you dont want to marry any man. Well I want to marry a woman when im financially able to support the family and also physically please her (intimacy), Precisely age of 20 and above.<br>  I had asked some questions about the negatives of women. Allah saved me from doing that stereotype sin and one sweet lady talked to me. I appreciate her talk with me alot. <br>  <br>  I do want to get married and love my wife for rest of my life. You should have the intention of marrying a man who is religious and marry for sake of Allah|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	That sounds just like my brother!<br>  <br>  However one man I came across he was very independent did things by himself even his cooking (I think he said he liked wearing the apron hahaha) although his sisters took Control and wanted to do things for him.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Not all are like that hun, trust me your coming across the wrong ones.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Awwww I know how you feel.

Their parents do not treat him the same way they treat their daughters due to cultural views over Islam. <br>  Islam says to treat them equally. You tell me where it says women have to cook, clean etc especially  for men. The best examples were that of prophet Muhammed (SAW). He used to fix his own clothes and was very hygienic. Hygiene is a major part of Islam.<br>  <br>  The way to make men be more hygienic is for them to learn the basic rule of sharing and helping around the house. He will only do it if he lives alone or student accomodation etc and once he is married it stops!<br>  This is his duty also. You will find this is not "his job" as in their houses the mums or sister, sister in law does it.<br>  <br>  Now a days as a woman is also expected to work and cook and clean and look after the kids, women are not putting up with this and quite rightly so. Men will find it hard to get married as most women are wanting  men to share responsibilities which some are not ready to do due to being pampered and culturally supported by their mums who were brought up very traditional and cultured to accept this way. However, she would just carry on the tradition and probably didn't have a career or studied far which is different to this time. Saying this however, certain countries men have given their wives maids to do these jobs but they are rich.<br>  <br>  A women has to change the attitude of men when the child grows up to teach Islamic values and not culture and it is ALSO their duty to wash, clean and look after their kids like prophet Muhammed (SAW)has done before us.<br>  <br>  It is changing the sexist cultural attitude of people and  this has to be achieved at  a young age so the man can grow with respect for women.|`|E0lMycUeaa	MUHAHAHAHA<br>  <br>  reema you cant escape from us<br>  <br>  we are around you<br>  <br>  we are everywhere<br>  <br>  MUHAHAHAHA|`|oq6PD1gRaa	Yep i'm with you in this<br>  i have this "why don't you clean behind your mess" issua too .. but also with my sis hehe<br>  <br>  i have found that every guy has some kind of issue .. the less men in your life .. the better .. so i declared to my family that i'm not going to get married coz no guy deserves me and my parents think the same hehe<br>  <br>  i keep my dad and brother only :)|`|CzLvqFFsaa	Don't insult all men. I'm a guy. I agree that most guys are like this and you can't change them (For example, most of my friends), only they can change themselves. You need to find a person who is hygienic.

XN0cYCATaa	No, That would be Called Theistic Evolution<br>  A variation on the theme of evolution is theistic evolution. It states that God initiated life on earth and allowed evolutionary principles to bring man to where he is--maybe with a little help from God here and there. At least this theory includes God. But this theory was developed in part by Bible believing people who thought that evolution had some merit. In addition, it is an attempt to answer the many problems existing not only in the fossil record but also with how life could somehow randomly form out of nothing. Because of problems like this, some believe they can be explained by simply adding God to the picture: God directed evolution.<br>  <br>  For those who hold to the Bible as the word of God, theistic evolution should not be a viable option. The Bible says, "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us..." (Psalm 100:3). The Scriptures state that God created. God said, "Let there be..." and there was. The Scriptures speak of the creative word of God. When God speaks; it occurs. He said "Let there be" and it was so. It does not say, "Let there be a slow development through an evolutionary process."<br>  <br>  God said in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." The Hebrew word for "make" in this verse and in verse 25 where God makes the beasts, is "asah." It means to do, work, make, produce. This is not simply the limited Hebrew understanding of evolutionary principles.<br>  <br>  The land animals were made differently than man. The animals were made from the ground but man was made directly by God: "the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Gen. 2:7). Evolution states that man evolved from life forms that developed in the ocean. Here, God made man from the dust of the ground--not the water of the ocean.<br>  <br>  If evolution is true and the Bible is true then how is the formation of Eve explained? She was created out of one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:22). There is no way to explain this if theistic evolution is true; that is, unless you want to say that Eve wasn't made from Adam's side. Then, if you do that, you are doubting the very word of God.<br>  <br>  Also, Jesus said in Mark 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.'" The beginning was not evolutionary slime; in the beginning of creation there was Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  Though this information is brief and far from complete, it should be obvious that theistic evolution and the Scriptures cannot be harmonized.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Well Catholics certainly can. Most thinking Christians do.<br>  <br>  By the way, you don't 'believe' in Evolution, you just accept the evidence.<br>  <br>  Belief is different from recognition and acknowledgement of facts.|`|smA22aNHaa	Most atheists have "Christian values and Morals".|`|MeFeazFiaa	There are actually millions of Christians who accept the theory of evolution.

Not all Christians are brain dead morons.|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Absolutely. It's called creationary evolutionist. It basically means that you believe that God created the universe and set in place a kind of blue print for how everything unfolded. <br>  <br>  Evolution actually largely matches the 6 "days" described in Genesis, which makes sense if you accept that a day for God would not necessarily have been 24 hours (a man-made convention). A day for Him could be tens of millions of years.|`|ij5Sv6staa	Yes, it is truly an intelligent design to give life the wonderful ability to adapt to it's surroundings.<br>  <br>  It is ludicrous to deny evolution when we see it happening before our very eyes with strains of bacteria changing over very short periods of time to resist our antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Who is to say that God did not use evolution as his tool of creation?|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	God gave you a mind and free will, so you can be anything you want and call yourself anything you want.<br>  <br>  As an example, I heard quite of number of people saying that they are Christian, and also claiming that the Sermon on the Mount does not apply to them!

A christian is merely someone who believes in and worships Jesus as the divine son of God and the savior of humanity from sin. Belief in the literal statements of the Book of Genesis is not required.|`|QMbaeva9aa	I think most of it has no contradiction to religion at all.|`|4f4mVCAAaa	In order to reconcile the two you will have to decide to believe that the bible is not an historical document of true events, but an allegory. Many christians do this, but it depends on which kind of christian you are (Methodist, Catholic etc). Some branches of christianity insist that the bible is true word for word. This is impossible to reconcile with evolution because evolution is not compatible with the book of Genesis (i.e creation etc) for example. <br>  <br>  Even in an allegorical sense its dicey whether or not you can believe both, for instance, god created man in god's image. Did god himself evolve? <br>  <br>  I know people who go down these roads in order to reconcile the obvious facts of science with their religion.<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist though, personally I believe that christianity (and all religions) shouldn't bend their own rules to fit in with changing knowledge of science. If the facts of evolution make you question your belief, this is because your belief isn't really compatible with the reality. In this case you need to make a choice, the only sane one is to go with the facts.|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	Evolution is not something you believe in but something you accept as it is scientific fact.<br>  Evolution doesn't say that there is no God either, it just tells you how life evolved from the first living cell to the present day.<br>  Many people don't understand that evolution has nothing to do with how life began, but how it evolved.<br>  98.9% of biologists accept evolution, 70% of those believe in a God.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	Yes, you absolutely can.  As Brian McClaren, a foremost religious speaker in Emerging Christianity says, "evolution is one of God's greatest creations."  Since all Christians interpret the Bible in various ways, it's certainly reasonable to interpret the account of Genesis as being figurative, and perfectly consistent with scientific evidence of evolution.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	Yes you can. In fact, if you wish to remain a Christian but you don't wish to deny reality, you MUST believe both.<br>  <br>  It's not just evolution that refutes a dogmatic, literalist interpretation of the Bible. Biblical Literalist Creation is proved false by geology, cosmology, astronomy, paleontology, Earth sciences, chemistry and physics to name a few.<br>  <br>  The secret is to NOT be a dogmatic Biblical Literalist. The secret is to treat the truths of the natural world - the glorious complexities, mysteries, facts, realities - all as your God's creation. <br>  <br>  Evolution is an amazing system that yields beauty, diversity, complexity, resilience, and rebirth. It has allowed life on Earth to weather massive, devastating extinctions. How horrible is it that some creationists deny evolution, or attribute it to Satan, when in fact it may be their God's greatest creation?<br>  <br>  It is truly evil when people like Kent Hovind, Ken Ham, and many people on Y!A lie to you and tell you that you must deny the reality of evolution to be a Christian. They are creating a conflict where none need exist. They are setting up a "false dichotomy" that makes so many Christians choose a path of ignorance and denial of science. It's terrible, it erodes our country's dominance in science, and it makes people close their minds to some of the most fascinating aspects of our world and our origins. After all, if you are a Christian, you cannot possibly deny that your God put those amazing fossils in the ground. Yet because of these "either-or" creationists, many Christians actively close their eyes and minds to the fossil record and DNA. That's so sad.<br>  <br>  If people wish to understand how to accept the fact of evolution while retaining their faith, I think Ken Miller is a good example to follow:<br>  <a href="http://evolutiondiary.com/2006/11/25/ken-millers-evolution-lecture-videos/" rel="nofollow">http://evolutiondiary.com/2006/11/25/ken...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/" rel="nofollow">http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/</a><br>  <br>  A really interesting fellow is Robert Bakker, who helped shape our understanding of how strong, fast (and probably warm-blooded) many dinosaurs were.

God does have a plan for every one of us—and the reason is because He loves us, and wants us to have what is best for us.<br>  <br>  You see, if He didn't care for us, then He wouldn't care what we did with our lives.<br>  <br>  If we wrecked our lives or wasted them, it wouldn't make any difference to Him—if He didn't care. But He does care what happens to us! He doesn't want us to drift through life without any meaning or purpose, nor does He want us to throw our lives away or destroy them. He loves us, and He knows all about us; Jesus said, "Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered" by God (Matthew 10:30).<br>  <br>  Never forget: God is far greater than we are. No, we can't imagine trying to keep track of every person on earth—but God can do it because He is greater than we are. The Bible says, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9).<br>  <br>  How do I know God loves us and cares about us? I know it because He sent His only Son into the world to save us and bring us back to Himself. Sin has separated us from God—but on the cross all our sins were placed on Christ, and He took the penalty we deserve. Yes, God loves us—and He loves you. Respond to His love today by giving your life to Christ. Then ask Him to show you His plan for your life, and He will.

ApJOZLBgaa	This is the concluding part of the argument on diiferent faiths in the short story 'The Coffee-House of Surat' by Leo Tolstoy<br>  <br>  "So on matters of faith," continued the Chinaman, the student of Confucius, "it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As with the sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God of his own, or at least a special God for his native land. Each nation wishes to confine in its own temples Him, whom the world cannot contain.<br>  <br>  "Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite all men in one faith and one religion?<br>  <br>  "All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God's own world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps, its pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the law, its offerings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is there such a font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens; such lamps as the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be compared with living, loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there any records of God's goodness so easy to understand as the<br>  blessings which God has strewn abroad for man's happiness? Where is there any book of the law so clear to each man as that written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the self-denials which loving men and women make for one another? And what altar can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself accepts the sacrifice?<br>  <br>  "The higher a man's conception of God, the better will he know Him. And the better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His goodness, His mercy, and His love of man.<br>  <br>  "Therefore, let him who sees the sun's whole light filling the world, refrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his own idol sees one ray of that same light.

Dating someone else who intimately understands what you've been through eliminates a lot of the worry that goes along with someone who doesn't.

PtWX39Zjaa	"Emo" is actually short for Emotive Hardcore - a type of music - started in the 90's.<br>  Kids used the term "emo" to describe those who dress like those bands or happen to be a fan. (black clothes, skinny jeans, etc).<br>  <br>  "Scene" on the other hand is more of a state of mind than a style, in my opinion. It's basically "emo" with  brighter colors and bigger hair.|`|boVKnnFCaa	Haha scene has more color basically =P, There are a few differences, but theres alot of similarities too.|`|un9XCHpraa	Just going by looks an emo girl style is more like this: <a href="http://myhairisemo.blogspot.com/2009/02/very-cool-emo-haircut.html" rel="nofollow">http://myhairisemo.blogspot.com/2009/02/...</a><br>  and a scene girl more like this: <a href="http://myhairisemo.blogspot.com/2009/01/kind-of-emo-kind-of-scene.html" rel="nofollow">http://myhairisemo.blogspot.com/2009/01/...</a><br>  I think scene has more colour, bigger hair and lots of posing ;)

dCewrtXaaa	First of all, don't think that being in a deaf world ruins your life. You may not have liked the school you went to, but there are plenty of wonderful deaf people in the world and you must be careful not to form a prejudice against them. <br>  <br>  What is causing the problems is that no one has really put together your speech needs, which include both practicing oral pronunciation AND learning English pronunciation. I believe you are entitled to speech therapy through the school, and I think if your parents insist on it and explain why the ASL interpreter is not the "least restrictive learning environment" in your case, the school would have to adjust  Since the counselor is not listening to you, they would need to talk to the principal. <br>  <br>  If the principal resists providing what you need, the next stop would be the school district office. School districts really pay attention to parent complaints, even more so than to teacher complaints, which I know from experience in both cases! Also, I believe the district would save money by giving you regular time with a speech therapist and an after-school tutor, as opposed to a full-time interpreter.<br>  <br>  As for the CART (or CAN), you may not be able to get it. But try for the other services first, and in the meantime ask the teacher if s/he can give you some summarized notes to study from. There is a saying in English that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. This means that if you continue speaking up for what you need, you are more likely to get it. There are some powerful forces on your side in the disability laws of the US, and the more you learn about them (online), the better you can manage your educational goals.<br>  <br>  PS. What if your teacher used Dragon Naturally Speaking with a microphone to convert her class lectures to computer text? Does your school have the technology to project that text to a screen? Could that work instead of the CART? Teachers can be surprisingly accommodating sometimes. When I was in Architecture school, a deaf classmate of mine (who also preferred oral communication) convinced the professor to shave off his beloved mustache to facilitate lip-reading. And do study lip-reading. It won't help you with oral pronunciation, but it will help you understand others.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|khzqW8o2aa	hello if you would like to talk to improve ure english i can do it with u if u like my email is nealo24@yahoo.ie

You have already reached 30 years and the life would be better from now on..

It is all over for you. Dont worry and carry on in confidence. <br>  <br>  The sun (lord of 9th) in exaltation is good and the other yoga kaaraka Mars in Kataka also suffers Neechabanga (moon being in the lagna kendra) and you should be having a reasonably good life..<br>  <br>  Many people would have the KS dosha indicating the challenges of our times, but we are all blessed to be born in the punya boomi of Bharath where saints lived and still live in the holy mountains, sanctifying the holy land..

Yi0sksmJaa	Any of the above could've caused her change in attitude. Sounds to me like you need to talk to her. Find out if she would go out on a date with just you, no friends. Then when you're out, you should ask her if it upset her that you saw other people. Tell her you've noticed the change and didn't realize that it would bother you as much as it does. If you want to be exclusive with her, then you need to talk to her. Sounds like you two need to figure out what each wants from the friendship/relationship. Good luck.|`|onfTqFe4aa	I agree with the above answer. Definiteley let her know that you've NOTICED the change. That way she's more open to explain it.

KWvGUoW6aa	By globalization, do you mean the developing of mass communication which makes it easier to communicate with people on the other side of the planet? Or do you mean the fact that people of various religions are now relocating to other countries and assimilating among people of religions different from their own?<br>  <br>  If that's what you mean, then I don't see how that idea can bring a global religion. If anything, it will bring people together, and teach people to appreciate their differences.
zdu3gh8jaa	I have answered so many questions like this so I'm copying and pasting one of my other answers:<br>  <br>  Hi there,<br>  Yes I am a believer as I have had too many experiences in the last 25 or so years for me to believe otherwise. Spirits are interactive so you would be able to speak with them and they with you. Ghosts on the other hand ar not interactive, they are just a replay of a person, event or animal that has been imprinted into the very fabric of their surroundings. This replay is not aware of you and will just repeat the same scene or action over and over again. It is held in place by the intense emotion at the time of imprint. Look up 'stone tape theory' for further info on this.<br>  Right, back to what makes me believe. How about a tumble dryer that worked without an electricity supply or motor in it. Or having a full conversation with a person only to watch them disappear like a curl of smoke halfway through. What about seeing 'shadow' people walk through the kitchen while you stand there flabbergasted or seeing them walk through the bedroom. Then there's whoever it is that washes pots and pans at 5 and 6 in a morning or likes to slam kitchen unit doors, but when you go to look there is nothing out of place. You also have the one that likes to make pictures fly off the wall approx 3ft before allowing them to drop directly in front of the neighbours that have dropped in for coffee. There's the cat that follows you from room to room meowing around your feet. There is also the gentle unseen hands that stroke your hair and face. Or the ones that like to run up and down the stairs and throughout the bedrooms when everyone is watching tv and accounted for. These are just a few of the things I and my family, friends and neighbours have experienced in my home. Do you think that after living here with this going on that I would do anything other than believe?<br>  These are all very true experiences and we have tried to re-create as many as we can just to rule out the possibility of a rational, logical explanation. Each time something 'new' was experienced we would search high and low trying to get to the bottom of what had caused the event, more often than not a normal or even possible explanation was not found. As for being scared, then no I don't find any of it scary, sometimes it makes you jump but I think it is more fascinating than anything.<br>  I hope the above explains to you some of my reasons to believe in spirit.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|32P3hG0Laa	MY LONDON GHOST STORY<br>  In December 2004 I spent a few days at a friend’s flat in London, just a couple of blocks from Trafalgar Square, near the Thames. As you entered the tiny apartment, there was a small 5’ x 5’ foyer. If you kept going straight, you went through the doorway of the bedroom. and directly across from that was the bedroom window. Under the window was a TV set angled diagonally to face the head of the bed, which was to the left of the doorway, against the wall. There was just enough leftover room to be able to walk around the three sides of the queen-size mattress, with two bureaus.<br>  <br>  I spent my first day tramping all over London, and that night I was flopped across the bed in my street clothes, reading maps and tourist info to decide what to do the next day. I was facing the window with the TV set, which was off. <br>  <br>  At one point, I glanced up from my reading material to think about my plans and noticed someone reflected in the dark TV screen. Apparently there was someone standing in the foyer behind me, looking into the room! I was startled, a little frightened at the idea of an intruder in the apartment, and in a millisecond, I felt my adrenaline kick in and spun my head to look in the foyer. There was no one there, and when I spun back to re-look at the dark TV screen, it was blank, the image gone. With my heart racing, I took stock of the experience and recalled seeing a man standing in the foyer, wearing a white wig and, I guess, an outfit from roughly the 1700s. He was only visible from roughly the mid-thighs upward, and he had his hands clutched together at chest level, as he turned back and forth as if scanning and assessing the room.<br>  <br>  I did not feel any presence at the time, and wondered if my eyes had played tricks on me, but I couldn’t see anything reflected in the TV screen that I might have mistaken for what I remembered seeing. The adrenaline surge kept me a little “up” for the next 20-30 minutes, so I got up and got something to eat, but eventually undressed for bed and slept. I didn’t think about it again until the next night.<br>  <br>  The next evening around 6, 7pm, I got in after walking for about 6 hours around London and walked directly from the front door to the bed, tossing my coat aside before I flopped perpendicularly across the bed, face down and facing away from the foyer, toward the window. Immediately, while the bed was still rocking back and forth from my flopping, I heard what I can only describe as five rapid footsteps, distinctly crossing the wooden floor, then a slight pause, and I felt an intense wave of cold energy  sort of “fall upon” my body all at once. In my mind I suddenly thought “Someone’s jumped on top of me!” although there had been no physical sensation of weight. <br>  <br>  It seemed as if my entire body was energized, as if all my molecules were vibrating, and it felt cool, not quite cold. Although I was hearing no noise, I felt like I was “buzzing” and I felt someone wanted me to leave, to get out. I didn’t feel threatened, just someone wanted me out. I didn’t “belong” there.<br>  <br>  I wasn’t in shock, or even upset. though I was amazed. And I had the presence of mind to take a deep breath and in my head, start repeating to myself “It’s OK. I’m just visiting. I mean no ill will. I will be leaving in a few days. I am not a threat to you.” over and over for a few minutes. I visualized myself protected, and tried to project a safe, calming energy outwards. <br>  <br>  The sensation of the “energy wave” began to fade, and was shortly gone. The entire episode lasted less than three minutes, and for the rest of my stay, another three days, I felt, saw and experienced no further activity.|`|BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|v20S8oSJaa	i believe in spirits/jinn (arabian/muslim myth ghost)<br>  and no i hav not experienced it, but i no ppl who hav.<br>  <br>  XXX Naomi XXX|`|KyLinbX9aa	yes im a medium i see them almost every day but i call them spirits at first i was scared but now i dont be they are just people looking for help<br>  ive been seeing them since i was 13|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	actually i do|`|t1VXsGpwaa	Yes I have.

G4SVG7tKaa	Get in touch with the Reverend Soleil.
RNyEQUQDaa	Neither. The Bible is about God/life not religion/science. God doesnt care how many or how well u can do repetitious rituals (what most religions/churches r about) or if u can build a rocket.  The crux of the problem 4 many is man (having limited knowledge) tries 2 know who God is by imposing human limitations 4 understanding things 2 God's abilities.<br>  <br>  Many scientific finds r true but it doesnt mean "all" their claims r true (many dont take time & energy 2 carefully think thru things b4 coming out 4 or against it). Many dont properly take in2 account all it takes 2 create a universe/life (they tend 2 focus on things "seeming" 2 support what they want 2 &/or u 2 believe).<br>  <br>  In science we established laws of physics. We can't see actual laws of physics. Rather, we see the results & interpret & apply them in accordance with whats been observed 2 b true thru experiments/calculations. Same is true regarding God. Just b/c we can't see God doesn't mean He doesnt exist.<br>  <br>  There may b forensic evidence 4 some micro-adaptation & 4 some "appearance" of macro-evolution but most is inconclusive @ best & pure conjecture @ worst. Finding the beginning & reason 4 it all is unattainable by scientific method alone (a billions of years old cold case). We didnt see it take place.<br>  <br>  But things in creation show an Intelligent Being was involved or the universe & we wouldnt b here (ignoring where it came from). 4 instance:<br>  <br>  1. We have 2 lungs & 2 kidneys - each has a near perfect mirror-image companion organ. No matter how u try 2 explain it away, making a mirror-image organ takes full reverse engineering, knowledge & understanding of its companion's functions & purpose or it cant be created.<br>  <br>  2. Our bodies r highly symmetrical from 1 side 2 the other. Its impossible unless 1 has an outside overview position allowing full comprehension of the entire organism (i.e. feather color patterns).<br>  <br>  3. We have 2 arms & 2 legs. Each is perfectly designed & precisely engineered 2 work with its mirror-image companion. An outside position is required 2 fully comprehend the whole organism & purpose 4 all parts, 2 create it 2 such perfection.<br>  <br>  4. The "being" of a cell is confined 2 within the cell membrane & cant know or b aware of much beyond itself. A cell is magnitudes more intelligent than all humanity & has amazing powers 2 know all of an organism's functions & purpose or it isnt the "brain" behind creation 4 many millions of incredibly diverse species. If evolution had a chance of being the source of creation it would require there only be 2 or 3 "kinds" of different bodies with several related species (it would take many billions of trillions of light years longer than the universe has existed 2 have the slightest chance of producing many millions of species of such incredible diversity).<br>  <br>  5. Many cells of an organism never contact others much beyond its tiny cell. Mostly, cells & organisms r just copies of their parents doing about the same things as all ancestors. U wont find a bird whom builds a better nest than their parents & their chicks build even a better nest. U wont find a bear improving his living conditions (or passing them 2 his young). Either a cell has 2 lives - 1 copying their parents & 1 secret life working on improvements or someone of greater intelligence than all mankind created everything.<br>  <br>  6. Others point 2 DNA (or RNA in the 1rst organisms). But a cell needs DNA 2 function & DNA cant function without a cell. So, we have a which came 1rst a cell or DNA problem. Without 1rst having great intelligence, full knowledge & understanding of how an organism is constructed it cant be created. If an ape finds a combination lock he wouldnt know what it was & even if he turns the dial over & over again he wouldnt know what he was doing & the chances against getting it right is astronimical - especially if it had 150 or more no. 2 find in the right order & even if he got that far he still wouldnt know what a lock is 4.<br>  <br>  A cell has little "inteligence" & DNA is much more complex than a combination lock (especially in higher life forms) so the odds against figuring out & using DNA (in the correct sequence) is many magnitudes higher than 4 a lock). RNA/DNA r building blocks common to all life - having 98% of other species' DNA doesnt prove evolution. DNA like a computer code (but more complex) requires great intelligence 2 identify & assign its proper order - its useless unless u understand it. Give a book to an ape. Its useless to him as he cant learn from whats written - intelligence is required.<br>  <br>  7. In the fossil record we dont find millions of trial & error organisms that should exist if natural selection or fittest survivor is the source of creation (no organisms existed be4). The odds r so great against near perfection happenning 4 many millions of greatly diverse species, it couldnt take place unless 1 had full knowledge & understanding of what theyre doing BEFORE millions of organisms could be created 2 such precision. If not true millions of misfit organisms with mistakes, having only 1 or 3 eyes in odd places, 1 leg growing out of a head or where an arm should be or a fin where a leg should be should exist. Millions more misfit fossils should exist than of the perfection found in nature.<br>  <br>  8. U won't find species like a horse mating a goat, a frog mating fish, a rabbit mating an otter, a lizzard mating a bird, a cow mating a hog, etc. Species with similar genes/characteristics rarely mate in the wild. Only a few succeed @ bearing young. Its very rare that a wild crossbreed/hybrid reaches maturity or can bear over 1 litter (usually that litter cant produce or has complications that kills off the crossbreed). Only human intervention brings more success but even that has lead 2 some bad results.<br>  <br>  9. Evolution processes being "the" source of all creation would be like having a blind man build a car he's never heard of, seen, touched, heard or rode in. It cant be done without 1rst teaching him about the functions, necessary parts & how 2 put it all together so the car will function.<br>  <br>  10. Look @ the huge amount of intelligence, knowledge, understanding, time & energy used 2 create & improve an airplane's capabilities (& many mistakes). If people didnt fully learn what 2 do we'd still be earthbound.<br>  <br>  11. Creation is astronomically more complex than an airplane. The more complex an organism, the greater the amount of intelligence, knowledge & understanding needed 2 create it. It can only be done by an Intelligent Designer who already fully understands what He's doing - the sheer complexity of man is evidence of God (airplanes show we're created in God's image - God had 2 be the source of all creation or it couldnt exist let alone evolve).<br>  <br>  12. An incredibly Intelligent Being, capable of building a universe, would know the environment His earthly organisms are 2 occupy. So, He built in adaptability so His organisms could survive various earthly environments.<br>  <br>  13. Earth happens to be in the best possible orbit 2 support life. It has the right amount of gravity, the right axis & rotation speed, the right atmosphere (& ozone layer, Van Allen belt, magnetic field) & needed amount of water. The moon's the right size & in the right orbit 2 provide tidal cycles needed by organisms. Just 1 or 2 relatively small variants in our orbit/envirnment & most likely life would be very different & higher forms of life wouldve died off in a relatively short time, if they couldve survived.<br>  <br>  Problem is theres many religions, built on what man wants God 2 b like. I realized they cant all b right (Theres 1 Bible - why so many interpretations & fatal errors? II Pet 1:**19-21). Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they don't know) but God knows what He's doing. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those who move in later?<br>  <br>  Many miss this: Jesus is the only 1 in history whom stated He's "the" way, "the" truth & "the" life & no 1 gets 2 God w/o Him (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12) & is the only 1 whom came from God. Its fully true or theres no truth & cant be any God (He knows what He's doing or He's not God). Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, whom should b disregarded.<br>  <br>  Since Jesus is the only way 2 know God, "the" whole truth was complete & finished thru Jesus. So any claimed new or other religious beliefs or from self-proclaimed prophets & teachers r null & void & wont lead u 2 God. God always knew all Jesus was 2 do.<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt hv done nor said whats written in the NT unless He fully knew the entire OT (the NT didnt exist while Jesus was on earth). Jesus couldnt hv known the entire OT unless God was with Him. & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know what He was here 4 (Lk 24:25-27,45) - Not possible unless God caused it.<br>  <br>  Whoever seeks Jesus Christ with all his heart & soul will find Him (u shall know the truth & it'll set u free). U can lead a horse 2 water but u cant make them drink. Why would God want u 2 live with Him forever if u dont want 2 know Him (reason 4 free will - Jn 1:12-13)? The truth of God remains forever unchanged while things of a man dies with him, including his religions/gods made in his image.<br>  <br>  God hates us b/c of our sins - neither being a good person as judged by men or religion can save u. But God also loves us dearly enough 2 send His Son 2 die for our sins - so that thru Jesus our sins could b forgiven if we sincerely turn 2 Him - Theres everlasting hope only in Jesus Christ & His Bible.

d21602968207c0c2d97e342c8834fc7aaa	A followup question might be:  If heaven is so much greater than earth, why would the 80 years on earth be so memorable in comparison to the 17,000,000,000,000 following years?<br>  <br>  I guess the "logic" is that if something is temporary, it's meaningless.  Like why build a sandcastle if the waves are just gonna wash it away.  But it's still not clear to me how permanence gives meaning.|`|xPeIvywdaa	well first heaven is outside the district of time, in eternity land, so there wouldnt really be 17bil years gone by<br>  <br>  who knows if we will have all our memories of this life, but if we do wed probably realize how great heaven is, and how great God is|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	it will be different from any thing|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Heaven I would guess does not have time as we know it.  Maybe time would not flow there at all, therefore "17,000,000,000,000,000,000 years" would have no real meaning|`|YUAegpPoaa	Roughly the exact same amount you have decided you must be forced to forget by an end. I will try to expand my answer without wandering too far off into the philosophical woods.<br>  <br>  The older you get the weirder your memory becomes; sometimes I think it creates things out of whole cloth all by itself and I know it tries to shade my personal history with a set of crayons that simply were not the true colors on occasion.<br>  <br>  These 'measly 80' had many, many firsts and I am pretty good at remembering those in addition to the pieces I claim have true meaning. Like the pages of a well worn favorite book, or another sunset, or the face of someone you love - do you think it possible to ever grow tired of looking at these? If you said such a thing possible I would not believe you. <br>  <br>  I am the man that the missus tells to quit looking at the stars and come to bed though. :)
mgrWKmCsaa	yea it really helps lol
W8bs2VQSaa	Yes, its a great way to celebrate the person's life rather than dwelling on the death. I often read "wear bright colours" in the funeral columns. When my Dad died, my Mum went out and bought a bright pink suit...she thought Dad would like it. Its great to think this way .|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	What a wonderful way to honor this individual.  I agree it is healthy for family and friends to aide in the healing/grief process.  Last year I lost my dad, my mother in law and my best friend.  Dad's wake and funeral was the traditional Catholic one.  I gave his eulogy and couldn't help but liven things up with some funny stories about him (to the absolute horror of the priest).  My mother in laws funeral was different.  We totally celebrated her life through music and remembrances.  Dress was casual as she would have wanted.  It was my honor to also give her eulogy.  When the funeral was over, so many people approached my husband and told him that it was the most uplifting funeral they had ever attended.  It's my opinion that while we mourn the passing of anyone, we owe it to them to also celebrate their life so that when family and friends leave, it is with a sense of peace and happiness for the individual.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	One of my good friends died recently of breast cancer and she planned her own funeral. She insisted that there be no sad music and no sad songs. It was to be a celebration of her being lucky enough to go home. This is just the way she lived her life. Strong in her faith  and looking for the good things. I am all for celebrating the wonderful things that people did during their lives. Yes we do grieve because we can no longer enjoy these people but we should thank God that we were able to be with them for whatever time we had.|`|24vQ8D71aa	love it. the idea of celebrating life is so good .i went to a funeral where every body who spoke did so with humour ,it was what she would have wanted (probably asked for it) as she always saw the funny side to things.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	There's no rules for funerals.<br>  It's a lovely tribute.

I have never heard of wearing bright colors to a funeral. However more and more families are having a celebration of life, or pot-lucks, picnics, some sort of gathering. I think since our lives are all so busy having a picnic or celebration of life is a way for everyone including out of town guest to come, relax and sit around and share wonderful memories about the deceased.<br>  Go wear bright colors in honor of your friend. Be blessed that his family wants to celebrate their loss like this.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	They are called " A Celebration of Life" and they go and have a picnic in honor of this persons life. Verses a traditional funeral. We had one for our Mother she did not have aides but she wanted us to give her a Celebration Of Life and we did. They are nice. And did not have a problem with it. We are a Christian Family and we still read from the Bible and had prayer. It was great.|`|hErzvFReaa	I've never been to a wake or funeral like that before, but I personally believe that that is a very healthy way of dealing with death.  Especially for those severally affected by this death.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Ive been to a few, and I like the idea of celebrating their life ,instead of mourning their death.<br>  What person would choose to have all their friends be torn apart and <br>  in tears, at their departure ?<br>  Ok besides my mom.  :-)|`|5UW2P8IMaa	Wakes and funerals are for the living survivors.  They are not for the dead. Such events help us remember the positive factors of the life of the departed.|`|J2SK6YxUaa	it sounds wonderful.(but im kind of hoping my survivors will tear their hair out and throw themselves screaming on my grave.)|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	I think its great!|`|Emk4xuTuaa	No, I haven't- but it sounds like a good idea.|`|0rpN2419aa	I think it is great to wear nice colors to a memorial service.  It brightens what could be a very dreary and sad mood. When I die, I want everyone to enjoy a good time together remember all the fun we had in life, and they can play the tunes of my iPod.  :=)|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I have been to a similar wake but being a traditionalist I prefer the old funeral at church and/or  at graveside and then those who want can come by the home to visit and eat.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I see nothing wrong with celebrating ones life as long as it is done in good taste. That also goes for attire. Black is representative of mourning, and has it's place for those that wish to do so. Ones attire should be respectful but does not mean it must be in black. Our friends and loved ones 'mourn' the fact we will no longer be with them physically. The 28 seasons listed in Ecclesiastes 3:4 tells us there is a 'time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.' Some people mourn in private. My beliefs as a Christian is in knowing that our dearly departed is in the presence of the heavenly Father, and we rejoice. I personally believe a memorial service and dwelling on a persons life  is a wonderful way to celebrate a life well lived. I have attended one 'celebration,' that was done in very good taste. Accentuate the positive I say.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I think it's wonderful, I never wanted to remember any of the people I lost laying in a casket. I don't want a memorial and I intend to be cremated, I'd rather someone fired up the bar-b-cue and iced down some beers and sodas, turned on some of my favorite music and had a good time. I love life and understand we all get to that day we will be going on to what ever your beliefs are, I don't fear it and even though I am disabled I try to enjoy each day.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	My husband was a minister for many years and that is what he always said that funerals should be a celebration of life!  I think that is  a great idea!!|`|xL6zc0bOaa	They are on their way to a better life, and you will see them again.

I'm sorry that you've been sad and even sorrier if you've been particularly hard on yourself.  It's totally normal to feel alone and even depressed.  If you feel like this more than half the time though, you might want to see a doctor.  Depression is a real illness and like any illness, there's medication for it.  I've struggled with insomnia and depression since middle school, and professional treatment really helps.  It can be hard to put yourself out there and deal with people or try to make friends when you're feeling depressed.  You need to work on yourself first.  The improvements in relationships and interpersonal skills comes with personal improvements.  ::hugs and good luck thoughts::|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	I'm hearing you.

yTAXDL5Jaa	You are truelly a women hater, I am so tired of seeing the hate: Read your bible, you are oviously forgetting what God says to men.<br>  Ephecians 5<br>  25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy, cleansing[b] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church— 30for we are members of his body. 31"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh<br>  Colosians 3<br>  19Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them<br>  1 Peter 3<br>  7Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.|`|Op81lhjuaa	Why do you put this verse over God and focus on it? Is there something that happened in your past? We are suppose to preach the entire Bible and not bring the law above God. <br>  <br>  In reference to your verse you always quote please read this!<br>  <br>  <br>  Why would God gift a woman to teach and then forbid to be a pastor?<br>  <br>  This is a common question raised by egalitarians.  They assume that if a woman is gifted in the area of teaching, then she should not be automatically disqualified to be a pastor.<br>  <br>  First of all, the issue isn't whether or not she can teach.  The issue is whether or not women are permitted to hold that position.  It is true that pastors need to be good teachers, but it is not true that anyone who can teach is called to be a pastor.  The requirements for a pastor are stated in Scripture.  He must be male Titus 1:5-6 and the husband of one wife, Titus 1:6.  The issue isn't about teaching ability.  It is about the biblical requirements for holding the office.  Besides, unbelievers are good teachers, too.  Does this mean they can be pastors?  Of course not.  The gift of teaching is only part of being a pastor but that gift alone does not mean a person should or could be one.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  The same logic they use would mean that unbelievers who are good at teaching could be pastors.  But, we know that is not the case because there are other criteria required for being a pastor.  Therefore, the egalitarians should not restrict the requirement set for pastoring to a single issue; namely, teaching.|`|Fzn0ObQoaa	Here is a page I found that you may find interesting about the role of Mormon women in the church and society.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mormon.lds.net/mormon-beliefs/mormon-women" rel="nofollow">http://mormon.lds.net/mormon-beliefs/mor...</a>|`|zp7aW6o7aa	You know very little.  I'm an ex-Mormon and I will say as a fact, I've felt more spiritual women in the Mormon church than men.  Women teach in Sunday School, just as men.<br>  <br>  But as many other religions, they've followed the ways of the world amongst all religions and are as ritualistic as any other religion on earth.  They also interpret the Bible and their Book of Mormon as the rest of the world does.<br>  <br>  One must leave the churches of man and follow God to learn true meaning of scriptures.<br>  <br>  The scriptures you quote above are not of God, but man.  There are two churches represented in the Bible and the Book of Mormon.  Satan's church, which is visible and Gods church which is invisible.  I left the churches of man to join Gods invisible church of the firstborn, where God truly is and we are taught by Jesus through the Holy Spirit.  We shall be called his new Jerusalem up his return.  The truth is within you if you open your mind and heart to God and leave the ways of the world behind and the teachings of man.  One must have the spirit of truth to differentiate between the two churches.  The world hasn't grasped that idea yet.|`|klq9rOjOaa	Myself and my family is a Mormon, and we do not believe in these scriptures you have there.|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	yes|`|uvCMpIilaa	i dont believe its quoted from the bible...
AA12360689	You are right.  It will be a wonderful privilege to be there and teach all those resurrected ones about Jehovah God and all the wonderful things he has done and will yet do for mankind.|`|zp7aW6o7aa	It will not take a thousand years, for thousands of years has passed since the words John wrote.<br>  <br>  It's happening now, as God is teaching his chosen and those who follow him as Christ did.  They shall be called the new Jerusalem.  Rev, 3; 12.<br>  <br>  Those who overcome the rituals of man and follow God as Moses and Jesus did, they shall become free of all the world in a way that is indescribable in words.<br>  <br>  If one studies the Bible and others books, through the spirit, they will learn the ills of our society and the world that follow false prophets.<br>  <br>  There is two churches within the Bible and scriptural works.  One of Satan, who's churches are visible and Gods only church which is within, or invisible.  The apostle Paul knew this, but even in our times many follow men over God.<br>  <br>  Ones faith must be in God and not men, and one shall be baptized in the Holy Ghost without the laying on of hand, for Christ shall baptise as John the Baptist said.  "But he who is greater than I shall baptize in the Holy Spirit."<br>  <br>  Yet, the world follows the ways of men.<br>  <br>  Satan has been turned loose for the short season, before Christ's return which is closer than you think, and very few shall be left, but the world will become much eviler than it is at this time.  It's just beginning.  Christ shall return within all the kayos and turmoil throughout the world, and he shall be feared and rejected by those of the world as Peter rejected him three times in one evening.  So shall it happen again.<br>  <br>  For truth is within God,not men. Read Ezekiel 14, 7-11.  See what God thinks of those who ask men about him.  We are to learn of God from God.  God will mislead, so-called worldly prophets, for God is a jealous God.  Yet not many will believe even this simple truth.|`|QNE6c77yaa	The truth will set you free.

You DO take after him in your thinking, after all!<br>  <br>  Satan is desperately trying to get people to deny God's existence so that they would serve and worship him, instead.<br>  <br>  But just remember, satan, and all those who follow in his path, will be "cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, where the fire never dies, and the worm (i.e. the people there) never die."<br>  <br>  You choose the path you want to follow - the broad way or the narrow way; but you can not choose the destination of the path.  Jesus said that the broad way leads to perdition, but the narrow path leads to life.  Jesus said "I am the door.  Any one trying to enter by any other means will be treated as a thief and a robber, and be cast out into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth!"|`|iblT1HJpaa	You twisted that around very nicely!<br>  You forget that people the world over and for all time have asked the elemental question -"Why am I here?" The answer is not to be found within ourselves, but without. It is to the heavens that the answer flows.<br>  GOd has instilled within us this craving, this desire, to know what is our existence and in that pursuit, people will come to believe in ANYTHING!

Mankind will always believe that there is some force or forces above, around, and through everything physical and non-physical. Including me. People do often adhere to formulated crystallised religious conceptions about who or what God Is. There are many reasons to Why, but a few would be, that it is easier to follow, than it is to lead ones own life to source power. Some just don't know where to start, like my self at one point. <br>  <br>  Religion can be a platform from where we can learn more about the existence of a  supra super being. And as we grow in our awareness of who we are in relation to this force, we usually begin to construct personal spiritual conceptions. I think  religion provides a safety net for those who need, and are dependant on others for guidance. I am not a religious person my self, but I am a connected to source power. But it was religion that initially pointed me in the right direction. <br>  <br>  Ultimate truth will always lead one to the source, which makes the truth possible to exist. It is an energy that melds with other energies that creates a physical realm, from where we can interpret the physical form, that energy manifests. We interpret our own energy though thoughts and emotions and  deduce how this correlates to other energies in physical form where we construct our own conceptions of truth. Everything is energy, everything is source, everything is God. It does not mater what people choose to call it, as long as they realise, that it is a power source, that sustains the whole of existence. Bless you!|`|oiB4KATuaa	I guess believing in God for me, means believing in the good and trying to be good, its not because I'm trying to make a deal with him ie I believe in you so you get me into Heaven!

If the truth is that God does exist then nobody would forget about God, his religion, savior or holy book. Your question links all religion as one therefore that renders your question as baseless. Against popular belief not all religions are the same. Jesus' statements and truths are hardly found in any christian religion anymore and the majority of other religions just use bastardized snippets of his statements and truths. Well to answer your question NO people do not believe in God because they have nothing else to believe in. They believe in God because they have had a real experience with him or are afraid of death or hell.|`|03k5qduQaa	My time on this forum has taught me a little. What is God? remains unanswered, and if responded is as many things to his many followers according their individual understanding. It is time humanity mature for a better word than evolved, learn to think independently as one will. Mankind aren’t able to do this if they know not their beginning or where life’s journey ends. <br>  <br>  If evolution is to be belived, humanity evolved from animals and worms. There is no moral purpose or explanation given as to what is will, why there is need, what brings peace and why does the forbidden tempt. It disallows mankind to think, sometimes understandable as evidenced here, silence is preferable to haphazard opinionating on matter we have less than limited knowledge of. <br>  <br>  Creationism defines a far glorious picture. Humanity was born from a thought, the original neuron, atom, molecule. The original primates shared a collective conscience or intelligence and will. Superhuman beings, strong, beautiful and peaceably content for being so. This nirvanic stratum was invaded by an atom of hate, of carnal nature embodied as sin, corrupting the perfect equilibrium, the unity and harmony and thereafter casting man into a web of confusion, chaos and suffering. Toil and learning became his lot as he endeavoured to return to the all knowing self sufficient universal individual he was in the beginning. This being life’s purpose, journey and goal.<br>  <br>  The positive and the negative, love and hate, good and evil virtue and sin all in conflict battling for dominance and the liberating power of will power brings. Man is a mishmash, an entangled micro circuit of the two will and forces battling to survive. Defeat at the will of sin gives rise to demands for so called right and freedoms otherwise denied to the unevolved. Tolerance of the sinful or battle to eliminate this life threatening state of conflict brings warfare and battling. In warfare and battle mode the good are required to suppress their humanity whilst the wicked don mantles and invade the sanctums of the good, and good is compromised thereby.<br>  <br>  The Saint or Messiah able to stand up to sin, be immune against the scandalous lure of debauchery and lead humanity again to their original state of utopia is the Victor, all else defeated. Who would be God when only the blissfully unaware are able to love such a megalomaniac, irrational, immoral, wicked and himself oppressed by evil or unable to fight it for his own dual nature or misplaced loyalty.<br>  <br>  Freedom of the spirit comes when we are liberated from, attachment to any need be it worldly or of God. Become the self sufficient, self counselled, united strong race as the creator created, and you find God within. One must know who he was to charter a course to his own source and core and to himself thereby, in doing so you release you God in kind ....|`|WapXyZwUaa	people believe in god because of a complex bunch of reasons that none of us understand fully.  i think people do believe in god because without that we would have nothing or maybe everything depending on your point of view, on the one hand we have freedom from god and all his rules and stuff on the other hand we are still prisoners of mortality. the fact that we know we will die is one reason to motivate us to believe in god and an afterlife because god solves the problem of death, with god we become immortal, at least that's what they believe. its a remedy to death.<br>  i think there is no ultimate answer, unless u make one up.|`|ZwECcnh1aa	I believe that to know the truth and the answer to all questions is to know God.

Also like cristians, they're born into the beleif, and probably like many other religions.|`|sohnrZDcaa	Not really... some die hard Christians will be faithful to Jesus no matter how fictitious or how gross the real story of Jesus may be! It is a brainwashing issue!<br>  <br>  You probably heard the name of "SLAUGHTER HOUSE RELIGION" given to Christianity. ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the “salvation” package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have “eternal life” <br>  <br>  John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you (DUCK!), Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>  <br>  It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the Host* (*wafer) and Wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL Meat and Holy Blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews! I AM NOT KIDDING!<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died… hey… any little bit of Mafia talk helps to shape the faith as Christians go!).<br>  <br>  The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldn’t stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus’ meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit as the dignified “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world” while grotesquely hanging totally naked nailed to a Holy Cross! There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record, either. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy man’s death hanging from his 2 nailed hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses about the philosophy of life like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the fact that only a bunch of perverts could have possibly dreamed up a religion like Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus’ spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die! <br>  <br>  There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it can’t be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a “God” who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to God’s chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. That’s why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and what’s even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on God’s chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious people’s attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!) <br>  <br>  The story of Jesus was written long after he died (if he ever existed!). He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus Christ’s gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the “Kingdom’s sake!” Many “witches” and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google “Salem witches” and “castrati” in Wikipedia!) So good luck to all of you Christians in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction… or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says in perfect King James English, “Thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!”
sohnrZDcaa	The wanking Bible writers ought to know what they had in mind!<br>  <br>  There is and always was free will in Heaven!!! According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven during the first week of creation with all the angels, 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s beauty and holiness. They rebelled against God on the SPOT and became demons along with Lucifer or Light Bearer who became known as Satan, The Devil, and so on. Lucifer is the most beautiful angel ever created! IMHO this is a major glitch in God’s Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! God was very busy creating the rest of the Universe and Hell to do anything about this rebellion right away so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the “Tribulation Period” after the Rapture? Most Preachers follow this primitive Bible script and claim that this event will take place any time soon! NOWHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE of over 70,000,000,000 light years wide with a corresponding astronomical number of galaxies like our Milky Way there is going to be a single demon stranded in any planet anywhere, but they will all be here on this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with “fire and sulfur” for ever and ever along with all sinners and those who never got to hear about “Jesus”! Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen...!? Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth…! (Please forgive my Christian hangover...!!! I can't stop “praising the LORD,” yet...)<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT<br>  <br>  So up to the “End of the World” SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information on their input DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to do it to this very day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! No angel has the power to hurt Satan! (Jude 1:9).<br>  <br>  It is a shame that not even one single “Guardian Angel” was available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. Considering that God Loves humankind so much and Eve was so innocent going about TOTALLY NAKED and ignorant about any evil issue like eating a forbidden fruit that if left hanging on the tree will eventually fall on its own and rot! God was very negligent not to provide a "Guardian Angel" like we see in so many cartoons trying to wise up the person undergoing the little Devil's temptation. The wanking Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell “prepared for Satan and his angels” (Mat. 25:41).  So in their Bible script they let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of an ignorant and FULLY INNOCENT woman! It was a set up! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her “eyes were opened and realized that she was naked!” The story has GOD setting up Eve so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it to be that way “before the foundation of the world” because God's pleasure was to sacrifice his "only begotten Son Jesus Christ" to fix his own screw ups!<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:19-20 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  WHO VERILY WAS FOREORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!* (*for “God’s sake!” how moron do you need to be to be a Christian?!!! I am sure that the wanking perverts who wrote the Bible never imagined the success that their work was going to have on the bulk of humanity!) <br>  <br>  About 1,000 Bible years after the “Creation Week” more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2) – This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be either very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish so they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their GOD ENDOWED sexual cravings. GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy in Heaven hardly 1,000 Bible years after the first angelical rebellion!  So the male angels had to look elsewhere to satisfy their God created sexual cravings… and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same virtual God put together by the Bible writers! The Bible writers even say that without gullibility or rather FAITH (spiritually speaking) it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible “as they were led by God the Holy Ghost”! In fact they claimed that they didn’t know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  There ought to be some higher schooling teaching how religions function in real life environment, especially Christianity! I imagine that Islam is easier to explain, but I was not a Muslim! Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about like the Muslims expect their mullahs to tell them all about Allah and Mohammed! The classical “When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know” is what makes Christianity so thriving! As far as learning or finding out where or how we came about to be religious people have it all figured out! I went to Christian College and I honestly read and taught the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard of the Bible, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, “HOLY CRAP!” It is amazing all the human excrement* (*sh*t) that a low IQ Christian, Mormon, JW, Muslim or what have you must believe to go to a place that doesn’t exist outside of the Bible or the Koran!|`|GYkfqnMfaa	I think in many ways, Satan is actually a heroic sort.

I dont buy into what creation scientists say so why would I care to acknowledge them?  <br>  Now what I care about is what Rush ( the republican guy ) is saying on behalf of all republicans.|`|146MzXiTaa	wouldn't an all powerful creator have the foresight and intelligence to give its creation the ability to adapt and evolve according to it's surroundings?|`|xSdnsSojaa	I suppose ironic would be one way to describe it.

Anyone with half a brain would know evolution is fact :)|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"yes"|`|hSy8ZKRXaa	Since when has rational thinking ever been a tool of the creationists?|`|W31kTFUSaa	FO SHO.|`|WF085j2Daa	Ironic? I think its hilarious|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  Even the churches find them ridiculous!!|`|26DoxkOBaa	I don't reject evolution, I reject Darwinism which rejects the notion of an intelligent designer simply because it can't be proved. It's one thing to admit ignorance about why evolution even got started or why anything exists at all, and another to say that God.doesn't exists. Science doesn't go that far, because they are ignorant and don't know, but you atheist do and so you're not scientific and irrational, aren't you?|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Yep.   They can't observe any of their idea at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  But of course it has been observed both in the lab and in nature to the point of speciation.|`|SYcYoxfMaa	Hugo - <br>  <br>  I have never seen ANYBODY come back from the dead...and I'm pretty sure nobody else has, either.|`|YUAegpPoaa	Oh Pot!<br>  <br>  Come here and give Kettle a big kiss!|`|nyqoPvL2aa	Actually, creationists reject evolution because it says that we are fundamentally animals. Whereas the Bible claim we are fundamentally different from animals (made in God's image, and all that nonsense). So basically they try to come up with reasons to reject evolution in order to avoid admitting that their egos are attached to this notion of their superiority.<br>  Get into a real debate about evolution with most any hardcore Christian, and eventually they'll fall back to the line, "You don't really think that we were once just monkeys???". That's it in a nutshell...|`|AA11946554	Wow. So much denial and misunderstanding.<br>  Since whoever these people are, they have one question (some more insane than others-ergo, Hugo) and the WHOLE theory is 'wrong' Ha!<br>  I've been reading about evolution and one thing I see that many of these 'deniers' don't understand is that an organism CHANGES (ie-evolves) according to it's surroundings. Scientists have noticed that some birds and flowers are changing/evolving already b/c of climate change. There is no 'ultimate goal'. Their DNA changes to adjust.<br>  There's hope for some...|`|2tf60aRSaa	We don't reject evolution for that reason. But I'm glad you are beginning to admit that evolution and atheism is comparable religious belief.|`|AA12022384	If they really believe this then they must also deny that gravity exists, funny how they never mention this.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Oh, you mean that creationists are hypocritical?<br>  <br>  Boy what a surprise.|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	They're nothing if not consistently contradictory.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	what a beautiful Irony!|`|WHJDbvmEaa	There you go... right down the slippery slope of rational thinking again... lol

I just asked my father who is a doctor.|`|fjsczTsMaa	Well unless the person was 14 years old, that is very underweight. I don't think it would look really abnormal, though.<br>  <br>  A healthy adult female should weight between 120-140lbs at that height, according to the most recent medical advice.|`|SzJhlR2Aaa	No! Don't be one of those girls that worries aout their looks (at least until you weigh like 300 pounds.) I think you are at a pretty average weight. It is actually better to be heavier than a stick. Anyway, you are at a good weight, and I am sure you are a pretty girl.|`|W0kDKnYCaa	sounds sexy to me, but I personally like what a person is inside more so than the outside. Eye candy is great but can be very deceiving.

I've seen some women go into such a rage I almost peed myself.

eHzJjeqKaa	wouldn't you like to know ;)<br>  <br>  haha|`|zc47c39daa	Hehehe, do you mean like attitude wise? <br>  Ex: Why are you such a witch all the time! <br>  Or<br>  Ex: Yeah, I'm a witch- I practice witchcraft.<br>  <br>  That's like me saying all men are pigs. -cough- <br>  <br>  Uhm, no- not all women are witches. There's many faiths or practices that make a person a witch, not just witchcraft. But that's a common example of someone who can claim to be a witch- they practice and study witchcraft..<br>  <br>  There are no supernatural powers and we don't fly on broom sticks or any of that. I can't point and say Hocus Pocus! TURN INTO A LOCUS! .. No, no- doesn't work like that.<br>  <br>  I actually practice Wicca, and like some people will say, it's not some devil worshipping religion. It's a nature based religion, but there are many varieties.<br>  <br>  Those powers and such are really just people projecting energy from themselves, energy from the elements, earth, etc into chants or merely just the law of attraction.. But that's not all that it's limited to.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped you with your question.|`|rZUThLfMaa	o yes. defiantly. so watch ur back bud, and i heard if you wear a necklace of fruit loops around your neck at all time us "witches" cant come near you :)|`|QVWwls11aa	NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I mean no.|`|GKHNm3Svaa	nope someone has to choose to follow the path of a " witch"|`|ztzEloj5aa	If i tell you you have to promise not to tell anyone...<br>  This answer has been plaguing men for centuries...<br>  the answer... is no|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I'm not secretly a witch - plenty of people know I am one.<br>  <br>  But not all women are, no.  Only those who actually practice witchcraft.<br>  <br>  And I have no "supernatural" powers - magic is working with natural energies to create desired change.|`|bMuwuAVOaa	Everyone has a bit of the magic about them. Men, women boys,girls and even the tiny infant child has the ability to evoke angles. In our everyday life we wish and ask for things to happen when the world seems against us. What driver has never spoken aloud in his/her car that if they could only find an opening they could merge and make that off ramp heading home/work? Or even asking for a decent parking space only to have one open up upon the request. Wishing someone in casual conversation to have a good day upon parting is another example of the magic that we all seek to use almost all of the time. So the answer to your question is NO! We are all very openly using magic in our lives everyday. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|oTwymgpIaa	Not unless the majority of women are secretly unaware of it. ;-)|`|IPAdOJ4Naa	"no"|`|na8ObA5Haa	i wish i was haha|`|VvRHin1Jaa	nope
CTSYw8yaaa	It is only my considered opinion,bit I would say that the use of the  term  "Agnostic Christian" - Born Again or not - would be a Contradiction in terms.However,you have not indicated what a Born Again Agnostic Christian would have to believe,and how you propose to attract a sufficient following?|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It is not required of us to fast them, but voluntary.<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said, "That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I received Revelation.''<br>  [Muslim].<br>  <br>  Commentary:  This Hadith points out the excellence of fasting on Mondays. The reason behind this, as is stated in the Hadith, is that the Prophet (PBUH) was born on it and that it was the day on which he received the first Revelation. It coincided with the 17th Ramadan as well.<br>  <br>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Deeds of people are presented (to Allah) on Mondays and Thursdays.

XAioHGKbaa	Sex all day|`|T9xbywGPaa	International Woman's Day (IWD) is marked on March 8 every year. It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women.<br>  <br>  Started as a political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries (primarily Russia and the countries of former Soviet bloc). In some celebrations, the day lost its political flavour, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love to the women around them in a way somewhat similar to Mother's Day and St Valentine's Day mixed together. In others, however, the political and human rights theme as designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner.<br>  <br>  Didn't even know there was such a day.  Going to be doing the normal crap. Not a big deal for most, is it?

Fossilization is a pretty specific process. We're lucky we've found as much as we have.<br>  <br>  "Yet after over one hundred years of intense searching only a small number of transitional candidates are touted as proof of evolution. If evolution has really taken place, where are the transitional forms?"<br>  <br>  Ambulocetus. Tiktaalik. Orohippus. Theraspids. There are very many examples of what you would call "transitional forms." However that's a misnomer. ALL forms are transitional.<br>  <br>  "And why does the fossil record actually show all species first appearing fully formed, with most nearly identical to current instances of the species?"<br>  <br>  It doesn't. Where did you pick up such a piece of blatant misinformation?|`|AA11969509	There are transitional fossils.  The most famous transitional fossils are the "missing links" between man and other apes.  Man does not appear fully formed in the fossil record, he shows up very ape-like in Australopithecus, and then gradually becomes more human like.<br>  <br>  A basic rule in life is:  "Listen to both sides of an argument."

And how do I know? O, yes, if they existed they would have been found already long ago.|`|DwhOX4E2aa	There are thousands of transitional fossils.|`|qLHBfkZjaa	John McCain was not interested in the job.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	1.  There are many transitional fossils. The only way that the claim of their absence may be remotely justified, aside from ignoring the evidence completely, is to redefine "transitional" as referring to a fossil that is a direct ancestor of one organism and a direct descendant of another. However, direct lineages are not required; they could not be verified even if found. What a transitional fossil is, in keeping with what the theory of evolution predicts, is a fossil that shows a mosaic of features from an older and more recent organism.<br>  <br>     2. Transitional fossils may coexist with gaps. We do not expect to find finely detailed sequences of fossils lasting for millions of years. Nevertheless, we do find several fine gradations of fossils between species and genera, and we find many other sequences between higher taxa that are still very well filled out.<br>  <br>        The following are fossil transitions between species and genera:<br>  <br>           1. Human ancestry - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC050.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC...</a> . There are many fossils of human ancestors, and the differences between species are so gradual that it is not always clear where to draw the lines between them.<br>  <br>           2. The horns of titanotheres (extinct Cenozoic mammals) appear in progressively larger sizes, from nothing to prominence. Other head and neck features also evolved. These features are adaptations for head-on ramming analogous to sheep behavior (Stanley 1974).<br>  <br>           3. A gradual transitional fossil sequence connects the foraminifera Globigerinoides trilobus and Orbulina universa (Pearson et al. 1997). O. universa, the later fossil, features a spherical test surrounding a "Globigerinoides-like" shell, showing that a feature was added, not lost. The evidence is seen in all major tropical ocean basins. Several intermediate morphospecies connect the two species, as may be seen in the figure included in Lindsay (1997).<br>  <br>           4. The fossil record shows transitions between species of Phacops (a trilobite; Phacops rana is the Pennsylvania state fossil; Eldredge 1972; 1974; Strapple 1978).<br>  <br>           5. Planktonic forminifera (Malmgren et al. 1984). This is an example of punctuated gradualism. A ten-million-year foraminifera fossil record shows long periods of stasis and other periods of relatively rapid but still gradual morphologic change.<br>  <br>           6. Fossils of the diatom Rhizosolenia are very common (they are mined as diatomaceous earth), and they show a continuous record of almost two million years which includes a record of a speciation event (Miller 1999, 44-45).<br>  <br>           7. Lake Turkana mollusc species (Lewin 1981).<br>  <br>           8. Cenozoic marine ostracodes (Cronin 1985).<br>  <br>           9. The Eocene primate genus Cantius (Gingerich 1976, 1980, 1983).<br>  <br>          10. Scallops of the genus Chesapecten show gradual change in one "ear" of their hinge over about 13 million years. The ribs also change (Pojeta and Springer 2001; Ward and Blackwelder 1975).<br>  <br>          11. Gryphaea (coiled oysters) become larger and broader but thinner and flatter during the Early Jurassic (Hallam 1968). <br>  <br>        The following are fossil transitionals between families, orders, and classes:<br>  <br>           1. Human ancestry. Australopithecus, though its leg and pelvis bones show it walked upright, had a bony ridge on the forearm, probably vestigial, indicative of knuckle walking (Richmond and Strait 2000).<br>  <br>           2. Dinosaur-bird transitions - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC214.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC...</a> .<br>  <br>           3. Haasiophis terrasanctus is a primitive marine snake with well-developed hind limbs. Although other limbless snakes might be more ancestral, this fossil shows a relationship of snakes with limbed ancestors (Tchernov et al. 2000). Pachyrhachis is another snake with legs that is related to Haasiophis (Caldwell and Lee 1997).<br>  <br>           4. The jaws of mososaurs are also intermediate between snakes and lizards. Like the snake's stretchable jaws, they have highly flexible lower jaws, but unlike snakes, they do not have highly flexible upper jaws. Some other skull features of mososaurs are intermediate between snakes and primitive lizards (Caldwell and Lee 1997; Lee et al. 1999; Tchernov et al. 2000).<br>  <br>           5. Transitions between mesonychids and whales - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC216_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC...</a> .<br>  <br>           6. Transitions between fish and tetrapods - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC212.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC...</a> .<br>  <br>           7. Transitions from condylarths (a kind of land mammal) to fully aquatic modern manatees. In particular, Pezosiren portelli is clearly a sirenian, but its hind limbs and pelvis are unreduced (Domning 2001a, 2001b).<br>  <br>           8. Runcaria, a Middle Devonian plant, was a precursor to seed plants. It had all the qualities of seeds except a solid seed coat and a system to guide pollen to the seed (Gerrienne et al. 2004).<br>  <br>           9. A bee, Melittosphex burmensis, from Early Cretaceous amber, has primitive characteristics expected from a transition between crabronid wasps and extant bees (Poinar and Danforth 2006). <br>  <br>        The following are fossil transitionals between kingdoms and phyla:<br>  <br>           1. The Cambrian fossils Halkiera and Wiwaxia have features that connect them with each other and with the modern phyla of Mollusca, Brachiopoda, and Annelida. In particular, one species of halkieriid has brachiopod-like shells on the dorsal side at each end. This is seen also in an immature stage of the living brachiopod species Neocrania. It has setae identical in structure to polychaetes, a group of annelids. Wiwaxia and Halkiera have the same basic arrangement of hollow sclerites, an arrangement that is similar to the chaetae arrangement of polychaetes. The undersurface of Wiwaxia has a soft sole like a mollusk's foot, and its jaw looks like a mollusk's mouth. Aplacophorans, which are a group of primitive mollusks, have a soft body covered with spicules similar to the sclerites of Wiwaxia (Conway Morris 1998, 185-195).<br>  <br>           2. Cambrian and Precambrain fossils Anomalocaris and Opabinia are transitional between arthropods and lobopods - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC220.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC...</a> .<br>  <br>           3. An ancestral echinoderm has been found that is intermediate between modern echinoderms and other deuterostomes (Shu et al. 2004).|`|FI916ISFaa	crocoduck|`|yYYXVCGZaa	scientists, paleontologists, and anthropologists find new transitional fossils all the time and there are many on display in museums around the world.  however, because bone, skin and soft organs are subject to the forces of nature and erosion and decay, finding ANY ancient fossils is pure luck in the first place.  but the fact that we have SO many and that YOU don't know about them, is PROOF that you don't want to see them.   pull you head out of your *** and your bible for one second and do some actual reading and learning about evolution and you will immediately see that it is true.  i know, i know...the truth hurts!  oh, and by the way, evolution NEVER stops, it continues as we speak...|`|vxSXsn59aa	Every fossil ever dug up, and those still in the ground, is transitional. Everything that ever lived was transitional. You who misunderstand the theory always seem to think that we should be finding lizards with wings, or some such. It doesn't work quite like that.|`|cAnha6sjaa	Damn, you're right. Those clods with Ph.D's who've been telling us evolution is a proven-beyond-any-doubt fact just didn't notice that.<br>  <br>  Good thing a home-schooled DaVinci such as yourself came along and showed us the way.<br>  <br>  Tell me, do you think Adam and Eve rode dinosaurs to church?|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Okay, let me first ask you something. What IS a transitional fossil? What characteristics would you expect to see on a transitional fossil that are missing from other fossils?<br>  <br>  Well?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're starting to see what I'm getting at here. You're talking about 'transitional fossils' as if they are somehow fundamentally different from other kinds of fossils, as if there are both 'true species' of organisms that existed at various points in time as well as merely 'transitional species' which are there only to serve as links between the true species. This is not the case. In order for a species to have any descendants in the first place, that species HAS to be viable, it HAS to be a fully formed, fully developed, fully functional type of organism that is capable of thriving in its environment, because everything else simply dies out. There is no special characteristic of a species that it is 'transitional' while other species aren't; ALL species that have both different ancestors and different descendants are 'transitional', and so are the species before them, and the species after them. You could take any cycle of 'true, transitional, true, transitional, true, transitional' and offset it by 180 degrees and it would still make just as much sense; in fact, I could point at many present-day species (including humans) and call them 'transitional' and, unless they were about to die out, there would be no way for you to demonstrate otherwise. Evolution simply doesn't care about your ridiculous creationistic concept of 'transitional'; it is a metaphysical law and it works on everything, all the time, whether you like it or not.<br>  <br>  Now, if you wish to repost your question in terms that take the above facts into account, feel free to do so. However, your question in its current form is loaded and I don't intend to attempt to provide you with a type of fossil that in evolutionary terms doesn't really exist.

THonpuVGaa	For me, that the police department immediately set in motion their defence...an attempt to say 'This was a one off'' - these policemen were squeeky-clean'.  Yes, a department should support its staff - but, only if they deserve that support.<br>  All the time I read of cases in the police, the local authority, the hospitals where incompetent staff are allowed to work and when they cause harm (even death) - there is a cover-up.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, as a UK citizen watching American tv programmes about the police I am alarmed at how often the mob of policemen seem to be out of control, over-excited and manage to create a drama where no drama exists. (and since the programme is being shown on tv their behaviour must meet with department approval) I especially hate when they are all kneeling on a suspect and yelling - 'Give me your hands' or 'Stop resisting' when the suspect is unable to comply because of the position they are in - I heard one poor chap yelling when they used the 'stop resisting' bit - 'I can't breath'  ...wouldn't you struggle in those circumstances?|`|n9hRyHpqaa	It is disgusting, utterly disgusting..|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	Reenie,  much as I hate to say it....

101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	Let me get this straight.<br>  You see there's no toilet paper, and rather than taking it upon yourself to look for some, you wake him up like a helpless child?<br>  THEN you use a TOWEL?<br>  <br>  Grow up, already. <br>  <br>  Everyone runs out or forgets to put a new roll on at one time or another.  It happens to the nicest people.<br>  You wiping your butt on a towel is where the line was crossed.<br>  <br>  That's my view anyway.<br>  <br>  And no, I wouldn't have woken him up. I would have looked for a new roll (and put in on the roller for him, too), and if I didn't find one, I would have dripped dry, and in the morning I would have mentioned that I couldn't find any toilet paper.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I don't see why forgetting to change a roll of TP makes someone a SLOB.  Maybe he is one, but I wouldn't make that judgement based soley upon him not changing out the TP.<br>  Also, how well do YOU do, temper-wise, when woken from a deep sleep?  Even the nicest person can be very grumpy in such a situation, especially when you are woken up by a grown woman because she can't be bothered to LOOK FOR A NEW ROLL OF TOILET PAPER HERSELF.<br>  <br>  Yeah. That'd tick me off.<br>  And to then be told the peron used a towel, hell, I'd just kick you our of my place right then and there.|`|m5ViQJPeaa	That depends, but mostly I won't wake him up. I'll let him have a good sleep. BUT in your case, well.. um... isn't that a bit immature? To have waken up in a sleep by your girlfriend because there's no toilet paper is not a thing to get mad of.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I would've just drip dried and went back to bed. But if he's going to get that mad about waking him up then you're better off.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Next time if it happens, just wipe your bum on their underwear that is lying on the floor. He'll think he left skid-marks!|`|7Es1LjvHaa	Well there's two points I would address here:<br>  <br>  Firstly, the pair of you are both 'grown up' adults, right??<br>  <br>  So did you NOT think PRIOR to you toilet activity to check for whether there was any toilet paper available in the bathroom????????<br>  <br>  No, so you end up using one of his towels which comes across as petty and pretty immature.<br>  <br>  I reckon, if that was me and I was woken out of my sleep for that, I probably would have given you a piece of my mind as well. Infact, I probably would have considered giving you the elbow. I'ts gross!<br>  <br>  My second point is this: If the guy is going to behave like a SLOB then you both need to communicate openly and set ground rules.<br>  <br>  Writing this I think is really pathetic and it seems to me the neither one of you really have any idea of domestics and what it entails to ensure smooth operation of day to day managing of the house.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's down to both the guy and the girl to work at this and in an ideal world, both couples would be understanding towards on another and wouldn't go through the measure of waking somebody up in the middle of their sleep - cheers.|`|X0Hg9iPLaa	hes a dick for that. i would of pulled out a clean nice dress shirt and wiped your vag with it. he might like it you never know. just do it. it would be a personal joke for you|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Sure I would.If he got mad because of that, I would have used more than a towel. What a jerk.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	9 out of 10 times there is a spare roll in the bathroom...if he got mad because you woke him up? your better off without him
BJu1GAs8aa	yes?|`|d3998dd190c3bb13f8787689fd589a7eaa	was this all a dream or that part where they think you stole the item is real?   if it is real, yes they would do that and it is a good idea to comply.  if it was a dream, then you should slap her in the face and see what happens since its just a dream =)
c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	because being Catholic is foreign to them and so - instead of learning it's easier to feign ignorance.  most people have been told it's not by others they respect and so - to come to the understanding it's as Christian as any other protestant or baptism organization would mean - that person they respect was wrong.<br>  people don't like to be wrong and so they stay ignorant.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - see you get people like WOWgirl and just shake your head. no matter how many times someone may tell her - we don't worship any other than God -- she wants to stay in her own world. in the world someone gave her that she probably trusts/respects and yet - she is wrong and it makes her look ignorant & unwilling to learn.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Plenty of Protestants learned anti-Catholic bias from their churches.  My church just taught that their doctrine was weird and probably non-Biblical but no one in the church went so far as to say that Catholics aren't Christians.  Apparently that has changed now and fundie pastors have decided that they're God and entitled to say who is or is not Christian.<br>  <br>  Once we got to high school we were taught not to date Catholics because if we married a Catholic we'd have to turn over our children to the Church.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I think they believe that because they don't understand the Catholic church nor do they want to take the time to understand it.  Too, there are a lot of preachers out there with their own agendas that seem to have to have an enemy, so the Catholic church gets targeted.  The only reasons I can think of stem back to when the protestants (Lutherans and Anglicans) split from the church.  They didn't necessarily say things about it, but I imagine some of the more fanatical people started up rumors and lies that have stayed with us throughout history.|`|93galWG1aa	Scripture is written in such a way that there are stumbling blocks for everyone who does not follow the teaching of Christ's church.<br>  They refuse the bread of life without knowing where this demonic doctrine of symbolism comes from, they attack the church which Christ said he who does not listen too does not listen to me.<br>  The ignorance of scripture and Catholic teaching is beyond reason, but they ignore the fact that Catholics do not worship Mary and every thing else that is scriptural about our Faith they ignore in blind ignorance of what Jesus and his Church taught.<br>  If you are not for me your against me, they fight Christ!<br>  The Fathers taught the meaning of the gates of hell will never prevail against the church is to been seen as meaning Heresy, this is what you find out side of the Catholic faith, yet it never prevailed against Christ's Church as we follow tradition as it has been handed down.<br>  And have you heard the sermons given by some pastors ? seems all they preach is hate.<br>  God bless.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Catholics accept other religions. We believe that there are many good religions, but that not all religions are created equal.

This seems to be true of most of the older churches including the Orthodox church and even in the newer Anglican, Presbyterian and Luthern churches. If you go back to the New Testiment, read Christs teachings and the very foundation of the purpose of the church, you will see that Catholicism even seems to be the opposite of what is taught.|`|syBBnsCAaa	They says it's not Christian for two reasons ;<br>  <br>  - the are bigots who can't accept anyone different<br>  - its easier to say "they aren't Christian" then to accept that Catholics may have a valid point of view, based on the Bible and earlier Christian teachings (early Christian teachings being profoundly Catholic)|`|OeAfpIZAaa	They have a Sola Scriptura-sticker in their brains.<br>  <br>  Sola Scriptura vs. Sacred Tradition.<br>  <br>  That is all, there is to this nonsense.<br>  <br>  And then there is ignorance as demonstrated by WOWgirl.<br>  <br>  WOWgirl: You are either ignorant or uneducated.<br>  <br>  They do not worship the saints or Mary.|`|AcLjARwyaa	Becaqsue if they did not say that they would have to join.  therei is deep seated biases from years of beliveing untruths.

An example is the uncovered abuse of  young boys by the priests about 5 years ago sort of made a bad name for the Church.<br>  <br>  What people don't realize is the majority of Catholic followers are more or less decent people like the rest of us. Groups such as Atheists hold a lot of skepticism for the Church and the Bible. A lot focus on the bad times and try to pinpoint holes in the Bible's teachings, when we should focus on the things Jesus taught us and how he died for us. <br>  <br>  The other denominations such as Protestantism (which I am) are simply groups that have similar beliefs with the Catholics, but want to worship in a different way from them. However, if all Christians/non Christians are good people, we should be able to get along and not hold grudges against one Church or another.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Ignorance, mostly.  Intolerance, prejudice, holier-than-thou attitude, elitism and hatred none of which is of God.  <br>  <br>  Bible Christians don't even know where the Bible came from.  They come across as if the Bible dropped from Heaven one day already bound, printed and translated into English exclusively into their hands.  We would not even have a Christian Bible were it not for the original, authentic Christian Church that gave birth to the Bible (as a teaching tool) 400 years after Christ.  This is historically factual, the Catholic Church gave birth to the Bible, the Bible did NOT give birth to the Catholic Church.  <br>  <br>  Bible thumping preachers don't even realize why the Bible is the word of God or that the Bible does not make this claim for itself.  The Prologue to the Gospel of St. John declares that Jesus is the Word of God.  It was the Catholic Church who compiled the Christian Bible and declared it to be in its entirety, all 73 Books, the Written Word of God, no one else.  <br>  <br>  Non-Catholic Christians confuse fellowship/prayer for 'worship' and falsely accuse Catholics of idolatry when they fail to understand the true nature of worship in the first place.  Worship is 'sacrifice' and if one is not receiving the Body and Blood of Christ, the Sacrifice to end all sacrifices then all he is having is 'feel-good' fellowship. <br>  <br>  Finally, all these fail to understand that hatred is not of God, nor is the spirit of rebellion the Spirit of God.  Error entered the True Church and the spirit of rebellion followed and so today we have countless denominations that call themselves 'Christian' rather than One True Church established by Jesus Christ as His Teaching Office 2,000+ years ago.  <br>  <br>  H|`|cfusEJPFaa	The Catholic church was the original Christian Church.  The Catholic church is the only Christian church which places equal weight on traditions and scripture, in the understanding that the traditions passed down from those who knew jesus best offer the lens through which scripture is to be understood.  '<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church IS open to new ideas, but those ideas must be carefully reviewed to ensure that they do not contradict Divine law.  Change is slow, but fast change can lead to heresies and incorrect teachings.  Why is change so necessary? Was the scripture handed down by Christ imperfect?  The Church is not a democracy, but neither is it a tyranny.  Westerners - particularly Americans - view Canon law from an American perspective, where the law means what it says, no exceptions.  A more accurate view - and the view that Rome has - is that the intent of the law is more important than the letter of the law.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Honestly, I think it all goes back to prehistory. Imagine you're a sort of early human. Your tribe is nice and comfy, you know the rules and they're most likely your family members. You all have the same standards of behavior, beliefs about the world around you and/or deities, mode of dress and maybe even similar body markings, jewelry and ways of keeping your hair. You're out foraging for food, walk around a corner and -gasp!- there's a stranger there! In YOUR tribe's territory! You both freeze and stare at each other, hearts pounding, blood re-routed to large muscles to enable the Flight or Fight instinct, pupils dilated to better take in your surroundings, not to mention that stranger. <br>  <br>  This person looks just as strange to you as you look to them. They dress  differently than you. They wear things you don't recognize as jewelry. Their hair may be different than yours. You both have mere moments to determine if that other person is a threat or a potential friend. (Stay with me here, k?)<br>  <br>  What do you think the chances are of thinking that person is a friend if your entire life you've heard "the people from the cave over the hill who wear the two stripes on their left cheek are WRONG and they'll make you be wrong, too. Everyone knows people who aren't dangerous or wrong or bad wear THREE stripes and on their right cheek!"? <br>  <br>  Sadly, that is what it comes down to for the most part. A survival instinct that makes many who are still stuck in prehistory on an intellectual level look at other groups who are "different" from them in appearance or belief system as being inherently flawed, if not outright evil/dangerous. This is their faith's survival technique. By insisting that those two stripe people, or anyone else who didn't have the three stripes on the right side, are evil and making them as wrong and scary as possible with all kinds of dire consequences for even treating them as you would want to be treated, they ensure that the vast majority of the three stripe people would  either run from, or attack, anyone who didn't have the three stripes.  <br>  <br>  In other words - some people need to evolve already.|`|E9chZY74aa	Listen, and I will tell you.  if you were here with me, I would speak softly and gently so as not to hurt you, but I would make sure to tell you the truth.  <br>  There is no Biblical authority for popes, priests, nuns, celibacy, icons, holy water, purgatory, infant baptism, candles, rosaries, cathedrals and other things.  If we desire to worship God as He commanded, then we must do things that are Biblical, only.

FWPSzFVhaa	This can happen - yes.  What is going on is that the meditation allows the true self to become awake and aware.  That true self is actually something much deeper and more total than words can describe.  It is what was before your birth and it will be what remains after your death.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, the mind of yourself holds all the memories and emotions.  It is like a computer database.<br>  <br>  When the true Awareness within you awakens, the true you becomes aware of the database that you think is you.  And it is a sense of eupohoria because it is an awakening.<br>  <br>  Those who are enlightened have that euphoria all the time.  It is a high that can not be described.  And it is a joy that can not be measured.<br>  <br>  **  Also, the difference between emotion and this is that emotions are a result of something.  They are the effect rather than the cause.   Enlightenment is not an effect - it is the cause.  The sight and vision of seeing the whole - of walking through life with eyes wide open- is experienced as you tasted.|`|4nAVWEjhaa	It is called emotions.

Heaven would be hell to an irreligious man. We know how unhappy we are apt to feel at present, when alone in the midst of strangers, or of men of different tastes and habits from ourselves. How miserable, for example, would it be to have to live in a foreign land, among a people whose faces we never saw before, and whose language we could not learn. And this is but a faint illustration of the loneliness of a man of earthly dispositions and tastes, thrust into the society of saints and angels. How forlorn would he wander through the courts of heaven! He would find no one like himself; he would see in every direction the marks {8} of God's holiness, and these would make him shudder. He would feel himself always in His presence. He could no longer turn his thoughts another way, as he does now, when conscience reproaches him. He would know that the Eternal Eye was ever upon him; and that Eye of holiness, which is joy and life to holy creatures, would seem to him an Eye of wrath and punishment. God cannot change His nature. Holy He must ever be. But while He is holy, no unholy soul can be happy in heaven. "|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	If you want to suffer, go right ahead.

Sorry, him or her.  Would you do it?  Would you allow them to kill you, in a heinous manner so that your child could be happy and never fear, be murdered, etc. <br>  <br>  I would in a heart beat and this is what God, Jesus did for us.  All he asks is that we believe.  And one day, everything we need will be provided. <br>  <br>  If you feel you deserve to suffer is it b/c you have done something wrong or is it b/c you feel as though you learn from it.  If it is b/c you have done something wrong and you are trying to make up for it, then my friend, there is good news, Someone already did it for you, you just have to reach for it. <br>  <br>  If you are doing it for learning great.  But, in case that really is your philosophy and you do have a child, let me put your mind at rest.  The Bible says that whoever leads a little child astray, were it better that they were never born.  So, if you have taught your child this, your desire will be granted through eternal suffering. <br>  <br>  Good luck with that.|`|XuO2rTteaa	In heaven, all the interesting people are missing.<br>  -Nietzsche<br>  <br>  Go to heaven for the climate, Well for the company.<br>  -Mark Twain<br>  <br>  Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.<br>  -John Milton|`|eJMOGeRraa	If you think heaven will bad- what do you think hell will be like.......

CjAaOsu2aa	There's this one legend from the 1850's. It goes like this:<br>  <br>  On a full moon, there was a noble man sitting at his window in the castle, looking down into the dark forest. He noticed something large and fast moving among the trees so he called his hunter to go see what it was. The hunter set out into the forest and after a short time he came in contact with a werewolf and they wrestled. The hunter cut off the werewolf's paw with a sword and put it in his pouch to take back to the noble man. When he came back to the castle it was morning. He called for the noble man to see the paw. But when they looked at the paw, it was no longer a wolf's paw, it was a slender white hand. The noble man recognized the ring on the severed hand's finger and went storming into the kitchen where he found his wife healing her bloody stump of an arm. They yelled at each other until she finally admitted she was a werewolf, and she was executed.<br>  <br>  Not a very nice ending but I still like this legend. Werewolves were not regarded as good people back then.|`|fpHblEtAaa	heres a good, scary sad story of a werewolf! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanfolklore.net/folktales/mi3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanfolklore.net/folktale...</a>

p0mczaAsaa	Here are the answers to the best of my knowledge, I hope this helps:<br>  <br>  1. If you're praying home then you just pray at your own pace following the correct way of praying. For fajr it is two Rakaa's.<br>  <br>  2. No you will not get less reward if you pray at home, you will get the full reward inshallah, but if you do pray at the mosque then you do get more rewards because of the extra time and effort it takes you to get there. Each step is counted. But you are getting the full salah reward if you don't go. <br>  <br>  3. The first thing to do when you get angry is say "aa'otho billahi min el shaytan el rajeem" and keep your calm.<br>  <br>  4. best website for accurate prayer times is www.islamicfinder.com and you should click on "download athan". Then you enter your zipcode or the region where you live and your computer will save it so that for each prayer you will hear the athan. Plus you can view all the prayer times for that day.<br>  <br>  I think becoming a better Muslim starts in the heart. but thikir Allah which is saying things like "subhan Allah" "al hamdu lilah" and "la ilaha illa Allah" are good ways to keep you on the path.<br>  <br>  May Allah bless you brother Ahmed.|`|p5cglKf0aa	<a href="http://www.questiononislam.com/subpage.php?s=cat_open&cid=26" rel="nofollow">http://www.questiononislam.com/subpage.p...</a>|`|AA10080642	as-salaamu 'alaikum warahmatullaahi wabarakaatuh brother,<br>  <br>  May Allah bless you dear brother.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

The fact that ANYONE let alone her own step-father raped her is despicable. <br>  <br>  That the Catholic church denied this little girl HER rights is deplorable.<br>  <br>  The Girl was NINE YEARS OLD. It was not a matter of convenience, but ethics. NO nine year old should ever be a mother, neither have even thought of sex let alone forced into it. <br>  AND your comments make you sound like the greatest fool that ever lived.

The child has been traumatized and victimized and no one can make that go away. The babies are dead, but this girl is no less a victim because of that. <br>  <br>  Babies are not a disease that she got, they are human beings, individuals. Why should they die? I realize that it appears to be a position of adding more horror to this child's life...asking her to give birth after what has been done to her. But the facts cannot be changed that the babies within were human beings and not tumors, or parasites...they were people, who deserved their right to life. <br>  <br>  There are things in this world that are horrible and nothing changes that. The Church isn't advocating that children be raped and forced to have babies, but in this situation, what was done already existed and the life created was innocent and yet bore the ultimate punishment. <br>  <br>  Those children were sacrificed so that their 9 year old mother would not suffer further. This is understood...the point is born children could not have been sacrificed in such a way. A baby conceived in rape cannot be murdered after it is born based on the circumstances of it's conception, nor should it be able to be murdered before it is born based on the circumstances of it's conception. <br>  <br>  The Church sees no difference between the born and the unborn. We cannot commit an evil to do something good. All life is sacred. This young girl will have to deal with the traumatic acts she endured at the hands of her step father. No doubt this was not the first time he raped her. She will suffer emotional and mental anguish, most likely for the rest of her life. <br>  <br>  The taking of innocent life to ease mental or emotional distress although understandable, is not justifiable.<br>  <br>  ADDED: It isn't that we don't understand that the 9 year old  is an innocent child, a victim in the worst way, but does her vicitmization justify the murder of two other innocent children? Can we really say that because this horrible thing happened to her, that killing two other children is acceptable? We can't!

I am 29 and I still don't feel like getting married. If two people love and trust each other that should be enough then..... BUT still marriage is not something that we should completely erase from our culture, it is an institution that   (we must admit) worked for a long time, and because of the law and the rights it could give for both partner it was important.  Of course it is lovely that we love and trust each other and we say that we could never hurt each other but do not forget that there is only a thin line between love and hate. AS much as you love each other at the time of the wedding you can hate each other that much later and do crazy things to get rid of each other or just have that last piece of furniture you have bought together or got as a wedding presents from aunt Netty .... people change, life changes, circumstances change... and it could happen that after a while you don't want to be part of this commitment anymore and you want out.People can be very cruel and I think that this piece of paper can protect us from each other and the children who will born into a marriage. I still believe that paper can help me at the time of the crazy separateing  (hopefully there wont be any ) to know where I stand and behave like a human being even when the pain of losing someone and something, and the pain of being lonely again drives you crazy.<br>  <br>  <br>  To put it in a nutshell : for those who can still believe in an everlasting love, trust and understanding and who can still dream of a better world, well its just a piece of paper, but for those who believe in all these things but still saw some pretty though stuff in life and know how things and people can change...for  those it is nothing but a piece of paper that can make them believe and hope that even if things go wrong they can behave in  anormal way...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f6VhiYJeaa	You feel this way because you are one of the few blessed women who see sense.<br>  <br>  It is pointless. it is only a piece of paper to show commitment in the eyes of god.

We must remain rationale in all of it. At least, writing these questions and answers, we can keep the physical emotion out of it because the religionists have had very negative and bloody ideological warfare for eons. We are dealing with words and concepts, but people come to blows over it? Crazy. However, I am not immune to warfare; I am a high degree martial artist and have fought in the ring (undefeated) before. Still I do not like it because we need to have peace in order to have a proper civilisation keeping war as it is today in economic demolition (when something is not turning a profit it must be destroyed, but not man himself in my opinion – the latter is fianchetto in which I am opposed – hierarchical problem presently).<br>  <br>  Moses states in the book of Genesis in the Christian bible that "He created heaven and earth" and the slide downhill from there regarding the “he” anthropomorphic god came into being. But it is my understanding that the “he” god is a negative overlord on the inner planes called Kal Niranjan by the Hindus. Hence, the religionists worship a demonic entity not realising it (during good times, the Kal is very good, but now not so – the central IT God is beyond good and evil as Nietzsche might say). Now, that should get people really upset here, but again it is not a put-down, but facts as I see it. I believe that the One Supreme Deity is a Divine IT and not genderised as the religionists would have us believe. The IT is not the creator and Moses was correct here, but edited misinterpretations have been proven regarding the bible. Some information left out would be that the creator is not the Divine IT because the latter does no engage in creation but delegates it to the He god.|`|HQI2Kqziaa	See, I would explain this to you, but you don't want to hear.

But the issue is not whether these things occur, but what they are.<br>  <br>  Research of UFO abductees has led to some interesting discoveries. According to those abducted, the aliens are teaching theology. The curious thing is that the theology is New Age theology; namely, that we are all divine, all evolving to higher levels of consciousness, that reality is what you perceive it to be, etc. These are anti-Christian teachings. In some cases, comments about Jesus himself have been made that directly contradict biblical revelation. I've studied the New Age for quite some time, and a great many people in the New Age not only accept Aliens and UFO's, but teach that they are more highly evolved than we are and that we need to learn from them.<br>  <br>  In addition, an inordinately high percentage of the abductees have had previous experience with the occult. I remember when I was younger and into séances, necromancy, psycho kinesis, and astral projection. One night I looked into the sky and saw a very bright light that moved at an extremely high rate of speed and made sudden and sever changes in direction during its flight. It moved extremely fast and accelerated out of sight as it moved high into the night sky and disappeared. I saw this with my own eyes. But it doesn't stop there. During my occult days, I also saw many other unusual manifestations, heard voices, and saw things move. I could go on. But suffice it to say, that I confirm the findings that those who experience UFO phenomena are very often involved in the occult. This is alarming and a major warning.<br>  <br>  My conclusion is that the UFO phenomena is occultic in origin and demonically based. I do not believe there is life on other planets and I suspect that what has manifested is nothing more than a great deception that is slowing enveloping mankind.|`|AA10676836	Ya aliens are just satans angels impersonating aliens. <br>  <br>  Study population tables.

I did some hearing tests and it turned out that I did lose my hearing for high frequency sounds.<br>  <br>  If you want to see if you really did lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds then get a thermometer (the one that you put under your arms to see your temperature), wait 2 minutes and if you can't hear it ringing then you probably did lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds (that's how I found out that I can't hear high frequency sounds). If you do have some hearing loss then do some hearing tests to see how much you have lost in hearing high frequency sounds. There is no cure to the ringing but if you want to be able to hear high frequency sounds then the only thing to do is get hearing aids (which really aren't necessary if your hearing loss is minor).|`|0rpN2419aa	The sound I hear is a high pitched squealing noise.

Here's what the cards say.<br>  <br>  Basis of the Situation - 10 Pentacles Card<br>  Right now you have a good relationship, very stable, satisfying and rewarding.<br>  <br>  Your Feelings - 4 Cups Card<br>  You may feel slight boredom or inwardly discontent, even though nothing appears to be wrong.<br>  <br>  Helpful - Ace of Wands Card<br>  You have a VERY passionate relationship, which is really good! Consider yourself lucky, this is a very positive card when it shows up in a relationships reading.<br>  <br>  Opposing - Judgment Card<br>  You are questioning where this relationship is going. You may be asking yourself questions like "Will I get anything out of the effort I put in?"<br>  <br>  Outcome - Nine of Wands<br>  You might feel like giving up or leaving, but don't! You will definitely achieve your goals or desires, whatever they may be, if you only work towards them and not give up so easily.<br>  <br>  Overall, the cards show me that you have a very good relationship. You must really care for each other. If you come across any problems or obstacles in this relationship, don't give up hope and keep working towards what you want. The odds are in your favor, but only if you 'keep at it'.<br>  <br>  I did a reading on him too - the cards don't say he's a cheater or a liar.

While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic.

It can't be.|`|lQM8uH6daa	I think there was probably a "religous vacuum" before Mohammhed started up Islam caused bythe destructon by our christian sct of the Gnostic Christian sects wo didn't believe Jesus was God or God's son which is pretty much the difference between Islam and us christians.The gnostics lived in the arabic lands and at one stage stood as a rival to roman christianty. I don't think you'd find a muslim who would agree this is true but I'd imagine the deification of Jesus 200 years before Mohammeds birth would have been a talking point in the middle east and a bone of contention with the wild jewish tribes and the reminants of the gnostics...hence Mohammed is a reflex against this notion.<br>  Islam its self seems to be splitting now along moderate vs Osama Bin Laden type lines and perhaps this ill be the next big split in religion in the middle east ?|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	there was NO islam until muhammad made it up|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	First of all, saying ''Pre-Islamic Muslims'' is contradictory.<br>  <br>  You can say that the then Arabs completely forgot all of the teachings of Abraham (A) and made up their own religions and customs. The House of Ka'ba was filled with 360 idols. They worshipped the sun, the moon, trees, animals etc and were steeped in superstitions. They were the farthermost thing away from the teachings of the previous Prophets.<br>  <br>  So, its wrong to say that they only strayed from the message given by Abraham. In fact, they forgot the whole of it.<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad (Sm) came to the Arabs for a number of reasons. <br>  <br>  First of all, he came to revive the teachings of the previous Prophets and give it fulfillment through the revelation of the Holy Quran.<br>  <br>  Secondly, he came to stop the tyrannical behaviour, customs and criminal habits of the then Arabs like drug addiction, alcoholism, oppressing the weak, burial of female child alive, treating women as slaves, quarreling, warfare, hypocrisy etc.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, he came to fulfill the religion Islam and give it a complete shape. He came to leave a legacy for all the Muslims of the future generation to follow.<br>  <br>  So Muhammad was not exactly a reformist, rather he was a complete revolutionary figure in Arab history.. He not only united the once disputing Arab tribes but also removed superstitions and false ideas from amongst them, and introduced the religion of Islam for all of them to abide by.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped. If you have any more questions, you can ask me.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Frangi:<br>  Pre-islamic 'arabs' were polytheists (the principle gods being 'moon' deities). Muhammad introduced them to the doctrine of ONE GOD, UNIQUE, INDIVISIBLE.... NON-BEGETTING....

The story may, or may not have any historical validity. <br>  <br>  The notion that the Kaaba was 'built by Adam and restored by Abraham and his son Ishmael has no historical verity. <br>  <br>  Have listed some titles that might be of use to you.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	about the square black box called khana kaaba ...it has a historical value it has always been a most sacred worshipping place... many prophets and thier followers would worship there.... muslims face it when bowing to God for unity.

ks9I8eFtaa	The phrase blue blood was first used to describe the Spanish royal family, like someone else said this could have started because they didn't have to spend any time outdoors and thus you could see their blue veins, it's also been thought that they could have had silver poising which gives your skin a bluish hue or they could have had a genetic disease that gives your skin a bluish hue. I think there was something odd about the Spanish royals that made people give them this moniker. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, their blood is of course red like ours.

Their main purpose is to resurrect humans back to a high state of abilities and spirituality, by gaining knowledge of themselves and life.|`|AA10985325	No we are not Christians.<br>  Here’s a factual description of the Scientology religion for you (From a Scientologist):<br>  <br>  Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So it’s not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.|`|nyqoPvL2aa	Here's a story:<br>  A few decades ago, three fairly popular sci-fi authors met for lunch. During the course of their discussions, they gave each other a bet. Specifically, to write a book that created the most successful religion. The three authors, and the books they wrote, are:<br>  Philip K Dick, "Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"<br>  Robert Heinlein, "Stranger In A Strange Land"<br>  L. Ron Hubbard, "Dianetics"<br>  The story may be entirely BS actually. However, the results are fairly unambiguous. "Stranger" is considered to be a great classic. "Androids" was the source for the movie "Bladerunner"... the book and the movie combined are one of the pillars of the entire modern sci-fi genre. "Dianetics", however, was gotten ahold of by Hubbard's crazy son, who turned it into a sort of religion... so technically Hubbard won their bet. As stated above, they have nothing to do with Christianity, and are more or less a huge scam.|`|X1OUnP0Kaa	they're a scam, and one of the dumbest religions around.<br>  <br>  $500 just to get into the church|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	They believe Jesus was half alien. <br>  <br>  I think they are a cult.

5UW2P8IMaa	I think it is rude for a man to wear a hat inside.<br>  <br>  Hats are removed when inside, except for places that are akin to public streets, like lobbies, corridors, and crowded elevators (non-residential). In a public building (where there are no apartments) the elevator is considered a public area. <br>  You may choose to remove your hat in a public elevator, but in the presence of a lady your hat must be removed.<br>  <br>  A gentleman takes off his hat and holds it in his hand when a lady enters the elevator in any building that can be classified as a dwelling such as an apartment house or hotel. He puts it on again in the corridor. <br>  <br>  In the Christian tradition, men do not wear hats during religious or funeral services.<br>  <br>  In the military, hats are removed when indoors unless you are "under arms" or are eating in a mess hall.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Traditions are the glue that holds a society together.

All the same, your insistence on wearing a baseball cap in places where there's no possibility of playing baseball isn't perfectly logical either.  Neither is your claim that what century it is makes any difference.  Besides, you have good hair, and it's a shame to hide it even when it's a little mussed.|`|9H1FZw7xaa	There are hats, and then there are HATS.  It is rude to wear a hat in a theater, because you might be blocking the view of the person behind you.  As for informal places like the mall, then it seems ok, but what is the real reason you don't want to take it off?  It is not longer an era where hats are required by men.  In the past, as recently as the early part of the 20th century, men wore hats all the time, and it was fashionable, but they always removed them inside.  Today, things are a little more casual, but, it seems a little strange to me that a perfect stranger should tell you to take off your hat.  Is it something other than a baseball cap?|`|va8quhPtaa	We have to follow and respect tradition.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Generally I'm pretty polite (in public), and I know and use reasonably good table manners.

In a Church, the church sets the rules, but a mall is public, and unless there are posted signs, which there aren't, then no one really cares.  The old battleaxe deserved to be shown which end of the battle axe fits where; and if you told her to mind her own business, you were WELL within your rights.<br>  <br>  21 Century and some of these old bats think they can male bash without recourse, and that is EXACTLY what you experienced.

I don't think it's necessary to remove your hat in a mall or at other retail establishments.

kK4GG6Z2aa	A blind,foolish and ignorant man.  The Holocaust came out of something very evil indeed and to deny this denies the existence of evil.  He probably has a low opinion of Jews who he believes killed his Lord.  Well, as I wrote in another post. "many Christians believed and some still believed that the Jews killed Jesus. In my opinion The Lord knew the stupidity and prejudices of men and in his wisdom ensured that all were involved in the Crucifixion – the Jew and the Gentile....How clever of God to ensure that all were involved not just one group. What people tend to forget or perhaps ignore is that with his dying breath Christ said – Father Forgive them for they know not what they do! We Christians believe that God always grants the requests of Christ do we not? So all those who were involved were forgiven.  It might be a hard pill for some Christians to swallow – but you can’t spit out those bits of the Bible which don’t suit your view of Christ."  It was not only the Jews that were murdered during the holocaust anyone supposedly inferior to the 'master race' was also murdered this included Germans too - the mentally ill - the physically disabled etc.  It is difficult to comprehend how a so called Man of God could be so ignorant -there is enough evidence out to prove it happened or does he think all those photos, and testemonies of the alied liberators were falsified.  How foolish and blind - sadly he is not the only one with this opinion. Genocide continues today in every corner of the globe- it's a sign of man's inhumanity to man.

The Holy See lifted the excommunication in January 2009.

She very obviously is not going to change her behavior to be like your behavior. <br>  <br>  I also recommend minimizing discussion with her as much as possible.<br>  <br>  I hope my comments have been helpful in some way, and, best of luck with whatever route you choose to take!

That book is the Bible—and if you've never read any of it, I urge you to do so.<br>  <br>  Why do I say this? The reason is because the Bible isn't just another book on self-help. In fact it isn't a "self-help" book at all because it tells us that we are too weak to change our lives and make ourselves into the kind of people we ought to be. We may not like to admit this—but it's true, as you know from your own experience.<br>  <br>  Instead, the Bible points us to God, for only He can change us and make our lives different. We can't change our lives—but God can, and He will if we let Him. God loves us, and He doesn't want us to be sunk in a pit of helplessness and despair the rest of our lives.<br>  <br>  How does this happen? It begins with repentance—telling God we know we have sinned, and we are turning from our old ways of living. Then we must turn to Jesus Christ and ask Him to come into our lives as our Savior and Lord. When we do, God Himself comes to live within us by His Spirit. Then we'll discover the same truth the Apostle Paul discovered: "I can do everything through him who gives me strength" (Philippians 4:13). <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|EAuMJrs4aa	try to find this book called the bible it tells you how to be the most horrible bigotted and evil individual ever look for the jesus bit its a turning point follow his teaching ignore those of this bloke called paul though|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	go to church

9BeUbORtaa	This is actually a really good question. We don't get many of those here. <br>  <br>  I don't really feel qualified to begin to answer it, except to say that the kind of 'love' theists claim to experience for their deity (and not all theists think about this the same way) is both experiential (that is, it assumes an experience of God, even if that experience is not a sensual one), and qualitatively different from all other kinds of human 'love'. It is, I suppose, more related to deep sensations of gratitude and spiritual desire than other kinds of love (e.g., romantic love, parental love) which have a physical object and involve concern, the desire to protect, physical desire, etc. One similarity between romantic love and religious love strongly emphasised in the mystical tradition of both Christianity and Islam, however, is the desire for union with the beloved. It is because of this that some Christian and Muslim mystics use quite intense sexual imagery to describe the desire for communion with God.<br>  <br>  This makes sense to me. But then, I find it very hard to understand how people can claim to love their country (how can you experience 'love' towards an abstract political construct?).|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Oh but I have met Him.

I don't believe it's so much an acquired love as an expected love.  <br>  <br>  A way to describe what I mean is this:  Most of us grow up saying "I love you" to all means of relatives -- parents, grandparents, etc.  However, if we were not related to them; they were simply a family friend, we would not.  That is the difference between *real* love and love expected because of relation.<br>  <br>  <br>  The same applies here.  Those raised in a family that follows a deity hears of this deity from birth, and are taught that the deity exists -- although they've never seen , met, or heard this deity.  <br>  <br>  Instead of focusing on meeting, seeing, and hearing, many of them take whatever "proof" they perceive of their deity -- for instance, many consider the deep stories of the Christian Bible proof of the Christian God.  They compare it to air -- we can't see it, but we have evidence that it's there.  The catch is that we DON'T have evidence of a deity -- although many believe certain things could be considered evidence, they most often cannot.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I have no specific religious affiliation -- I do not deeply love anyone; let alone someone I have not met, seen, or heard.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Again it is Faith.......you may never have seen him, or actually heard him, or met him, but I bet there have been times in your life when you have thought , wow, I really got lucky, or man, someone must love me.

And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  <br>  <br>  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.'<br>  <br>  John the author of Revelation meets face to face the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.  But this Alpha and Omega says he is the one who lives now, but was dead.  When in the scriptures did Jehovah God ever die?  Jesus God's son died, was resurrected by God the Father, and is alive for evermore and it is he (Jesus) who has the keys of hell and of death.<br>  You are in denial about Jesus being no more than  a created god, He is God.  Look at John 1:1   'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'  Again Jesus said he was the word, here it say the Word existed in the very beginning of things,  that the Word was with God (Jesus was with God the Father) and the Word (Jesus) was God (Father, Almighty, Jehovah, Lord)|`|QC7vlfPPaa	They hang out in cancer wards and convert people at their weakest, make them refuse transfusions... they invade peoples privacy and personal space.

Yet, he comforts them: “If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.” Jesus next reveals why the world hates his followers, saying: “Because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.”<br>  Explaining further the reason for the world’s hatred, Jesus continues: “They will do all these things against you on account of my name, because they do not know him [Jehovah God] that sent me.” Jesus’ miraculous works, in effect, convict those who hate him, as he notes: “If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen and hated me as well as my Father.” Thus, as Jesus says, the scripture is fulfilled: “They hated me without cause.”<br>  <br>  A few years ago I was talking to a woman and leaving some magazines for her sister.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

Mohammed will be cast into outer darkness because he tried to get in by another way when Jesus CLEARLY said, "I am THE way, THE Truth, and THE life.  NO man comes to the Father but by ME." and again "I am the door.  If any man tries to enter by any other means, he will be treated as a thief and a robber and be cast out into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth!"<br>  <br>  So, if Jesus were a prophet, why do you call Him a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus said that you can ONLY know God, through Him, Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Jesus said that He did ONLY what He saw His Father in heaven do. (No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes this statement, "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	If they can read, they should already know that Christ never claimed to be God... but only "Son of God.

AGlpdpAKaa	well, different people have different ways of seeing it.  it depends who you are.  i had a miscarriage a few months ago.  when my friends didn't ask how i was doing, it would hurt me because i felt very alone.  but when people i didn't know well brought it up i would feel insulted and irritated.  one girl brought it up  at our mutual friend's baby shower, saying "how are you doing? you're ok are you? you're alright with being here?" well, no i'm not alright but it's not appropriate to talk about how sad i am when we're here celebrating another woman's baby.  i know what you mean though.  the whole thing is frustrating.  people are not asking to keep the hurt alive, they're trying to be sensitive and kind and warm to you, reaching out in case you need to talk.  people don't realize that it's hard for you.  so, when people ask, just say i'm fine, and change the subject.

This question is a little like asking could God make a rock he coldn't pick up. Like that's going to happen any time soon. Some questions are illogical to start with. Is there a point to the question? What is it? I believe in Jesus myself but I'll support anyones right to belive and disbelieve whatever they want.

But having god-like powers has been given; which I  think is the key to all this. God dispenses His power to those He chooses to give it to. They end up doing what is otherwise impossible to do.

I'm all for gay marriage.  I think its ridiculous how closely religion is tied in with the matter - that appears to be the major factor in the anti-gay debate.  Its seems stupid that with a population that has such a high number of athiests and other spiritualities that the connection between the church and government is so strongly enforced.  If you love someone, you should be able to enjoy the same relationship as other people whether it be heterosexual, homosexual, or something in between.  In the end does it matter what equipment the person has, so long as they share a deep emotional bond that ties them together?<br>  <br>  I know several gay people and they are fantastic.

I'm quite offended by the bespectacled, imbecillic, overweight urchin accompanied by the word, "HUT", likewise Adrian Mole. Harry Potter is maybe a slight improvement on the theme...<br>  From the outside, as a man (albeit one who is awaiting the results of his hormone test with no little anxiety...), lesbian relationships just seem so peaceful. Straight and gay male relationships both seem to me to be about submission and dominance. I daresay that goes on in lesbian relationships too but to me it has always seemed like the most equal partnership there can be. I have probably watched too many D.H.Lawrence films but I feel such envy.|`|nxQZtRU1aa	I find it offensive, although I'm not lesbian.

The concept is pure fantasy and styalises the idea of teenage sexual frustration... sucking blood is symbolism for sex, guys like lesbian porn but it is slightly frustrating for them to not be 'involved'. It is a pastiche on the genre, and is just lighthearted entertainment.<br>  <br>  They are not being hunted for being lesbians, but I did have some concerns, I haven't seen it yet of course, it seems like it might be OK. Not like Chuck and Larry.|`|d103d3f30374db2373144a1d32b17c35aa	The film is, indeed, geared towards teenage boys.<br>  In particular, it is geared towards exploiting their hormonal flux in order to make them part with money in order to to see the film - thereby earning the film's producers & distributors lots of lovely Profit.<br>  <br>  As for it being demeaning to women, I think that anyone who watches large amounts of this sort of entertainment over long periods of time is probably more likely to view women as sex objects - because it is their only 'interaction' with women.<br>  <br>  What you, as a woman, SHOULD be more worried about is the ubiquitous misandry of advertisements for household cleaning products (and the sort of 'female-friendly' tv shows that they 'sponsor').<br>  <br>  EVERY ad for these products portrays men as useless creatures who make messes, and cannot clean up after themselves.<br>  EVERY ad for these products shows women - even young girls - ridiculing men, and cleaning up after them 'because they are incapable of doing so themselves'.<br>  <br>  WHY is this a Bad Thing? Because it programmes *all* the young children who are exposed to these ads - from the pre-school age at which their minds are at their most impressionable - with the following memes:<br>  <br>  Boys - in our culture, your role in Life? is now - and it also always will be once you've grown up - to make messes.<br>  No need to worry about that, as Women will always be around to clean up after you.<br>  Women will also, invariably, ridicule you, no matter what you do. So why should you treat them as anything other than the Enemy?<br>  <br>  Girls - in our culture, your role in Life? is to make the Perfect home. You have to have the Perfect Job, the Perfect Figure, feed your Perfect family, and Clean Up after them.

I don't feel offended, but it's really not helping the situation, it's not helping peoples' ideas and understanding of what it is to be lesbian, not in a respectful light. It makes us look sex mad and silly, there to be laughed at. Actually being gay is the same as being straight in relationship terms, it is just as serious and spiritual and you still have the same kind of issues and struggles. So naw, it's a silly portrayal and a bit irresponsible.|`|9EkwyFB8aa	i watch the film first then get a answer for you|`|3029b27a303de71c5528ee94f4bb098baa	i love lesbians,in fact ,one of my work colleagues is a lesbian.so no it dont bother me.|`|JV6fAzy4aa	SO glad you brought that up! I was going to ask exactly the same question! <br>  I saw the advert at a bus stop which I pass every morning on my way to work and was initially shocked!<br>  The more I thought about it the more it irritated me.<br>  Lesbian Vampire Killers? WTF? This is very offensive! Especially as there are people out there who believe in killing gay people just because they are gay. (I am straight by the way)<br>  It isn't a laughing matter! You can call me what you want, too serious, can't take a joke etc but I know me, and I know I have a fantastic sense of humour, I laugh every day all day and find loads of things hilarious. But that's because they are funny<br>  This film looks like a load of rubbish.<br>  Men getting excited about lesbians, and then killing them with their phallic weapons!? PUHLEASE! How misogynistic can you get!? This is blatantly sexist AND homophobic, and I can't believe it is just being passed off as a normal comedy. I have zero respect for the writers, and for James Cordon, and whatever the other one's called. Pathetic. Very offensive mindless rubbish. I am not a man-hater, I am not a lesbian, but I can see how narrow minded and shallow this film is, not to mention that it shows no respect for lesbians by making a mockery out of their sexuality!<br>  I wonder if any of the people involved in creating this film have ever really understood how a real lesbian feels, or what she has had to go through in society because of her sexuality.<br>  I don't think it should be taken for granted that everyone is open minded and accepting of other people who are different or who have a different sexuality, as unfortunately that is not the case. <br>  This film does take it for granted and I don't even understand why lesbians has to be such a blatant part of the film. If it were the other way around and you had lesbians as the majority and they were killing the minority straight male vampires, I think there would be uproar, especially from straight men complaining of sexism and misandry! Not to mention a general feeling of emasculation.<br>  So in answer to your question, yes I find it very offensive, and that's coming from a liberal straight female in a hetero relationship who loves real comedy and real men!

While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage.

At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.

AyEkA6Flaa	-- As for Christians, the Christian Byzantine Empire did not punish homosexuality until 529 A.D. under Emperor Justinian, who blamed homosexuals for plagues, earthquakes, famine and pestilence.<br>  <br>  -- In Catholic Western Europe, homosexuality was legally forbidden around 350 A.D. (though this was not widely enforced except in Spain), then it was ignored and tolerated after the barbarian invasions.  Later, homosexuality began to be punished after 1179 A.D.<br>  <br>  -- Many Christian churches now allow same-sex relationships, including the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States, many Lutheran Churches in Europe and America, and a growing number of other congregations including Methodist and Presbyterian, even some American Baptists.<br>  <br>  -- As to Islam, this question is complicated!  I know that there was homosexual love poetry by Muslims in the Medieval period, certainly in Spain and in the stories of the Arabian Nights.  And I've heard it is not uncommon for young Muslim men to turn to each other for sexual play when growing up.  Yet on the other hand, I have also read that homosexuality is forbidden in Islam, and I know that in Iran and elsewhere it is punishable by death.  So I am confused and am unsure why it has sometimes been tolerated and sometimes not.<br>  <br>  -- Please note that among Christians, those Churches which permit homosexuality have their origin in the time of the Protestant Reformation, in which there was a major re-thinking of the Faith.  As far as I know, Islam has not yet had a similar time of radical re-thinking of their Faith and a growth in individual freedom -- so maybe it will just take time for same-sex relationships to be accepted.<br>  <br>  I don't think God or religion are to blame for this, per se.  Rather, it is religious leaders who enjoy *controlling* the actions of others who are to blame.  In the West, that has largely changed with the growth of secular governments, but it must change still further.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	I'm not sure exactly what you are asking but there are tons of churches now a days that welcome homoesexuality.

It is a culture that proselytizes innocent children who do not have the philosophical modality to actually even consider a dogmatic identity. They're not even capable of fathoming death, let alone a metaphysical existence. It is a false sense of conviction and self. They have placed a blasphemy on speaking out with the consequence of eternal hellfire. By circumventing the necessary process of philosophical inquiry and the venturing of one into one's self they impose a sociopsychological detriment to the child's development. This coupled by the passages that limit free thinking and speaking out can only be equated with slavery. Only when one willing makes an inference on the philosophical identity can they find self worth. Religion also places men and the earth on pedestals when biology and astronomy infer otherwise. Organized Religion is a tacit advance on premature religious perversion. To ensure followers they prey upon those who cannot think for themselves and stay them with inhibited cognitive injunctions.

Also, as with Christianity, there really is no "right" branch of the religion. Everyone has their own interpretation of the Torah.<br>  <br>  Reform Judaism is one of the more liberal branches, Conservative Judaism is a middle ground, and Orthodox Judaism is significantly more strict, strongly encouraging observance of all 613 mitzvot, especially with regards to sexual intercourse, diet, and holidays.<br>  <br>  For full disclosure, I'm not religious, so that's why I'm not sticking with the Orthodox idea of Judaism.
aO4iCwtoaa	This is the third question of yours I've seen, and I'm starting to notice a pattern here.  <br>  <br>  While your story about being drawn to Judaism is very moving, on a practical level it sounds like you really don't want to be Jewish at all, you only want to embrace the parts of it that you think are meaningful or cool.  That simply isn't how Judaism works.  It's not a menu of observances that you can pick and choose what you want to do.  Saying that you want to convert, but you plan on breaking Jewish law repeatedly (getting more tattoos, marrying a non Jew, who knows what else - are you planning to keep kosher?  to not work on Saturdays?) shows me that you are not truly sincere about it.  Maybe that is simply a reflection of your lack of knowledge about Judaism, and can be changed, but if not, you will not be accepted into any trustworthy conversion program.  <br>  <br>  Jewish people are absolutely very open and accepting of people, but Judaism itself is a strict religion.  Just because there are Jews who break Jewish law does not mean that breaking Jewish law is okay according to Judaism - it's simply a reflection that at the end of the day people have free will to make their own choices, including bad choices.  Just as there are many Catholics who never attend Mass or get divorced or use birth control.  An outsider who goes to a priest and says "I want to convert to Catholicism, but I don't want to take Communion and I plan to get an abortion" would be laughed out of the church.  It's the same situation here.<br>  <br>  If what you are looking for in a religion is simply an accepting faith where everything is "open and nice," I suggest you look into Unitarian Universalism.  Religiously, their dogma is about as close to Judaism as you can get without giving up Jesus, they are extremely welcoming and tolerant of differing beliefs, and you don't have to give up Christmas.

You don't have to confront them face-to-face, but you need to say something to someone.  If they're doing it to you, then they're probably doing it to other people as well.

They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except [what] they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.<br>  <br>  Yes, VIRGINIA, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no VIRGINIAS. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br>  <br>  Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br>  <br>  You may tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, VIRGINIA, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding. <br>  <br>  No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever.

MXWyX4PRaa	I think the "peace" comes from the firm belief that no matter what happens, someone else is looking out for you and making sure it's the best outcome for you.  It's like having a cop around when you're traveling through a bad neighborhood, or having your mom stick around a few minutes when dropping you off at a party where you weren't really sure you'd be welcome.  Imagine how much more compliant and relaxed a child would be if they *really* believed their parents when they said, "We're doing this for your own good."<br>  <br>  Really, if you could relinquish responsibility (at your job, your finances, whatever) to someone you believed knew *everything*, that's a lot of weight off your shoulders.|`|uE2aOqeNaa	As a third party looking in I must say you are a phucking retard.<br>  <br>  They belief 100% that they will go to heaven. They believe that God answers all of their prayer. They are just not so dumb to think all answers are yes and no. This is unlike your dumb *** whole only looks to the world in only black and white. <br>  <br>  There is no unpredictability as you state it. They have the reassurance that God is always there for them. <br>  <br>  I guess your logic is a fail|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	I understand what you're trying to say. Kudos.<br>  <br>  However, many theists get mental peace and satisfaction just by praying to God. The ''signs'' that they may get sometimes reinforces their beliefs, and makes them happy. Some people seem to have this personal relationship with God and they need nothing else. Its not possible to check the validity.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	The best way to describe the peace is an inner-knowing that all is going to be all right. After the car accident, you will have 1 leg, 1 arm, difficulty seeing due to the concussion, pain like you've never known, but the peace comes from Faith (from understanding the Word/trusting God). Faith that everything will work out all right (not all perfect, but all right is truth even so). We trust that our best interests are in God's hands & everything is in His will & He will be there for us/knows how we feel. I see a comparison: complete trust in God the Father much like a small child trusts his father w/out question. With someone (God) caring for you like that, you have a peace that everything will be ok...no matter how big the problem, since God knows the book from beginning to end and is omnipowerful. I've seen ppl calm in the face of fatal cancer diagnosis-not that they would be healed, but that God was with them & it was still ok, cuz they were not alone & were going to 'heaven.' (thus escaping the earthly pain).<br>  <br>  The Good: In spite of the truth of many of the following statements, If I believe in myself, I can do a better project, improve my life, complete the marathon for charity, believe in others who will feel empowered by my belief & so on down the line...Practically, if I believe I can succeed a vocal solo tryout, then it's beneficial for me & can improve my performance. (A simple statement on belief-not related to God.)<br>  <br>  The Problem: beliefs can be so ingrained that a person's eyes/mind are blinded to the truth presented by scientific facts or even a simpler way to do things. Beliefs travel by-word-of-mouth and a belief can gain a following-even if it's ill-advised. This can cause countless harmfull situations. <br>  <br>  Beliefs can be practical, but they can also be impractical. Fanatacism due to beliefs can cause blind devotion in which one loses self. At such points, the believer will go to any extreme-some resulting in a danger to others.This level is the most unpredictable and can sometimes be equated w/psychoses or neuroses.<br>  <br>  The idea of belief has great power-even w/out a connection to God. For Christians, their belief is in God...any shortcomings, their own. Belief in God is not an answer to all situations, tho. Crime & pain still happens-that, I don't understand. why wouldn't God fix it? Ppl who are believers don't have all the answers, but they feel they know One who does...and that's good enough for them because they have a 'relationship' w/Him. Some believers have peace, not all. I've also found there are plenty in other faiths who have equivalent peace, so it has nothing to do w/the religion's doctrine-only that there is a higher power (what if the power is a 'truth center' in the brain? And their connection w/it keeps them on an even keel. I can only equate that with a special strength &/or determination within a person. Peace seems to be elusive, but those who have it say it's the best. <br>  <br>  I believe in the scientific process & love learning about the world around us. I don't write-off ea medical success to a miracle. Different ppl place diff amts of credit to God over medicine/science. I think one can believe in both. I know many credible docs who do. Religion should stay within its borders though. No one wants to have another's beliefs shoved down their throats. With more education, ppl will hopefully be able to find out the true reason for probs & their fixes instead of attributing everything good/evil to God.|`|AA11348743	I see you are searching and wanting God. You try to make too much sense of it. There is always this dogma of science equals intelligence and religion equals delusional. I think you are afraid of losing your label. Science teaches us to combine all the verifiable evidence and throw out the rest. "the rest" is where you will find peace.|`|U1hGMckKaa	you will never have peace if you are a believer. it makes a person lazy when they rely on prayer. why pray for things when you can get the job done yourself? we can work together. the same thing is true for conservatives. how are they ever going to live independently if they have to conserve in order to make up for others faults? how can liberals get their way if they become too assertive? they always force too much onto others.|`|8ZJdjfMOaa	Even with meds, there could be a placebo effect, so everything is mind based anyways. Even if you choose not to believe a particular ideology, it's all just mind based perspective.|`|nMLomteraa	Well, I NEVER NEVER NEVER ever wanted kids, when I was younger? and LOOK what happened! Surprise! I'm a mommy!<br>  <br>  God gave me something, no SOMEONE to love, more than my own self! It's an amazing feeling! It's all new! To be selfless, and love another being with your whole entire heart and soul... and oops, I was supposed to love my husband first, right? Well, what can you expect from someone with this Lesbin Laden avatar? So, my kids taught me to love. <br>  <br>  I prayed for death. I prayed to be released from my sins/own personal hell... and ... wow!!! God gave me kids, instead! what a surprise!|`|rMOKjYn7aa	God always answers ..sometimes the answer is "no".<br>  If you truly seek - that peace you speak of will come to you. It can't be explained because words are inadequate and finite.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	You have to believe in something, even if that belief is nothing. Believing that god doesn't exist, is still your belief. "I believe that when we die we are nothing but rotting bodies in the dirt" or "I believe that when we die we go to heaven" are both beliefs and neither can be proven. So I choose to believe in heaven. It doesn't take any more time or energy on my part to believe in heaven than it does not to, so I choose to. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, nothing lost nothing gained. Just what I choose to believe. So when you say "the problem with belief..." I say, what problem? It just is. You believe this or that. Who cares, none of it is reality... Unless it is.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Belief is not science<br>  All facets of life are not science, nor reducible to scientific principles<br>  All of us, including atheists, subscribe to various little beliefs that have no proof<br>  You cannot perceive my subjective mind therefore you cannot judge whether or not prayer has been beneficial to me
dgJyU7xkaa	From God!|`|C6NPYQ3Daa	i got mine from the off licence,they have all the spirits your ever likely to need .|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	from god|`|xKthWOGtaa	Spirits, from my understanding, are not material things. They are energy. And every particle in the universe has energy. We can give them more energy, or less energy through various means, but all particles vibrate and therefore have energy. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only changed from one form to another. <br>  <br>  I think that spirits are specific patterns of energy. They also cannot be created or destroyed, but only transferred. <br>  <br>  I think if you think about it, the spiritual energy of the world is always constant. When one dies, another is born. Not just humans, but all living things. Even if more humans are alive today than yesterday, that must be balanced out by another species decreasing in numbers. Therefore the balance is always the same. That's my limited understanding anyway.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	Spiritual growth is the process of inner awakening, and becoming conscious our inner being. It means the rising of the consciousness beyond the ordinary existence, and awakening to some Universal truths.

KnTrvQd6aa	PLease don't refer to transsexual women as "feminised men", or transsexual men as "masculinised women"; transsexual women are NOT men, and transsexual men are NOT women.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question; there are two main reasonsd why society accepts trans men more than trans women;<br>  (A) we live in a patriarchal, phallocentric society; transsexual men are often seen (as you seem to) as 'women trying to be like men' which is considered quite acceptable and admirable, whereas trans women are considered to be 'men trying to be like women' which is regarded as a threat or insult to manhood in general.<br>  (B) Trans men have a small advantage in their social transition; the effects of testosterone are more effective, and more dramatic, on a female-developed body than the effects of oestrogen are on a male-developed body; this means that trans men can appear more physically masculine, and faster, than trans women can appear physically feminine.|`|LpMGGmFuaa	It took a REALLY long time for women to be tolerated for wearing male couture.<br>  I can remember a time when I was scorned at a department store for attempting to buy some  men's pants.  I had to tell the saleslady that they were  a birthday present for my (fictitious) brother.<br>  Someday people won't throw a fit if males want to wear something supposedly feminine.|`|sv6cyCkMaa	Unfortunately society has a double standard when it comes to what men & women wear. <br>  <br>  I realize that in the past women didn't wear pants, and if they did they were not accepted into society. But also in the past men were able to wear white wigs and have frilly shirts and nothing was said.<br>  <br>  These days some men feel it is sexy when women wear their shirts and underwear and I see nothing wrong with that. For some reason if  a couple goes out in public and is wearing each others clothes, the woman would be accepted but the man would be laughed at.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately a man is suppose to act and dress as a man and if they aren't they are picked on, made fun of and laughed at. But on the other hand a woman wearing  guy clothes it appears they are trying to become more like a man (being dominate) .<br>  <br>  I guess most people want to be dominated in the bedroom, and since it has always been the man's job to be dominating, it is who is wearing the man's clothes is the one in charge.<br>  <br>  I personally see nothing wrong with the woman wearing man's clothes or a man wearing women's clothes. <br>  <br>  Society should accept the person and not their clothes.|`|niq3ETl0aa	That is so sad. What a tragedy.  Maybe the suicide is more complicated than that. Whatever the case, if you identify with him or have friends like that, trust yourself. Be yourself. we all go through times when it seems no one likes us or they are constantly trashing us...when it comes from all sides it can be so depressing. People like this boy should spend alot of time alone centering. This should be where we find joy, happiness, acceptance, not from others. Also, despite what judgemental religious people say, God dearly loves ya all. And, if it comes up within you to change say?

He told the attendant:<br>  <br>  "I don't care what it is that a person wants to try on.

Most shops will think that you are buying something for your lady. The only thing that you may get the looks from is when you but makeup pantyhose or shoes. I've bought some make up from department stores, I prefer to buy good foundation, Eyeliner and  mascara and cover up from a drug store. because of cost. Eyeliner and  mascara does go bad. So you need to keep it fresh. That is what I have the most trouble with. Remember that money talks. I have gone int to woman's shoe store and the sale person starts out not liking it but them they look at the green and that is a sale the made and they made a sale.

H2Xn7IH4aa	Yes God is against homosexuality but he's also against lying, cheating, stealing, lust, jealousy, greed, premarital sex, arrogance, hatred, and a bunch of other things that every person on this planet is guilty of. *ALL* have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The important thing to remember is that, despite what people like the Westboro Baptist Church would like everyone to believe, homosexuality is no worse than any other sin. Against God's perfect moral standard, all sin's are weighed equally. I would even go as far as to say that God looks more favorably on gay people who save themselves for one person than straight people who have multiple sexual partners throughout their lives (I have no Biblical reference for that, it's just what I believe). <br>  <br>  There's a great song by Casting Crowns called "If We Are the Body" about Christians judging other Christians. One line goes "Jesus paid much too high a price for us to pick & choose who should come..." Jesus didn't take the punishment that we deserve to save us from God's righteous wrath to then turn around and say, "Ok I'll forgive this but not that & I'll only save these people not these." If a gay person repents and puts their faith in Jesus Christ as their savior, they'll be saved just like anyone else.<br>  <br>  I noticed on one of your other questions you said, "I understand that some Christians may not appeal to a lot of ppl but that really has nothing to do with Jesus and his message." That's a perfect place to start. Forget about what other people say. Only God knows what's really in a person's heart and only His approval matters. And don't focus so much on what God is against. They'll learn that as they get older. What's important is His love & willingness to save anyone who accepts His grace. Besides, Christians should understand that although homosexuality is a sin, it's just like any other and shouldn't be held against anyone. Judge not lest ye be judged. Anyone who truly loves the Lord and has acknowledged their own sin nature will tell you the same. I hope this answered your question.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	i would teach my kids the same wether i was gay or not..<br>  <br>  the bible was writen by MEN who wanted to have power over others and so made up a book ... the book wasnt inspired by god...  heck the story of jesus is the SAME as Horus and horus the eqyptian god was told thousands of years before...<br>  <br>  there are morals to follow... you might find a few in the bible but not all...<br>  respect ALL people men women gays bi.. black asian white... we are all HUMANS no one is better then the other<br>  <br>  and dont get brainwashed in to religions that say you have to give them money.. buy there sermons on CD/DVD or you'll miss "salvation" and the earth is only 6000 years old and dinosuars didnt exist or lived beside humans and died in the "flood" cuz they were unworthy of saving<br>  <br>  fairy tails|`|ojiO3svoaa	JUST TELL THEM THAT THERE ARE CRAZY CHRISTIANS OUT THERE AND THAT THEY ARE WRONG.|`|iwOjydnFaa	In the future i would love to be a father, but i would feel terrible if my child was getting bullied because he has two dads.

Tvc6Tmz5aa	The first known uses of the pentagram are found in Mesopotamian writings dating to about 3000 BC. The Sumerian pentagrams served as pictograms for the word "UB," meaning "corner, angle, nook; a small room, cavity, hole; pitfall," suggesting something very similar to the pentemychos. In René Labat's index system of Sumerian hieroglyphs/pictograms it is shown with two points up. In the Babylonian context, the edges of the pentagram were probably orientations: forward, backward, left, right, and "above". These directions also had an astrological meaning, representing the five planets Jupiter, Mercury, Mars and Saturn, and Venus as the "Queen of Heaven" (Ishtar) above.<br>  The pentagram has long been believed to be a potent protection against evil, a symbol of conflict that shields the wearer and the home. The pentagram has five spiked wards and a womb shaped defensive, protective pentagon at the center.|`|stAeoUeSaa	satanism<br>  it is a very evil symbol|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Five pointed stars have been around since the dawn of recorded history. Pentacles were used by the ancient Greeks to symbolize the musical octave. From there it became a Christian symbol, and represented the five wounds of Christ. It was used extensively in the Masonic Lodge (mainly for its ancient Greek associations). In the late 19th century British magical societies like the Golden Dawn adopted it as a magical symbol representing the for elements plus "spirit." Then, in the 1950's Gerald Gardner adopted it as a symbol for his new religion called "Wicca." Since then it has been a common symbol among neopagans (even though it was not a common symbol in ancient paganism). In the late 70's the Church of Satan adopted the inverted pentacle as a symbol of satanism.|`|JMOLRKRraa	I think God gave info to Solomon.<br>  Not sure if Enoch had the info earlier.

Olympias was not the only wife of Philip and there was much conflict between Alexander's parents. <br>  <br>  Tutored by Leonidas (possibly his uncle) and the great Greek philosopher Aristotle. <br>  <br>  During his youth, Alexander tamed the wild horse Bucephalus. Later, when his beloved horse died, Alexander renamed a city in India for Bucephalus. <br>  <br>  In 340 B.C., while father Philip went off to fight rebels, Alexander was made regent in Macedonia. During Alexander's regency, the Maedi of northen Macedonia revolted. Alexander put down the revolt and renamed their city Alexandroupolis. <br>  <br>  In 336 B.C. his father Philip was assassinated, and Alexander the Great became ruler of Macedonia. <br>  <br>  Had several rivals executed in order to secure the throne.<br>  <br>  For info on topic at this site.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|tewPHeY7aa	alexander is so great because he was so young when he died he never had a down fall. read this for some info but don't plagiarize <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_t...</a>|`|Y6zzfebqaa	just visit this site  -   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_t...</a>|`|7Sslop1Baa	Get a life!

1jGEeMDYaa	It could mean that you have a mental condition called narcissism. Yes, it's a real mental condition where people are obsessed with themselves, beyond what would be considered a normal way of being pleased with your looks. These people are not necessarily gay. You may want to look up a definition. And speak to a mental health professional to help you make a clear diagnosis.|`|08QtgdpOaa	I don't think it's narcissism or vanity etc. If you're gay then yeah, I suppose you could be attracted to yourself. I know seeing myself dressed nicely and groomed *sometimes* does more for me than it should lol, but I don't think I'm that great looking anyway so.. Even though I think you are, if you're truly and honestly not gay, then I have no idea why you'd be sexually attracted to yourself. Maybe you could try enumerating the things you don't like about yourself, and concentrate on them. Or you could either put on a load of weight or become anorexic, lol.

qXvFsnOcaa	It would depend on which accent you have. I've spent some time in Britain before and there are lots of different accents for the different regions.<br>  <br>  Both Canadians and Americans tend to like the "Hugh Grant" type accent because it's associated with sophistication and being a lady/gentlemen, but they probably wouldn't even recognize a Geordie or Brummy accent as being British, and they'd certainly not like the accent that chavs speak with.<br>  <br>  Mostly this is the fault of television. British characters on US television tend to fall into two stereo typed characters. Cheeky cockneys or posh sophisticates. The later of which are usually portrayed as being classy and well educated (the dashing hero/villain or the sophisticated lady). For example, pretty much any character played by Hugh Grant, or Emily from Friends. This tends to warp their perception of the English accent and of the kind of people who have it.
taElYijzaa	It's a fancy. Though in China most people hope it will happen one day,few know the serious problems here.<br>     Every year there are several riots by the local people in some areas.<br>  The government usually block any news about it, and use policemen to suppress the people.<br>     The communist worry their rule rather than development. Hence, the freedom of speech improve very slowly.<br>      Last year, an big riot took place in GuangAn, the hometown of Deng XiaoPing.   The gov's hospital refuse to save the life of a small child because of the child have no money.<br>     many teachers and students around GuangAn began to gather in the hospital and ask for justice. Because of angry, the students began to smash the facilities. Then the gov use army and gun to drive the crowd. many were killed. and all news were blocked.<br>     One of my dorm-mate is from GuangAn, he told us the whole thing.<br>  Now the hospital is shut up.<br>       But I feel angry until now.

And that the wisdom of this world can't fathom the creation as man's reasoning  is all foolishness to God. I didn't grow up as a Christian and so wasn't brain washed into it. I saw the evidence produced by top scientists in their fields stating evolution was and is impossible. This has been demonstrated more and more now that the complexity of DNA has been observed.

lfjTRFzFaa	I wouldn't worry about it Zombies only kill to feed on Brains.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	They are coming in less than 18 years I have heard, it would be scarier than imagining to be one of those living guys in Dawn of the Dead. If you die at all during it than you are a zombie unless your flesh gets eaten you'd just see pitch black. Because zombies will come when hell is over filled with demons. Heaven will unreachable anymore for the demons wanting to go there. You will be scared as hell. More than you ever have been. I am using my time wisely waiting for it, ready to survive. You can only kill them by a lead-silver bullet into their brain. It will be like wishing you were dead but wishing you could live forever because you would just be seeing nothing forever after you die. No rebirth. It will suck. I got my life to live but we all have to live with the zombies. But when they do come we will have the whole world dead and a zombie, like people might die from a heart attack or something. Zombies can climb stairs. They are smart like us but just seem dumb. Blowing them up with a nuclear missile wont kill them. Nothing except a shotgun bullet right into their brain. They will never stop walking the earth, even if there is no living population left. They will never stop. It is impossible to kill them all. You can't stay on-top of a building or something the zombies can jump super high, crash right threw walls. Run super fast. Even throw 2 cars 7 miles at the same time. We wont be ready. Here is some things I researched:<br>  <a href="http://zombies.monstrous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zombies.monstrous.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.monstrous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monstrous.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/158995" rel="nofollow">http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/15...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-s...</a><br>  It can happen any second right now. But it has to be in less than 18 years. I hear this a lot and it is really true. It is a real fact. Sorry for making this so long but just some information on zombies. And everything I told you so far is true but not even close to be like a real zombie invasion. It could happen right... now or any time between now and 18 years. 18 years is the maximum amount of time we have. So it can happen any second until 18 years. It has to happen in that time. Scientist have discovered that. And it sucks. Hope I didn't scare you but again, this is real news. Shocking isn't it. Although we have 20% chance they could be wrong I hope. So let's just hope they are wrong so far ehh,?|`|pjYn6PbCaa	I bet it would feel more like a giant reunion for you.|`|DOVhPN03aa	And this would happen why?|`|dzfArr3daa	1)The zombie plague is worldwide.The zombies numbers would grow very fast if it reached the airports and other means of evacuation entire countries would be taken over.<br>  <br>  2)Use the army to subdue the epidemic,send out an alert.When there is no longer zombies threatening america go to other countries.<br>  <br>  3)It would take over large cities but open country side could easily be kept zombie free.<br>  <br>  4)They would send tanks in with sirens and helicopters.<br>  <br>  5)This situation would be treated in the same way as shooting an intruder or any other person who was trying to kill you.It would count as self defense.<br>  <br>  6)If there was witnesses then the murderer would be considered mentally instable if he doesn't confess.<br>  <br>  7)If a dangerous animal was found in the store the shop could be sued,<br>  If the person was to die on the premises because of hunger or killed by zombies the store would be held responsable.<br>  <br>  8)Yes zombies can't go eveywhere.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	I *hate* the fast zombies. I really, truly do. <br>  <br>  Since World War Z is one of my favorite books, and many of my friends and I have had long discussions about the zombie plague, I feel I'm well  prepared. I know that eventually even I would run out of ammo and that a crowbar is the desired replacement weapon. It is a multi-functional tool. Not only for zombie-bashing, but also demolition and construction.<br>  <br>  Containment would be a major issue. We know that some people would be in denial about their status as one of the infected and attempt to hide this. If they were to hide it effectively, they would be able to infect those in the secured area once they turned. It would be incredibly difficult to contain and the more people you had in a secure area, the more potential for things to go horribly, terribly wrong. Major urban areas should just be carpet bombed. I hate to say it, but that would really be the best course of action. Smaller groups that had fled urban areas would be responsible for their own survival and keeping themselves infection-free.<br>  <br>  Barack Obama would be doing what the rest of us would be doing - getting out of urban areas and somewhere that is easily defensible, has resources necessary for human survival and being ever vigilant.<br>  <br>  It would  definitely spread  world wide. People are paranoid now about someone contracting something like Ebola or Marburg, getting on a plane not knowing they were infected and then bleeding out someplace like San Francisco international airport or O'Hare. We can travel around the globe in mere hours - which is so fast you wouldn't even know if someone was infected, especially in the early stages of the zombie plague.<br>  <br>  I think the best course of action is to go to an "everyone for themselves"  philosophy as far as the government is concerned. It's also the one I'm sure they'd take. If you look at the way we conduct wars now while we are zombie-free, you'll notice that most governments accept "collateral damage" as unavoidable. <br>  <br>  No. If you shoot someone who is infected, you are doing everyone around you a favor. Good luck getting someone to testify against the shooter in that case. <br>  <br>  If you shot someone in an argument who wasn't infected, I imagine the others in your colony/settlement would deal with that person themselves. Working together with a small, easily manageable group would  be key to survival. You couldn't have a violent individual in your midst. It is detrimental to the group as a whole.<br>  <br>  I don't think you'd be expected to pay for anything once the zombie situation was under control. The chances of the owner of such goods not only surviving but also finding  you and proving that you stole from them are pretty slim. Not only that, the whole way of doing "business"  would undoubtedly be changed for many generations. I think we'd go back to a bartering system rather than a wealth/money based system.<br>  <br>  This human would definitely survive. My little circle of friends and I talk about this kind of thing much more than is entirely healthy. (We also play zombie kickball and go on zombie walks. WHEEEEE!) I'm very well  prepared. Not that I wouldn't be traumatized, I'm sure. But I would definitely survive it. The only thing we haven't been able to successfully resolve amongs ourselves - can zombies climb trees? I say "no" but others have put out some very good points detailing how *some* zombies may be able to climb trees. So  I won't assume climbing a tree will keep me out of reach. Problem solved, no?|`|D4WWNPGiaa	Take it this way. If it spreads world wide, it will have to end. It may sweep our nation so quickly that Obama will not have much time to do anything. If the zombies survive in a small number, they will probably stick to the shadows, so they could not be expected to pay for stolen food and so on.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening/improving one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE in the online world these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember to keep your attitude positive!|`|DWLfKACYaa	yes.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

lNlL0Ag2aa	The humans that originated there were all white covered with hair. As hair started losing it's growth and our skin was exposed, the skin darkened based on the sun. But by the time we became hairless, we were all scattered so skin color developed when the Africans already migrated.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  I am studying this in college so don't thumbs me down when you don't really know if I'm wrong. Humans did originate in Africa, but we were all covered with fur so our skin remained pale white. It was when we lost our hair that our skin changed color but by the time our hair thinned out, we were already scattered around Eurasia and Africa. Thus, the sun determined the skin color. <br>  <br>  So those who remained in Africa under direct sunlight grew darker than those who were closer to the North and South poles farther from the equator. The equator is the middle of the Earth where the sunlight is most direct so that is where the darkest skin will be located in.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	The evolution of dark skin is intrinsically linked to the loss of body hair in humans. By 1.2 million years ago, all people having descendants today had the same receptor protein of today's Africans; their skin was dark, and the intense sun killed off the progeny with any lighter skin that resulted from mutational variation in the receptor protein.[5] This is significantly earlier than the speciation of Homo sapiens from Homo erectus some 250,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Dark skin helps protect against skin cancer that develops as a result of ultraviolet light radiation, causing mutations in the skin.[citation needed] Furthermore, dark skin prevents an essential B vitamin, folate, from being destroyed. Therefore, in the absence of modern medicine and diet, a person with dark skin in the tropics would live longer, be healthier and likelier to reproduce than a person with light skin. White Australians have some of the highest rates of skin cancer as evidence of this expectation.[6] Conversely, as dark skin prevents sunlight from penetrating the skin it hinders the production of vitamin D3. Hence when humans migrated to less sun-intensive regions in the north, low vitamin D3 levels became a problem and lighter skin colors started appearing. The people of Europe, who have low levels of melanin, naturally have an almost colorless skin pigmentation, especially when untanned. This low level of pigmentation allows the blood vessels to become visible and gives the characteristic pale pink color of white people. The primary difference in skin color between blacks and whites is however a minor genetic difference accounting for just one letter in 3.1 billion letters of DNA.[7]|`|EmOnt7FIaa	As people who originated from Africa got further away from the continent their features started to change due to environemental conditions.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	I love my Black features and I feel like I got lucky, I'm glad I don't have a weird nose that's shaped like a foot and nasty stringy hair and gross pale skin!|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Yeah...

So just except that and move on.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Adaptation to different climates. It is believed that the gene that possesses the skin tone of "White" was a mutation that couldn't have been suppressed any longer due to the fact that they were living in much colder climates. Compare this to how such mutation would prove dangerous to living in the sweltering heat of Africa.|`|AA11238703	according to what i've read it's because humans need white/transparent skin to absorb enough vitamin D from sunlight to be healthy.  it was an adaptation to living in northern climates where there was much less sunlight.  <br>  <br>  it seems you are thanking god for not being black, which is ok but should help you understand things like black pride - a black person is probably thanking  god that they are not white.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	With your, "thanks god" remark you're obviously a bigot and not an intelligent one at that.

Not all people from Africa are black.  Anyways, I believe that it is widely thought that the people that migrated out of Africa weren't actually the same as were are now.  In other words, they hadn't adapted to their new environments that they would be living in for the next millions of years in Europe and Asia.  The people who didn't leave Africa kept adapting to THAT environment.  I'm not saying we're not the same species, i'm just saying our ancestors evolved to adapt to where they lived.|`|8iJe2S2Daa	Its called evolution genius. Scientists can tell when something is a living species when it adapts to its surroundings. White people lived in caves for many thousands of years in cold temperatures and lost all the pigment in their skin. White skin absorbs sunlight, thats why people with white skin need to beware of global warming. Black skin reflects sunlight because Africa was hot. Their hair is like that to protect their scalps. Oh you are a genius if you didn't know that.|`|AA10320630	That's about the stupidest question I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  Both black people and white people have evolved from the original humans who lived in africa.

Two, we don't look alike and there are different races due to evolution and regionalism, and the adaptations that humans make. When humans evolved and migrated, they separated from eachother and formed their own groups in different places. This caused regionalism resulting in different cultures and life, and different adaptations to the body needed. For instance an Alaskan native will have much better tolerance to the cold than a native American in say, Peru, will. It's probably just adaptations to certain regions that humans lived in.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	Because you, Scott- are a mutation. That is why you have no pigment (meaning, you burn like hell, you wrinkle in 25 years tops and your ears get HUGE) your bodies had to adapt to it's COLD,WET, DARK climates in the caves.<br>  <br>  add: oh, yes, I agree- 'thanks God" Thanks that I don't have to worry about looking like that creature on the Lord of the Rings.

Beyond that, I'd have to point out that all sources  'verifying' Jesus' existence have been debunked, or are extremely questionable.<br>  <br>  Not to mention everything the Bible gets wrong about what has happened. I mean, it is bound to get some things right, or be cloudy enough to be interpreted as such. But what about everything it got wrong?|`|G4SVG7tKaa	You need to stop trolling through biased Christian websites if you want to find that archaeologically, geologically, and historically, you will find not a shred of evidence for the existence of the divine Jesus nor the veracity of the contents of the New Testament. Google the History Channel or the Discovery Channel's sites and get the real deal about the gigantic hoax that is Christianity.<br>  <br>  With all this so-called "evidence" of ancient manuscripts (the Dead Sea Scrolls being one of them), ask yourself why the NT consists mainly of the words written in the four gospels, with the earliest written 70-80 years after Jesus' supposed death? That's hardly an eyewitness testament to the miraculous events supposedly following Jesus. Where are the eyewitness events from his 12 apostles? Why didn't Jesus himself write anything? Open your eyes to the possibility that your faith is a fraud by reading the information you may readily find in UNBIASED websites. I dare you.<br>  <br>  P.S. When you see the word "apologetics" in the title of a work purporting to "prove" the veracity of the Bible, be very skeptical. There is no need to apologize if what one says is fact based on evidence, so why are there Christian "apologists?"|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	None of that supports the claim that either God or Jesus ever existed.<br>  <br>  Josephus - shown to be forged<br>  Tacitus - refers to the Christians believing in Jesus, it does not say they are justified in the belief.<br>  <br>  etc.<br>  <br>  There is no evidence to support the major claims, sorry. In fact, the evidence actually points the other way. For instance, Nazareth was not an inhabited settlement in the first century CE. Arthur Drews, a famous theologian, showed in 1911 that Jesus is a myth, and he has never been shown wrong<br>  <br>  edit: Says your creationist website, right?

I had that and a number of other direct experiences. They are cosmic in their scope (and not a druggie kind of thing), this comes from knowing how to become "Children of the Light" as Christ himself was preaching. Click on my avatar if you want more context, and an online resource that explains these things in an entertaining way.<br>  <br>  Spiritual experiences are real.... one only has to know how to increase the light and be persistent to have them.|`|casg30Ataa	spiritual-no<br>  <br>  ghostly-no, wait actually yes; when i drink alot i get kinda pale<br>  <br>  out of body- yes, i did some ketamine once and i literally just left my body and was a single point just floating thru space... no joke.|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	I've had many out-of-body experiences.

This is to differentiate between O.B.E's which are external dealing often with what people call astral realms or merely moving a part from the body. A Inner body experience is when you enter into a higher state and reality of MIND and BEING -- drawn into the reality of your Higher Soul-Self. It is this same reality that many people experience in NDE's, when they encounter a Being of Light. This Being of Light is their Higher Soul-Self. The difference between my experiences is that I achieved this by work on myself, work that transforms oneself and expands the consciousness. In such a state all can be proven and known and one can see how the world truly is. <br>  <br>  I have seen ghost as well, particularly when I was a child. They are disincarnate spirits. It would freak me out when I was child, as I remember one occasion sending a night over a friends house and when were asleep, I saw two ghost walk by like they were just living a normal life.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	I have.. it is a very interesting and scary thing.

Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!<br>  <br>  As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I see a lot of both sides.

Atheists believe that Christians are wasting part of their lives, and living indoctrinated by superstition. They are actually trying to help them in their mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  Christians proselytize to atheists too. They believe that everlasting life in the Kingdom of God is a possibility everyone should have, and that everyone deserves. How bad would a christian have to hate an atheist, to not share that belief with them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It goes both ways.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Cry more.<br>  <br>  There is a huge difference between obnoxious atheists laughing in the faces of believers and systems of oppression and power that force religious dogma into the faces of everyone through different societal institutions.

They say marriage is for anyone who loves each other. They use terms like evidence and facts. They recruit people into their weekly evolution studies. its because they fairy tales about common ancestors-( I mean they believe we came from chimpanzees not that they are just a related species) not to mention they trust in the technology and the 12 hour a day 6 days a week studying scientists with degrees from places like Harvard.<br>  and the world being millions of years old.I mean they even think that it is impossible for miracles like hunger being solved and moutians cast into te ocean. They just want to promote violence and control unlike the 4 year BA people from Liberty University.  I mean its a fact the world is 10,000 years old and girls evovled from a rib.<br>   <br>  <br>  and lets not forget what our peaceful book teaches:<br>  Who killed someone because they were wicked (according to their holy book)<br>  a.Muslims<br>  b.jews<br>  c.christians<br>  d.all of the above<br>  <br>  who rapped people: (according to their holy book(s)<br>  a.muslims<br>  b.jews<br>  c.christians<br>  d.two or more of the above<br>  <br>  Are jews pure evil in the Old testament God ordered the murder of innocent children, and ripping open stomach of ladies<br>  <br>  (isa.13:16) ( abortion is a sin)<br>  16[a] Samaria(A) shall bear her guilt,<br>  because(B) she has rebelled against her God;<br>  they shall fall by the sword;<br>  (C) their little ones shall be dashed in pieces,<br>  and their(D) pregnant women ripped open. (but it does not say they killed the little ones...that would be sin)<br>  <br>  Judges 10:20-24 (true marriage not some kind of sick thing between men)<br>  <br>  20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin. 22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.' "<br>  <br>  23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.<br>  <br>  24 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.<br>  So I am guessing jews are evil to right or no?<br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 5:29 (the reason why you should take care of your temple your body)<br>  <br>  Luke 22:35-38 (Jesus said do not hurt other people)<br>  35And he said to them, "When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing." 36He said to them, "But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. 37For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me:'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me has its fulfillment." 38And they said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." And he said to them, "It is enough."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Revelation 2:22-23 (American Standard Version) (Peaceful warrior)<br>  <br>  22 Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.<br>  <br>  23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.<br>  <br>  So are you a christian, a jew or what, how do you feel about these verses.<br>  <br>  funny true story:<br>  A alien came to earth to see what was going on.He recorded everything he saw. he left and went back to the other aliens. They asked him what was going on. are they happy, sad, peaceful or what what is going on.<br>  <br>  the alien replied, " they are all happy because their gods are helping them. They are all sad because of the false religions leading each other to hell. They are all very peaceful because their God and Prophets and saviors are all very loving and gentile.

There are jobs but it might take a lot of looking.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	READ THIS: IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It was caused by the housing crisis. the government passed a bill in the 70's forcing financial institutions to give out subprime loans to people who couldn't afford them "so underprivileged could have a home." Well during the Clinton presidency they refused to because it would lead them to bankruptcy. So then Obama (THATS RIGHT OBAMA) sued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2003 and 2005 George Bush (YES THATS RIGHT GWB) and McCain recognized what was happening and tried to prevent it but the bills that were proposed got blocked in congress. When all these banks failed people lost their money so they stopped spending which is why retailers are now giving massive layoffs. Since these institutions failed the ones that havent are scared to give out loans fearing people wont be able to pay them back which is why you hear the media bitching about how the credit market is frozen. This is also why GM and Chrysler are going bankrupt because people usually take out a loan to pay for their car. That's also why theres massive foreclosures.<br>  <br>  Conclusion ITS THE ******* GOVERNMENT'S FAULT!|`|NrzxtivLaa	businesses are imploding along with the financial system all thanks to a bunch of greedy investors and CEOs|`|wc6N5sxOaa	There are no jobs in America because of many reasons.

971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	I think a problem with tradition is that it usually doesn't give any room for adjustments or new concepts or practices, so people will get stuck in a "well, this is the way we'll do this because this is the way we've always done it" routine.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The corrupt Pharisees of Jesus' time heaped rule upon rule and statute upon statute in order to virtually enslave the Jewish people under an onerous system designed to generate revenue and centralize power for the corrupt men who were then in authority.<br>  <br>  Jesus said of these men to "Do as they say, but not as they do" since they sat in the chair of Moses, and they had the God-given authority to teach in God's name, yet they did not conduct themselves according to God's law.  <br>  <br>  False traditions of men, based only on their own novel interpretations of scripture, serve to needlessly divide the Christian Church.<br>  <br>  Good examples of novel false traditions are those of the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormons, the Seventh Day Adventists, and some notable Messianic Jewish groups.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, genuine sacred tradition is the way the Holy Spirit infallibly guides the authentic Church from age to age, and since like the Bible, this type of tradition is God-inspired, there is nothing wrong with it at all.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	The only bad thing is that you can end up following something that you find you don't really agree with.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	There's only one bad thing.

Why would anyone think this stuff is still relevant?<br>  <br>  I suggest you make up some simplistic stuff to answer these, then ignore them. Most of the nurses I've worked with over the last 32 years were atheist or agnostic (I am the former) and you're going to discover there isn't time in your day, if you're giving effective care, to worry about spooks and spirits. There's nothing like the realities of health care to make you realize the silliness of our religions and the misplaced dependence on the supernatural.<br>  <br>  The answer to numbers 2 and 3 are: Call the hospital chaplain for a referral, let the God-squad handle it, and get back to real patient care. <br>  <br>  Empathy is the ability, essential to nursing, to put yourself in another's place.

mP6ox5f3aa	Absolutely not, England was stable under Charles the first although his wife was a possible cause of trouble. Cromwell was not a nice man as is depicted. He and some of his military officers became wealthy and in spite of being Quakers dealt in the slave trade and the exploitation of the West Indies. Cromwell's ancestor changed the family name to  Cromwell, who was someone at the court of Henry 8th. another murderer..<br>  Cromwell did not give ordinary people the vote at all, only the land owners. After the 11 year Parliamentary rule under Cromwell, people were fed up and glad to have a King back again.<br>  A lesson for the anti monarch misfits of today. Learn from History!|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	He was executed there is no "should have been" about it . . .|`|GHefTsUyaa	He was King of Britain,not just bloody England!!! <br>  He was born in Dunfermline,Fife and the Stuart dynasty goes back to the 14th.century!<br>  <br>  Alba gu brath.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I think the previous answers miss the fact that Charles almost wanted to be executed.

Killing a reigning monarch was by no means unusual. Although parliamentary democracy was starting to happen and indeed this particular act gve the process a boost, any figure like Charles posed a threat to the people trying to run the country. Everyone was fed up with fighting the civil war but had they let Charles live he would have presented a figure head for dedicated Royalists to rally round even if he was imprisoned or exiled. So while the parliamentarians were in a very strong position they could still have been outbreaks of violence which nobody really wanted. So I would say they really had no choice. In the town were I live there is a house with a large room where it is said Miles Corbet and other leaders of the parliamentarians met and decided, prior to the trial, that they would execute Charles. It is known as the "Conspiracy Room."|`|fQmJSlEyaa	I don't believe in the death penalty so i don't think he should have been executed .

This event is one of the most famous in Stuart England's history - and one of the most controversial. No law could be found in all England’s history that dealt with the trial of a monarch so the order setting up the court that was to try Charles was written by a Dutch lawyer called Issac Dorislaus and he based his work on an ancient Roman law which stated that a military body (in this case the government) could legally overthrow a tyrant. The execution of Charles, lead to an eleven year gap in the rule of the Stuarts (1649 to 1660) and it witnessed the rise to supreme power of Oliver Cromwell - whose signature can be clearly seen on the death warrant of Charles.<br>  <br>  Charles was put on trial in London on January 1st 1649. He was accused of being a <br>  <br>  "tyrant, traitor and murderer; and a public and implacable enemy to the Commonwealth of England." <br>  <br>  He was to be tried by 135 judges who would decide if he was guilty or not. In fact only 68 turned up for the trial. Those that did not were less than happy about being associated with the trial of the king. In fact, there were plenty of MP’s in Parliament who did not want to see the king put on trial but in December 1648, these MP’s had been stopped from going into Parliament by a Colonel Pride who was helped by some soldiers. The only people allowed into Parliament were those who Cromwell thought supported the trial of the king. This Parliament was known as the "Rump Parliament" and of the 46 men allowed in (who were considered to be supporters of Cromwell), only 26 voted to try the king. Therefore even among those MP's considered loyal to Cromwell, there was no clear support to try Charles. <br>  <br>  The Chief Judge was a man called John Bradshaw. He sat as head of the High Court of Justice. He was not one of the original 135 judges but none of the 68 that did turn up wanted to be Chief Judge and the job was given to Bradshaw, who was a lawyer. He knew that putting Charles on trial was not popular and he actually feared for his own life. He had made for himself a special hat which had metal inside it to protect his head against an attack. It was Bradshaw who read out the charge against Charles; that he <br>  <br>  "out of a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people of England." <br>  <br>  The hall where the king was tried was packed with soldiers - to protect the judges or to make sure that the king did not escape? The public was not allowed into the hall until after the charge had been read out. Why would the government do this if their case against Charles was good?<br>  <br>  At the trial, Charles refused to defend himself. He did not recognise the legality of the court. He also refused to take off his hat as a sign of respect to the judges who did attend. This seemed to confirm in the minds of the judges that Charles, even when he was on trial for his life, remained arrogant and therefore a danger to others as he could not recognise his own faults.<br>  <br>  Bradshaw announced the judgment of the court : that <br>  <br>  "he, the said Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, traitor, murderer and <br>  public enemy to the good of this nation, shall be put to death by severing of his head from his body." <br>  <br>  When the judgment of the court was announced, Charles finally started to defend himself. He was told that his chance had gone and the king of England was bundled out of the court by the guarding soldiers. <br>  <br>  His date of execution was set for January 30th1649.<br>  <br>  Charles was executed on a Tuesday. It was a cold day. Charles was allowed to go for a last walk in St James’s park with his pet dog. His last meal was bread and wine. However, there was a delay in his execution.<br>  <br>  The man who was to execute Charles refused to do it. So did others. Very quickly, another man and his assistant was found. They were paid ￡100 and were allowed to wear masks so that no-one would ever know who they were.<br>  <br>  At nearly 2.00 o’clock in the afternoon, Charles was lead to the scaffold which was covered in black cloth. He had asked to wear thick underclothes under his shirt as he was very concerned that if he shivered in the cold, the crowd might think that he was scared. Charles gave a last speech to the crowd but very few could hear him. He said:<br>  <br>  "I have delivered to my conscience; I pray God you do take those courses that are best for the good of the kingdom and your own salvation." <br>  <br>  It is said that when he was beheaded a large groan went up throughout the crowd. One observer in the crowd described it as "such a groan by the thousands then present, as I never heard before and I desire I may never hear again."<br>  <br>  Even in death, Charles found no dignity. Spectators were allowed to go up to the scaffold and, after paying, dip handkerchiefs in his blood as it was felt that the blood of a king when wiped onto a wound, illness etc. would cure that illness.<br>  <br>  On the 6th February, 1649, the monarchy was abolished. Parliament stated that <br>  <br>  "the office of the king in this nation is unnecessary, burdensome and dangerous to the liberty, society and public interest of the people." <br>  <br>  What became known as a Council of State was set-up instead of the monarchy and Oliver Cromwell was its first chairman. <br>  <br>  When Charles II returned to become king of England in 1660, those men who had signed his father’s death warrant (and were still alive) were tried as regicides (the murderer of a king) and executed. Anyone associated with the execution of Charles was put on trial. Apparently the only people to escape were the executioners as no-one knew who they were as they wore masks during the execution.<br>  <br>  So your answer depends on whether you believe that monarchies are supreme, and god given (rather than an accident of birth and ancestry) or whether Charles should have given heed to Parliament, whether you think the execution was lawful, or whether laws were made to render the situation lawful<br>  <br>  What do YOU think?<br>  Halcon
Hs10ZIrnaa	I think you have a point, but to be honest with you I am flattered by women who tell me they have a crush on me, its a very sweet and cool thing. You should try to talk to them in a different way than just telling them you are gay, because when you say it in those situations you might offend someone you don't want to offend. Just say, I am seeing someone else, or say i think we can be friends, and see where it goes, and then talk to them about being gay. This way, not only do you give them the opprtunity to see other people, you give them a chance to be a part of your life in other ways, I mean who couldn't use a new friend?|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Same way he should handle it if a gay guy he was not at all attracted to had a crush on him/  Why should it be any different?|`|Fzn0ObQoaa	I think being honest is best. Keep doing what you're doing.|`|a8687a650a19834bc4b30491b67daa9baa	I think you are letting them down in the best way you can. It's a bit odd that these girls don't know you're gay, though. I mean, if they get to know you long enough to get a crush, you'd think that'd be long enough to find out you're gay... But anyway, at least the reason you are giving them is something they can do nothing about. You know, it's nothing they'll feel bad about themselves over.|`|QwNZsTaEaa	welll.....just tell them your.....not looking for a relationship at the moment and then if they ever ask u out or something gently i mean GENTLEY tell them you are gay and tell them that they'll meet some1 really nice and stuff like that.just be like um "ur a great girl but im not looking for a relationship right now" or something......<br>  <br>  <br>  hope it helped|`|paRqMN9xaa	Being honest is the best thing to do.

I told her I was gay and she asked if I was just saying that, so I did not have to sleep with her! <br>  Long story short, she said I should never tell him about my sexuality, and we should never speak of it again.  She told him anyway, and when I wanted to tell him, she already had.  Now, they are divorced and he and I are still friends, just friends - no benefits.

JWjq5iaXaa	Oh boy, these are going to be fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  1.If he's alone, he's most likely the only one. For some reason, zombies tend to stick together, even though they're too stupid to understand the mechanics of teamwork. It's almost like an instinct, and they stay in packs. It's possible, though, that there was a mob of zombies who were equidistant from several sources of food (humans), and they went their seperate ways, but that's unlikely. I'd say he's alone.<br>  <br>  2. Is he scratching or banging? If he's using his fingernails on a glass door, he'll never get in. We'll assume he can't figure out how to move the door aside to get in, so he'll break his way in. Unless he's banging his arms and legs, he's not going to get in. He'll probably start to bang eventually, so I'd give it a minimum of 30 minutes before he breaks his way in.<br>  <br>  3. It depends... Barricading the door is just delaying the inevitable, because, as stated in #2, you've only got around 30 minutes or more, so you can't build a fully-working barricade, and there are other entrances in the house. I suggest you stay away from the door (or get someone to watch it if you're not alone), find a weapon or a means of killing it, and return to the door. Then, take care of business. Set up your shot, open the door, and bang.<br>  <br>  4. No, don't shoot it through the door. Considering there's only one, you'll have time to perfect your shot between the time you open the door and the time you shoot him. Take the advantage and shoot him when you open the door... a little blood on the carpet is a hell of a lot better than a zombie bite. The main reason you shouldn't shoot it through the door is because that would break the glass, and just in case there WERE more zombies, you'll need that door.<br>  <br>  5. Keep the body chained up, just in case you didn't actually kill it. Keep a watch on it, don't go to sleep. Wait until morning, or when there are people are around. Report it to the government, and our good CIA will take care of the problem. Unless of course, the zombies have spread. In that case, shoot the body again (just in case), throw it in a bush, and prepare yourself for the masses.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I love zombies.<br>  <br>  1) No he is not the only one! Others are surely behind him<br>  <br>  2) They will break it eventually<br>  <br>  3) Never barricade the door! You will be locking yourself in, and they will eventually break the door down. You should try and shoot it...or escape if you can<br>  <br>  4)...Hmm...Well, they're immune to fire I think...so...Just chop off it's head, you don't have to do anything to it's body.<br>  <br>  BTW - GET A SHOTGUN! <br>  <br>  See this is what zombie books cause...now I'm all obsessed<br>  <br>  lol whoops I missed one. No don't shoot it through the door because you have to get a head shot.|`|GKHNm3Svaa	nope the others are behind you. i give you about 2 minutes to run before the glass breaks. barricading the door would be the best idea. no dont shoot through the door. burn baby burn|`|VPCl2C9daa	.....duh!|`|96AQZUGyaa	1) Maybe. He hasn't rotted yet so he may be the first infected one. If he got infected recently the odds are you'd have noticed the first zombie.<br>  <br>  2) A minute.<br>  <br>  3) Escape. The zombie knows where you live. Others will come.<br>  <br>  4) Yes. A glass door is nothing worth saving.<br>  <br>  5) Cut off head, set on fire.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	1. if it was a zombie it finding you would attract more zombies so if it was alone it won't be for long<br>  <br>  2. soon<br>  <br>  3. do you have somewhere to go? yes= leg it there and kill the zombie, if it follows it will bring more with it. no = kill it then baricade then go up stairsand see if more are coming<br>  <br>  4. yes it's safer, and beens it's glass easy head shot<br>  <br>  5. burn it<br>  <br>  for better answers read the zombie survival guide
JWjq5iaXaa	Keep asking these questions, they're fun!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Ok, let's get started. If there's two, there's probably more. There might be only the two, but don't take any chances.<br>  <br>  2. A 15 foot drop? It depends, really. If he's climbing his way out, he'll land head first. He'll most likely break a few bones and hurt his head. He'll get up, but he won't be able to move as quickly as other zombies, and will eventually die.<br>  <br>  3. No. Like your other questions, if he's a #3 type zombie, he's not actually "Dead". he's just infected, and he's as alive as a human. If you hit him, he'll react the same way a human did. <br>  <br>  4. Ghostbusters won't do anything. Call the police before the one in the bathroom escapes.|`|GKHNm3Svaa	theres 500 more. nope he would kill you for the fun of it. he is cause he wants to. and you should call the funny farm.|`|VPCl2C9daa	it IS a stupid question, everyone knows you call ghostbusters....duh.|`|96AQZUGyaa	15 feet off the ground, zombies can't jump or climb.<br>  <br>  1) Never think so.<br>  <br>  2) No.<br>  <br>  3) You can't "kill" a zombie since they're dead. The only way is to destroy the brain or decapitation.<br>  <br>  4) Rob Zombie.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	1. there will be more coming<br>  <br>  2. can't get out the window<br>  <br>  3. nope not at all<br>  <br>  4. i was gonna say that but i say your parentheses so the order of light, police military

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4.

They sound the same, but mean different things.<br>  <br>  In regards to Chinese with tones, as long as it is not a terribly ambiguous situation, a native speaker should have no problem figuring out what you are saying.  Just listen, for instance, to some movies where Mandarin is the main language.  Take Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  He speaks a lot in kind of a loud, rushed, whisper...you can't discern tones that well.  The same with when someone gets angry and yells...tones are sometimes lost.  From context, you can figure out what they are saying|`|a6JZjRG1aa	"to duck" and "a duck" are two different words actually... <br>  a verb and a noun...<br>  wrong tone may turn a word to a homonym...<br>  if example if you hear a sentence: <br>  "and noble night was praised by the king" <br>  will you hear it as "night" or as "knight"?... the latter i suppose...<br>  homonyms and variety of meanings is a common feature for any human language...|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	Question: Does the spoken Chinese language use context the same as spoken English? <br>  <br>  Answer: Sometimes YES, sometimes NO. <br>  <br>  Reason is: <br>  It totally depends on the context. Tones isn't really of much use if a person is angry or depressed. <br>  <br>  The noun = [The] duck. The verb = "To duck", not "To the duck!" <br>  In Chinese, sometimes a noun can be turned into a verb, but mostly it can't. <br>  <br>  if I use the wrong tone when saying something in Chinese, will the listener be able to use situational or conversational context to ascertain my intended tone? Yes or No, depending on how closely it is spoken when compared to correct Chinese. <br>  <br>  When you say "Chinese", I will assume you meant Mandarin, unless otherwise listed: There's other dialects in Chinese, where Mandarin is the official dialect.|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	All languages use context.

1TYZDRUqaa	Despite what some people think, CAtholics are Christians.  Not all Christians are Catholics, though.  Christian worship differs from denomination to denomination.  Baptists have there traditions, Methodists have their traditions and so on.  There are some non-denominational CHRISTIAN churches that do not follow any organized group, and these non-denomination groups would have there own traditions as well.  The one thing all christians share, weather they be Mormon, JW, Catholic, Baptist, or any of the other thousands of denominations is that they all believe in the divinity of  JESUS CHRIST.  Anything else may be unique to there particular branch.

What you meant to ask is the differences between the Catholic Church and Protestant churches.  The Catholoic Church is founded and approved by Christ, and teaches the fullness of Christian truth.  Protestant churches are founded by men in violation of the stated will of Christ "that they all may be ONE". They teach a mix of genuine Christian truth received from the Catholic Church and new traditions of men introduced by their many human fonders.|`|boqwvEvUaa	Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity ;) <br>  i think you've covered the basics...|`|7mhRDbvsaa	catholics have priest <br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  christians have pastors|`|jard50Yiaa	The Roman Catholic Church, officially known as the Catholic Church is the world's largest Christian church, representing over half of all Christians and one-sixth of the world's population. The Catholic Church is a communion of 23 sui juris particular churches. Among these are the Western Rite (Latin Rite) and Eastern Catholic Churches comprising 2,782 dioceses. The Church's highest earthly authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance is the pope, currently Benedict XVI who holds supreme authority over the Church in concert with the College of Bishops, of which he is the head. The community is made up of an ordained ministry and the laity; members of either group may belong to organized religious communities.<br>  <br>  The Church defines its mission as spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, administering the sacraments and exercising charity. It operates social programs and institutions throughout the world, including schools, universities, hospitals, missions and shelters, as well as organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas Internationalis and Catholic Charities that help the poor, families, the elderly and the sick.<br>  <br>  Through apostolic succession, the Church believes itself to be the continuation of the Christian community founded by Jesus in his consecration of Saint Peter, a view shared by many historians. It has defined its doctrines through various ecumenical councils, following the example set by the first Apostles in the Council of Jerusalem. On the basis of promises made by Jesus to his apostles, described in the Gospels, the Church believes that it is guided by the Holy Spirit and so protected from falling into doctrinal error.<br>  <br>  Catholic beliefs are based on the Bible and on traditions handed down from the time of the Apostles, which are interpreted by a teaching authority. Those beliefs are summarized in the Nicene Creed and formally detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Formal Catholic worship, termed the liturgy, is regulated by Church authority. The Eucharist, one of seven Church sacraments and the key part of every Catholic Mass or Eastern Catholic Divine Liturgy, is the center of Catholic worship.<br>  <br>  With a history spanning almost two thousand years, the Church is one of the world's oldest institutions, and has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilization since at least the 4th century. In the 11th century, a major split (the Great Schism) occurred between Eastern and Western Christianity, largely as a result of disagreements over papal primacy. The Eastern Orthodox churches became a separate entity from the Catholic Church in the resulting schism. Eastern Churches who remained in or later re-established communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, form the Eastern Catholic churches. In the 16th century, partly in response to the Protestant schism, the Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the Counter-Reformation.<br>  <br>  Although the Church maintains that it is the "one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church" founded by Jesus Christ, where one can find the fullness of the means of salvation, it acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of other Christian communities to bring people to salvation. It believes that it is called by the Holy Spirit to work for unity among all Christians, a movement known as ecumenism. Modern challenges facing the Church include the rise of secularism and opposition to its stances on abortion, euthanasia and contraception.|`|ttcCS2EMaa	My understanding  is that there is a greater  concentration on 'Works'as a path to salvation.  The conflicts  that  created  Protestant Churches were based at least  initially on a rejection of indulgences [purchased  forgiveness or benefit].  The Universal"Catholic" church is Christian of  course but is a more traditional and ritual faith that has  recently allowed for modern trends and adaptation rejected  by the 'home'or 'mother' church. As the older Christian  church it seeks  to manage and  restrict its branch or related  churches.  Adieapa{sp.] are things  not  specificly  mentioned in the Bible. The Orthadox Church is the Eastern equivilent of the Catholic Church and is considered  more traditional and given to more Iconic and specific  differences. {Calendar/Etc]  Most Christian Churches accept the concept of Saints as a more  generalized statement of those who have passed away and are in Heaven.  Whole volumes  have been written on differences..concentrate on those things  common to all- The biggest  difference  now is Literal Belief of Biblical Faith-some  churches Pick and Choose to the exclusion of important priciples and beliefs- Trinity Etc. Even so far as Hell Sin and an incarnate Evil presence or Being.  Love and Faith and Hope are still essential.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Look, you Protestants (or whatever you are) can try to disown the Catholic church all you want, but the fact of the matter is that all of the first Christians were Catholics, and the church itself was set up by the word of Jesus (the literal word. He told Peter to build it).|`|VsCrYYMeaa	The Catholic Church is the Church founded by Jesus.

The proof is in Sacred Scripture (www.drbo.com).<br>  <br>  "And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it...He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me."<br>  <br>  Christ speaks of the so-called and self-styled Christians (Protestants):<br>  <br>  "This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. 9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men."<br>  <br>  Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Hus, Henry VIII, Smith, and many others, were not all these men who taught their own commandments?<br>  <br>  And elsewhere we read:<br>  <br>  "Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven."<br>  <br>  And for those who refuse to accept the teaching authority of the Church, interpreting Scripture on their own:<br>  <br>  "As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction."|`|K8qXXubdaa	Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity, just like Church of England is.<br>  <br>  Catholics are traditionally 'stricter' i guess: against abortion and the likes.

Of course we think about faith but we all are Humans, we need to understand life and read the Holy Quran and learn Islamic History and about Islam in General to have Knowledge and being good Muslims.<br>  <br>  You see slim tall pretty beautiful Girls Revert to Islam everyday, you see rich people, poor people all Revert To Islam.

36164a8dd1b2187b74c9bf3e7b947b3caa	since most of the times restaurant settings allow you to know what the table next to you is ordering its perfectly normal to know...because chances are they ordered it cause they saw your own dish and want something like it! so what i would do is tell someone at my table in a loud voice that this dish was not good! and also tell the waiter again in a loud voice so the person at the table next to you hears you...if none of that works then let it be...|`|qQv2cZ9zaa	Why is it any of your business what anyone else orders, especially at another table? How do you know that it's not the dish, and it's just your personal preference? Maybe they've had it before and it's their favorite?<br>  <br>  It's rude enough to be paying attention to the other table's conversation and even ruder to weigh in on their dining experience. It might be a different situation if it was your best friend and you knew what they liked and didn't like and you thought they might have not realized what they were ordering. A stranger is a different story.|`|YWpGo52Caa	I would mind my own business.  Like others have mentioned, how do you know they don't have different tastes than you do, or that they have had it before and liked it so much that they're having it again?  Unless they ask your opinion, you have no place telling them.  <br>  <br>  Why would they give you a "why didn't you tell me" look?  Unless you quite openly stated your disgust at the meal, nobody would know that you thought it was awful.<br>  <br>  Just let them decide for themselves.|`|m5ViQJPeaa	Don't tell. The person might like the dish, so I prefer not to. And besides, let them have it so they'll have an experience to not order that dish again (If she/he didn't liked it)|`|i0UPqaL4aa	I would definitely tell them. I always have people looking at my plate and I tell them if its good or not, so I would do the same and spare them|`|AA10530246	Tell them and then let them decide for themselves|`|uDoXxSxKaa	Well they may like It never know.|`|BJERgbM5aa	I would definitely mind my own business and keep my mouth shut, especially since the person is a stranger to me.  However, if by chance the person asked me for an opinion of that dish, I would give him my opinion.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	It's recommend, if you'd use Check Spelling, and etiquette-wise you should keep your yap shut, as Shakespeare often said.  It isn't isn't your business, her taste may not be the same as yours, or her dish might be prepared differently.<br>  <br>  IF you really wanted to save the person from disaster, you should talk to the manager about how dreadful your meal was.|`|9H1FZw7xaa	I think it would really depend on the type of restaurant.  For instance, if it is say, a "Burger" place, and the prices are not terribly high, then let them go ahead and order it, they will not be losing too much money.  But, if the reason you don't like it is something you can actually articulate, for instance, it is "dry" "Too salty", seemed over cooked, whatever, and you are in a very expensive restaurant, then I might actually wait until the wait person has gone, and then let them know.  Then they will have the chance to make the decision by themselves.  If they do change their mind after your comments, then they will be the ones to alert the wait person, and change their order.  But you are always taking a big risk if you "butt" your self into any one's space.  Good luck.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	I would probably keep my mouth shut out of shyness.

tJBvGea5aa	One depends on the other. If you intend to carry out any act of worship and your really do intend to do it. then you will. But if you are not that keen on it, they there is a chance you won't. It kind of depends on the degree you really want to do this kind of worship. <br>  <br>  But one great thing in Islam, is that if you think about doing something good but didn't do it, then it will be written as 1 hasanah (good deed), but if you thought about and did it, then it will be written as 10 hasanahs.<br>  <br>  And if you thought about doing something bad, but decided not to do it, then it will be written as 1 hasanah (good deed), but if you thought about it and did it, then it will be written as only 1 bad deed.<br>  <br>  I hope i understood your question well.  <br>  Peace...  :)|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Yes Intentions are more important than the work<br>  because you may do something like giving money to the poor but it will not be accepted from God as your intentions were to show off or you did something in the intentness of helping someone but what you did not help at all. still you are not to blame if you had done your best with good intentions.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Worship what?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chick.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chick.com</a>|`|yIYEmkZyaa	i really like to assess this, but i'm just too busy, is that ok?|`|Zs7DQl5jaa	God is looking for ur intention and ur act|`|uvCMpIilaa	why would you say tat? I disagree though|`|yyUfMfEiaa	The intention is an integral part of the worship so it is neither more or less important that the act itself. Intention must be followed by the act of worship otherwise nothing has been consummated.

KqiiT1WSaa	Hmmmmm thats a hard question<br>  <br>  If the woman was more practicing then i think it would be easier for her to encourage her husband to practice because the husband will be more motivated.<br>  <br>  BUT the things is there are sometimes when the woman can't practice as much, so this will be the man that encourages her to do extra dhikr or anything else that she can do. I think, personally that the man should be the one encouraging overall because the man has to be consistent but he will definitely need the support of his wife and also the wife will need his support. so it has to be a team effort.<br>  <br>  Good and difficult question there.<br>  <br>  Oh and as for methods, i really liked what you wrote in my question that after fajar you have a talk about quran and sunnah and how important the principles of islam are in your life.

DtlQawvgaa	Acts 15:19-21,28 is the Scripture the JW cult typically point to as the reason they refuse to accept blood donations. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:20 says, "Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood." <br>  <br>  It is clear from the context that the instructions were against eating / drinking blood, not blood transfusions. Blood transfusions were not even possible in Bible times, so there is no possibility that this Scripture could be referring to blood transfusions. There were many pagan religious practices that involved eating and drinking blood and/or strangling an animal to keep more of its blood in its meat. <br>  <br>  The Scriptures and all people recognize the difference between eating or drinking something as a food for nourishment or pleasure, as compared to taking the same thing for medical treatment (see 1 Tim. 5:23).<br>  <br>  After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.<br>  <br>  In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.<br>  <br>  In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.<br>  <br>  In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.” At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.<br>  <br>  In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.<br>  <br>  After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””<br>  <br>  In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion. This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. As part of this doctrinal shift, the Watchtower organization warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent them from living eternally in God's new world.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|AA10554783	i'm glad they are relying on the goverment  now.|`|AA12073868	To answer the question,  "Jehovah's witnesses, if blood could be purchased in a meat market, would it still be a problem for medical use?" yes. <br>  <br>   What does the word abstain mean to you?|`|n5AXfWEfaa	They wait around with their mouths pressed against the rectum of the watchtower society just waiting for it to poop out a new thought, belief or assignment.

BUT......the Bible prophesies that a time will come when a cry of "peace and security!" will be sounded, apparently at a time in which mankind's governments feel they are on the verse of bringing it to the world. At that time, when that call goes out (in whatever form it comes), THAT is when "instant destruction" is to come.......in the breaking out of the foretold "great tribulation" which will climax in the battle of Armageddon.|`|NWa45ZDIaa	The Bible doesn't say that Peace & Security is a sign of the end, it says "Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman; and they will by no means escape." 1 Thessalonians 5:3<br>  <br>  The actual "sign of the last days" was given by Jesus himself when he said: "But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth." 2 Timothy 3:1.<br>  <br>  But not to worry, because God would never allow things like global warming to destroy the earth, this is a severe problem that man has himself created, but Revelation 11:18 promises that God "will bring to ruin those ruining the earth." The Bible also holds out many more beautiful promises of a paradise earth, a future we can be hopeful & excited about, not dread. Here's an article titled "A Secure Future at Last!" that touches on these scriptures if you'd like to learn more about what the Bible teaches on this very subject:<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990822/article_04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990822/art...</a>|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	The scriptures does not clearly state the lengh of time prior to and leading up to the disgusting thing that causes desolation. However it does state that the holy city of God is destined to be trampled on by the nations for an appointed time of 42 months.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	You know? You don't have to ask a JW about this because anyone who loves God and values his/her relationship with God can help you to discern this question.<br>  <br>  We do not, NO ONE, knows the exact time or day, but you can easily look around in the world and see that the state our earth is in such chaos and such debauchery that Armageddon is very near. We are truly living in the last days of this wicked world we live in.<br>  <br>  I was a devout JW for many years, but kept noticing cracks or rather, much hypocrisy within the organization. I was shunned for bringing to the attention of the elders, the serious criminal acts including sexual abuse to children and women, fraud, slander that has hurt others, and men behaving like tyrants to single women in the congregations. I then wrote to the society in New York and they did absolutely nothing. <br>  <br>  I then started to research this religion and it is a cult; mind control and brainwashing. They hide serious abuses and criminal acts within their organization from authorities and when someone comes forward, they lie to authorities, continuing to cover up the serious offenses until they are forced to "come clean". They also disfellowship those who come forward.<br>  <br>  I am not exaggerating, but it hurt me to remove myself from this organization because it had long since been part of my life for many years, but do your research because you do have the internet now at your fingertips and that includes researching VARIOUS COURT DOCUMENTS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. ALONE; i.e., MANY COUNTY AND STATE COURTS HAVE ACCESS TO COURT RECORDS ONLINE.<br>  <br>  Much of the time Witnesses (the society) pays hush money, or gets gag orders with the victim or court to shut them up so they don't look bad to the public. This is just like the Catholics and all their secrecy surrounding the many sexual abuses that went ignored, unpunished for so many, many years until these abuses started to be publicly disclosed a decade or so ago. This is what the witnesses do also.<br>  <br>  YOU, questioner, can look around yourself and see that there is not much time left, for God did not want us to live in a world full of crime, death, sickness, murder, rape, and one of the worst sins of all is false organized religions.. the ones at the top stay rich and dilute the scriptures, while the perisheners think they are "in the truth", being in the one and true religion only to learn later that it's a sham, a hoax, something based on spiritism and racism. It is a crock.<br>  <br>  What matters in the end is your personal relationship with God and that you heed accurate Bible truths, not a false religion orchestrated by imperfect and hypocritical men. Do your homework and research. JW's are not what they preach. It's really very sad. The hypocrisy is the worst.<br>  <br>  No one knows the day or time except "The Father".

9Iy69I3Qaa	i belive everything is done for a reason. not that God chooses before hand and has a set plan for us. i dont belive that, im not religious. but things are all done for a reason. people come into your life to change you. wheter it be for the better or the worse. wheter you know them for years or only talk to them for 10 minutes. they do something to change you. each  person impacts you. and as you are going through life meeting all these people, there are the people who you think are close to being your soul mates. the ones you have alot in common with, thoes are the people you end up dating. but often you will realize that there are small differences between you two which shows you two arent as perfect as thought.and you keep dating untill you find the person who is your other half. the person who you were basically made for and feel that you cant live without.<br>  <br>  thats my opinion. but im sure other people have others. but i do feel that even though im only 15, i have found that soul mate. <3|`|OsY0lmTCaa	I do believe in soul-mates, but I see it a little bit differently than most people do.<br>  <br>  Most people view the soul-mate as your perfect lover or partner, I think it's a bit more than that.<br>  <br>  The Soul-mate is literally the other half of your soul. You run into them at various points through the cycle of incarnations. Sometimes they are indeed your perfect lover or partner, but at other times they could be your parent or friend or even an enemy.<br>  <br>  The reason this is, is because we need to learn different things in each incarnation, and our other half helps us to do that. We encounter each other in the manner that reflects the lessons we need to learn in our life.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	I think that we all have several kinds of people out there who could be a soul mate, if we found one of them.

Let's leave that kind of sappy BS to the movies because that's just not reality!  And I don't think we should just be free and date several people without committing to any one person.

It is also a twisted version of earlier creation myths from other cultures that include archetypal structures such as the World Tree (the world axis or central pillar that unites heaven and earth and also stands for the path a person takes to rise from the animal to spiritual realm) and the serpent, who in other cultures represented Time and Timelessness (an attribute of God), regeneration, healing, and wisdom. The deities and mythology of one religion are misunderstood by another and are transformed into the demons of that other religion. This is what we see in the myth of Adam and Eve. On the other hand, the story explains why there is suffering and death in the world. Most religions have a myth about why people suffer and die.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Genesis 2:9 <br>  The "tree of life" was an actual tree, with real fruit (Genesis 3:22; Revelation 22:2) whose properties would have enabled even mortal men to live indefinitely. Though modern scientists may have difficulty in determining the nature of such a remarkable food, they also have been unable so far even to determine the basic physiological cause of aging and death. Thus it is impossible to say scientifically that no chemical substance could exist which might stabilize all metabolic processes and thereby prevent aging<br>  <br>  The same cautions apply to any discussions of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which likewise was genuinely physical. It is conceivable that the fruit contained substances capable of catalyzing physiological decay processes in the body, perhaps affecting even the genetic system. Whether or not this was the case, a "knowledge" of evil would necessarily follow its eating, since evil is fundamentally rejection of God's Word. Man had abundant knowledge of good already since everything God had made was "very good" (Genesis 1:31), but disobedience would itself constitute an experimental knowledge of evil.<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:17<br>  For true fellowship with God (having been created in His image), man must be free to reject that fellowship. The restriction imposed here by God is the simplest, most straightforward test that could be devised for determining man's volitional response to God's love. There was only one minor restraint placed on Adam's freedom and, with an abundance of delicious fruit of all types available, there was no justification for his desiring the one forbidden fruit. Nevertheless, he did have a choice, and so was a free moral agent, capable of accepting or rejecting God's will.<br>  <br>  "Thou shalt surely die" could be rendered, "Dying, thou shalt die!" In the very day that he would experimentally come to "know evil" through disobeying God's Word, he would die spiritually, being separated from God's direct fellowship. Adam would also begin to die physically, with the initiation of decay processes in his body ultimately causing his physical death.|`|AA10843092	I don't know why everyone keeps thinking it was a tree.

The omnipotent god who lives in the past, present & future all at the same time, (beyond our understanding), knew that Adam & Eve would give in to temptation.  It was a test He knew they would fail.  The point of the exercise was to demonstrate to Mankind that God can and will do anything He pleases with us.  It's about fear. <br>  Of course there really are no such things as gods and this crafty story was contrived by men but you get the idea.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	I often wondered that myself as a Christian.  Believe it or not, I got my answer in a fiction book - specifically the second book in C.S. Lewis' space trilogy.  In the book, instead of a tree that cannot be eaten from, it is an island that cannot be traveled to, but the explanation works just the same.  The only problem is that it takes several pages to make sense, so you'll pretty much have to read most of the book to understand.  If nothing else, it is a good book just to read.<br>  <br>  Perelandra is the title.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The opening chapters of the Bible tell us what happened when Adam and Eve committed the first sin - but they don't tell us exactly why God allowed it to happen. We must be careful, therefore, not to blame God for something that is ultimately beyond our understanding.<br>  <br>  At the same time, the Bible does tell us two very important truths about Adam and Eve's sin. First, it tells us that they were completely free to love God - or to reject Him. In other words, they weren't robots! God's warning was clear: "You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die" (Genesis 2:17).<br>  <br>  But what if they had been robots - that is, what if they didn't have any will of their own, and all they could do was love God? Then their "love" for God wouldn't have been love at all - because love always involves a choice or a decision on our part. God took a great risk in creating them with a free will - but only then could their love for Him be real.<br>  <br>  The other truth the Bible tells us, however, is that while sin's consequences were great - God's love is even greater. The proof is that He sent His only Son into the world so we could have our sins forgiven.

In doing so, they gained wisdom in exchange for mortality, which I think was a good trade - beats living forever in ignorance.<br>  <br>  (I actually gave my daugther the middle name Eve for this reason - to me, Eve is the wisest woman ever.)|`|FjqJs7gMaa	He could have placed it anywhere, but they would never have thought us to obey HIM.<br>  <br>  ex: lets say you have a lighter and kids. <br>  <br>  Would you tell them never to touch the lighter because they will hurt themselves, placing the lighter in a visible area?<br>      Now when they use it they are disobeying you<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  Hide the lighter and not tell them anything about it? there kids they will find it one day. <br>     They find it then hurt themselves, they didn't know they were disobeying you.|`|8ZJdjfMOaa	That's the thing, it isn't literal. Gaining knowledge is metaphorically the act of wanting to know all things and eventually stumbling across the evils of knowing such things, and without it we would be ignorant and innocent. It's a very nice story taken in that light.|`|2DRl3lWMaa	This is freedom of choice - an act of love.<br>  <br>  The Holy Bible, a work of non-fiction written over a period of 2500 years, by more than 40 writers of different nationalities and socio-economical backgrounds (kings, paupers, priests, shepherds) is the only absolute Truth. A person could not get three friends to write about baseball bats and end up with a harmonious end product, yet this book is completely in harmony between these writers revealing the character of God.<br>  <br>  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is not merely symbolic but is about choosing Life (submission out of respect and love) or death (rebellion). Look at it like this - would you expect a perfect and just Creator of all things, who claims to be so loving that He sent His only Son to die an excruciating death (that word, by the way, means 'out of the cross' - the most painful and humiliating of deaths) to pay for our sins against Him, so we wouldn't have to be cast away from Him into hell - to create mankind and then reign over us like a dictator. NO! He put the tree in the middle of the garden BECAUSE He loves us so much He is willing to allow us free choice, to follow Him out of love for Him or to rebel and throw off His commandments (which were given to protect us and give us peace and happiness not keep us from having fun).<br>  <br>  God is totally 'pro-choice'. He chose to die in our place, He chose to love us even though before we are born-again of His Spirit we are spiteful, selfish, hateful and rebellious people. He chose to accept us even though we will not accept Him (until He calls us to Himself). He chose to give us the opportunity to return to Him (through the ultimate sacrifice of the shed blood of Jesus) and have eternal life with Him - or to choose for ourselves to reject Him and suffer an eternity expelled from His presence, to experience continual pain and remorse without His grace.<br>  <br>  The tree was put in their midst out of love, with the willingness to allow freedom of choice - and it shows us that there is not one good person on earth, all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Jesus is the tree of Life which is now in your midst...will you chose Him or rebellion?<br>  <br>  It's your choice.|`|doLepY4daa	Sure he could have put it elsewhere, but then we'd be ianimals prgrammed with instinct rather than free-thinking persons.<br>  <br>  One must first understand what the trees symbolize before making assumptions.<br>  <br>  Edit: "Bam, do you want to explain to me what it symbolizes then?" The rest of the Bible makes it VERY clear. But in a nutshell, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil symbolizes humanity's attempt to attain divinity while rejecting the need for God, while the tree of life is Jesus, the only way to be grafted into the family of God. God is life, and withoug God there is no life. In short, without God you end up with a world that looks just like ours, a mess on the verge of self-destruction.<br>  <br>  <br>  @zaatheis, you don't know what you're talking about.

Eve saw “that the fruit was good to eat” and she ate of it in all her innocence! Eve had no “Guardian Angel” to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She honestly didn’t know that God set her up to fall, either! Her fall was planned BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD! (1 Peter 1:19-20)<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that as soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with God’s Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against God ON FREE WILL and on the spot! The highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of God’s goofs! He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God also created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit for about the same reason we eat any fruit! She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any honest Christian with a reasonable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit  and in the process NO GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS IN SIGHT TO PROTECT THE BULK OF HUMANITY FROM GOING TO HELL…!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created an original God different from any other primitive God. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven! They became known as demons. God is in desperate need of them to justify sending “the world” that he loves so much to be tormented in Hell for ever and ever! According to the Bible writers the demons and Satan will be evicted from Heaven during the “Tribulation of the last days” (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have plenty of faith (gullibility) to swallow anything that the preachers tell you! Christianity is a big business banking on people’s gullibility! <br>  <br>  Back in the Garden of Eden God set up a “flaming sword moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever! God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve and the bulk of the human race from going to Hell unless he was determined to create human beings only to torture them with fire and sulfur for ever and ever for his wanking pleasure. Christianity is as Heathen and barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he “wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF was present in this King’s Royal Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that he might have enjoyed with Sarah! BTW, Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” --not related to any Bible God. But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much end up tormented in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap! It takes years of Christian schooling to keep Christianity still marketable today! The top Clergy is fully aware of all the Holy Crap that they peddle! They call it difficult doctrines in need of a new Bible version.<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only this wanking God knows how many nights he was peeking on him!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband! God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man or not! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers all along! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he loved to watch him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the time God in the person of the Holy Ghost visited the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he was not a nerd!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he must have been aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objection for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, this illiterate Hebrew shepherd Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it! Gen 12) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is like in the case of EVE, but here Sarah is a “sinful” horny old lady age 90, not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*so as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit any sexual “sin” against this wanking Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? The Bible scholars tell you that God prevented Sarah from enjoying sex with King Abimelech because she was going to be an ancestor of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors are loaded with all sorts of sexual escapades!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a gorgeous sexy married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God, but be aware of the long arm of the SECULAR LAW that supersedes any Law of God!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he wouldn’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Old Christian ladies take a cue that age is not a restriction as far as enjoying good sex goes! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross as a “worthy lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. BTW, the Roman soldiers never dressed the genital area of their victims with a white diaper! Now Christians need to snack Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross! He was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup!” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Christians are brainwashed to believe that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it can’t be taken literally (short of seriously)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom wanking GOD? Christianity is about the most immoral religion in the world today, second only to Islam!|`|MeFeazFiaa	The bible.

Please read fully and I urge you to check out the website as it has much more to keep you wondering.<br>  <br>  I have your information right here and if you want to read more go to the following website below:<br>  <br>  Source of information about Jesus in Christianity<br>  <br>  Christians take their information about Jesus from the Bible, which includes the Old and New Testaments.<br>  <br>  These contain four biblical narratives covering the life and death of Jesus. They have been written, according to tradition, respectively by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They are placed at the beginning of the New Testament and comprise close to half of it. <br>  <br>  ENCYLOPEDIA BRITANNICA<br>  <br>   notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death. What can be established about the historical Jesus depends almost without exception on Christian traditions, especially on the material used in the composition of the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which reflect the outlook of the later church and its faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Let me add that these people are viewed as authors with no knowledge of their history, family, or even their last names. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soundvision.com/Info/Jesus/inIslam.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundvision.com/Info/Jesus/in...</a>|`|jWO10NN5aa	Peter and Paul and John would be viewed as Unbelievers and if they were still alive today, they would be sentenced to die under Islam.<br>  <br>  As an Unbeliever myself, and one who is therefore sentenced to death by Islam for being an Unbeliever, I can tell you one thing which is obvious, the authors of the books of the Bible would be sentenced to die as Unbelievers under Islam if they weren't dead already.<br>  <br>  According to the fanatics, anyone who is not a Muslim is has an Islamic death sentence hanging over their head.|`|l2QUgSwzaa	Well if you mean his student so this will be my answer: we look at them as the Students of Juses just like Muhammad's (PBUH)friends we respect them bcoz we respect Muhammad(PBUH) and we love them bcoz we love him, Muhammmad(PBUH) and Quran commanded us to respect and love all the Prophets that GOD has Sent since Adam till Juses so we will never insult any of them or disrespect them and because we love Juses we love his students, family and friends.<br>  Additional:<br>   gorkbarque what the hell are you talking about... people like you who does need to die, who are you to say they muse be die, Quran says: { If you kill one person for no reason its like you killed the whole world} it doesn't matter if he is a christian or muslim or Jewish, we don't own our soul or any one's soul so how could you take it, <br>  Peoples like you destroy the picture of Islam, and God will make you and people like you pay

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Goodness... aren't  these answers are the same people who whine and complain to the high heavens that Christians are rude and judgmental and intollerant and don't respect other people's beliefs?<br>  <br>  In any case, I think this is the passage you are talking about right?<br>  <br>   13By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us.God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. <br>  <br>  I'm NOT a Biblical schollar, but the little bit of research I did sent me to these cross references<br>  <br>  1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.<br>  <br>  and this 1 John 2:5 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him:<br>  <br>  and this 1 John 3<br>   1See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.<br>  <br>  It seems to me, that the important point here is the phrase "because he has given us of his Spirit".  As Christians welcome Christ and the Holy Spirit into their lives they undergo a bit of a transformational experience. It's not really faith if it doesn't change your life, and as you move deeper into faith you will change more; and be less like the world and become closer to God. This will be both a sign that you are moving closer to God and cause for the people who are devoted to the world to reject you.|`|J7KSKm54aa	gibberish, absolute gibberish|`|WFZWlGA0aa	17 By this, ??love is perfected with us, so that we may have ?confidence in ?the day of judgment; because ?as He is, so also are we in this world. <br>  <br>  All it really means is that we need to be like Christ. We are supposed to complete His message of love. He died on the cross for the sins of the world, we need to carry out our part. So I would say that it is more-or-less talking about us. We (Christians) need to be like Christ in the world.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	It simply means that Christ dealt with the same issues that we do as humans in this world.

That is not what you want for your life.|`|3Ophdo9raa	Get into her face and yell for her to stop hitting you. You have to snap them out of it. They're in a rage.

KBxz1Wfyaa	I have to go with blue Nick.  Actually my favorite color of blue is electric blue.  Years ago I had a color analysis done.  The results were that any color in the blue spectrum was a match especially the vibrant electric blue.  The lady who did the analysis said that I was eclectic.  Now if you google eclectic, some of the results can be quite unsettling:-)<br>  The color analysis expert said that my personality matched the blue explanation you've given.

Americans are not necessarily seen as being unrealistic and fake; in fact, many people from outside the US admire the American can-do attitude, American capitalism, and the American way of life.<br>  Yes, there is a recession now; and, yes, the new President sounds a bit too socialistic to be great; sure, that's true.  But, don't worry, there are still plenty of educated, well-off people from other countries (including Western Europe) who enroll in US universities, buy apartments in the US, love your country and would be thrilled to become US citizens. <br>  If some Americans are pessimists, they are wrong.  You have the best country in the world, fight for it instead of whining and letting Mr. Government take control over your lives!|`|yhfG07Jtaa	You construct an entire argument around "being seen."

I watch those 'reality' shows and I think to myself "who acts like that?". I don't know anyone in real life who behaves like the people on TV. Nobody I know has even had plastic surgery. TV is fake and unrealistic but life is not a TV show. <br>  <br>  I don't agree with those who are saying Americans are pessimistic now because of the recession we're in. We're worried, but most of us know we will come out of this and be strong again. This isn't the first time the US has faced a crisis like this. We overcame it before and we will again. It's just difficult because, as Americans, we are used to a certain sense of security that we don't have right now.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	I see what you're saying. I ventured around western Europe about a year ago, the majority of people seemed so skeptical of anything and everything, and generally seemed that they were "negative Nancies." They always seemed to find the negative in everything and focus on that, rather than find the positives and build off of that.<br>  There were people who were the opposite, but generally, that's the impression I walked away with.|`|8auEgQf2aa	Nah I only mean fake as in American culture revolves around Hollywood and all they do is sell ignorance and consumer mentality I dont mean Americans are fake people as I aint lived in America to know im just talking about the culture your media shows and that is what America is known for.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I think it can be seen as overconfidence Different cultures my Friend.

dCewrtXaaa	It usually means that you are a good auditory learner. That's why being good at languages is often accompanied by having a good ear for music.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	you can speak well|`|vQTYDR1oaa	Being multilingual, I learn languages easily & independently without the assistance of any teachers so financially, it saves me alot of $$$. <br>  <br>  Also, it enhances my communication skills with foreigners because I can connect with their culture, beliefs & language so they tend to be more tolerant of my cultural background and are more interested in making friends/doing business with me.<br>  <br>  I earn alot of extra cash by helping children, students and people learn a foreign language because they need someone who is at least effectively bilingual to understand their thoughts in the native language & assist them in the transitional process to express themselves in another language.<br>  <br>  I have an excellent memory and can remember many things vividly, even if they happen 20 odd years ago. My friends often marvel at how I could memorise the exact lines which they've said many years back. I hardly forget things.<br>  <br>  Whenever I travel overseas, I don't get much of a problem in communication, especially during times of emergency. I remember once in Indonesia (Jakarta's airport) when my noon flight was delayed to the next morning without any notification from the airline, most passengers, who were also uninformed, sighed and went off as the airport staff spoke minimal English and could not assist them to find the accomodation for the night. On the other hand, I used my Indonesian language to my advantage instead of using English and insisted that I had not received any notification by showing evidence and that the staff find me a temporary accomodation for the night. Had I not known how to express my thoughts in the language, I think I would have to camp in the airport as I would not be able to travel another 3 hours back to West Java from Jakarta and be in time to catch the next morning's flight.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, I can often identify a sense of familiarity with those whose languages & dialects that I speak, especially if it's not in English.

He knew that the cost was an issue in my circumstances.  It was still quite expensive.  The Oral Surgeon received the biggest share of the money.  My dentist said to give the gums and dentures about a year before coming in to have the dentures lined.  It will be a year in June.  It isn't a picnic to have it done in the same day but looking back, I'm very glad I chose that option. Working in the public every day was my motivator for choosing the same day option.|`|qAVADb9vaa	For me it took 6-8 weeks. I had to wait for the gums to heal.

That way, the dentures can be fitted without having to resort to relining. Depending on your personal rate of healing, this could take 3-6 months. Those who have Medicaid coverage are required to follow this guideline.<br>  <br>  Most people cannot conceive of being toothless for that long so they're fitted with immediate dentures. These are placed after the extractions and cause a lot of discomfort pressing on the extraction sites. After 4-6 weeks, they need to be relined since the swelling has gone down and they become too loose. Standard insurance usually covers this.<br>  <br>  Some people opt for temporary dentures fitted on the same day and then replaced with permanent ones 4-6 months later. This is the most expensive route and not all insurance companies will cover the extra expense since relining is much cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you are paying without benefit of 3rd party coverage, you and your dentist will make the determination.

1YW5WTg6aa	The true nature of the soul is full of knowledge, eternal, and blissful. It is due to our false Identification with this material body that causes suffering. Currently there is a lack of proper education regarding the science of the soul. When we say a person has passed away or died. What has passed away? Everything that we could see with our eyes is still there; arms, legs, muscles, face, blood etc. So what part of the person has passed away? The fact is that we are always changing bodies. In Bhagavad-gita chapter 2 text 13 Krishna says, <br>  <br>  "As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change."<br>  <br>  For example, the body you had when you were two years old is completely gone. Modern science can confirm this on a cellular level as well. It is a fact that everything material goes through six changes; manifest or birth, growth, stays for some time, produces some by product, dwindles, and unmanifests or death. The very nature of the material world is temporary. Happiness derived from material enjoyment is flickering. Material happy is like trying to enjoy a drop of water in the desert. Most people work like asses five days a week to have a couple hours of intoxication and sex enjoyment. This cycle repeats until old age, disease, or death takes hold of the body. The quality of material enjoyment is temporary. <br>  <br>  Because we try and enjoy separate from God we are put into illusion. The fact is that there is no separate position from God. God is absolute. God has given us free-will and with that free-will comes the ability to misuse it. It is due to our misuse of our free-will that we are suffering. We are trying to lord our free-will over material nature, but because that is not our original position we are suffering.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't believe in God can you see how your very life is preparing you for suffering? If you have family attachment it will come to an end. If you like your youth you will lose it.<br>  <br>  The human form of life is meant for inquiring into the absolute truth. Even the animals are busy eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. Most of the human population is doing the same thing only in a polished way.<br>  <br>  Please utilize your intelligence for understanding the difference between matter and spirit. <br>  <br>  Religion without philosophy is sentiment; philosophy without religion is mental speculation|`|hzMpdFFBaa	In my faith, life is a play of pleasure and pain (ie,suffering). Indeed,in the great circle of life,one being's pleasure is another's pain. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, things that seem “bad” only seem so because of narcissistic tendencies. We judge everything through whether it is a pleasant or painful experience. If it is pleasant, we feel blessed and also anxious about the ephemeral nature of our good time. If it is painful, we say it is evil, and if we buy into moralistic and superficial notions about destiny, we say it happened because we deserved it. But life happens. It is called the eater and the eaten. Everyone and everything is both of these at the same time. The phenomenon fuels the world machine, and our struggle is nevertheless the bliss of “God” having the experience of phenomenological life.|`|S60bFeuGaa	My previous church taught that suffering was next to Godliness.  But I started to notice that the people teaching this weren't suffering.<br>  <br>  Living a life of integrity can sometimes feel like suffering.  Using the term suffering is just that, a term.

The 2004 tsunami is a recent big example.  A disproportionate number of the 300,000 people killed were children.  Can you imagine the fear they felt as the waters carried them away?<br>  <br>  Can you imagine the fear of the children swept away in Noah's flood (if you believe it)?<br>  <br>  So what's the answer to this logic? (borrowed from Epicurus):<br>  <br>  If God is not able to prevent the suffering of children, then He is not all-powerful and it is pointless to worship Him.<br>  If God is able to prevent the suffering of children, but doesn't, then he is hostile or uncaring, and it is pointless to worship Him.<br>  <br>  Which is it?<br>  <br>  And please don't hide behind "God's ways are a mystery, but there's always a reason." God supposedly drowned the ENTIRE population of the planet (except Noah's family) when all he needed to do was appear in the sky and say "Obey me!".<br>  <br>  The God of Abraham is exactly what you would expect humans to devise to explain things they don't understand and to control other humans.<br>  <br>  The God of Abraham is completely INCONSISTENT with an all-powerful being who wishes us to behave a certain way.<br>  <br>  Men of science drastically reduced the suffering of children from diseases.  Men of science will find a way to predict tsunamis.  And if we can stop the religious and tribal wars, then science and technology and trade can eliminate the suffering of starvation.  The power is ours, not God's.|`|Ilk5Xbzfaa	See: Catholic Church: What it teaches about suffering. For atheists, consult Universal Atheism Handbook, revised. Oops, you want MY opinion? Ohhhh.

I believe God planned to use satan to test the worthiness of mankind. He knew mankind would fall into sin, but he already had a plan to send his son Jesus to be our savior. <br>  <br>  I believe God uses the earth as a testing and teaching ground for souls. He sends them here to test their faith, their character, and their love for him. It is easy to profess love and compassion when all your needs are met, but put that person in distress and their true character will show. I believe that only under duress is the true character of a person revealed. Those that prove worthy on earth with little responsibility and power will be rewarded in heaven with great responsibility and power.<br>  <br>  Job 1:9-11<br>  9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. 10 "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face." <br>  <br>  Luke 16:10-12<br>  10"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 11So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? 12And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The question of why a righteous and loving God allows evil to exist is almost as old as the human race. Over 3,000 years ago, Job asked, "Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power? ... Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways'" (Job 21:7, 14).<br>  <br>  Nor does the Bible give us a complete answer to this puzzle. Someday in heaven we'll fully understand God's ways—but not now. We live in a fallen world, a world where evil often seems to be in control. But that isn't the whole story! By faith we know that God still loves us, and His power is greater than all evil. The proof is Jesus Christ, who was put to death by evil men but rose from the dead by the power of God. Never forget this truth: Ultimately, God is in control, not Satan.<br>  <br>  And someday God's justice and power will rule, and all evil will be destroyed. Satan will be bound forever, and Jesus Christ will reign over all the earth. In the meantime, we say with the Bible, "How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" (Romans 11:33, KJV).<br>  <br>  The real question, however, is this: Is your trust in God? In the midst of so much confusion and doubt in the world, have you put your faith in Christ, and are you seeking to follow Him every day? Make sure of your commitment to Christ, and then make it your goal to grow closer to Him every day.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Suffering is the part of the living journey that we like the least, but it cannot be avoided.|`|J7KSKm54aa	cool- a rapping rabbi

That is no blame on God for haveing the truth available for all to see and read .. The simple truth that only one denomination could be correct is beyond man's ego to believe , so he becomes a willing slave to what other men before him have told him is truth ...  Why do you think so many died during the great flood ...  because they thought they were part of the right one ...  That did not prove to be true except for just a few who believed it was comming at all...  Like today's world most believe that they have the right one ...  Like long ago, soon many will come to the same ending because of ego ... God says there is one path to him and that path is narrow and not all will find it ...

I will have no ending like adam and eve , or satan for that matter or the millions who thought they were right ...

People get their own ideas and preach them to others, and usually they can find people that will agree with them.  Some of these people get the idea that if you don't see it the way they do, you are a heretic, and thus not a real Christian.  They think it is God's will for them to show other people the right way.<br>  I do see some significant differences in some denominations; for example, some believe you can experience the Holy Spirit just like the apostles did in the book of Acts; others say no, all who claim that experience are fake.  Well either people really do have that experience, or they are deluded.  One or the other is wrong.  Some go so far as to say people who claim that experience are devil possessed.   That's a serious charge; saying the Holy Spirit is the devil is very close to blasphemy.|`|yluVQqcRaa	Jesus said in Matthew 5;17-20 that he is not here to start a new religion; but to fix the Jewish one.

And only teaches 9 today.

So new obedient churches formed in different countries,...<br>  Since then many more churches have formed mainly because laziness has come again and it is ways to do less but claim you are perfect.

Denominational differences are so deep at this point that it is nearly impossible to get people from different plains of thought to agree. So nothing gets done because someone always has to be right.

I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS. Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX. Thanks for letting us get this off of our chest, I don't need the stress of being treated this way because of heart problems, I have 2 leaking valves in my heart, from all the heart attacks and dying due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Rhuematic Fever.

Obviously some of the Bible writers were anti-Semitically oriented and they meant Jew for JUDAS. That is why Christianity justifies hating bad non converting Jews!

One of the things I have against the idea of confession is that people think it absolves them of all culpability for the wrong they do.  As I see it, what good does the Church's forgiveness, or God's forgiveness, do for those whom you have wronged?  Nothing.  Confession and absolution are immoral unless you seek the forgiveness of those whom you have offended first.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Going to church/confession weekly doesn't authorize you to invade anyone else's privacy...though if you really are doing what you're suggesting YOU SHOULD BE GOING TO CHURCH/CONFESSION WEEKLY...  BUT, you must not be confessing your actions because the priest should have been telling you you're out of line violating anothers privacy...  SHAME ON YOU...|`|jOZWekKjaa	No, because that's just rude and immoral. You obviously aren't following your own religions teachings. That's kind of sad.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	If I caught you going through my private e-mails, you wouldn't be able to go to church.|`|5WIZowKOaa	Anyone can go to church every week and as for confession, that is supposed to be a a matter between you and God (sincere prayer). I was so relieved and angry at the same time when I found out that this confession to a priest is something instituted by the catholic church-NOT from the Bible! It made me question a lot of other doctrines and teachings-they are full of pagan teachings and doctrines.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No.<br>  <br>  Going to confession does not give us the right to go out and sin. Confession is reconciliation to God, it is forgiveness. When are to hate our sin because it offends God. To confess then go out and sin only shows that you do not hate your sin, but enjoy it and see confession as some kind of fail safe plan for salvation. Not so. <br>  <br>  "you will know them by their fruits." Sin is a disease, and allowing that disease to continue in you will take you further from God. Confession helps root out the disease and heal our souls so that we do not want to sin because we love God more than ourselves.|`|b849wydSaa	Only if it is your own. People have a right to privacy.

It's not God's forgiveness that you have to worry about, it's theirs.|`|sohnrZDcaa	Yeap... why not? The priest ought to know all about you so he can absolve you of any wrongdoing!

Better not to have a label. Your previous 'gay' label may have stopped you doing things you could have enjoyed!<br>  <br>  Really don't worry about labels. There is no sense to it.<br>  <br>  And it could easily be that your past has made you think things that are not really true or that are only temporarily true.<br>  <br>  A label is a mental barrier to change and I sense that you are far too young to have done all the changing you are going to do.<br>  <br>  You can go on changing until you are 30 or more. Some gay guys only realise that they are gay then.<br>  <br>  And your sexuality is determined mostly by who you fall in love with. Anyone can enjoy sex with either sex.<br>  <br>  So move in and start with a clean sheet (I mean with no labels on you) and see how life develops.<br>  <br>  And don't ever say to yourself that you can't do XXX because you have a label on you that says YYY. <br>  <br>  That really would be nuts.|`|s24cErX4aa	I don't think anybody can tell you what you are, but you could discover more about yourself if you get a professional therapist to help you (somebody serious who is just going to listen and help you better understand your thoughts and feelings - not one of those crazy ones who want to fit you into a stereotype).|`|XukScWE3aa	You need help.

You probably, like most straight people, assumed that because she's straight that she's attracted to every girl she sees, which just isn't how we are, I mean, are you attracted to every guy you see?  Probably not.

mVTGl6HGaa	The term nuclear family is used to distinguish a family group consisting of most commonly, a father and mother and their children, from what is known as an extended family. Nuclear families can be any size, as long as the family can support itself and there are only children and two parents, nuclear families meet its individual members’ basic needs since available resources are only divided among few individuals or the family would be known as an extended family.<br>  <br>  In China, the most populous nation in the world, the nuclear family is considered the most common family arrangement.[1] In the more urban parts of India, the second most populous nation, the number of nuclear families is overtaking other forms of family arrangements, although unpopular among Hindu orthodoxy who advocate a form of extended family structure called the joint family.[2] In the United States of America, the third most populous nation, just under 25% of family units are considered nuclear families.[3]

FKxrJxbPaa	Its because of Britain's history. <br>  <br>  Prior to the standardisation of the English writing system, "English" was really more of a collection of many groups of different-sounding dialects. What was spoken in London was moderately different from what was spoken in Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool. They weren't distinct enough to be considered languages proper, but there were pronounced differences. Remember that English is a blend of Anglo-Saxon, Frisian, Scandinavian and Celtic tongues, with heavy borrowing from French, Greek and Latin. Varying influences affected the way the language was spoken and that was the root of the differences.<br>  <br>  Also, there was much less inter-regional travel in those days. People were born, raised and died in the same village, oftentimes without leaving more than 50km away. Because of this, language became divergent in different regions. <br>  <br>  When English writing was standardised all of the dialects were essentially blanketed under one group, English. The separate dialects gained a roughly identical grammar and spelling system, but the exact sounds still remained varied according to region, and in many cases class and ethnic background as well. Thus the distinct dialects became regional accents.<br>  <br>  The phenomenon is the same in most parts of the world. In France and Italy, there are huge regional differences in the way the language is spoken, and some dialects are literally incomprehensible from other ones. Low German is completely different from High German, and Swiss German is a whole new language altogether.|`|eskZfVBkaa	Its true. People tend to forget that the UK is a tiny island (smaller than Texas) and yet the accents are SO varied its unreal! Someone from Liverpool sounds as though they are from a completely different country than someone from London! It's weird and i really don't know the answer to it. To some of the other answers: yes we know it's not unique to England but the fact that we are such a small country makes it all the more unusual. America is massive so it's no wonder that the accents are varied (although they are no where near as varied as British accents) whereas in England, people from areas which are an hours drive away sound as though they are from a totally different country sometimes.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	It goes back to invasions both peaceful and warlike throughout our history. The English are a mongrel race made up by row upon row of invaders long before written history and for several centuries after it. As the invaders intermarried with the itinerant population so the languages and methods of pronunciation  were amended as time went on. The Scouse Accent with which I speak is or was a very local one and 150 years ago the accent around here was a Lancashire one perhaps a little nasal because of the dampness in the climate. Then the Welsh and Irish arrived and also others and the present day accent evolved and is evolving, not always the way one would wish|`|S6MqrWdjaa	iono. i cant really tell the diff. maybe its slang usage or diff phrases. i notice some talk faster while some slower. i think it has to do with immigration having an effect. mle is a mixture of patios, english, and what not, right! so immigration plays a role.|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Anglo-saxon invasions and invasions by others means that we started with a variety/mix of accents. Then, we complicated things more!<br>  Influence from media, other nationalities and people who commute to other geographical places to work means that they pick up certain accents and take them back home. It then spreads. <br>  <br>  If you listen to a child from London speak back in the 1940s/50s. they sound a hell of a lots different now. This is because we no longer have Received Pronunciation - it died out due to what I have mentionedd.<br>  <br>  Every area has subtle differences with their accent/dialect due to colloquialisms and close neighbours/villages. <br>  We will keep a wider accent base as the years go on due to immigration. It all makes things more interesting!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Most countries are the same way.  The United States has a large number of regional accents, but that's probably because it's such a huge country.  I have relatives in Germany, and the language they speak in the north is quite different from what they speak in the south.  In China, people who speak Mandarin literally cannot understand those who speak Cantonese.  Spain, too, has many dialects that amount to almost entirely different languages.  <br>  This is not unique to Britain.|`|xKthWOGtaa	Because before train and car, people lived in their own area and didn't really travel so much. There was no mass media either, so nobody taught them how to speak. Therefore over time, regional accents and dialects arose.<br>  <br>  Compared to America for example, Britain has a far greater diversity of dialects and accents because America was colonised only within the last 300 years or so. <br>  <br>  Compared however to somewhere like Spain, France or Italy, Britain has far less diversity in regional accents. In Spain, for example they speak totally different languages in Madrid (Castillian) and in Barcelona (Catalan). In the north they speak Basque, and in the north-west they speak Galician. These are all totally different languages which are not understandable with each other. In Britain, we talk differently, but we can normally understand each other despite the accent differences... except perhaps Geordies... :-)|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Ha in Scotland, it's not just scottish either, theirs<br>  <br>  Dundonian<br>  Aberdonian<br>  Midlothian<br>  Fifer<br>  Glaswegian<br>  <br>  and plenty more.

nk3QCoPvaa	Is the story really about witches in London, or rather is it about religious fundamentalist mob who kill women for sport? And what sort of person joins a group like that? Would Ted Bundy join a group that brings witches to justice? Would he enjoy the work?<br>  <br>  The story is about a man who murders his wife. It is not about witches at all. It is about state-sanctioned homicide.

yB0nVXfWaa	Well, you've not got a lot of help, have you, from the answerers?  Usual thing, just deny it.<br>  <br>  I will not go into trying to interpret your dreams, except it would seem that you're on the wrong side of salvation, I reckon.  I mean, if you were truly saved, the evil one couldn't hurt you or give you anything to fear, because you would belong to a greater one than he.<br>  <br>  Even though not Christians, it is not usual for people to have these kinds of 'demonic' dreams, actually, but I do think that this kind of thing is increasing nowadays, judging by the number of times I've answered this kind of question on Yahoo! <br>  <br>  Basically, the evil one doesn't come in and cannot touch you unless you have unwittingly opened a 'door' - ie. had something to do with the occult.  These are practices which are forbidden by God for our own good, and if a person violates this sanction, then he makes it possible for evil spirits from the spirit realm which normally can't touch him, to pass over.  What I mean by occult is things like ouija board, fortune telling by cards, tarot, etc., spiritualism, seances, transcendental meditation (or most 'meditation' actually), spiritual yoga, mantras, drugs, tantric experiences, etc.  It's a long list, but those are the kinds of things which people can quite innocently do and not realise what they're getting into.<br>  <br>  The occult is the first place I would expect this sort of thing to come from, or something like that, combined with strong fear.  Did you have a shocking experience which was a bit 'supernatural' recently?<br>  <br>  Well, that's the kind of thing that gives an 'entry point'.  Unless you are a Christian, you have no power to actually command the thing to go, so if you want any help, you will have to seek out a mature Christian who knows his God to pray for you.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Forget the religious and psychological answers.

Dreams cannot be accurately interpreted by any one person because each interpretation will vary according to the interpreters own belief. Like everything else, your dreams are impermanent.

BYUGkoHoaa	Witchcraft has been part of Pagan religions for a long while, and as Paganism has been around for thousands of years, you could say witchcraft has been around for quite awhile too.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is a practice mainly using the elements and natural tools (i.e. herbs, minerals, etc.) to influence the energies around you and act out your will through magic. Magic is energy and it all depends on your intent when casting a spell.There is no good or bad magic.energy doesn't have a conscience, its what you do with it. <br>  <br>  Witchcraft is mainly used in pagan religions like Wicca; however you don't have to be Wiccan or even pagan to perform it.You don't have to change your religion because you are a witch,although some religions don't think you should, its practice, not a religion.<br>  <br>  There isn't a set formula or anything of witchcraft.What I mean is, nothing is set in stone or even accepted by all witches.For instance you will find that, while although many practicing witches out there follow the Wiccan Rede, "An it harm none, do what ye will", however there are those who feel, since they aren't part of the Wiccan faith, this rule doesn't apply to them.Another would be not to cast a spell on someoen without their permission, there are those who follow this and those that don't. <br>  <br>  Witchcraft isn't a set science really, its a practice stemmed in belief with no substantial evidence to whether or not it actually works.|`|dFBccLExaa	I think it has it's purposes, but that many witches rely on it way too much. I also think that there are a TON of misconceptions about what magick is capable of and what it isn't.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Witch craft is the practice of using the supernatural or paranormal to get the result that you want.  As most people who aks for the services of a witch tend to ask for something that will benefit them it has always been banned and practiced underground.  <br>  <br>  What people want may be altruistic, such as helping a sick friend, but the spell asked is usually for personal gains, such as getting money or a lover.  The ethics of these are debatable, as money may come through a disaster of some kind; and it does not do to try to compel someone to love you against their will or by breaking up a relationship.   <br>  <br>  Worse are the requests for ill wishing or cursing someone or something.  No one has the right to call down illness or misfortune upon another, except in dire need when the law has not worked to right a wrong in very serious cases, nor to cause harm to property or livestock.<br>  <br>  Witches, however, usually got praise when they worked to improve circumstances, such as by turning away a curse, but were in trouble, if found out, if they were doing harm.<br>  <br>  The modern term witchcraft tends to be applied to the wiccans who, say, send out healing, with permission, or help someone to get a job or relationship, but without interfering with anyone else's life.  This is very tricky and should not be undertaken lightly. The media though loves glamour and scandals so these are all that is publicised. <br>  <br>  Some who have wicca as a religion do still use the term witchcraft as describing themselves.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	It's a perfectly fine craft if you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is not saying a few words and lighting a candle. Nothing will happen then. That is the problems with people who dabble...they go through the motions and get no results and wonder why.<br>  <br>  Study, and do the proper work if you want to work witchcraft, or leave it alone.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	It's a craft/pratice like anything else out there. . .|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I don't like witchcraft because nothing good ever comes from it.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	i think it's a valuable part of our cultural legacy.  witches are keepers of folklore and experts in a wide variety of disciplines.  but most people who call themselves witches have not earned the title.  you have to do more than cast love spells to earn the right to call yourself a witch.  you have to develop a deep knowledge of the art you wish to pursue.<br>  <br>  witchcraft is not only about magic.  it is the practice of any occult art, and includes divination, herbology, astrology, and other non-magical arts.  not all witches cast spells.<br>  <br>  contrary to what another poster said, not all wiccans are witches.  some would be insulted by the term.  wicca is a ceremonial earth religion that focuses on the balance between male and female aspects of the divine.  many wiccans do not practice magic or any of the other disciplines that are part of the witches' lore.|`|jM7CyxQzaa	Witchcraft is the manipulation of natural energies to your own ends, its the practice of this that is Witchcraft - Wicca is more of the religeous side of celebrating the seasons and festivals.<br>  <br>  Witches can be Hereditary (ie they were born into their Craft) Family (it runs in the family) or it can be learned. <br>  <br>  Traditional Witches will happily hex (curse) as heal and it's the Wiccans who do not hex. There is a difference between Trad Witches and Wiccans and quite often Trad Witches will get very annoyed if you call them Wiccan.<br>  <br>  Not all Witches believe in the Law of Threefold Return - which is a Wiccan tenet.<br>  <br>  Witches do however believe that if you do something you TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for it, that means thinking about what you are going to do and wording or working so that no harm comes to anyone else unless you wish it - if you muck it up then YOU and ONLY YOU will take the metaphysical flak for it. Ie don't mess with what you don't know enough about.<br>  <br>  It's used a lot by 'teens' who think they can frighten other people or get a reaction from people by claiming they're witches, it's the latest 'in thing' to be. Some of these teens will put in the work and really learn how to be a good witch, others will never get past the beginner stage - usually if they brag or claim that they 'know it all' they're in the beginner stage :) Experienced practitioners can tell a newbie or a flake five miles away :)<br>  <br>  Witchcraft only uses natural forces and energies, it does not involve worship of the Devil (who is a Christian belief and therefore not anything to do with Witchcraft OR wicca) it does not involve 'stage magic' ie levitation, dissapearing acts or such, and it does not and never has involved changing of your eye colour - this comes from the film The Craft.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft uses Magic as a tool. ie a means to and end, a something to use to get results.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is the European version of Shamanism.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is NOT something to be dabbled in lightly, there are very real forces and energies out there and only an idiot 'plays' with them.|`|tedOdb7jaa	I used to be pagan. Its a bad idea. really bad idea your opening the doors to spells and other gods and goddesses. its opening your self up to get screwed over by satan. although pagans dont believbe in satan. they beiebe in the horned god. and the earth and all that. <br>  <br>   its not a good i dea. when i was pagan i became a very dark troubled person. i was a hateful person and i wasnt myself . if i had a video of myself back then i would show you. i was so angry . and depressed. i would cut myself becuase i loved blood. i would do many spells not worring about the 3 fold rule. its a toxic religon<br>  satan pulled me into the darkness and i fell in big time.|`|z4LgTbTlaa	I think witchcraft is great.but remember" all things come back to you three fold."This means if you try a spell to cause someone harm it will rebound on you 3 times worse.Be careful and do your research before you try a spell.There is a lot involved in making a spell work the way you want it to and sometimes they work in unexpected ways.|`|AA11367192	i believe in it though i don't cast spells. I think that most people misunderstand the concept of witch craft...it's not about casting spells for fun or casting spells on yourself or other people..it's about finding your self and controlling the energies.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	I hope the Bible will remain important to you, and that you will never lose your confidence in it, for it is still God's Word—regardless of what some people suggest. Jesus put it succinctly: "Your word is truth" (John 17:17).<br>  The vast number of discoveries that archaeologists have made during the last century—discoveries that repeatedly confirm the historical accuracy of the Bible. Your local Christian bookstore can suggest further reading for you if you are interested.<br>  <br>  Since the dawn of history, some have denied God and tried to cast doubt on His Word. In fact, the very first question in the Bible came from the lips of Satan, and his purpose was to convince Adam and Eve that God's Word could not be trusted: "Did God really say ... ?" (Genesis 3:1).<br>  <br>  Don't be misled by these claims, but put your faith firmly in Christ, the divine Son of God who walked on this earth and gave His life for your salvation. Then make the Bible part of your life every day, for "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path" (Psalm 119:105).|`|U51pBeLfaa	Jesus spoke in parables which I understand is a Jewish way to teach.

aWEybdDFaa	only u know what you feel and do not feel, go to a lesbian lounge or club, if you find someone pretty--get to know her a little. Go out and spend time with her after that. And if you ever get sexual emotions to kiss her or have sex with her than yes, that would make you Bisexual.<br>  <br>  however, just because you enjoy a woman's beauty that doesnt make you a lesbian or BI|`|52VDjbNTaa	You're probably bi-sexual, I feel like this too =D<br>  You might just be straight and curious though...<br>  <br>  Just experiment & have fun! =D|`|zFhhgL0Oaa	try dating a guy who loves to wear womans clothes and get the best of both worlds.    and to answer your ?  it doesnt mean your lesbian, when you meet the right guy you wont be thinking of sleeping with a woman.... i am a crossdresser and i meet  alot of woman that love us and get turned on by us and alot of them say they can be bi or not it depends on the woman....  maybe its a stage your going through as well... good luck hon|`|kJUCZFwkaa	Ε?σαι ?να αν?χωμα.|`|xWyWS3anaa	Im guessing u mah yung what u gonna have to do is experiment try both u have time tho|`|z2xRXM5Laa	At this point, you haven't done anything with either sex, so I can't say you're  gay or straight or even bisexual.  Right now you are curious in any case.  You maybe bisexual, but you really need to experience them to know for sure.  You just might have boyfriends, have sex with them and discover that you don't like being with guys.  That happens. Or you might think you're really into guys UNTIL you meet a woman that really rocks your world, not just sexually.  I also seriously think that you should explore being with females.  Different ones.  You need to discover for yourself how you truly feel about them, and the only way to do that is to have some relationships and sex with women.  I think the reason you can't picture yourself in a relationship with women is because you are afraid and you are used to considering yourself straight.  <br>  But trust me on this,  if you ignore your feelings for women, some day you'll be married to a man and have his kids, but you will have this deep void in your life and you'll feel miserable.  You'll end up meeting a woman who really changes how you feel and you'll feel horrible still wanting women even after you've married a man.<br>  So please, go  and have some experiences with different women.  Loving experiences.  Hot, sexual experiences.  Intellectual and deeply emotional experiences. I don't think that it is fair for human beings to identify themselves based on sexual attraction.  Sexual attraction is not the end-all-be-all of existance. Human beings are sexual creatures, so  I think it needs to go deeper than just a sexual aspect as far as how one should identify  themself.  But you have to go and find out on both ends how deep your feelings can go since you like both.  You know how you feel about guys.  Now you should find out what you really have inside you about women.|`|B0ioojMMaa	I feel that way but the other way round lol i'm sure i'm a lesbian but SOMETIMES i'm attracted to men - only sexually though...<br>  It might be you're bisexual and me too lol...buti don't label myself so... i believe i'm a lesbian with occasional sexual atraction to men, cause let's face it you can never have a romantic relationship with someone who you're only sexually attracted 2 : )<br>  Good Luck hope i helped in some way : )<br>  Peace Jay : )|`|qQv2cZ9zaa	You can figure all of that out later, if it's important. I'm not sure it's an important question for anyone to figure out, really. Just have relationships with people you like and don't worry about the label.|`|ZvTYxdmsaa	If you're a lesbian, you'll know it.
0rDDPTi5aa	Yes, I agree with a a lot of what people have said already.  Generally speaking, culture is the reason for this.  I notice that in white culture, there is much more pressure to be near perfect:  the perfect house, perfect career, perfect family, and perfect body.  When they don't fulfill this, they feel insecure.  Youth is worshiped, its like they expect to look 19 forever.  In black culture, most are not expecting perfection, and we honor the elderly and do not worship youth as much as the white culture.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Yea, it's because how most of us are brought up, my family always gave me and my sister compliments and always told us how beautiful we were. While I realize I am not a beauty queen, I definitley don't see myself as an ugly person and I don't waste my life moping on my flaws. I like to embrace the beauty God gave me. We are taught to love ourselves and realize that being black is beautiful, which it really is, most of us are taught not to feel inferior to any standards and instead create new ones. I think it's good to have this type of self-esteeme within the black culture, it's good to realize that women who are beautiful and who were once seen as the least to some, see their true beauty because they are beautiful. Black women deserve to have confidence.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	I think its because a lot of white girls are trying to live up to the standard of beauty set by society -- meaning, super thin, big boobs, blonde -- whatever -- whereas society tends to not even pay much attention to black women (unless they're Halle Berry or some kind of super model) -- so there aren't tons of magazine covers and ads and images for black girls to mold themselves after (I mean, black women now they're not going to be white and blond, haha)-- so we don't even think about that or want to be that or try to be that -- we just have our own sense of what's beautiful for us and we go with it -- but that's just a generalization. Trust me - there are insecure black girls and really confident white girls -- all depends on the girl.|`|xEmIhOc3aa	dn't say that there are sum black girs who's confidence is through the florr as well as whites...mine was and it took me a while to gain sum confidence ... im not completely confident and i dn't want to be..just enough to where i feel good about myself..i dn't like a cocky , arrogant personality ...its not me|`|4sh2oRR7aa	There's a difference between confidence and acting like b*tch who is just too full of themselves. Women who act like "queens" are full of themselves and hard to get along with. Maybe white girls are more humble.|`|AA11355027	cause we (well me) when i was growing up i was told i was pretty and princess and (i am mixed 2) but like idk i never thought of my self as ugly...idk i always wondered that 2|`|eskZfVBkaa	I've noticed that as well. I think that its a good thing and white girls should be more like it. Im assuming its the upbringing.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	call me pc if u want but I dont think race got anything to do with how confidence people are.|`|rEFHlhmdaa	I don't think this is alwasys the case, many time you find black girls over compensating for the fact that they can feel insecure unloved and unwanted in society. It is like a coping mechanism if you are constantly being told your hair is not good you are too dark and your not beautiful you have 2 Major reactions you either become a recluse or you put on a show and fake confidence. you find that many black woman take the second road. Not to mention the white standard of beauty is very narrow and seems to require perfection while the standards for black woman seem a little looser in terms of body shape.|`|GZUZqazcaa	Well,because,us black girls/mixed girls have no role models to look up to like white girls do,there are hardly any black models to represent us,therefore we don't have a black''ideal beauty'' and we don't have an image of what were ''supposed'' to look like.White girls on the other hand have a lot of models that they have to look up to,and America has made an ''ideal beauty'',and if you're white,and don't have a narrow nose,no lucious lips,no long silky hair,then they make it seem like they're nothing..<br>  <br>  As for me,I am confident within myself,because I am beautiful inside and out,my grandmother instilled in me that no matter what someone says,I will always be beautiful,from my hair,to my feet,I am beautiful,and no one can take that away from me.(Which is why I don't get my hair straightend anymore,I accept my curls and waves that God gave me,and not what America wants me to look like.)|`|8sWaWQWGaa	Black women had to experience a lot of things in their life far as family raising kids, watching siblings, working , household chores everything, getting an education,  all that stuff makes us strong and ready for anything in this world Oh! let me not for get loving a Black man and being their for him for support. White women on the other hand have everything handed to them on a silver platter their parents spoil them even when they get older in age. Some have no responsibility or get no attention from their parents because their major concern is money. They aren't emotionally strong to handle some problems black people face in everyday life that is as simple as getting a good education, that discrimination is still out their you can tell the difference in the neighborhoods and the school system. White people are more catered too. That's what messes them up and clashes their mentality. Basically by you asking this question I guess you want to know how you can get some self-confidence.Hunh! (p.s. I am a sista)|`|UxJMk38aaa	Well, for one white girls are targeted more by the media and have that "gotta be blonde" or "submissive to men" stereotypes placed on them. Since there are not as much media telling black girls how they should be; they get to have more confidence.<br>  ...Plus, to the person with some lame welfare joke: more white people are on welfare than any other race!|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	My impression is that self-importance and extreme self-love is more evident among black people, because of the whole slavery thing. It's a way to "prove yourself" as worthy, and as good enough for "white society". <br>  <br>  In my country, a lot of dark-skinned immigrants are very loud and obnoxious. Being loud doesn't make you more confident. The most balanced people are those who are calm and serene.|`|T1beLIQqaa	I am not Black. I have dated women, and, have friends across the spectrum. From my personal, experience, most, NOT all, Black women are more honest, forward, and open about wanting intimacy, and, very openly flirt with me from get go, then I know it is a done deal-no guess work-I love it when any woman, REGARDLESS of ethnicity, lets me know she wants me at least as much as I want her-we end up more happy and content getting what be both want without the hassle.<br>  <br>  NOTE: I think mixed heritage women (any ethnicities)  have the most hot women of any group.|`|5WERChMuaa	Well personally I am African American myself but I do get mistaken to be mixed or have a "white" girl personality. The way I see it is we all come from different types of families and backgrounds, therefore the way things are taught in our homes are different. African American families tend to go through allot more struggle then Caucasian families, therefore when an African American person in general is going through something the people around them help them to deal with it as to Caucasians they seem to be more secretive, they want things perfect which won't ever happen. Confidence is all about you, no matter what race you are, you just have to really believe in yourself & really not care what others have to say.|`|cFG8EaH1aa	Good question, I think maybe white people are more influenced by the media? I mean, whenever you see a commercial about lotion or shampoo, there's always some white, blond, thin, beautiful woman with smooth perfect skin. The media jsut doesn't target black women as much as white women. they are not pressured to look good as much.|`|beO40ap7aa	Some are more confident some are less, in my observation its because African Americans dont hold women to the model standards that Caucasians do. With that being said, African American women have less to lose and are thereby more confident maybe.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	that's not always true. i have suffered from more insecurity issues than most in the past, and i'm black.<br>  <br>  i see girls of all races walking around like they're the sh1t tbh. and more power to them!!|`|I1mQQqpCaa	Black people in general are very confident about themselves.   That's why you see black guys getting the most girls because they are extremely confident and will walk up to ANY girl and ask for her number.   It's how we are brought up....|`|238ca7113ff45c9c845ea02e21b7356faa	Black ppl got bold-looking beauty and that's why they are confident.|`|kSFu2L6caa	B/c we look better duh!<br>  <br>  At least I do!

They're also quite often gay (why else do they always chase after skinny, boyish looking girls)? Not easy being a white girl these days.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	well dear - your questions comes across quite harsh so be prepared for some strong reactions.  i am hoping you are sincere in your question.  most black gals that i know who may not be considered "beauty queens" have confidence because they are taught from a young age - they are special and all children of God are beautiful in His eyes.  they then walk around with a confiddence and inner glow brough about by peace.  in the black community men also find women attractive based upon their spirit and the soul and not just outward appearance. in the "white" culture (excluding some eurpean cultures) it's all about materialistic things and looks are just another something you can buy.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	several studies actually proved black women feel more confident in their bodies than caucasian women. when comparing a black woman who weighs 200lbs to a white woman who weighs 200lbs, the black woman would feel 'thinner' than the white lady. I don't know why though.  and don't always be fooled by loud or boisterous as confident, people wear several masks, many 'shy' woman have good self esteem and body image.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	Anyone can have confidence. I feel like black people in general have this mentality that "we have to be better". So black women feel like they have to have more confidence then anyone else just to get on the same level as white women or other women.<br>  <br>  There is a fine line between cock*ness and confidence. Some black girls are arrogant. You don't have to walk around saying your beautiful. If you really felt beautiful you wouldn't have to remind yourself everyday.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Because most black girls don't care what someone thinks about them. It's their body, and their gonna flaunt it whether you don't think they should. And if you say something, you might get punched in the mouth.

Every serial killer does not start out big, they first kill animals and then burn houses and then they rape women and then they rape and kill their victims and then see if they can get away with it and they get better and better at it until they find that they can kill and kill again.

They have every fruit tree known to man in that one garden and they still screw up and eat from that one tree.  God put that tree there because he gave man free will.  He dosn't force us to do anything.  So, Eve decided to eat from the tree because the devil decived her, and Adam ate because he didn't want to leave Eve.

When we were in our lesser evolved state we had no idea of good or evil only survival and in "bliss" because of it. When we made that step, ate the fruit, and could tell the difference we could only be better beings.<br>  <br>  If there were never any bad people you would not know what a good person was. If there was never war then you would not know peace. I think that there will always be evil people and I think they were destined to be that way, If your like me then you cant imagine how people murder but to them they seem to have no regret other than getting caught. Its Gods way of letting us know we are not gods, we are not perfect and must always look inside and put checks on our self.

wia35rNKaa	How difficult would it be for you to imagine that jesus was not real at all? Think about it...the only evidence we have that he was an actual person is the bible. THAT IS IT. Any writings after the introduction of Jesus are problematic for 2 reasons...<br>  First, people will attribute things to Jesus based on nothign at all...they will feel or believe it is jesus speaking with them, so in their minds it was Jesus.<br>  Secondly, how difficult would it have been to create situations that Jesus was in without Jesus actually having existed. <br>  <br>  How difficult is it to actually know that jesus walked on water and fro someone to just invent that fact and then say he walked on water. Not much difference between the two...think about it.<br>  <br>  Plus, I love when people say that they saw jesus...yet they saw jesus as a 6 foot man or so, beard and long hair, usually white, with good abs. the concept of jesus is different depending on what region or culture he is in...if he was middle eastern and was alive 2000 years ago, he would most probably have been much shorter, dark completed, wide nose.

She was a horny teenager in full puberty. She was very eagerly submitting to the advances of the proxy agent Saint Gabriel that God the Holy Ghost sent to fix a deal with her. She didn’t hesitate for one moment to comply with the request of a perfect stranger! So it was not a rape, but more like a horny young girl's dream to lay God the Holy Ghost come true! <br>  <br>  It appears that as soon as Saint Joseph leaves the house on an errand and the Virgin Mary stays home alone, God the Holy Ghost “overcomes” her in a most divine copulation of unprotected sex ever recorded in a religious story ending in a positive pregnancy. She was never married to God the Holy Ghost! She was not married to Saint Joseph, either.  She was only engaged to be married to him.  Saint Joseph is not the legitimate father of the Baby God the Son Jesus Christ! So what does that make Jesus, but a Holy b-a-s-tard? There are plenty of vulgar words with the initials SOB that we can use to describe him, but since the Early Church Fathers came up with the brilliant idea to bestow on the Blessed Virgin Mary the title of Perpetual Virginity nobody would dare to call Jesus any vulgar name!  No matter what kind of instrument was used in the sexual encounter that Mary had with God the Holy Ghost HER VIRGINITY WAS NEVER COMPROMISED! <br>    <br>  The Blessed Virgin Mary kept her pregnancy a secret from her fiancé Saint Joseph for 6 months! When he found out that she was getting big around her slender belly he was going to dump her.  Mary assured him that she was going to mother God.  Fortunately Saint Joseph had a dream that same night confirming her statements so he kept her!  When you love someone that badly you are bound to dream anything! Most Christians believe that the marriage of Saint Joseph to the Virgin Mary was never consummated between the 2. Today, the Holy Sucker Saint Joseph is the Guardian Saint Protector of the Virgin Mary’s Perpetual Virginity and also the Saint Protector of all the Christian believers in the World!<br>  <br>  Because of the Holy Trinity connection, the Blessed Virgin Mary became recognized as the Mother of God conceived without the “original sin?”. Always virgin! Her hymen was not torn neither during the intercourse with God the Holy Ghost, nor during her pregnancy or at delivery! That is a miracle or maybe God the Holy Ghost had a very small penis… spiritually speaking, of course!  The Virgin Mary’s virginity is a miracle verified by Saint Salome to the fullest satisfaction of the Early Church Fathers! Nobody can prove any abuse! In 1950 it became a Church dogma that she ascended bodily into Heaven! Now she is officially known as the Queen of Heaven and the Mother of God! I don’t believe that she would be willing to complain about any statutory rape or abuse!!! The Vatican compensated her beyond her wildest dreams! LUCKY TEENAGER!<br>  <br>  The Blessed Virgin Mary was really drenched in Holy Sperm from head to toe like the Early Church Fathers report!  <br>  <br>  GOSPEL OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/gosbart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnosis.org/library/gosbart.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Chapter 2 (II)<br>  3 Bartholomew therefore said unto Peter: Thou that art the chief, and my teacher, draw near and ask her. But Peter said to John: Thou art a virgin and undefiled and thou must ask her.<br>  4 And as they all doubted and disputed, Bartholomew came near unto her with a cheerful countenance and said to her: Thou that art highly favored the tabernacle of the Most High, unblemished we, even all the apostles, ask thee to tell us how thou didst conceive the incomprehensible.<br>  5 But Mary said unto them: Ask me not concerning this mystery. If I should begin to tell you, fire will issue forth out of my mouth and consume all the world. <br>  6 But they continued yet the more to ask her. And she, for she could not refuse to hear the apostles, said: Let us stand up in prayer<br>  <br>  (7 Verses PRAYING IN PENTECOSTAL TONGES…) <br>  <br>  14 And when she had ended the prayer she began to say unto them: Let us sit down upon the ground; and come thou, Peter the chief, and sit on my right hand and put thy left hand beneath mine armpit; and thou, Andrew, do so on my left hand; and thou, John, the virgin, hold together my bosom; and thou, Bartholomew, set thy knees against my back and hold my shoulders, lest when I begin to speak my bones be loosed one from another* (*she was anticipating an orgasmic experience of humongous proportions just at the thought of having had sex with God the Holy Ghost! It is all in the Early Church Father’s writings!). <br>  15 And when they had so done she began to say: When I abode in the temple of God, on a certain day there appeared unto me one in the likeness of an angel. <br>  16 And straightway the veil of the temple was rent and there was a very great earthquake, and I fell upon the earth, for I was not able to endure the sight of him.<br>  17 But he put his hand beneath me and raised me up, and I looked up into heaven AND THERE CAME A CLOUD OF DEW AND SPRINKLED ME FROM THE HEAD TO THE FEET* (*this is not hard to imagine if you already watched any ******* movie!), and he wiped me with his robe.<br>  <br>  The Blessed Virgin Mary never lost her virginity during her sexual intercourse with God the Holy Ghost or even during DELIVERY of the Baby God Jesus Christ! According to... <br>  <br>  THE PROTEVANGELIUM OF SAINT JAMES <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.ht...</a><br>  <br>  19. And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. And she said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to thee: a virgin has brought forth-a thing which her nature admits not of. Then said Salome: As the Lord my God liveth, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the **** parts, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth. <br>  20. And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show thyself* (*spread thy legs!), for no small controversy has arisen about thee. And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire. <br>  <br>  This Early Church Father’s account comes at the tune of "?? Faith of our Fathers… living still…??? we shall be true to thee to the end…???"|`|3061ed3a2f1d09c904ae44f8dc455d7daa	You don't have to be a Christian to answer this question.

"I AM"), "Elohim" (the Hebrew word for 'god', i.e. Gen. 1), and "Adonai," which means "master" or "lord."  "Jehovah" is often joined in usage to the word "elohim," as in Gen. 15:2.  It is also joined to other words.  For example, Jehovah-jireh which means "the Lord will provide" (Gen. 22:13-14); Jehovah-rapha which means "The Lord who heals" (Exodus 15:26); Jehovah-shalom which means "the Lord our peace" (Judges 6:24); and Jehovah-tsidkenu, which is "the Lord our righteousness" (Jer. 23:6).  In the NT, God is known as the "Father" (John 17) and the "Word" (John 1:1,14), etc.<br>  <br>  John 8:58 and 10:30-33, "I am."<br>  <br>  Jesus said in John 8:58, "Before Abraham was, I am." This is a very important verse to Trinitarians because it is one of the places we use to show that Jesus is God. We maintain that Jesus attributed the divine name of God ("I AM" from Exodus 3:14), to Himself.  But this verse alone may not be sufficient to prove His deity. There are a combination of other verses that contribute to the doctrine. Nevertheless, there are many non-Christian groups that deny that Jesus is God. Therefore, when they come to this verse, it must be dealt with. The reason is simple. If Jesus did say, "I am", it would give strong evidence that Jesus was claiming to be God.<br>  <br>  This answer will not attempt to analyze the Greek translation principles that have lead various Bibles to render John 8:58 as, "I have been," or "I was in existence," etc. Suffice it to say that the best recognized translations which have sought literal renderings of the text, have translated the verse as "I am": NASB, NIV, KJV, RSV, etc.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witness Watchtower organization claims that the best translation of John 8:58 is "Before Abraham was, I have been." Notice that they do not have it say, "I am."  Is it legitimate for the Watchtower organization to insist that John 8:58 is best translated as "I have been"? Let's take a look.<br>  Ego Eimi means "I am"<br>  <br>  In Greek, the words recorded in John 8:58 are "'prin abraam genesthai ego eimi." Literally, this is "Before Abraham was existing, I am." "Ego eimi" is literally, "I am." This is the present tense. To say "I have been" is to use the perfect tense.  In Greek, his would have been "aemane."  But Jesus didn't use it here.  He used the present tense, "ego eimi" which is "I am."<br>  <br>  There are places, however, in the New Testament where the Greek present tense of 'ego eimi', "I am", can be translated into the English perfect tense, "I have been." An example of this is John 14:9 where Jesus says, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me..." In this verse, "Have I been" is originally the Greek present tense, 'ego eimi'. But here, Jesus was answering the statement in verse 8, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." Since in English it is awkward to say, "I am with you so long and you still don't know me....?", it is then rendered as, "Have I been with you so long and you have not come to know me....?" The translation of the Greek present into the English perfect tense is perfectly justifiable here because it doesn't make sense in English. But is it the case with John 8:58? Must it be translated as "I have been"? No. There is no linguistic requirement to translate it as "I have been" particularly when you notice that the Jews wanted to kill Jesus after he said, "ego eimi."<br>  <br>  Jesus has two natures man and God.<br>  Jesus' Two Natures: God and Man<br>  <br>  Jesus is God in human flesh. He is not half God and half man. He is fully divine and fully man. That is, Jesus has two distinct natures: divine and human. Jesus is the Word who was God and was with God and was made flesh, (John 1:1,14). This means that in the single person of Jesus is both a human and divine nature. The divine nature was not changed. It was not altered. He is not merely a man who "had God within Him" nor is he a man who "manifested the God principle." He is God, second person of the Trinity. "The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word," (Heb. 1:3, NIV). Jesus' two natures are not "mixed together," nor are they combined into a new God-man nature. They are separate yet act as a unit in the one person of Jesus. This is called the Hypostatic Union.<br>  <br>  The following chart should help you see the two natures of Jesus "in action":<br>  GOD MAN<br>  He is worshiped (Matt. 2:2,11; 14:33). He worshiped the Father (John 17).<br>  He was called God (John 20:28; Heb. 1:8) He was called man (Mark 15:39; John 19:5).<br>  He was called Son of God (Mark 1:1) He was called Son of Man (John 9:35-37)<br>  He is prayed to (Acts 7:59). He prayed to the Father (John 17).<br>  He is sinless (1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15). He was tempted (Matt. 4:1).<br>  He knows all things (John 21:17). He grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52).<br>  He gives eternal life (John 10:28). He died (Rom. 5:8).<br>  All the fu

I was getting food from this church, because I am disabled and needed help with food. This woman was put up to this by a  woman that teaches Bible classes. My husband is taking classes for RCIA. I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS. Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX. Thanks for letting us get this off of our chest, I don't need the stress of being treated this way because of heart problems, I have 2 leaking valves in my heart, from all the heart attacks and dying due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Rhuematic Fever.

Of course not!  So why would the Church allow not someone who has been given some kind of a five-hour "faith support" course to minister to one of their flock?  Would the Church allow a nurse or a doctor who has been given a "faith support" course to come into the Church and tend to the spiritual needs of their congregation?  Of course not.  So, how are the "faith needs" of a sick or dying patient any less important than the congregation in the Church?<br>  <br>  By doing this the Church is, in effect, admitting that ministering to the faithful (at least the sick and dying faithful) is all SHOW with no real caring.<br>  <br>  If the Church wants sick and dying patients to have their "faith needs" tended to, then they should make the time to tend to those patients, THEMSELVES!<br>  .|`|QPB6e3lVaa	I think that the National Secular Society is over-reacting.

I really don't see anything wrong with asking someone if they would like spiritual counsel if they are ill and in the hospital. Many people will have their own clergy they can ask to come and visit them, but often the hospital chaplains are very able to give "general" Christian support that covers most all denominations. I see nothing wrong with this. If someone is an atheist or, like me, a Pagan, we can always say no, and find our own people to call upon. It's not as if the hospital is forcing you to have a chaplain visit you.|`|5IkvPgfuaa	It sounds like a total waste of money. Money that could be better spent.

The 20th century was the century of atheism and has resulted in the most horrifying bloodbath in human history. The atheists have slaughtered at least 100 million people in 100 years. It's time for reasonable people to stand up and defend the rights of believers, and to encourage the human conscience instead of denying it. The world is a better and safer place when people think there is something wrong with killing the innocent. That faith and hope are virtues worth upholding. That there might be a God, and to wonder what He would think of you. To defend the rights of the poor and the weak gives people something to live for and hope for. No wonder people will die for their faith. What is the atheist answer? Death camps? People have a right to their faith, and it's cruel to deny it to them when they are at their weakest and most vulnerable. Shame on them.

I will be watching for your answers.|`|syIp6d2Naa	There are a lot of these kinds of things in the Bible, Starting in Genesis, You must remember that man wrote down the words even those spoken directly from Jesus in the New Testament. Men are fallible and put their own understanding of the words and added or took away as they believed it to be right. Then take the fact that the Bible was not written in english, but in different languages of the men who wrote these things down. In many languages there are words other nationalities use that there is no word in their language so they must translate the meaning by using different words. Now have more men translate these into languages not spoken by the peoples of the Bible but translated into their own language and you have more changes as the same thing happens. Man tries to translate it to words in his language that all who speak that language can understand. There are many words used in the Bible that do not mean the same now. People misuse a word and if it is misused it long enough it can often come to take on the wrong meaning. Simple words like "vamp" for many years a woman who portrayed sinuous demeanor was called a vamp. The original meaning is the main support in women's shoes with heels, it prevents the shoe from collapsing. the word witch meant "traitor to the church". In Califorina they have strong hot winds, the Native Americans and the Mexicans in the area called them devil winds, or Santana, it has been misused so much now it is the norm to call them Santa Ana winds, which is a town and the name means Saint Ann.<br>  Look at the difference in those words alone. I hope this helps, Isn't it amazing how badly mankind can mess things up. I bet God looks at the mess we have made of his world and the people in it and cries, it's a far cry from the perfect place it started out to be.|`|luwBPdE8aa	I don't have a source for this but I have been told atheist artists pained Jesus with long hair to make him look bad.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Shades of Jerry Lee Lewis!  Actually, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt were 5th cousins, but who's counting? However, Einstein, Poe, and Darwin all married their first cousins.  A large percentage of the Arab world also arranges marriages between first cousins.  John Adams, the second President of the United States, married his third cousin, Abigail Smith, just as Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom married her third cosuin, Phillip of Greece.  <br>  <br>  After the Reformation, European royalty had to confine its marriages to either fellow Protestants or Roman Catholics, a practice that severely limited potential marriages, although the practice was popular before this time as well since Mary Tudor married Phillip of Spain, her first cousin once removed, and Mary, Queen of Scots, married her half first cousin (Is this a relationship?), Henry Darnley Stuart.  <br>  <br>  Certainly, after 1701 and the Act of Settlement, British royals were primarily limited to marrying royals from Scandinavian countries or German principalities because they were forbidden from marrying Roman Catholics. <br>  <br>  Until the 16th century, however, the Roman Catholic Church wouldn't allow marriages within six degrees of consanguinity--at least without appropriate dispensation.  Henry VIII, for example, had to get special permission to marry his brother Arthur's widow.  When Katherine of Aragon produced no living male heirs, Henry VIII at first sought a divorce on the grounds consanguinity.  The Catholic Church still forbids marriage between third cousins (to the fourth degree of consanguinity). <br>  <br>  Finally, if many amateur genealogists look back far enough, they may find instances of first cousin marriages.  My great, great grandparents (William Young Box and Nancy Jane Henderson), for instance, were first cousins.

This line of kings is called the Achaemenian line after Achaemenes the father of Teispes.<br>  <br>  The early history of Cyrus II is somewhat obscure, depending largely upon rather fanciful accounts by Herodotus (Greek historian of the fifth century?B.C.E.) and Xenophon (another Greek writer of about a half century later). However, both present Cyrus as the son of the Persian ruler Cambyses by his wife Mandane, the daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. (Herodotus, I, 107, 108; Xenophon’s Cyropaedia, I, ii, 1) This blood relationship of Cyrus with the Medes is denied by Ctesias, another Greek historian of the same period, who claims instead that Cyrus became Astyages’ son-in-law by marrying his daughter Amytis.|`|m29eEm57aa	seleucid, probably.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	No, he was Persian.|`|pnyoaSPVaa	No, Miley is not Jewish.

I feel that religion gives you a bad sense of generally everything and the only light is in its teachings, and even after death you are doomed.....i call shenanigans.  <br>  <br>  People get so worked up over what happens after we die that most of us forget to live the life we have.

That simple  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

God has made salvation very simple: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  Trust in Jesus as Lord and your sins will be forgiven by the Grace of God.  It is by Grace we are saved from damnation not by works or deeds.

But he came and taught us that we can get to heaven IF we do all that is required of us! From believing in God, that Jesus was the only angel that had not sinned so he got the job as God's son, we are to be serious about God all the time, willing to help others, praying and believing all the time. Jesus even said that for a person to even think of having sex with anyone other than their married opposite mate (husband & wife) that they were sinning. And that we should only marry if we can not control our urges/needs. <br>  That it is best if we can give all of ourselves to God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost, not just a small part.<br>  Studies have been done on "life after death" and they found studying people that had died and were saved (brought back to life) that anyone that had tried to kill themselves went strait to hell.

fuN8BZp9aa	I think I might agree <br>  as long as I understand what you are saying.<br>  The same teens who would hate to wear uniforms, beg their parents to buy them the same clothes as "everyone" else.<br>  Those who insist they are anti-mainstream and non-conformist get tattoos, piercings, and color their hair like their friends do.<br>  People like to fit in and not be out casted. In many places it is a form of social survival. Many people, especially teenagers, base their opinions of others based on their appearances. So dressing like most people is a shield to keep negative attention away and attract more friends. <br>  But like you said about the Northface, I stopped trying to keep up with the designer name game before I even went to high school when I discovered that the name was not enough.

Abortion was the humane choice.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	I am against abortion overall in every case.  The commandment is Thous shall not Murder.  Murder is the UNJUSTIFIED taking of a life. Of which nearly every case of abortion is - the unjustified taking of a life.<br>  <br>  This is one of the very very rare and singled out cases in which justification COULD be found.  For many, they will not find justification with this.  One must remember that the commandment is to not take a life with out justification.  Based on circumstances of the girls age, ability to carry one let alone 2 children is the main reasoning it could be justified. <br>  <br>  I am not sure if I had a 9 year old with similar conditions, that I would not opt for the abortion, I do know, however, that I myself was told to terminate for risks to myself and child, I made a choice not to - both myself and child were fine.  13 years later, all is well.  Of course, I was an adult.<br>  <br>  As I said, I am very much against abortion, but if we stick to what the commandment is, Do not Murder, murder being the unjustified taking of life - there could be justification found with this particular case.<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts and understanding|`|wxBFZ41Taa	The Church is not calling the 9 year old girl a murderer. Obviously she is a victim many times over in all of this. However, those who insisted on her abortion, are murderers. <br>  <br>  Does the Church place a higher value on an unborn child? No, we place the SAME value on an unborn chid. The unborn twins are of the same human value as the 9 year old girl. All three are equally human beings, equally valued by God, and equally deserving of their right to life. <br>  <br>  What happened to this child is horrific. I'm sure that her step-father has been abusing her for years. She is traumatized and will suffer the effects of this abuse for her entire life. But does this justify the murder of two innocent unborn people? No, it does not and cannot. The unborn babies are not some disease she caught from her step-father, they are human beings, individuals who should be saved at all costs. <br>  <br>  To kill them because the 9 year old may die does not justify the act of abortion. If, at anytime, the girls life would be in danger, they would have acted to save all three people. No one can place a higher value on one life than another. The Church does not make a distinction between the born and unborn in terms of the value of their human life. All life belongs to God, only God can decide the time of death. <br>  <br>  God tells us that he knows in the womb, before we are born. The Church has consistently taught for 2000 years that the life of the unborn is sacred and it is a sin to kill a child in the womb. The Bible says we cannot do an evil to bring about a perceived good. In other words the murder of the babies, even though the intentions were to help the girl, do not justify the act. The girl is going to be an emotional wreck either way. She is already victimized and killing her babies will not fix that and make it go away. <br>  <br>  This poor young girl is the victim of a monster, and now the twins are victims as well. Three people whose lives have been ruined by one man. <br>  <br>  The worldly idea that an unborn human being is of no value is the problem. The Church has always held that this is not true. Science and the supreme court have never dared determine "when life begins." As Christians, we must defer to God. To his greater plan, his love, compassion and omnipotence. We cannot make ourselves the authority on life and which is more valuable, which is should and should not exist...even when our motivations are good ones. Who are we to decide that those twins are of no value?<br>  <br>  The Church only asked that she go long enough to have the babies born by c-section. She didn't have to carry them to term and give birth naturally...only long enough to allow them to live outside the womb. I think the mother consented because of her own guilt. She wanted it all away from her as to not be reminded of the man she brought into her daughter's life.<br>  <br>  For those who say "abortion is murder...but..." that makes no sense. If you believe the unborn to be a human being, than murdering it because of the circumstances of it's conception make no sense. Are human beings only valued on certain conditions, or are they valued by virtue of the fact that they are human beings created in the image and likeness of God? These twins were human beings, with souls, they did nothing wrong and yet they were sentenced to die for their father's crimes. That is a crime.|`|zkPSQs7xaa	Its because most Christians adopt an Im better than u attitude.<br>  They become judge juror and god themselves and think they know it all.<br>  Its a disgrace...and they are more or less advocating rape.<br>  But when u look at christianity...young virgins being given to soldiers, allah and his young virgin brides or whatever..they are seriously misled and perverted|`|o8o689x5aa	Generally, I don't believe in abortion, because it is murder. However, in this case, it was the right thing to do. No 9 yr old should have to carry to term a child much less twins.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Good heavens, like the poor child hasn't already been through enough at the hands of a pedophile, now the church has got to make it worse?

This will ultimately be between the girl and God, and I understand the lethal medical ramifications of her situation. So it is a tough chioce, though her local community should not be so harsh on condemning her. It will be up to her and the local community to seek each other's forgiveness in this matter. I'm more interested in hearing what, if any, molestation charges will be pressed on her stepfather. The family itself should be investigated as well as friends and the surrounding neighborhood. Obviously, the stepfather was not leading a sound Christian life.|`|5WIZowKOaa	Although the Bible refers to God seeing the embryo before you even know it is there which constitutes this a life from the very beginning, God certainly would not approve of imperfect humans judging one another. He sees what is in your heart and knows everything about each one of us more than we know ourselves. These so called christians and religions should looke at themselves first!|`|USGHB6fYaa	Christians aren't crazy. <br>  <br>  Abortion is murder and it's not the children's fault that they were conceived. Had she not had an abortion I would have said that she should have the children taken out by cesarean by a month or two early. Also, the stepfather who did this to her should have been placed with 2 murders on his record and should serve time for that. Not just in jail, but in prison where he belongs. Also, if the 9 year old being pregnant would kill her then he should be put in prison for 3 murders.<br>  <br>  Do you know that she may never be able to have children again because of the abortions? That man has ruined her life, not only possibly physically but emotionally and mentally.<br>  <br>  I don't think abortion was the answer, I think cesarean was the answer (even though they said it would killer her because of her being so small) they could have been wrong like they are on a lot of other things. And after the children were taken out early they should have gotten some medical treatment and been adopted out.  To add a note, my mother was told that she would die if she carried her child, they pushed her to have an abortion but she didn't. And though they told her also that the child wouldn't make it, he did and he is now a normal 20 year old boy and was never anything BUT normal. <br>  <br>  The abortions where wrong, it wasn't the children's fault and that man needs to be in prison for a long time because he's a no good, low down, worthless b@stard.|`|eph8JOhBaa	On reading stories like this, I really wish that Hell DID exist.

9Iy69I3Qaa	i do have a friend like that. now shes my girlfriend, but we still act like that, and acted like that before. we seriously saw eachother every single day. when one of us was on vacation, we still texted every single day and sent pictures of where we were all the time. we knew abolsutly everything about eachother. people often thought we were dating before we truly were, so when we did start dating, it was no big surprise to anyone. we knew eachother since we were 7. so thats 8 years of the most amazing friendship. we tell eachother absolutly everything. we dont get embarrassed over anything between us. like, if we were over one of our houses and one of us had to go to the bathroom,  (and this happened even before we were dating) we wouldnt shut the door. we'd just go. and when one of us was in the shower and the other needed to do her hair or makeup or brush her teeth, we just would. we didnt care, and we still dont. our teachers all know we are basically joined at the hip. when they need to know something about one of us, just ask the other. we live 4 houses away from eachtoher, though she basically lives at my house. when we were cold we would cuddle on the couch since we were just so comfortable around eachother. we never argue. we see everything the same way and always agree. i dont know why, we just do. our friendship was amazing to begin with. and now it has turned into an amazing relationship which, when it ends, will simply have made the initial friendship even stronger.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	I have....always have been. My best friend differs from junior high, to high school, to college. <br>  <br>  how did I end up so close? Usually from the basic thing, just going out together and such. I don't believe in being friends should have same characteristics, because the best friend I had right now are so, completely the opposite of me. But we can't not get out together! <br>  <br>  Btw, all of my friends are straight guys. Somehow, gay guys don't want to hang out with me because I'm an out person.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I'm a lesbian and have a male among my three closest friends. Everyone thought we were more than friends but that was never the case. We became friends over time and found we had a lot of the same interests, and thought about the world and people the same. We found we could talk to each other about anything. He griped about his wife once in a while (he was totally faithful and in love with her) when she got on his nerves about something, and I did the same as the woman I was with could at times get on God's nerves. The women I am friends with I've known between 30 and 40 years, my partner met them when we first got together and was a little uncomfortable about us being friends because one of them is an ex. Once she got to know them though she became friends with them also. So where your a gay male wanting a male friend straight or not it's ok. Friends come to us in all forms and as long as you respect the rules of friendship, being truthful and never repeating a confidence, both sharing your thoughts, feelings and allowing the other their own way of thinking, supporting them even when you think it might not be the best thing for them, and them doing the same for you, it should develop a good long lasting friendship. We've remained friends through good times and bad, through the trials and good times of their and my relationships with people. We've rolled on the floor laughing at ourselves and held eachother as we cried over something, and never crossed the line between friendship and other. So don't look for a friend because of what they are, but look for one in who they are.|`|G6BG7id2aa	yea i used to have a friend like that, but idk what happened i just got to caught up in some other stuff and just ignored him and he tried talking again but i basically told him to go pi$s off.... but then later on i realized how much a jerk he was :$|`|08QtgdpOaa	I did though the last 4 years of highschool, but during the few years after we graduated, we drifted apart.

They are possible, and wonderful when they happen.  I don't think you can find one, or make it; they just happen when the chemistry is right.

Its one of those ways they show its inconsistency and subconscious doubt. Most religious people told they are going to die of cancer are not "Woo, Jesus here I come." Their loved ones aren't hugging them happily and saying "I think you are so lucky you will know you will be in heaven by six months to a year and I know I'll get to see you there in a brief time." No they are usually, justifiably terrified and their loved ones naturally traumatized knowing they are losing someone they love. They will try to fight it and live. Religion is a psychological patch in my opinion. It helps some people cope with life, motivates some to bring out their better qualities, and alleviates some loneliness and fear. It can also make people anti-intellectual, intolerant, dogmatic, and eager to impose theocracy. Religion is just a human social/psychological tool in my opinion. The honest response to death you see from most people is indicative that this is so and that many subconsciously whether they want to admit it or not know or suspect so.|`|7sEFufRbaa	I wonder did you stay up all night thinking of that one  Or  is your life that pathetic that you post a statement just so all your little cohorts will justify your opinion with a "Life Advancing" star?   <br>  <br>  The way I see it is that All religions teach to believe in  God and do good.  However,  It seems to me that the atheistic dogma provides its disciples with the convenience of a life style devoid of moral consequences. What precludes an atheist from committing vile acts against humanity when there is no governing doctrine which condemns them from doing so?|`|6jAVElX7aa	we view life as sacred not as some of you who dont think  anything about abortions or killing the child within.

Jesus called hell a place of "outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 25:30). In one of His parables, Jesus told of a man who was in hell, begging for someone to come and "cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire" (Luke 16:24). The only companions anyone will have in hell will be "the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).<br>  <br>  There is much we don't know about hell—but we know all we need to know. And the most important thing we know about hell is that we don't have to go there! Yes, we have sinned, and we deserve only God's judgment.

Do you have to have permission to congratulate them?  What is the point of congratulate individuals for circumstances of their birth?  International Women's Day, like a few other special days, sounds like one more ploy on the part of the system to put back a small token amount into a cause from which it has "taken", or stolen, a lot.

There is a Bible verse that says"I will never leave you or forsake you".  A lovely promise, but a threat as well.  He will constantly use circumstances to give opportunity for you to "come home".  As a Catholic, I believe that God is logical.  Scripture supports this as it speaks numerous times of the order of things and precision of certain objects and buildings.  His plan and covenants throughout the ages also exemplify His ultimate logic.  The video you provided cites the Bible numerous times, a good thing.   Some Christians believe all truth is in the Bible.  A useful tool, the living word of God, that it is!  It is not scriptual, though, that it contains all truths.  The Bible states that the Church is the pillar of truth in Paul's letters.  At the time, and up until the Reformation, that was the Catholic Church.  I suggest you read Lamb of God by Scott Hahn.  It reveals, logically, God's plan throughout history.  He has written several other books about the Church, as well.  Read the writings of the early Church Fathers(you won't find to many in the Christian book stores, but there's lots on line and Catholic web sights).  Unfortunately for you, faith is and always will be a matter of the heart.

I was getting food from this church, because I am disabled and needed help with food. This woman was put up to this by a  woman that teaches Bible classes. My husband is taking classes for RCIA. I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS.

That is your free will.<br>  Many Christians think God is this person just waiting for us to sin/mess up so he can punish us. This isn't God at all. They don't know him. <br>  <br>  Many have problems with suffering in this world and a loving God that would allow it. I understand this is hard. God has allowed free will for good and free will for bad. Can't have one without the chance of the other.<br>  <br>  All I can say is I've prayed many times and each and every prayer was answered. Some in the most amazing ways that could only logically be from a God that heard my prayers. I'll tell you one that is very very small indeed compared to the many others. I was sick, had an operation and was very weak. Needed to get to the DR and didn't have the strength to drive. I was crying on the couch praying. Just as I started to pray an acquaintance called and asked if she could help me in anyway. She drove me to the DR. One could say this was a coincidence but if one adds hundreds of these "coincidences"  over the years there's no way one could deny the existence of a living God.<br>  <br>  ?|`|7sEFufRbaa	As to this notion that I or any Christian has to 'prove' God to you I am neither compelled nor determined to do so. Why? You have science. Use your science that you rely on to give you the irrefutable proof that you need. You will never accept any proof that I or any other Christian would provide you. You would claim our ignorance, lack or understanding on science, as you put it our brainwashing or some other insulting demeaning classification. So why should a Christian bother to try and convince you of what we believe. This is just a cat and mouse game. I see the atheist's unwillingness to explore God through science as simple cowardness on your parts because you fear that either one you will discover Him or two you will see how inadequate science truly is.

Until then He gives you the chance to choose to repent and receive forgiveness from all of your self inflicted corruption, or to continue stock piling your crimes against the Lord which will be held against you in the Court of His Law. <br>  <br>  You speak as if we're all outside your door begging and pleading and waiting for you to decide to convert so we can get a gold star in heaven or something. God does not need you. It is a PRIVILEGE and an HONOR to know about God and to be part of OUR family! It is not God's will that you should perish but that you should have everlasting life with Him, but you take great liberty in the way you speak about your Creator, and God is in no way obliged to answer such a prideful and pretentious and faithless call for Him to unveil Himself to you. God does not sit in heaven trembling and saying, "Oh my, he doesn't believe in Me! What ever shall I do?!" No, rather God says, "You are made of dust and to dust you will go. But if you set aside your pompous arrogance and admit that you are a smart mouthed breaker of my Law and confess that I died to save your worthless carcase, I will condescend to forgive your filthy corruption and give you eternal life.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Most are cheating the system? Only some are cheating the system. Do not think that most welfare recipients are cheating the system when they are not. <br>  <br>  No, I don't think a woman who doesn't work and has 6 kids should have welfare. Tax payers should not have to pay for her. she should not have 6 kids in the first place. <br>  No we should NOT have to deal with other's mistakes.<br>  But then again don't we all make mistakes? <br>  <br>  In my view of welfare, I think it should not be abolished but restricted. Welfare people should have to do drug tests. Welfare should not come in the form of money. It should be in like a debit card so they can't use it to buy drugs. <br>  <br>  Welfare people should also have jobs. If not, they should be full time students. At least doing SOMETHING. The number of children should be restricted. Two at the most. If they do not have a job, they should be a student or disabled or giving proof that they are trying to find a job. <br>  <br>  Even though the parents made mistakes, the children should not be punished. We should better their schools and make life easier for them to succeed in life. We should NOT under ANY circumstances tell them, "OH WELFARE KID YOU ARE GOING TO END UP ON WELFARE LIKE YOUR MOM." no that is the wrong approach. We should tell them that they can do anything. We should encourage them to do well in school and go to college. College can happen if you're poor. If the kid got good grades and has dreams, then NO ONE should stop him/her from going to college. Some Republicans say that college funds should be cut. They should not. Poor people can not afford college AT ALL and what if there is a poor kid who did well in school and is deserving? Do not judge all of them. <br>  <br>  The reason why poor people are staying poor is because they are ignored and kicked out of society. Of course, there are other factors too like not getting enough support from tehir parents, getting pregnant or getting into violence. They don't get the support they need t obe self reliant tax payers. The only way out of poverty is education. I believe we can reduce poverty, but poverty will always be there.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, the US would look bad if people were dying of starvation.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	My views:<br>  <br>  People shouldn't be on it for over 12 months. That's plenty of time to get a job. If a woman pops out a kid out while on welfare then we shouldn't have to pay for that child. Many mothers pops out children while on welfare to get more money. <br>  <br>  I feel bad for California citizens because their money is going to those fourteen children with the crazy, unstable mother.|`|cXXJVz64aa	Welfare is a necessity. What should a woman do when her husband disappears after she has a bunch of kids? I feel that if someone goes on welfare, it should not pay for any new children born 10 months after getting on it. That discourages people from using it indefinitely.|`|ENzHIUdOaa	I always get even.<br>  <br>  If i see a welfare bum who is obviously benefitting from free government money (MY money) i will do everything possible to punish these parasites for their slothfulness and slovenliness.<br>  <br>  If they ask me for help, i laugh in their face. If they try to steal from me, i destroy them. If they move into my neighborhood, i make life hell for them.|`|1yJWrccXaa	Against it; far too many cheaters and abuse of the system.  The current system is too broken.  Abolish it and offer a small assistance for the truly needy.|`|Rh2tpV1Faa	I think it is ok if it for disability.  As far as for women with kids they can't support i don't agree either.  I think the system is getting abused by the drug addicts and irresponsible people that have kids when they can't support them.  This has been a real issue with me lately because i have seen how the system really works.  I am 32 and i have worked since i was 15 with no gap in employment.  I have no kids and have never used drugs and i don't drink.  I have been seriousley mentally ill my whole life and been able to deal with it until recently because my employer harassed me and drove me to the looney bin.  I have paid in my share to the system and i feel i should get help that i really need.  I have had a hard time because i don't have kids.  The answer is YES it pisses me off when people that really need and want help can't it because they don't have kids.  I think they need to do drug testing every month if you recieve assistance.|`|AA11510145	I'm torn because there are people who truly need this and do not take advantage of it. There are also allot of people who take advantage of it and that irritates me. <br>  <br>  I agree that once you are using the benefit you should not be allowed to have additional children. I also think that there are some medical procedures that should not be allowed. I also think they should check closer into the households because there are allot of people who are living together as a couple but they don't report this.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	That is unfair but what can you do about it once it happens? You cant kill them and if they end up in a foster home the taxpayers end up paying for it anyway. The only people that should get welfare are kids and people who physically cant work.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Let me ask you a question: Do you think the devil would like for you to get involved in these practices? The answer is yes—and that should be a solemn warning to you.<br>  <br>  The Bible is very clear: If we want to please God, we will avoid everything that has anything to do with the occult (even if it seems innocent or harmless on the surface). The reason is because occult practices of any kind could involve you with spiritual forces that are opposed to God and are, in fact , in league with the devil.<br>  <br>  I know that is a strong statement—but I can't emphasize strongly enough how spiritually dangerous it is to follow Satan's way rather than God's way. When the Ephesians who had practiced the occult became Christians, they "brought their (magic) scrolls together and burned them publicly" (Acts 19:19). They knew there could be no compromise between their old way of living and God's way.<br>  <br>  Don't try to resist the "pull" you feel toward the occult in your own strength. Instead, by faith turn to Christ and ask Him to come into your life and give you the strength of His Holy Spirit. Don't be deceived, but come to Christ, who alone is "the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6). <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  E-mail me anytime at the above addy.|`|99hfFssXaa	they don't work...|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Someone moves the cursor.|`|UnLkBsViaa	The ouija board doesn't know anything, it's just cardboard and wood.

It may be a result of terrible pain or emotion and I feel for anyone who is so desperate that they feel this is the best option. But it is still selfish.

E8rFixesaa	Im so sorry. I hope that you can get over it. I know how you feel. You still want to love the person but they dont love you anymore. Its just as painful as breaking up with someone. I really do think you need to move on becuz there is no changing who a person likes and doesn't like. Are you sure its not lust ur having??? Cuz that happens a lot when it involves  a HOT guy. But since you cant avoid forgetting him since you see him everyday, set things straight. What I think you should do is talk to him. Tell him ur sorry and if you can be friends. But dont come to him all of a sudden. It might scare him away. And once the other guy is out of the picture, who knows,  he might know you enough to fall in love with you. And you might want to stay out of the dating mood for a while. Just stop thinking about relationships. Its unhealthy to not want to move on though cuz you can hurt yourself by drinking and stuff. But I guess a sorry will make things better. I know its scary but you need to do that unless you want to live in fear everyday.<br>  <br>  Im from NYC too.

I was getting food from this church, because I am disabled and needed help with food. This woman was put up to this by a  woman that teaches Bible classes. My husband is taking classes for RCIA. I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS. Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX. Thanks for letting us get this off of our chest, I don't need the stress of being treated this way because of heart problems, I have 2 leaking valves in my heart, from all the heart attacks and dying due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Rhuematic Fever.

Dde4ZnmYaa	Well atheism doesn't dictate a theory on the creation of the universe. We leave that to scientists. Although l Iike many atheists would point you towards the Big Bang. (Strangely a term first used as an insult by Fred Hoyle)<br>  <br>  There are conflicting ideas on how it started. One current popular school of thought is that there is no "beginning". That the universe explodes, cools, retracts  (big crunch) and explodes again.. At the point where the universe contracts to a singularity time doesn't exist. So the idea of a starting point and a "before" don't apply. If you adopt this circular notion the "latest" big bang occured about 13.7 billion years ago.<br>  <br>  One of the most interesting things I find about the big bang, is so many people find it difficult to believe that matter "just exists" when they are surrounded by it every day.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	First, the theory of evolution has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.  Only religious people say that - not scientists or public school science teachers or anyone with a modicum of education.<br>  <br>  Second, if you've done any research, you know the prevailing scientific theory is the Big Bang Theory of rapid spacetime expansion from a singularity, and that it is supported mathematically and by observations in the universe including the relative motion of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background radiation.<br>  <br>  Third, if you really wanted an answer, you'd ask this in the Astronomy section.  It isn't a question of atheism, it's a question of science.  Many of the people who study cosmological origins are also religious.<br>  <br>  If you really are interested, this is a big topic.  You should start with some university websites and work your way up to "A Brief History of Time" by Hawking.|`|BVVvb8Ieaa	We (humans) dont have all the answers, and the answers we do have are not so simple that I can lay them out in detail for you on yahoo answers. <br>  <br>  To get the info you are looking for you will need to <br>  Go read some books on the subject.

I believe universes have always existed, that there was never a "beginning" as such.<br>  <br>  This is from a Discover magazine article you can read online:<br>  <br>  "...Cosmologists Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok have a radical idea that could wipe away these mysteries. They theorize that the cosmos was never compacted into a single point and did not spring forth in a violent instant. Instead, the universe as we know it is a small cross section of a much grander universe whose true magnitude is hidden in dimensions we cannot perceive. What we think of as the Big Bang, they contend, was the result of a collision between our three-dimensional world and another three-dimensional world less than the width of a proton away from ours—right next to us, and yet displaced in a way that renders it invisible. Moreover, they say the Big Bang is just the latest in a cycle of cosmic collisions stretching infinitely into the past and into the future. Each collision creates the universe anew. The 13.7-billion-year history of our cosmos is just a moment in this endless expanse of time."|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Just look up the cyclical model of the universe...|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	What do you mean by 'it all'?

vhlORK4Waa	What ALL of it? It's kind of long for a tattoo....oh, I see you mean you want the words "Psalm 50" tattoed on your wrist.<br>  <br>  mizmor is the Hebrew word for psalm but I can't find the Hebrew letters - remember that Hebrew is written and read right to left! Nun is the word for 50, ditto with the Hebrew letters.<br>  <br>  Why do you want a tattoo, and why that? Just interested that's all.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word for faith is ????? (emunah) and is an action oriented word meaning "support". This is important because the Western concept of faith places the action on the one you have faith in, such as "faith in God". But, the Hebrew word ????? places the action on the one who "supports God". It is not knowing that God will act, but rather I will do what I can to support God. This idea of support for the word emunah can be seen in Exodus 17:12.<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|AA11389157	Why in the world would you get a tatoo of a Bible verse when the Bible itself says:<br>  <br>  YE SHALL NOT PRINT ANY MARKS UPON YOU: I AM THE LORD.<br>  - Leviticus 19:28<br>  <br>  "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

It's a choice to have children, if you can't take care of them DON'T have them.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	That's a tough issue, especially during hard economic times.  <br>  <br>  I do volunteer outreach and advocacy for the homeless in my area. Our homeless population has exploded in the past year. It was already quite large (this is a major urban US city, after all), but now we're seeing a whole different subset of homeless people. I just recently provided tents, tarps, blankets, sleeping bags and appropriate for the situation food items for several homeless families with children that were solidly middle class last year. I don't think they should lose their children and I feel that a civilized society would do all it could to help  them get back on their feet. It's just difficult to do right now for many people.<br>  <br>  I also believe that having children should *not* be something just anyone can do. Seriously. We make people take a test to drive a car. We make people get a license to own a gun. Why are they allowed to  just pop out children at will? The thought of stupid people reproducing just irritates me. The thought of people who can't afford one child intentionally producing another one or dozen or so also irritates me. However, once the children are here it's not as if anything can be done about it. They do have to be provided for by society whether it be through entitlement programs to keep the family together or some sort of adoption or foster program. It's not as if the child had any choice in the matter after all.|`|JVPwpwYlaa	I agree with you...you need to be licensed to drive a car...educated to get a decent job...but any shlub can procreate...I would go a step further and also rescind all tax breaks for child rearing.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	Once the children are born, if the family can't support them then they will either starve to death or society has to take care of them. I do think that some children should be taken from their families and given up for permanent adoption much more expeditiously than is now done.

In 7th grade, I wouldn't talk very much, but I would everynow and then. And by the 8th grade, I was talking like everyone but I still was quiet. And then I hit onto high school! My freshmen year was awesome!  But it was a lil bit rough. I made friends with juniors and sophmores and a couple of seniors. But mostly freshmen. Two years later, here i am lol. [I'm a junior now...yay!] and I guess, everything is kind of alright now lol. But i am still quiet and shy at times.|`|tJIAiFUraa	...started as someone ignored by everybody... but now, after joining the school's dance squad... i feel cool|`|MWPl41Eeaa	Sorry, but neither I nor anyone around me believes in that crap.<br>  <br>  And, where I come from, no one else does either.|`|Nh7TY185aa	Well here goes. <br>  <br>  Ever since starting school I was abit of a troublemaker and hung out with the wrong crowd. I was pretty ordinary though, would seldom get into fights but wouldn't shy away from them either. Girls were not a major subject for a long time. And I guess upon getting to junior high things went abit flat and I began slipping down the social ladder. Alot of my cooler friends were either expelled or moved schools because they would get busted for drugs on school property or were in juvi for petty theft (breaking into warehouses at 15) <br>  <br>  But before that happened I always felt there was a certain allure to being one of the bad boys, but I lost my edge at 15. I became more settled and less of a risktaker. Like I said before girls were not a major thing and I had a weakness for getting too tongue tied with the opposite sex. So I wasn't on par with my cooler friends who breezed through those situations. I even envied 2 of my mates for being so brazen and doing a three way with a ex teacher one wild weekend. They always seemed so much cooler than me, one of them driving since age 13 because he looked 18 was around 6foot and his mother was an unashamed alcoholic single mother (I never hung out with them after school hours so I was halfway cool in their eyes because of that, never truly one of them). One summer 5 of them got caught for breaking and entering and it split up the friends I would hang with. Mostly because they each got sent to another school. So suddenly I was "orphaned" so to speak. Without the cool crowd I had grown up with. The final years were painful, I had to seek solace with the brainier kids because the other cool kids had a rivalry with my own former cool crowd, we had brawled at one point and they had lost. But now I was the only kid from that group that was left so I had no place.<br>  <br>  The funny thing was that I really respected the whole school hierarchy of popularity. But it was such a false belief system. It really is just a he said she said propaganda game, no one really is cool or at least its all based on lies anyways. <br>  <br>  Well I ended up moving on and during my early 20s got a job etc etc. Still rather humble as a guy with the ladies. And ladies don't really get drawn to being humble. But it took me losing my job and being fed up with mediocre work friends to realise I was wasting my time. So I took off overseas, went to Brazil of all places and hitchhiked all over latin america. It was only then that I was reborn, I got my edge back. I became the party animal again and threw caution into the wind. I got a whole new slew of cool dudes to meet up with and all of them were 10x more badder and smoother with the ladies than any before them. So you can say I picked up some very useful skills. Some had shady pasts, like a colombian guy I found out his father was arrested for dealing in narcotics and financing a paramilitary group. But all in all I turned a blind eye to that, I was in it for the connections. <br>  <br>  Eventually I got connected with all sorts of people over there, I was the gringo who knew the lingo. And had hundreds of friends wherever I would go, ladies were all giving of the attentions and I grew a big pair of nuts that could block out the sun, after alot of near misses with some bad people. But whatever didnt kill me made me stronger right?<br>  <br>  Anyways when I finally decided to return to my suburban existance back home, I realised I wasnt the same meek mild mannered Clarke Kent of before. And so immediately with my new style I attracted women even in the country I never got dates in. It was a real eye opener, but I just had that wild streak in me that comes from living on the edge. So I never shyed away from anything then or since. I think in the end you dont have to look like Brad Pitt or sleep with women who look like Angelina Jolie to boost your confidence because its all about life experience and balls. And even a miss universe cannot deny when she meets a guy with a big pair who doesnt take things lying down. And I literally found that out, when I was in Venezuela and met an ex miss Venezuela. If only my old friends could see me now.

cWuumdy7aa	The proponent of this theory claim that Muhammad himself was the author of the Qur'an. Muhammad used to go to a cave near Makkah and meditate for long hours. During these long meditation sessions, he invented the Qur'an. The theory also claims that Muhammad used to sleep in that cave and he learnt about the historical facts and about future incidents in his dreams. <br>  The above theory, however, can be easily refuted for the following reasons: <br>  1- Muhammad was an illiterate person who did not know how to read or write. He was not known to have an interest in literature and he never composed a single poem in his entire life. Muhammad, therefore, could not have written the Qur'anic text with its superb style that no Arab in Makkah could produce a text similar to it. A person cannot gain the power and fluency of expression via meditation only. <br>  <br>  2- To write a highly perfect text (even a short one) of a majestic style, the writer cannot do without the help of the pen to write, edit, correct, and rewrite again. The Qur'an contain more than 6600 verses that are composed of more than 77000 words. The style of the Qur'an is homogeneous, the ideas are consistent, and the accounts are accurate. Muhammad was illiterate; he did not know how to write. It was impossible for an illiterate person to be able to author such a long text. <br>  <br>  3- Muhammad could not be the author and developer of the social, economical, political, legislative and religious systems that are contained in the Qur'an [and in Islam]. As a matter of fact no single human being could develop such systems by himself alone. If a society or a community endeavors to develop and perfect such systems, it will need large numbers of thinkers, philosophers, experts in sociology, religious scholars, politicians, and men of wisdom. It will need also many years [perhaps hundreds of years] for implementation, evaluation, experimentation and perfection. The systems of life in Islam have been proven to be ideal for man for more than 1400 years. They are until now the same teachings that were revealed to Prophet Muhammad in a span of about twenty years only; they did not go into the normal cycle of development and evolution that is characteristics of man-made laws and legislation. <br>  <br>  B- The Qur'an has `Jewish-Christian' origins: <br>  <br>  The second theory regarding the identity of the author of the Qur'an is that Muhammad got the help from the Jews and Christians who had good knowledge about the old Holy Scriptures. The proponent of this theory claim that Muhammad used to travel in merchant caravans to Syria. There, he was influenced by some Jews or Christians who told him about the teachings of Jewish prophets and the history of the Jews and Christians. After returning from these trips, Muhammad used the information he gathered as a basis for the new religion. <br>  <br>  Another variation of this theory claims that many Jewish tribes used to live in Yathrib (Madinah), a city about 420 km north of Makkah, and some Christians used to live in Najran, a city about 350 km south of Makkah. Muhammad could have travelled to those places and was influenced by the Jews and Christians living there.  <br>  <br>  A third variation of the theory claims that some Christian Arabs used to visit Makkah from time to time. Muhammad could have met some of them and was inspired by them. The proponent of this variation of the theory mention, in particular, the name of Waraqa ibn Naufal, an Arab Christian who was a relative of Khadija, the wife of Muhammad, and who was known to have met Muhammad several times. They claim that Waraqa ibn Naufal influenced Muhammed when he was in Makkah; and after Mohammed’s emigration to Madina, he was influenced by the Jews who were living in Madinah and whom Muhammad used to discuss with them matters related to religion. <br>  <br>  The above group of theories share a common claim that Muhammad himself was the author of the Qur'an, but, his sources of information were Christian or Jewish people whom he had met in different places. These theories, however, can be refuted using the following arguments: <br>  <br>  1- Muhammad travelled outside Makkah only three times in his entire life. The first time, he travelled with his mother to visit some of his uncles who were living in Yathrib. On that trip, he was six years old. The other two trips were to Syria; the first when he was twelve years old in the company of his uncle, and the other trip when he was twenty five years old in charge of the caravan of Khadija (his future wife). The questions that one must ask: <br>  <br>  First, how much knowledge can an illiterate person gain in these short trips? Secondly, without the aid of writing and reading, how could a person preserve the knowledge he acquired and reproduces it in its finest details after many years from the time he acquired it? <br>  <br>  It is difficult, therefore, to accept the theory that Mohammed learnt in his trips the knowledge that enabled him to author the Qur'an. <br>  <br>  2- Historical accounts|`|luwBPdE8aa	I don't know of any "Holy" Quran, but the Quran was written by the "reciters" of what Muhammed said.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Muhammad and a bunch of others who wrote and rewrote for political reason.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Allah SWT, the Lord of the Worlds, is the author.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	wow, not a single answer on this question has a thumbs up.<br>  Allah?|`|ij5Sv6staa	The author is satan masquerading as an angel of light while hiding in a hira cave. He mislead poor illiterate Mohammad, who somehow magically remembered verbatium everything he was told, and then he told others who later wrote it down.  <br>  <br>  We KNOW Mohammad is a false prophet because he denies Jesus is the son of God, here is the test:<br>  1 John 4:1-3<br>  1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:13-15<br>  13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.

d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	I quit cold turkey 25 years ago and have never smoked since. I did gain some weight after quitting but I know I'm better off even with the extra weight. The weight gain has been hard to keep off over the years and I have to diet every so often. Fair trade off for clean lungs :)|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I gave up cigars and a wonderful pipe after I had a heart attack. Living was a pretty strong incentive to not smoke any longer. I just made up my mind to quit and that was that. I have not smoked in eight years .|`|bRLCxmP6aa	I'm in my mid-forties and I smoked for many years. I quit when I was carrying my son, but when he was 2, my ex-husband and I separated and, motivated by stress, I reached for the cigarettes and started again. I continued to smoke, even when I started running and exercising. Last January, I was ill and couldn't even try to go outside for a smoke (I never smoked in my house) for three days. By the time I was well enough to go out, I thought "now that's pretty ridiculous - the physical addiction is gone, so why start again?" and I haven't had a cigarette since. I've had one or two moments when I thought "this is when I would have enjoyed a smoke" but I haven't felt any cravings or anything - I've only ever felt proud of myself for quitting. It was the right time for me to quit, and I was very motivated, so it was actually pretty easy. Being sick as a dog during the time when the cravings are the worst helped considerably.<br>  I feel that I look better overall, and I think my skin looks clearer, but I still have the beginnings of those little vertical lines around the lips that all smokers have. I hope those will go away.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I smoked 2-3 packs a day for over 20 years. I went to the doctors one day when I had lost my voice. He told me my blood pressure was high and I needed to stop smoking & drinking coffee.<br>  <br>  I went home and threw out all the cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays, cleaned the house and cleaned the nicotine off of all the windows, and have never touched another cigarette, nor have I had the desire to smoke again. I gave it up on 1/11/00, and haven't touched one since.<br>  <br>  I drank 6 cups of coffee a day, and haven't had one since that same day.<br>  <br>  If I was still smoking, I'd probably be spending about $8,500 a year on cigarettes.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Yes, I did quit. I had a Dad who had trouble with quitting. The last two years of his life I helped my Mom take care of him as he had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a horrible way to die.

I thank God I don't smoke anymore and never smoked much to begin with.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I never started.  I understand it is the most powerful addiction.  I admire anyone who can beat it! =)|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no i did not and doubt if i ever will................|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I quit at 52 because I had pains in my legs.  I knew it was smoking related because it got to the point where as soon as I lit up it started.  Then I would lay in bed at night and my legs would just ache.  At the end of her life my mother developed problems with her legs and finally could not walk at all.  She was in her 80's at that time and smoking pretty heavily.  It seemed odd to me that I was getting it in my 50's, but I was.  It was not hard to quit because I was scared.  That motivated me.  I quit 2 years ago this January.  Last June I had 2 cigarettes.  Other than that I've been off it.  I don't know how it affected my skin or my appearance.   I eat too many refined carbs.  That wrecks the skin.  I would look better if I cut that out.  I'm going to work on that next.|`|pIDN3GIjaa	Sure lot's of times and I'm quitting at the end of the month again because of the tax hike. I quit a year and a half, don't know why I started up again but it 's like my dad always says, they are like a friend . I'm more of an introvert personality so i guess I reflect alot and a smoke to go along what I happen to be pondering seems like half the battle. My car smells, my clothes smell, it is over 100.00 a month in cost, it is inconvenient , you cannot smoke in bars now , so why even smoke? Even after all that , having a smoke on the way to work or just sitting back watching the world go round makes it that much nicer to me. As far as looks ... I am 44 and have been smoking full time for about 25 years ... and my skin is still pretty smooth and Im told I look younger than i am. It affects different people in different ways. <br>  Cigarettes are a curse and a salvation so if you are thinking of starting... please don't . Because you know in time you will have to quit anyway and that is misery . And to pay that much is insane when you add it up through the years. And by the way i am a cold turkey guy. It will suck regardless so why kid yourself with gum?|`|5ac40eaae3a66dcd680cf6c728f414adaa	I gave up by gradually cutting back and getting used to NOT smoking when I really wanted to.  Then when I felt like I just had to, I would'nt smoke for a minute or so, then light up.  The tactic was to delay, delay, delay satisfying the urge. That went on for a long time.  It worked quite well and some folks were surprised upon meeting me to find out that I smoked.  I did, but worked it down to less than half a pack a day.  I still had palpitating heart (mostly from coffee - which worried me) during the day and nights, too, stinky breath, smelly clothes.  I finally almost quit several times, like for a few days after illnesses, that was nice, but felt guilty starting up again, then finally we went home for over two weeks and I said I wasn't going to let my sister and Mom smell me after smoking, nor my nieces...  Smoking really, really stinks, you know?  Drink half-caf, half-decaf coffee.<br>  <br>  Maybe it was guilt, but I finally quit, now for a couple years.  I sure would like a smoke sometimes, again, but no - it's not worth it, ever again.  Work the habit down to almost nothin' - then it's not much to finally give it the boot.|`|6hnEhNcQaa	Switched to all natural cigarettes first. Which meant the nicotine level was lower so I weaned off the addiction that way at first, but still got to smoke for a while. Then I gave them up cold turkey and it was easier since I had already weaned myself off the high nicotine content of the non-natural cigs.|`|tFfUMQtyaa	I smoked from the age of 15 Years until I was about 21, I woke up one day and thought..."Hang on smoking is for school kids and single mums on benefits" I just went cold turkey, It was like walking on broken glass for about 4 weeks but WELL worth it!!!|`|uHxfAyjBaa	I smoked for 25 years...sometimes up to 150 cigarettes a day.<br>  <br>  And I gave up..not for health reasons... but because they just got too b bloody expensive.  <br>  <br>  I was spending up to $300 a week on smokes.<br>  <br>  So, nicotene patches and willpower.

My guess is that he was fully immersed -- as the Savior who took on everything in our corporate guilt.

The Flood, for instance involved complete immersion for many while Noah and his family were saved with sprinkles of rain.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	I don't know, the symbolism of it is Jesus receiving the Holy Spirit, Jesus represents the Logos (word of God), the dove represents Sophia (wisdom of God) which I think is interpreted as the holy spirit by Christians.  its a union between Logos and Sophia much like a marriage that leads to the Christ Counsciousness.|`|cXJQq93Eaa	It was necessary for Jesus to get baptized to be obedient to his Father and to fulfill prophecy.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	yes, jesus was a "just add water" god.|`|3ydc6z6oaa	Because it is a commandment to be baptized if Christ had not been he wouldn't have been perfect.

RR|`|7JZpZMRHaa	Hello I want to make a complaint about a woman who got in my face and asked WHY ARE YOU COMING TO THIS CHURCH FOR.  I was getting food from this church, because I am disabled and needed help with food. This woman was put up to this by a  woman that teaches Bible classes. My husband is taking classes for RCIA. I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS. Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX. Thanks for letting us get this off of our chest, I don't need the stress of being treated this way because of heart problems, I have 2 leaking valves in my heart, from all the heart attacks and dying due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Rhuematic Fever.

The Anglicans (8%), Muslims (5%), Seventh-day Adventists (4%), Presbyterians, Jehovah's Witnesses and Methodists are among the other faith groups represented. Two African syncretic faiths, the Shouter or Spiritual Baptists and the Orisha faith (formerly called Shangos, a less than complimentary term) are among the fastest growing religious groups, as are a host of evangelical and fundamentalist churches usually lumped as "Pentecostal" by most Trinidadians (although this designation is often inaccurate). A noteworthy Judaic community does exist, as well as several other Eastern religions such as Taoism. Due to their smaller numbers, the Taoist, Buddhist and other Sub-Hindu cultures are often locally viewed under the wide umbrella of Hinduism[citation needed].<br>  <br>  [edit] Human rights<br>  <br>  The Cat o' nine tails is still used to flog prisoners. On 11 March, 2005, the Government of Trinidad & Tobago was ordered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to pay US$ 50,000 for "moral damages" to a prisoner who had received 15 strokes of the "Cat" plus expenses for his medical and psychological care (<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/IACHR/2005/4.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/IACHR/...</a> {{Caesar vs. Trinidad and Tobago - Series C No. 123 [2005] IACHR 4 (11 March 2005) }} It is unclear whether the Court's decisions were met; however, the "Cat" has not been used for several years, and the use of the birch has also fallen into disuse. Prisoners sentenced to death for capital crimes used to be hanged, but recent attempts to execute persons sentenced to death have been blocked by the Privy Council, with sentences being commuted to life imprisonment.<br>  <br>  Homosexual acts are illegal in Trinidad and Tobago (see Gay rights in Trinidad and Tobago) and under Article 8 (18/1) of the Immigration Act, non-citizen homosexuals are not allowed to enter the country.

Sometimes they might even glimpse over just to see if you're looking.<br>  2 How close do they get?

How do they act? Differently around you then around others? How do they speak? With a lisp? (some gay men speak with lisps) stuttering could be a sign of nervousness which means they like you and care about what you think.

For an essay about science, big words make a difference.;  In such a case asyo uhave supplied, the vocabulary should match the character.  In this case, it's rather obvious that the  words were chosen for their size, and not their ability to convey the idea.
Y9585qFLaa	you are right, either the question gives incomplete data or the answer is wrong.<br>  <br>  btw you have not yet considered the possibility that some ziggles could be wiggles that are not waggles at all ;)|`|m89kGXBnaa	I would have said false. The problem is they did not define whether a waggle had to be a wiggle (in which case it would have been true). Without that piece of information, there is a possibility that there are waggles that are not wiggles (as it hasn't said) therefore a possibility that none of the waggles that are ziggles were also wiggles. So this question needed you to make an unfounded assumption to reach the "true" conclusion<br>  <br>  (i.e. imagine "wiggles" are dogs, "waggle" is St Bernard dogs and "ziggle" is male. All St Bernards are dogs, therefore some dogs are male (which we knew anyway, but bear with me).<br>  However, imagine "wiggle" is dog and waggle is "pet" and "ziggle" is feline. Some dogs are pets, some pets are feline, but no dogs are feline (they're canine).)|`|qHXmyFkjaa	True.  No, wait, false.  No, true.  What was the question ?|`|2BXxFk5waa	I think wiggles would be zaggles then because the waggles are already ziggles, so somebody has to be zaggles!!!! lol now my brain hurts! :)

Also, Muslims and Christians both follow the new and old testament, from what my research says, so it's just like adding on a new book.|`|frFCT3H7aa	As Salaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullaahi Wa Barakatuh<br>  <br>  Muslims are united by the love of Allaah and there is no love greater than this. When people unite through this bond then their is no bond stronger than this, and we must recognise this blessing as Allaah says:<br>  <br>  And He has united their (i.e. believers') hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah has united them. Certainly He is All-Mighty, All-Wise. (Al-Anfal 8:63) <br>  <br>  And how good is a person who has left kufr and shirk upon which he was raised and accepted Allaah as his sole Lord, without any partners! Allaah says:<br>  <br>  Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin. (An-Nisa 4:48)<br>  <br>  When a person accepts Islaam Allaah forgives all his/her past sins. Allaah says referring to Jews and Christians:<br>  <br>  O you who believe [in M?sa (i.e. Jews) and 'Iesa (i.e. Christians)]! Fear Allah, and believe too in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (Al-Hadid 57:28)<br>  <br>  If this is the case, that our Lord has forgiven him, then what can we have against him? Will we leave him alone after he left kufr and shirk for the sake of our Lord and Creator, Allaah?<br>  <br>  No! By Allaah, if you are pleased with his character then do not turn him down. After all the best generation were like him, who left kufr for the sake of Islaam (I am talking about the companions of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))!<br>  <br>  Your brother in faith,<br>  Salaam|`|G4SVG7tKaa	He's no longer an "infidel," so what's the problem? <br>  <br>  It's so freaking sad when the issue of religion becomes paramount in matters of human love.

3jAdp1lJaa	Wow, Mr. Paul Harvey has got quite a well thought out mock agenda there, are you sure he is not the devil? <br>  <br>  I say the wealthy elite rule over mankind, only because the people of the earth want them too, somebody has to do it..We need social structure..Money is the measure of political power, and political power is the measure of military might.This day in age, pitting one group's imaginary god against another group's imaginary god is dangerous considering the wonderful achievement mankind has developed with how they can destroy each other. Do you remember WW2 (World War 2)?. I guess you never heard of the Nuclear non-proliferation act....I'd say the earth is a dangerous place right now..Do you know how to get to any other habitable planets? I don't Maybe Jesus and the rapture will take us to safe and happy town....It's not a secret by any means, all of the earth inhabitants knows what kind of day in age we all live in....Don't pray against your enemy's god and your enemy's dogma, pray against anarchy.....Alot of christians want there to be an armagheddon, or some rising star political personality to preach against their religion, that way it would make them feel reaffirmed their book of revelations is real...It appears they love hearing about the carnage, fear, and loss of human life found in the book of revelations instead of the compassionate loving and forgiving story of jesus...WHy else are they obcessed with the book of revelations and can't stop talking about it this day in age...<br>  <br>  I certaintly hope its not  sensitive co-dependent Jesus, his invisible abusive psychotic father, or his trusty side kick  the holy spirit.....|`|GCl84SPLaa	By the way Paul Harvey died last week.|`|LjsRfaskaa	I think you need to study the history of Christianity and exactly how it managed to become the worlds most powerful religion.

Blame everything that's wrong in the world on the devil.  I pulled my sisters hair cause the devil made me do it.<br>  <br>  "I would delude their minds into thinking that they had come from man's effort, instead of God's blessings" Everytime I do something good it's because God is controlling my body to do good things and everytime I do something bad it's the devils fault. This logic is the same logic that is used to say that God deserves credit for everything good.<br>  <br>  I would dupe entire states into relying on gambling for their state revenue. While I definitely don't agree with this I think that this has more to do with people wanting money and not realizing that they're hurting others to get it. If people knew the extent their actions caused the suffering of others they wouldn't do it.  (Philosophy of Socrates)<br>  <br>  I would take God out of the schools, where even the mention of His name was grounds for a lawsuit. This one is perhaps my favorite because it shows how one sided this poem is.  I, for example am Buddhist and if in schools people started chanting mantras and prostrating I am almost certain that there would be a lawsuit. I would even agree with it. Yet, when a "christian" does things that could be offensive to people who don't share his religion you think it's OK.<br>  <br>  "I would attack the family, the backbone of any nation."  I agree that strong family unity is a desirable thing I am a little confused though at how this is being used by many (not all) christian churches.  Who also use this term to have their members have lots of kids.  In this situation "the family" is destroying the planet we live on because of overpopulation.*Save our planet use a condom.<br>  <br>  "I would convince the world that people are born homosexuals, and that their lifestyles should be accepted" I have one word for you, "BONOBO" please look it up on wikipedia.(it's funny as well as informative)  They have the closest DNA to humans. (DNA is proven whether you believe in evolution or not) Even closer than the chimpanzee. And every last one of them is bisexual. Let that sink in.  Every one of them has intercourse with both males and females. You can even watch it on youtube. Like I said entertaining as well as informative.<br>  <br>  This poem I feel is so outrageously unthoughtful that I can only find it funny.  I may not be christian, however, I support your religion with my whole heart.  I love the things that they teach you.  I wish you'd stop hunting but you have to decide to do that yourself.  AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND STOP BLAMING THE DEVIL.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Though I tend to agree with the above as things that are happening.<br>  But,<br>  it is God who is in full control of events as He allows what happens. <br>  Satan or other more evil humans who sometimes the devil learns from them; can all try,<br>  but at the end it is God's final word what will happen.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	You are speaking for a "devil" that has yet to prove his existence. If I was a Christian, I would right an article about the devil attacking everything I did not believe in. I would use this article to change the minds of people who used the free will my god gave them to walk another path. I would try to convert as many followers as possible so my church can grow massive wealth. I would tell my children from birth that if they don't accept jesus they would burn in hell for eternity, in fact; I would tell EVERYONE that they are going to burn in hell if they don't choose MY beliefs. These are acts of tyrants and hypocrites. What we must do is evolve over the petty bickering. I will not change your beliefs, you will not change mine. But notice how I don't tell you your beliefs are wrong? They are right for you and wrong for me. Notice how I am not using threats to make you consider my path? My path is right for me and wrong for you.
bR4BgFLlaa	Pretty much every story/film/books etc in existence today have a root in mythology. In fact screenwriters are taught that there are only 7 basic plots:<br>  <br>  man vs. nature<br>  man vs. man<br>  man vs. the environment<br>  man vs. machines/technology<br>  man vs. the supernatural<br>  man vs. self<br>  man vs. god/religion<br>  <br>  For example, "Rocky" is a story of the "underdog," who goes through a "transformation" and falls in "love" while on a "quest." <br>  <br>  All of these plots have their roots in Greek Mythology.

m4nKkFDUaa	Well, here in Ireland, Irish is the official language, but it's definitely spoken my a very small minority of people! In school, we have to learn it from Junior Infants (Pre-K) all the way up to Sixth Year (12th Grade). There are Irish language TV and Radio stations, all our signage is bi-lingual and there are areas of the country called the "Gaeltacht" where Irish is spoken, and most teenagers go there for three weeks in the Summer to improve their Irish. There are even schools where you learn entirely through Irish. Right now, in fact, it's "Seachtain na Gaeilge" (Irish Week, which is actually two weeks long! (only in Ireland could that happen.)) when people are encouraged to speak Irish etc. I go to an Irish speaking youthclub every Friday.

I was getting food from this church, because I am disabled and needed help with food. This woman was put up to this by a  woman that teaches Bible classes. My husband is taking classes for RCIA. I am already Catholic, but I had broken away because a priest in Las Vegas, told me that I was evil because I would not make ceramic angels for the church that was going to be built. This priest was Anthony Geerts. He has since passed on several months after I quit the Church. Also going back to the rude woman, why does a parish let woman teach men. From my way of thinking, I believe it is wrong as it says in the Bible in 1Timothy 2:12. My husband and I are NOT going back to this Church unless this woman  apologizes for her rudeness. I would also like to know what your opinion of this problem we are having with finding a good church that does not treat people with disdain. Just because my husband and I have been homeless, does not mean that we can not attend Mass, and we will be good participating members of any church that we decide to join. Please help us resolve this problem we are having.<br>      Plus a person from the Church said that the Bible is 2000 yrs old and times have changed, so it is alright for a woman teach MEN. If we are to follow the NEW TESTAMENT, Why did ST PAUL tell TIMOTHY in 1 Timothy 2:12 that women are not to teach men. I also want to emphasize that my husband and I used to be homeless, but we are not now. Also we have had brain damage. Me from being dead for 33 min back on Jan 4th 1999 in Albuquerque NM. My husband was born with brain damage from birth, cord wrapped around his neck. <br>      I would also like to quote Mark 11:15-17, this pertains to selling in the Church. Didn't Jesus throw out the money changers out of the Temple.Matthew 8:20, Foxes have a place to lay, birds have a nest but man has no where to lay his head at night 1Corinthans 4:11, Wasn't Jesus homeless, why should we that have been homeless be treated like we are the scum of the earth, In Gods eyes we are loved but why do so many people who call themselves CHRISTIANS. Treat us with so much disdain. Also we would like you to listen to THE OUTLAW PRAYER by Johnny Paycheck. this a  true story it happened in Ft Worth TX. Thanks for letting us get this off of our chest, I don't need the stress of being treated this way because of heart problems, I have 2 leaking valves in my heart, from all the heart attacks and dying due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Rhuematic Fever. Thanks  <br>  Our lady of sorrows catholic church McAllen Texas

Before I get on my horse I'll leave these observations to be mulled over until I get back with the right answers.<br>      God created man in his own image and I just can't accept the idea that God looks like an ape. His son didn't look at all like an ape.  I trust that you have seen all of those pictures and statues etc, A picture is worth a thousand words. <br>     I don't bathe unless I absolutely must, in a tub. I prefer bathing in the Nueces River and my second choice is a shower. When I bathe in a tub it is because I am very dirty and I need to soak my carcass awhile before all of the dirt will wash off. When I do that the bubbles are brown and not white, After I soak for a few hours I am able to scrub all of the dirt off.  I know that I am finally clean when the bubbles start turning white. Mull over that while I am down in the pasture.<br>      When I am very hungry, and my Sweetie is away on a shopping spree in San Antonio, Texas, I check the frig for something to eat . If I don't find something in there I keep going back the hungrier I get because my instinct to cull out food I won't eat becomes more relaxed.  Eventually I'll end up eating something that I culled because I wasn't hungry enough, earlier.<br>    My male chauvinism will not allow me to ever admit that I have ever pushed a vacuum cleaner around the house so I clam to have no earthly idea of why those little bits of string get on the carpet, and why the vacuum won't suck them up.  I will admit to to the fact that when I was a  young blade I would drop little strings on the carpet all over the house and wait for my Sweetie to bend over to pick them up.  <br>    I'm headed for the pasture now to ponder over your questions and when I come back I might have some better ideas about people evolving from apes, why people take a bath when their bath water stays clear and the bubbles from the bubble bath don't turn brown,  searching for something to eat in the frig and culling out perfectly good food that is only a week or so old, and how old worn out cowhands evolve from perfectly normal and extremely clever young studs.<br>    If I ain't back by dark thirty would you mind doing my milking and feeding. The milk bucket is upside down on the back porch and all the feed is in the barn.  Get Juan and Jose to help you and Jesus might be back from Acuna today,  He said he would be back by sundown.        <br>  <br>     .|`|b3h0ovgRaa	These questions are too smart for me. I know that I did not come from apes, I hate bananas. I did not evolve from fish as I don't like to swim Hubby did come from a family of monkeys, if you have ever seen a monkey grin, this what hubby looks like when he is in trouble with me. He still thinks he is a 'swinger' who is constantly scratching. Hubby will raid the fridge 50 times a night, each time coming away with nothing. I can identify with that vacuum cleaner though, I do the same thing too,  And not only with string.  Good questions and funny too. Everyone can identify with them.   Poppy|`|xyt9NdjVaa	1. In my opinion, man did not evolve from apes. If evolution were a fact, why would man have stopped when he evolved into man? Wouldn't man and all creatures still be evolving? Skulls found, of so called 'Neanderthal' men were studied and scholars (ahem,) were amazed at how the Neanderthal mans skull resembled an ape..know why? Because it WAS an ape's skull.<br>  <br>  2. Color pigments in bubble bath do not bind to the bubble forming product, glycerin. <br>  It will separate as the bubble forms and stays in the solution....and now you know. :)<br>  <br>  3. Each time we look into the fridge I think we are hoping that SOMETHING will finally look good. Perhaps it takes a few times to the fridge for the mind to process what it is that it actually wants.

Of course in America, it's more modernized and there are several women including myself that don't actually do that so, it's really all up to the woman honestly.

That's why it's common for men in the west to look lustfully at western women (who dress inappropriately by exposing 60% of their bodies and up).  <br>  <br>  2- For women, the feeling of a touch is what increases their sexual desires.  That is why it is not common among women to look at men lustfully (as much as men do look at women) in the western societies where open sexuality is common among people.  It is generally the men who seek the women and look at them lustfully.  The vise versa is not true!.<br>  <br>  Knowing the above facts, it is important for us as good Muslims or good followers of Allah Almighty to reduce wickedness in our society to the very minimum.  For these reasons, Allah Almighty ordered women to cover up so that they don't look sexually intimidating, and He ordered men not to touch women whom those men are not their "mahram" (guardians).  In other words, a man can touch his daughter on the shoulder for instance, or his mother.  But he can't go around and touch stranger women, because depending on the woman, this could raise her sexual desires to lead her to commit fornication or adultery.<br>  <br>  so if men and women lust at each other they are punished so women cover up there bodies so men cant see their "goodies"|`|h87y0K3caa	I would like to say u one thing that is if u read quran and if u understand the meaning of it its say's that look at fatima R.A .she her mother khadijah R.A they are the perfect examples from women as well as for grils....the way they spended there life just read the story of it then u will indertsand how much is it important........|`|jgTQPjKNaa	It's just one of the examples of Women rights abusing...I am a Muslim and I can't find any sense for a women to cover themselves up...<br>  <br>  And I should make that clear too that this practice is not common everywhere...!|`|brOCG7wcaa	I think it's their religion for women not to show any flesh as this is considered flirty or sexual in some way.

Satan had been originally "created" (see notes on Ezekiel 28:14,15 at the bottom) <br>  <br>  The physical serpent was clever, and possibly originally able to stand upright, eye-to-eye with man, (the Hebrew word is nachash, possibly originally meaning a shining, upright creature).<br>  <br>  Some of the animals may have originally been able to communicate on an elementary level with their human masters, an ability later removed by the Curse. More likely, God allowed Satan to use the serpent's throat (as He later allowed Balaam's *** to speak--Numbers 22:28) and Eve was, in her innocence, not yet aware of the strangeness of it.<br>  <br>  The root of all sin is doubting God's Word. Satan was successful in this approach even with one who had never sinned before and who had no sin-nature inclining her to sin. Satan merely implanted a slight doubt concerning God's veracity and His sovereign goodness. The approach so successful in this case has provided the pattern for his temptations ever since.<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 28:14<br>  The "anointed cherub" on God's "holy mountain," covering the heavenly Eden and God's throne, was evidently the highest of the cherubim and, therefore, the highest of all God's created angels.<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 28:15<br>  This being was of incomparable beauty and wisdom (Ezekiel 28:17), "perfect in all his ways," causing his heart to be lifted up to attempt to displace His own Creator (Isaiah 14:12-15).<br>  <br>  When iniquity was found in this perfect being--evidently the sin of rebellion against God--he who had been Lucifer ("Light-Bearer") became Satan ("The Adversary"), and has remained God's greatest foe ever since.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	all depends on whos interpretation you take, I think its best disregarded altogether. its about the fall of mankind spiritually. the snake can be depicted as being satan or Sophia attempting to regain the divne spark from mankind that was stolen from her by Yaldaboath when he created the physical world as a copy of the divine world but through his ignorance he made an imperfect copy. <br>  <br>  all it teaches is that death comes from sin, sin comes from ignorance and all will be well when we reunite with God and the Goddess Sophia|`|oaEqLAT7aa	The devil in the form of a talking serpent.

AA11047076	A better question would actually be:  are a kippah and/or tzitzit beged ish even normally?<br>  <br>  A kippah the answer is probably yes- since it is commonly worn by men only- women normally cover their hair with a hat, snood, wig etc.  However, tzitzit may eb worn by a woman thoughthere is no requirement to do so and it is questionable whether a brochah would be said.  (Standard Ashkenazi custom would be for a woman to say the brachah).<br>  <br>  When ti comes to Purim- since a man can wear beged isha, there is no reason why a woman could not wear beged ish.  So a kippah is ok- and tzitzit are ok in any case.<br>  <br>  Have a Purim Sameach
frFCT3H7aa	Yes, we do believe that Jesus (may peace and blessings be upon him) was born to virgin Mary. Allah (God Almighty) narrates to us the story of 'Jesus son of Mary', saying:<br>  <br>  "And mention in the Book (the Qur'an, O Muhammad SAW , the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.<br>  <br>  She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our angel (Gabriel), and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.<br>  <br>  She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah." <br>  <br>  (The angel) said: "I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son." <br>  <br>  She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?" <br>  <br>  He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: 'That is easy for Me (Allah): And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by Allah).' "<br>  <br>  So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem).<br>  <br>  And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date-palm. She said: "Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!" <br>  <br>  Then [the baby (Jesus)] cried unto her from below her, saying: "Grieve not! Your Lord has provided a water stream under you;<br>  <br>  "And shake the trunk of date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you." <br>  <br>  "So eat and drink and be glad, and if you see any human being, say: 'Verily! I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) so I shall not speak to any human being this day.'"<br>  <br>  Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: "O Mary! Indeed you have brought a mighty thing!" <br>  <br>  "O sister of Har?n! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman." <br>  <br>  Then she pointed to him (baby Jesus). They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" <br>  <br>  "He (Jesus) said: Verily! I am a slave of Allah (God Almighty), He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet;" <br>  <br>  "And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me prayer, and charity, as long as I live."<br>  <br>  "And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest.<br>  <br>  "And peace be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!" <br>  <br>  Such is 'Jesus son of Mary'. A statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute)<br>  <br>  It befits not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son [as Christians say]. Glorified (and Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, "Be!" and it is. <br>  <br>  (Jesus said): "And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the Straight Path. (Allah's Religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His Prophets)." <br>  <br>  Then the sects differed [i.e. the Christians about Jesus], so woe unto the disbelievers [those who gave false witness by saying that Jesus is the son of Allah] from the meeting of a great Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection). <br>  <br>  How clearly will they (polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us! But the 'polytheists and wrong-doers' today are in plain error. <br>  <br>  And warn them (O Muhammad SAW) of the Day of grief and regrets, when the case has been decided (day of judgement), while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not."<br>  (Qur'an 19:16-39)|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

Spoke while he was only a baby.<br>  2.  Healed those born blind.<br>  3.  Healed the lepers.<br>  4.  Revived the dead.<br>  5.

She said: "I seek refuge from thee to ((Allah)) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah." <br>  <br>  19. He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son. <br>  <br>  20. She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" <br>  <br>  21.

So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. <br>  <br>  23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!" <br>  <br>  24. But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; <br>  <br>  25.

The Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Anointed (Masih or Messiah), Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter, and one of those brought near to God.

He created him of dust and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was."

mVTGl6HGaa	The general theory is that individuals must be enticed with some type of benefit to join an interest group.[2] Known as the Free Rider Problem, it refers to the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, even those who are not members of that particular interest group. So there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if they will receive that benefit anyway.[3] Interest groups must receive dues and contributions from its members in order to accomplish its agenda. While every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, that Environmental protection interest group does not, in turn, receive monetary help from every individual in the world. [4]<br>  <br>  Selective material benefits are benefits that are usually given in monetary benefits. For instance, if an interest group gives a material benefit to their member, they could give them travel discounts, free meals at certain restaurants, or free subscriptions to magazines, newspapers, or journals.[5] Many trade and professional interest groups tend to give these types of benefits to their members. A selective solidary benefit is another type of benefit offered to members or prospective members of an interest group. These incentives involve benefits like "socializing congeniality, the sense of group membership and identification, the status resulting from membership, fun and conviviality, the maintenance of social distinctions, and so on.[6] A solidary incentive is when the rewards for participation are socially derived and created out of the act of association.<br>  <br>  An expressive incentive is another basic type of incentive or benefit offered to being a member of an interest group. People who join an interest group because of expressive benefits likely joined to express an ideological or moral value that they believe in. Some include free speech, civil rights, economic justice, or political equality. To obtain these types of benefits, members would simply pay dues, donate their time or money to get a feeling of satisfaction from expressing a political value. Also, it would not matter if the interest group achieved their goal, but these members would be able to say they helped out in the process of trying to obtain these goals, which is the expressive incentive that they got in the first place.[7] The types of interest groups that rely on expressive benefits or incentives would be environmental groups and groups who claim to be lobbying for the public interest.[8]<br>  <br>  <br>  Some public policy interests are not recognized or addressed by a group at all, and these interests are labeled latent interests.

You are the typical hippie; you assume we are all ignorant drones.  Our command and NCO's possess more intelligence, education and experience than you could ever imagine.  You know what we military members call guys like you, Arm Chair Generals.  Men (well actually you are a boy), who have never served, yet seem to know how to do our job.  Absolute ignorance is what you are spouting.   I have been in 12 years; I am a Staff Sergeant in the United States Marine Corp.  My 12 years of experience trumps your opinion and false assumptions.  6 deployments, 4 of them to Iraq.  You are absolutely ridiculous if you think you are aware of what our life and what the Marines represents.  The USMC represents honor, respect, faith, and loyalty to this nation, constitution, citizens and our fellow Marines.  We have a culture and ideology you will never understand or be a part of.  Our loyalty and honor is earned, do not show your anger that you are not a part of the respect of our world. <br>  <br>  I am not denying the politicians of the US and Europe have had their issues and have not made the best decisions in the Middle East. Yet, how dare you be disrespectful to those who follow order and serve their nation.  You are only a conscientious objector due to your right to be one.   It is very difficult to be a conscientious objector in countries in war torn Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Be thankful you live in a safe, wonderful country, (whether u are in the UK or America) that provides you the right to be ignorant and claim u know it all.  There is a difference between soldiers/marines and politicians.  You need to learn to separate those groups. <br>  <br>  “And as you know, you can't stop them with your army.” (You say) <br>  Do not say Army, We are Marines.  There is a difference.  If you knew anything about the military, you would know that.<br>  <br>  How about you deploy to Iraq/Afghanistan and see what it is really like over there before you start throwing accusations from your comfy warm, safe living room.  Enlist and become a man instead of an arm chair general.  I did not enlist to "kill".  There is more to the military than killing.  You are completely wrong with your assessment in the objectives of those who enlist.  Real men serve; boys whine and moan as you are.

I could be wrong, but I thought "liturgy" was religious.  Anyway...<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is NOT a disease.  It IS natural and is found in nature among animals - approximately 1500 animal species have been found to have some homosexual members.  OVER 1500.  Killer whales, chimpanzees, black swans, sheep, etc. are just some of the animals observed to have homosexual members.<br>  <br>  Animals obviously don't make a "choice" about their sexuality, so it naturally follows that people don't either - they are born that way, and it's just a part of nature.<br>  <br>  It's about time all the bigots got over themselves - just because some guy who didn't like homosexuality wrote thousands of years ago that it was a sin, doesn't necessarily mean that god actually thinks it is.  Why would he have created gay animals if he thought it was wrong?<br>  <br>  Besides, if god really does have a problem with it, he'll take care of it.  Me, I'm not too worried about the whole thing - most of the gay people I know are much nicer, more caring, and more giving people than most straight christians I know.  If I had to bet on who would get into heaven, it would be my homosexual friends, hands down.|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	The natural existence of homosexuality in non-human animals is considered controversial by conservative religious groups who oppose LGBT social movements because these findings seem to point to the natural occurrence of homosexuality in humans.[1] Whether this has logical or ethical implications is also a source of debate, with some arguing that it is illogical to use animal behavior to justify what is or is not moral (see appeal to nature).[1][5][6] Its definitely not a test from god.|`|qbLTYbZlaa	You obviously have access to the Internet, the single biggest source of information, why not use it to research your own question properly?<br>  Homosexuality occurs in humans and many other animal species, it's a natural trait.

Just as it's a natural variant of animal sexuality.<br>  <br>  God created homosexuality and bisexuality in all His creation. Among animals, it serves as a protection against overpopulation. Same-sex pairs often adopt and raise orphaned young. It can serve the same purpose in humans.<br>  <br>  It's not a disease, and not a sin.

(Which is misunderstood wayyy too much)<br>  >>If you read the gospels, Jesus was very relational and hung out with the whores and tax-collecters and diseased. Notice that the way to Heaven isn't being a good workhouse. It's about knowing Jesus. (See John 14:6)<br>  <br>  That being said, if any church leader is using religion as an "opiate for the masses" (or to keep people good and happy) so to say, he is seriously mislead.<br>  <br>  God being creation wouldn't make sense either with all of the prophecies and presence of Heaven and angels and the sending of His son... But it is believed that God did in fact create creation (hence "creat"ion) and is omnipresent, so it would be easy for you to confuse that... But it was made very clear (ex. in the beginnings of Genesis and John) that God was never created but always existed.<br>  <br>  And personally (and I know for many others) this belief makes me beautifully happy here in creation... to believe that God in Heaven created all this beauty for me!|`|skmWBLRxaa	Creation itself is not God any more than you would be the world you created if you made one. That world would not be you, only From you. All that is good was created from His love for us and all life in the world. He created it more for us than for Him. He doesn't need any of it for Himself to live and He lets us do as we please with it.<br>  If God were controlling, everyone would be dead for not doing as He tells us we should. Christianity is all about being free to choose. He would not have given Adam and Eve the choice to sin and gain that knowledge if He didn't mean for us to be able to have free will to choose to love or hate Him. Punishment for sin in hell is a warning, not a threat.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	I don't believe I'm unintelligent; yet, I've read your question four times now without gaining a complete understanding as to what you're saying.  Let's break it down:<br>  <br>  1. The first words in the Bible are Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."  <br>  <br>  CLEARLY that makes it plain that BEFORE the beginning, there was God.  BEFORE any creation, there was God.<br>  <br>  To further underscore this point, we in Exodus 3:14 that God declares to Moses: "I AM WHO I AM." And He said, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"<br>  <br>  Here's a quick summary of the meaning of I AM:<br>  <br>  Bible has used many names of God. And one of His name is "I AM". The word "Elohim" was used for God. Elohim is derived from El, its original meaning being "the strong one" "the mighty one". A mighty God and "I AM WHO I AM" is really an expression of God's real, perfect, unconditional, independent existence. On the one side He is a mighty God but on the other side He has the heart of a feeding and nourishing mother. On the one side He is mighty in deeds and on the other side He cares for His children and protects His children.<br>  <br>  So, yes, I believe that it logically makes sense and is Biblically imperative that ALL CHRISTIANS believe that God existed prior to and wholly independent of ... creation.  What is troubling to me is that you seem to make this somehow "conspiritorial," as if Pastors have an agenda other than it being Biblical truth.  WHY?!  And what is your alleged agenda again?  That's what I'm trying to figure out!<br>  <br>  2. "... If one 'confuses' God with creation itself, then one could be happy here- in creation- with God...."<br>  <br>  I don't get how "one" could "confuse" God with creation itself.  It would be like confusing the sandcastle maker with the sandcastle!  A 2 year old "gets" that the human existed before the sandcastle came to be!  Likewise, God clearly had to exist BEFORE the creation described in Genesis 1:1 and beyond!<br>  <br>  3. Since I cannot accept the premise on which this line stands, it is hard to take this line seriously: "... and therefore, not a good workhorse waiting to be saved- and then, be with God- in Heaven."<br>  <br>  As I say, I reject the entire notion based on the fact that one would have to be delusional to somehow morph God Himself with His acts of creation, but even within your flawed premise, I found at least one sub-flaw:<br>  <br>  Does "a good workhorse" WAIT on anything?  Isn't waiting (inactivity) the opposite of WORK?  <br>  <br>  I'm sooooooooooo confused by what it is you're saying, but YES, I am quite confident that you are misinterpreting any number of things.

hl5cZxO2aa	Chennabhaira Devi'. Type this in yahoo search.Lot of websites. No need to copy and paste thesis|`|cWuumdy7aa	There is every reason to believe that by virtue of its strategic location Bhatkal has for centuries been an apple of discord. It seems as though many rulers-foreigners not barring-vied with one another to gain control over this town by hook or crook. Paradoxical thought it may seem, very little is known about the history of this place prior to the 12th century A.D. except a few stray references here and there. This being so, reconstructing the history of this glorious town is stupendous task by any counts. Not withstanding these facts there is conclusive evidence which goes to prove that Bhatkal was a part and parcel of the Hoysala empire for more than 50 years during the rule of Ballal III from 1291 to 1343. Although the Alupas were the nominal rulers of Bhatkal taluk during the early decades of the 14th century, they in turn owed allegiance to the Vijayanagar emperors. The rulers of Vijayanagar administered Bhatkal with Honnavar as the headquarters. This rule lasted throughout the reign of Harihara II, Devaraya I and Devaraya II. However, in the early days, the rulers of Haduvalli did defy the supremacy of Vijayanagar and did not hesitate to give tough resistance. Varthema (1503), the Italian traveler speaks very highly of Bhatkal. In his words Bhatkal was noble city, very beautiful, Bhatkal was among the top-ranking centres of trade and commerce in the Vijayanagar empire. That was the reason why the Portuguese appealed to Krishnadevarya time and again to permit them to open a factory there. The fact that Krishnadevarya who maintained amicable relationship with the Portuguese refused their request underscores the importance of Bhatkal.  After the disintegration of Vijayanagar empire the Saluva rulers of Haduvalli brought this coveted town under their rule. Thus the dawn of the 15th century marked the beginning of a new chapter in the chequered history of Bhatkal. Many temples and bastis came to be constructed here during Chennabhaira Devi's rule. It is said that one of her commanders, Narayana Nayaka (1556) built the Vardhamana Basti. It is a matter of great pride to us to recall that the eminent scholar like Akalanka II who was the mentor of the renowned Kannada grammarian Bhattakalanka (1598) was a great son of this locality.   This region passed on to the Nayakas of Keladi from Chennabhaira Devi. Meanwhile sweeping changes were taking place in the political scenario of the country. the Portuguese had secured a strong foot-hold in Goa. their meteric rise was upsetting all political equation. In the alter part of the 17th century they had entered into an agreement with Chennammaji (1678) and succeeded in obtaining her permission to build churches at Bhatkal and elsewhere. The Maratha King Shivaji came by the sea route and tried to plunder Bhatkal in 1664.  The Dutch maintained cordial relationship with the rulers of Bhatkal. No wonder their policy paid rich dividends. Trade between the two countries prospered as never before. When Bhatkal came under Tippu's rule its overseas trade received a further boost. He opened many state-owned depots at Bhatkal. Bhatkal proved to be invaluable and indispensable for the prosperity of the economy of any kingdom. Thus it changed hands quite frequently. In 1606 it came under the Keladi Navayakas and continued to rise notch by notch. The Portuguese succeeded in opening a factory of their own at Bhatkal in 1678. From the Keladi rulers, Bhatkal passed on to Hyder Ali and Tippu from whom it came under the British in 1799. Antequetil dy parron who visited this place in 1758 speaks of a fort built on a rock. Buchanon who came here in 1801 says that there were 50 houses in Bhatkal . Bhatkal did not lag behind its counterparts in other parts of the country in our struggle for freedom. The historic Quit India procession was taken here during the second week of 1942. Thus even a sketch history that can be reconstructed in the light of available evidence speaks volumes of the greatness of Bhatkal and of its vital role in our country's economy.  FACTS : There were two division of Canara in Nov. 1800-Northern & Southern; Bhatkal was in the northern division.  In 1871, both the division merged to emerge as a single division. In 1862, the single division was again divided into two districts-Uttara Kannada with Bhatkal Petha was transferred to the Bombay Presidency. In 1960 - Bhatkal was elevated as a taluk.

Several theme parks in The US, Canada and Australia are called "Wonderland".|`|DnwhJ4F6aa	I've never heard this saying, but I'd imagine it would mean that your mind is wandering off somewhere else... daydreaming.<br>  <br>  More common expressions would be "You must be in la-la land" or "You have your head in the clouds" or "Earth to Neil!" (meaning "Come back down to the planet Earth, Neil!")
jM7CyxQzaa	Witch comes from the Anglo Saxon word Wicce which means 'knowledge' it would have been pronounced 'Witch E'<br>  <br>  There's two parts to this answer<br>  <br>  Firstly<br>  <br>  There was a lack of education at the time  - most people couldn't read and so information was passed by word of mouth and no one questioned things as they would now if they could go look it up. If someone was seen doing something that people didn't understand - for instance healing with herbs - then quite often they would be scared of it and would call the person a witch because they had knowledge - believed to come from the Devil - that the accuser did not posess.<br>  <br>  The reason that they felt that the knowledge meant that the victim was 'in league with the devil' came from the power the Church had at the time. There was still a 'feudal' system in place and the peasants were expected to abide by the rules the Lord of the Manor set out.<br>  <br>  This brings me on to the second part of the answer.<br>  <br>  At the time the Church was still new and converting people, usually through fear and threats,  Church and Law were pretty much the same thing the Church teachings were used as a way to control the masses - remember the lack of general education? well if you told a peasant he was going to hell or that he had been cursed by a witch he'd believe you and be terrified - if you told him his Soul was in Mortal Danger then he'd also believe you and do pretty much anything to save it. This is how many Lords and other people controlled the peasant community (also their workforce you have to remember)<br>  <br>  Now anything that anyone did that was not in the interests of the Lord or person in charge was a threat to that person and needed to be 'controlled' and the trial for Witchcraft was used for this. <br>  <br>  Accusations of Witchcraft were hurled at people for any reason other people could think of, knowledge of herbs, if someone's cow gave sour milk, if someone's baby died then it was blamed on Witchcraft due to a lack of education of the people and a culture of fear of the Church and the unknown. Even if they just plain didn't like someone and wanted to be nasty to them. Such was the fear of the populance of Witchcraft that the 'trial' was little more than a torture session aimed at getting a confession from the victim. It was also to find 'evidence' of a pact from the Devil, this would be any mark on the body that the witchfinder claimed was proof - so any birthmark would be suspect. Also any mark found was said to be a 'third nipple' where the witch was meant to feed their familiar (normally just a pet dog or cat) from. These latter things were from a book called 'the discoverie of Witchcraft' written by one 'witchfinder General (self proclaimed) Mathew Hopkins, son of a clergyman. He wrote this book that came to be used to persecute people, there is NO evidence apart from his personal opinion of truth in that publication. (if it was written now we'd call it fantasy!)<br>  <br>  There was also a cultural reason as the new Christianity was teaching that Souls would go to Hell everyone was desperate to save their own souls and oftentimes the people who accused others of Witchcraft would do so to 'save' themselves as they had saved a soul from evil. The Lords and such would also 'buy' their way into heaven by trying people for Witchcraft on their land as that too meant that they were 'saving' them, and had the New Religeon at heart.<br>  <br>  What made a witch then was pretty much absolutely anything that anyone did that someone else didn't agree with. Nowadays we see echoes of this in people calling Video games 'evil' or music, or the Harry Potter books - same mentality. Actual ability to do 'magic' didn't come into it, the vast majority of people tried and convicted of Witchcraft were little more than average everyday people - and children you have to remember, if the mother was accused then the children were often implicated - men, women and children were all victims of this stupidity.|`|TYGACtk2aa	The fear of the supernatural appears in many cultures, not just medieval Europe. When bad things happen people look for reasons. Very often superstitious people have settled on blaming other people for the random misforutnes of life. If God loves us why do bad things happen? A witch did it. <br>  <br>  In Christian Europe it was widely believed that people were making pacts with the devil to receive magical powers in return for their souls.  Supposedly witches would gather for black masses at midnight to summon the devil for unspeakable rites. The act of selling your soul to the devil supposedly left marks on the body that could be located by those who knew what to look for. Compare this with the recent moral panic about satanic ritual abuse.|`|qCZgLDGcaa	its something to do with the pagans and the stake when they used to burn them i think it was like a song thing and people started taking the songs serious and then they just decided to use their song privatlly or something like that i read about it before|`|3uiIrxojaa	Magic made a Witch Witch... There are people who are born with it... And there is such thing as witch.. I've known a lot. but When you say witch don't think about a big nose with a mole and nasty nails.. You think they are like that because you've seen fake witches in movies or cartoons..|`|7bf43d487015d45e6264f26c5f6c6374aa	"Why did they think that?"<br>  <br>  -As a general rule, male aristocratic society was suspicious of any woman who had knowledge.  A midwife, and herbalist/healer, a Pagan, etc.  Some women may have actually been Pagan "witches" (Wicca is a term that was created in the 1950's and so doesn't apply here.)  Most women though, had nothing to do with being a witch as their religion.  They were average ladies who knew more than the men around them thought they should.
