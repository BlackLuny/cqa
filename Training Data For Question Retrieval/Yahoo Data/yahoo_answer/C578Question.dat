My friend messaged me on myspace, saying she was thinking about killing herself, and wanted to know why I tried suicide.      Well, I'm at a loss. I don't know what to say anymore. She doesn't have a set date or method that I know of.      She says she doesn't want the pain anymore. She's lived through being sexually assaulted twice and once being nearly beaten to death. And she may have Crohn's Disease.      I tried telling her that she wouldn't be able to feel the relief if she killed herself... She said she never wanted to feel, never wanted to feel anything, no pain, even if that meant giving up the good feelings as well.

20090226193415AAJrYk6	Health;Mental Health	Private psychiatric hospital staff?	For a time when I was about 16, I was a bit mixed up. I spent some time in a private psychiatric facility, and received some help. The people who truly helped me there were the staff members. They were the people that monitored us, walked us from our quarter to the cafeteria, were open for "1 on 1" sessions, had to control and sometimes subdue patients who got out of hand, and administered meds. They weren't therapists, nurses, or psychologists.      However, they were the ones who truly helped me, and helped me to see things for what they were. They listened and talked sense into me.       Does anyone know what they are called? I remember one of them was still in school. Nonetheless, I have decided that THIS is what want to do with and in my life. I want to pay homage to those staff members and help other 'mixed' up kids, even the ones who are more extreme. I learned a lot from the other kids too, the attention starved, the "system kids, the psychotic ones, I saw it all, and all were valuable in my experience.      Does anyone know who these people are, and what kind of schooling and certification I am going to need?   Thank you.

Ok, on to the situation I'm in.      The other day I noticed a slimy brown discharge when I wiped. The next day, it was in my underwear (tmi, gross..sorry), and tonight after BD w/ the hubby, there it was again. Actually, for the past 3 days it's been around just wiping.      So after researching I see that you get a slimy brown discharge when ovulating, which I should be ovulating right now. Thing is, I've never had anything like this before. The more I researched, the more "implantation" kept coming up. Now, I've been TTC for awhile now...so of course I would absolutely be thrilled if that was the case, however I would have had to ovulate early. I don't keep track of my ovulation. Sometimes I go to those ovulation calculators which said I should be ovulating at this time, but seriously? Wtf. I'm dumbfounded. I'm nowhere near my period yet.       What do you guys think?

My dad thinks he has high blood pressure, so he bought some Omron device to wrap around the wrist to read it. His was around 130/80, which is apparently normal. I was curious and tried mine. He told me that my blood pressure is unusually high and asked if I felt okay (i.e. no dizziness, etc). I feel fine, but why do I have such high blood pressure? Can I just have a random spike in blood pressure and it'll go back to normal in a couple of hours?      P.S. I tried multiple times, and it always is around ~160/~90. :/ Lowest reading was 144/85...

20090226201118AAHvc2V	Health;Men's Health	Question for the guys: My son has very strange masturbation issues!?	Just about every night my son is really loud in his room (doesn't do anything when my boyfriend is over.) He moans, screams, and he humps his pillows really hard. All the paint is chipped off the wall from the bed slamming against it, and on one side he dented the drywall. I know this might be his "routine," but he needs to stop being so loud and he needs to stop damaging the wall.      I tried talking to him, and he seemed quite embarrassed each time, but he never stopped.      I snapped last night. When I got home all I wanted to do was sleep but I couldn't. I was tired with listening to him all night that I went up to his door and started beating on it. He just got louder. So I burst into his door to find him on who knows how many pillows, but I know 5 of them from a designer bed set from my guest room that I paid over a thousand dollars for! He had his head in a trash can that had some humans 'waste' in it, and he flipped around on his bed, landed on the ground, and his skin looked really red/purple and it looked like he had dried blood on himself. He hasn't come out all night/day, not even to eat.      How do I make him feel better? He has his door locked and won't even speak. I'd like to take a look at him as it appears he burned himself. I'd also like him to pay for the expensive pillows he ruined. They were going to be for my mom who's moving in soon.      I don't know what to do now. I feel terrible yet I feel the need to punish him. He does need to stop espeically with my mother moving in.   Suggestions? Please be mature about answers. Excuse my english.

Anything other than the deodorant i can use or try for this (I hate deodorant, it makes everything slimy and stuff).

20090226204150AA3nEgc	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will it be possible for me to go from 114.5lbs to 105lbs in one month?	My ideal weight is to be no more than 105 lbs. I used to be that beginning of college, but I gained weight over the years.    Here is what I do...      - I attend exercise courses for 1-2hrs, around 4-5days a week   - I try to cut back on snacks (although I tend to have cravings for small amount of chocolate or candy now and then)   - I have light dinner (usually before I exercise) and if I get really hungry after, I usually just try to eat a fruit, some veggies, or drink tea    - For breakfast, usually a bowl of oatmeal or sandwich and coffee   - For lunch, that's when I usually have a big meal (usually rice) but I try to have small proportions      I would like to loose overall fat (so in my thighs, arms, and stomach), Also possibly smaller hips...      I look forward to your encouragements and please let me know any low-carb meals I can try... Today, is the end of my 1st wk and I will weigh myself later to see any results...      Thank you very much and thank you again in advance for all the support and encouragements!
20090226211228AANidcz	Health;Other - Health	Passing out while on an amphetamine?	Ok so where to begin?   For as long as I can remember, I have always passed out while giving blood. (Usually right after -  but feel symptoms of knowing I am getting very sick while the blood is being drawn) Anyways, I'm prescribed an amphetamine drug which I take daily. A couple days ago I had to give a blood sample for my doctor and of course passed out. Looking back on it now...why did I pass out this time if I am on a medication that's known for keeping people awake? (can be prescribed to people with Narcolepsy but I take for ADD)      **Also** This is the 1st time I have ever given blood while on the drug - I try to avoid it as much as possible unfortunately had to do it this time!!      It doesn't make sense to me..I've been trying to research it doing google searches but can't come up with anything.   Even if this does not happen to you or you are not 100% sure why it happened to me give me your outlook. Can't make any sense of it!!      thanks so much!
20090226211308AAxOYFU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Can I donate blood if I'm slightly anaemic?	I have always wanted to donate blood but I have been anaemic off and on ever since I was born.       It was quite severe when I was younger but as I got older it went away with changes in diet and taking supplements. Thing is even though my last blood test said I was okay I still get a lot of the symptoms of it such as menstrual headaches. It usually seems to effect me more when I'm stressed as I don't eat properly.       If I build myself up for a few weeks, plenty of red meat and spinach and my next blood test is okay would I be able to donate?      Also are anaemics not supposed to donate because it's damaging to their health or because their blood is less useful when used in a transplant?

20090225123049AAr6sJN	Health;Mental Health	How do I raise my self confidence?	I am 12 years old, in middle school, 6th grade.  Last year I was the most popular girl in the school, and had no problems with what I looked like and I had so many friends!      This year, since I'm barely in any classes with my old popular friends, I lost them, and they got more friends!  Now even the not-so-popular kids make fun of me!      I don't know why, but when I'm not part of a conversation, I'll be like, "Oh my gosh!  I'm so scared for my detention!" so people will notice me, and everyone would be like "WE DON'T CARE!"      The popular girls from last year are still nice to me, but since I'm in middle school now, the other girls of the group think I'm so weird and annoying, just because I have different opinions about things.      I'm not mean to anyone at all!  But at lunch or whatever, my friends will be screaming that I love some random boy, or that I want to live with this weird teacher, or I have a big head or something.  I don't have the heart to say something mean about them back!  I know they're just kidding, but I'm so sensitive!  And later they'll be like "Why don't you just say something back?" and I get so embarrassed!      What can I do to raise my self esteem, and have the courage to stand up for myself?  Thanks!

20090226204341AADgsJL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart rate increases and blood pressure drops?	When I was in my teens one day I had got up from the couch walked about 20 feet and felt dizzy and my tongue felt funny and then my eyes rolled back and I passed out... as soon as I hit the floor I was okay. Well this happened many more times after that. I went to a heart doctor because after an episode they figured out my blood pressure would drop (@ 90/60) and my heart rate would rise to about 150-160 and sometimes higher. I had a lot of EKG, an ultrasound thing of my heart and a tilt table test. Well the only thing the heart doctor could come to a conclusion on was maybe my body was unable to retain salt and there was a big explanation cant remember all but basically because of this when I stand the blood doesnt go to my brain and there for I pass out. (if anyone knows the name of this disorder please let me know). Well when I was pregnant I had to go to the E.R. and I wasn't getting up from sitting or anything and my Heart Rate was 147 and of course I had to get an EKG and it came back fine like all the other times I've had one. But my blood pressure was fine. And well my question is what could be wrong all my EKG's come back fine and Im telling you I've had more than 10 in the last 5 years. What would cause my heart rate to be so high at times.... When Im just sitting in resting most of the time when my heart rate is so high?
20090226211250AARKJkB	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Quitting smoking.... Help please?	I've been an avid smoker for about seven years now, and have decided to quit. Not for any reason, I just decided to stop. Now, I didn't smoke for three days, which everyone always says are the worst days. I admit that I thought about them more than usual, but I didn't have mood swings or anything like that. Thing is my boyfriend, whom I live with, is also a smoker. He thought the idea of quitting was great, but said he'd start next week... That's fine, even though I know he'll have a hard time.   Well, he went to bed early tonight, and left two cigarettes on the table. He also has a broncial infection and shouldn't be smoking. Of course this isn't an excuse, but I smoked the both of them. The second one even made me feel a bit ill, but regardless, I did. MY question is- Do you think because I smoked these two cigarettes, only three short days of quitting a seven year addiction is terrible? I mean, honestly, I love cigarettes, but I'm thinking of my future health and all. So do you think I'm hopeless, or need chantex, or the patch, something? I feel like if they weren't around I wouldn't smoke them.   Anyway, thanks in advance

On the area right below the cap and slightly on the right side there is a slight bump that hurts if you touch it in the right spot. When I press on it it hurts. Did I knock something lose inside my knee or what? The pain is not that bad unless I do something to it like jump and land on that leg and that leg alone, then it throbs for 10-20 minutes. Often times while walking I do not notice it at all however, other times I do. Should I just rest it as much as possible or did I damage it and by letting it go am I creating a chronic condition?

20090226205229AAThdIi	Health;Diet & Fitness	Please help! I cant seem to lose fat and Im probably losing muscle?	Hey all I come to you with a fitness dilema. I have been working out consistently for about 6 months now, doing both weight training and cardio, but it seems like I am getting weaker ( lifting less weight every week ) and not burning fat. I am a 22 yr old male with a pretty decent diet and this is my routine:      I try to do my cardio when I wake up for best results...      Mon - 1 hour eliptical session after having oatmeal in the morning    Tues - the same thing + 20 mins of abdominals   Wed - Chest n Tri's after 3rd meal followed by 30 mins of cardio   Thurs - 1 hr eliptical after oatmeal +20 min of abs in the morning   Fri - Full shoulder / bicept routine followed by 30 mins of cardio    Sat - Morning eliptical again with abbs after oatmeal in the morning   Sun - Rest      I know I should be doing more weight excersizes but I cannot really afford a gym membership at the moment.       My diet is as follows: ( I eat the same things every day lol )    Breakfast: Oatmeal (and sometimes yogurt)   Lunch: Turkey sandwitch and carrots   Snack:  Apples and strawberries    4th meal:  0 fat cereal with 1% milk (and weigh on weight days)   5th meal:  Chicken and brocili with rice   Dinner:  Usually the left over chickin mixed with cous cous and another vegetable (stringbeans or pees)      I think I eat enough calories but maybe I dont because I have not been seing results this whole time that I have been consistent with my routine. It seems as though I am losing muscle still and gaining a verry little amount of fat.       The scale doesnt move at all either. Shouldnt I have seen somewhat of a change this whole time? Do I have aids or something?       Also I always wait 2-3 hours before going to sleep after my last meal.       Thank you to whoever can provide me with some good advice and if it is to get a gym membership I am working towars that but I still think with this routine you should see results!

So the first night, I just thought I was having a bad headache, so eventually I slept it off. The next day, same thing, around the same time, end of the day. Okay,so  yesterday, I didn't wake up with the pain, I went through the day as normal, took a few liquigels for stomach cramps, the entire day, no pain, it was all good, until later in the night, the head pain came back, but in very mild doses, so eventually I went to bed as well. Today, the pain is milder, but its there, and my ear feels kinda weird, so I'm thinking it might be a head cold or something. My friend tells me to go to the doctor, but...I really don't want to, they might tell me something I don't wanna hear, so, is there anything that can relate to these syntoms?

20090226210720AAB7noz	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Who do you report to when the staff at a doctor's office is often rude and unreliable?	My grandmother was scheduled to have shoulder surgery on Feb. 27, but had to have a stress test on Wed. to determine if she was able to have the surgery. She had the stress test in which everything checked out, and that doctor's office was supposed to fax the results to the surgery clinic. Well, at 4 pm on Feb. 26, we called the doctor's office to see if they had, and the receptionist said "Oh, no, I haven't gotten around to it yet." And THEN the surgery clinic's receptionist said that she didn't know where my grandmother got the idea that she was having surgery on the 27th from, but that it wasn't happening. They didn't even bother to call to tell us that! We both made preparations for this surgery, both took time off work, and neither office was very friendly nor helpful, which is often the case with the first office. Is there someone I can report this to?

I had a dead piece of skin so I tried pulling it off, but then it got bigger and deeper and started to bleed, so I cut the piece of skin off. It was bleeding. And it was right on the tip of the thumb too. So more than 12 hours later, I was trying to write with a pen at school and it started bleeding. There was also some somewhat clear stuff? Coming out onto my pen. But not alot or anything. The whole cut is aprox. 0.5 cm across. Its hard to clean cuts, and for alot of our classes, we use pastels, and art stuff. And its hard to clean some of it off. Also, wearing a  bandaid wouldn't help too much, since its on the edge of the thumb and a band aid would be really awkward. It still pretty sore, and looks a little gross. It looks like lips kind of. On the outer edges it almost seems dark greyish brown, and in the middle, there isn't really even any scab... It just seems raw. I'm not even sure whether my hands are just dirty from art, or if its infected or something. I guess its  kind of hard too, but aren't most scabs? Is it possible, that it is just dirty and it is raw in the middle because I draw and write so much or something. I dunno. T-T If it is infected what should I do? -_-       Thanks, in advance!

We were playing indoor soccer in a really small gym and I was sitting on the bench up against the wall, waiting for my turn. But then this dude, within a range of 3-5 feet, kicked the ball hard. It hit me right in the face (more in the nose area) Which is probably why my glasses aren't damaged too badly or anything I think. But then the force of the ball knocked my head back into the cement wall.       Its been about 10 hours since. My nose is still sore is this bad? It starts being sore right around under the nose piece of my glasses. and goes down almost to the tip of my nose. Thankfully I don't see any bruising so far. I also had a few headaches. But now the head aches are gone. I'm fine right?      (Last time I got hurt, I didn't cry, but it was painful. And it turned out to be a hairline fracture. Of course I didn't know, so then now there is a calcified bump there or something. Anyway, this time I cried/eyes watered. I just want to make sure....)      Thanks in advance...

20090226212829AAP82ox	Health;Men's Health	Excessive Exercise Potentially Harmful?	Hello, about a 8 months ago me and a friend of mine (who had before been serious couch potatoes) started working out and radically changing our diet around the end of High School.  Ever since then we've practically had changes in our personalities.  We both run and lift weights a lot, I've not asked him the specifics I just know we both like it.  I'm wondering if MY behavior is normal for being 18 now.      If there are stairs I try to jog up them, I try to at least put resistance in my own steps.  If my friends have lots of bags I offer to carry them so I can have more resistance in it.  When at home or sitting I at least try to do stretches or lift minor weights to keep my hands from idling.      Every day I wake up with 110 (adding 10 every week lately) pushups and a few situps and then I go running around the nearby rural area.  Sometimes if I'm not doing anything that day I'll go hang out with my friend and we'll use the day to do serious weight lifting and resistance exercise that morning (though we do it EVERY night normally because our nights are always free).        Is it normal to practically feel addicted to an increased heart rate and very exerted body?  I half do it because I feel very strong when I'm practically steaming from exhaustion.  I also do it to keep up with my friend who has taken to using medical enhancements to assist in his own work out, but I've just been trying to stay with sheer exercise.      Is it normal to keep my heart rate so high with consistent exercise?  Also I try to make sure my diet is nearly perfect, I will not drink sodas or anything of that sort, also I rarely touch processed foods.  I mostly only eat fruits and unseasoned vegetables, and unseasoned and unprocessed meats.

(1 year ago) I believe im the biggest I've ever been and can't find the motivation to work out. I've always been able to lose weight that has been gained in the past. Where can I find the motivation? Has anyone had anything help pull them out of feeling like this?

I have four children, and I just really need some advice. I can't stand this weight gain. Everyone gives me this "free pass" just saying, "Well, you've gone through a really hard situation..." and things like that, but my body is starting to disgust me.

20090226194816AA1gc4h	Health;Mental Health	How do I find/create an outlet for stress?	My way of relieving stress is by talking it out and get an empathetic response. I would do the same when the listener needs it too.      I agree that whoever I vent to might feel that I am flaming at him/her during the process.  So I would tell them in advance that this is my stress therapy.  They would usually said they'd understand.        Things didn't turn out smoothly.  Even though I might vent like 1 out of 10 times when I meet up with the same person, one by one shows that they have no interest listening to my problems;  They only want to have fun hanging out, which I told myself I should respect that and put on my better behavior.  After all, everyone has diff methods of handling stress.      After some time, it gets tiring and stuffy not to have an outlet.  That's why I turn to Yahoo Answers and websites of the like.  Some suggest me to just write a diary.  Well, I need to get human response. Be it good or bad, it's the only way I can get an illusion that there are pple who care abt what I go thru in life.      I guess being the emotional type isn't very suitable in today's society.  I always tell myself that I shall get over whatever it is after a good sleep.  It would be nice if you can advise what else I can do for this situation.        Thank you all for reading and have a pleasant weekend.

20090226215430AAqZwP6	Health;Mental Health	Do I have anorexia or something similar?	I have some of the characteristics of being anorexic. However, I don't feel like I need to be extremely thin and I don't have body image problems. I have lost about 12 pounds in the last 3ish months. I am now 108 pounds and my height is 5' 8" (18 years old), which I realize is not healthy. I have been thinking about food a lot lately and most of the time if I get hungry between meals or at night I will not eat anything, mostly because I am lazy. I figure it's not worth it to find myself something to eat. I use my teeth to scrape my food off of silverware because I don't want to let the silverware touch my lips. Also, I have been getting dizzy almost every day for the last week or 2. I hardly ever get my period (I've gone up to 7 months without getting it, but when I eat more my period returns). I think that some of my undereating may be for wanting attention. For example, if I know I'm not eating enough I at least hope I'm losing weight so the doctor will send me to intensive outpatient care or something. In addition, I sometimes get depressed and have been seeing a social worker for this. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow for my bad eating habits and she wants me to see a therapist (even though I haven't told her most of these symptoms yet). From what I've said does this sound like disordered eating, an eating disorder, or something else?

20090226201022AA9jFvp	Health;Optical	Question about vision- does anyone else have a lighter colored "shadow" of what you're looking at?	It's like double vision, although it's not a full object- if she looks at the tv- the tv looks maybe an inch bigger- with the "shadow" part being on the top generally, although sometimes it's below, and it's very light. At night, some signs seem to be two- with another sign on top ofthe other, although she says she can tell the difference, since the one on top is a lot lighter in color. As she gets closer to the sign, the shadow gets smaller, and right by the sign it's just ONE. Also, when watching the tv, she says she sees the letters on TV the same way- a shadow above them. Not enough to see the word twice(as if they were stacked) but just enough to be annoying. Does anyone know what this is called? Is this normal? She is nearsighted, and wears contacts or glasses. Thank you!

20090226215245AABLIFP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Just curious would this idea of cancer treament work? whats its problems?	i was just contemplating ideas about ways to cure a cancer and i really think i thought of something that could somehow be in use and could save millions of lives. It is true that when cells become inefficiant they destroy or terminate themselves correct? This being the case, i was thinking if people developed an antibody or something that sought out cells that carried the cancer and destroyed the nucleus or another cellular organelle so that would make the cell inefficiant and the cell would destroy itself and the cancer along with it. The end result being all the cells with the cancer being destroyed, although if to many cells were infected having them destroy themselves would cause some problems. and if this method worked any disease that was in the cells could most likely be cured or so i think and hope.

(don't laugh jerks... this is the only recent picture i could find with a decent picture of my acne)   the picture doesn't show it that well but my acne looks more like this    http://162.129.70.33/images/Acne_1_06090...       acne is just on my left and right cheeks and under my mouth. i also sometimes break out on the top of my mouth.      products i've used(following the instructions long enough that i should have seen results): proactiv(3 times), murad, countless lotions, facewash, hormone pills, and just tried not using anything for a while.      nothing has helped. i had done research online and i heard there's a myth about milk affecting hormones. so i had decided i would stop drinking milk and anything that contains a lot of milk. i had also given up on fast food and anything greasy. this has been going on for about 2 weeks and i have been breaking out much less, but the acne is still there. i also gave up drinking coffee... most of the time.      stress might have been a huge factor, considering it was junior year and was the most stressful year. but i'm a senior now and i'm just relaxed. i'm wondering how much sleep affects acne, because junior year is probably when i started to get around five and a half to six hours of sleep, as opposed to 7 to 8.      please help me. is there anything i should or should not do? should i go to a dermatologist? that would be my last resort, but if that's what it comes down to, then so be it.      i would prefer answers from people with personal experiences, but if you're an expert that'll also suffice.      you'll make a life-changing experience for someone, not to mention the 10 points for best answer.

20090226212335AAnXAcY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	I have bloody stool. How serious is it?	I've been noticing that I have blood in my stool for about a year now.    It usually happens about 1-2 consecutive days a month for every 3-4 months period.      I'm only 18 years old. The blood color is bright red. The stools are often soft and I've never felt any pain. It's quite hard to tell if the blood fragments are attached to the stool because they usually mix into the water.       I would say that I'm healthy with average weight and height. I'm eating mostly healthy food; I drink milk and juice everyday.      So I'm wondering if this problem is serious or not. I did address this issue to the doctor but he said it most likely be something that I ate.      Any help or advice?   Thank you.

For ages I have been getting blood with my stools on off,    About 5 months ago the doctor put me on the waiting list for the hospital which is now in 1 month, as he did stool tests and blood tests and nothing came of it.      But in the last 2 weeks about I have been getting a lot more blood and mucus every time I go. I also get stomach aches, sore eyes, headaches, tried all the time. My eyes get sore in light really easy.      Just before when i went, I got blood like normal... but when I was finished it kept dripping blood and then I pushed a bit ( sorry don’t know how else to say it) and little bulls of dark red blood came out and I had a big muses string of dark red blood..       I was pretty worried about this so rang the health line where I talked to a nurse who said I should see a doctor within 4 hours.      So go to A&E, but I don’t feel like I should... because it’s not like im doing to die and I have an appiment with the hospital in a month, so do you think I should wait? Or go to A&E where I probably will have to wait for hours and hours and then they might not be able to do anything anyway??

A friend called me today claiming that a liquid    that is made out of trees,,, and is called DMSO is a great medication that comes in liquid and it should be in glass bottle, also very careful to use it.  The area where you are going to put it on has to be very clean and should be applied with cotton.  I have bought so many ( medications) "natural"  that before I get this one I would like if someone knows more about it. Please.

My college's fitness centre has a hot tub inside the men's locker room and I've been wanting to use it for some time. Since the fitness centre has no swimming pool on site, all guys who use the hot tub go in naked after their work-out. I'm wondering if it would be acceptable to use the hot tub if there is already someone sitting inside. I've been wanting to try it out for some time, but there always seems to be at least one guy already sitting inside. Would it be inappropriate for me to use it while he is there?

Almost every time I do a particular chord switch on guitar, I get this popping sound and sensation in my wrist, about where it connects to my hand.  It doesn't hurt much, but it's really uncomfortable.  It sort of feels tingly, like when you hit your funny bone, except in the wrist and hand.      What is it that's popping, and is this common with guitar players?  Could it be bad?

The doctor put through two rounds of steroid packs and two rounds of antibiotics. The second of each kind was stronger than the first. Is it normal for my cough to last this long?

My fever is gone and I'm feeling better but I still don't feel normal and I still have difficulty breathing when I walk or move around a lot.       Any ideas or advice?

20090226203546AApJz97	Health;Dental	I'm 16 & have horrible teeth?	Okay so here i go. Pretty much i have horrible teeth. I'm only 16, but i'm too the point, where i don't want to meet new people, talk in front of large groups of people, or even go anywhere. I feel like that my teeth are the first thing people notice on me. That my teeth are all they notice when i talk to someone. I'm so depressed, they are all i think about anymore.    I have 3 cavitys in the back of my mouth. And two teeth in front are rotting. I do drink alot of soda, and blame it partially on that. But i have been asking my shi**y mother to make me an appointment for over 2 years and she won't. because shes too busy doing whatever it is, she is doing.   Recently, one of my teeth got abcessed. I called my mother, and told her to make me a dentist appt. She told me she would do it, and pretty much about 2 weeks later, she didn't. And my face had looked like i had an orange in my mouth. So me and my boyfriend went and picked up my grandma & went to the hospital. They gave me some antibiotics & tylenol 3's. I just ran out of medication about 2 days ago.      I told my boyfriends aunt [who i live with] if she could make me an appointment. She is supposed to, but i have to have my mother take me. I'm pretty much just really depressed and in this rut. Because i don't know what to do. I blame my teeth on my mother. Because she refuses to take me. And when i go, she is so going to blame it all on me. ANd make me look horrible. It also doesn't help that everytime i have went to a dentist in the past, they have put me down for the way my mouth looks. Their job is to fix them, not to make you look like an asshole, and make you not want to go anymore.      I just don't know what to think!! I just want some peoples opinions on this.

Hi,      I'm 21 and I got a rotator cuff injury to my shoulder while weight lifting when I was 20. I was doing military presses and locked my joints (stupid I know) so my left arm gave out and my shoulder took a bad tear.      I visited my doctor and he perscribed me NSAIDs, basically anti-inflammatory stuff and it helped calm the pain down after the injury but I do have chronic pain. He wants to do an MRI to check to see if it needs surgery but I can't afford that and don't feel like it's serious enough for surgery. I do have chronic pain but it's tolerable.. but it can be distracting and a bit uncomfortable at times...      Would these symptoms be enough for me to get a medical marijuana card? If yes, how do I go about getting it and bringing the subject up to my doctor w/o coming off as some kind of pothead?!      Thanks
20090226210808AALcDta	Health;Mental Health	What do you think about this? Is there a part that is too cheesy? (Its a dedication to my friends)?	The Best Friends A Girl Could Ask For      Finding true friendship in this often phony and temporary world is not an easy task.   I’ve been lucky to acquire the beauty of friendship with some great people.   As our lives evolve, its still nice to know I can find trust, respect, and compassion within these few (and fine!) ladies. Its been great having shared part of each other’s lives. I really do care about their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations. I have the desire to see each friend grow and develop, both individually, and with those that they love. I hope for each one to succeed in all aspects of life. True friendship involves action: doing something for someone else while expecting nothing in return.          Then I will go on to list a few great things about each friend.   Should I add or take anything out of this? Please tell me!

However, I don't feel like I need to be extremely thin and I don't have body image problems. I have lost about 12 pounds in the last 3ish months. I am now 108 pounds and my height is 5' 8" (18 years old), which I realize is not healthy. I have been thinking about food a lot lately and most of the time if I get hungry between meals or at night I will not eat anything, mostly because I am lazy. I figure it's not worth it to find myself something to eat. I use my teeth to scrape my food off of silverware because I don't want to let the silverware touch my lips.  I also have to make sure everything is very clean before I can eat. Also, I have been getting dizzy almost every day for the last week or 2. I hardly ever get my period (I've gone up to 7 months without getting it, but when I eat more my period returns). I think that some of my undereating may be for wanting attention. For example, if I know I'm not eating enough I at least hope I'm losing weight so the doctor will send me to intensive outpatient care or something. I have been underweight my whole life but it is getting worse lately. My whole life, people have told me that I am too skinny and that I need to eat more but it is not that simple. In addition, I sometimes get depressed and have been seeing a social worker for this. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow for my bad eating habits and she wants me to see a therapist (even though I haven't told her most of these symptoms yet). From what I've said does this sound like disordered eating, an eating disorder, or something else?

But for some inexplicable reason, I am always terrified of "immaculately" becoming pregnant!       I get stressed out a lot because I have a full load class schedule in college, and my menstrual cycles have always been irregular since menarche. This doesn't help my fear because the stress sometimes goes so far as to make my period go out of whack, thus FUELING my paranoia about possibly being pregnant. I know perfectly well that it is biologically, medically, physically, etc IMPOSSIBLE to be pregnant all on your own (women don't produce sperm, duh) and well, it takes two to tango obviously... but I haven't been able to convince myself out of my irrational fear.      Does anyone else out there ever feel this way? Are you in a similar situation? Please please please reply!      Thank you in advance
