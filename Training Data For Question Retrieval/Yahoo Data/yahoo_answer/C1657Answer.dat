I love eating and sitting on the outdoor tables at restaurants and cafes.  The parks are so much fun, I hire a small boat.  Tons of people read books and have picnics at the parks.  Then you have open air concerts, festivals and theatre too.  Wimbledon and Queen's tennis.<br>  <br>  I love summer!!! :D|`|3arJsZ91aa	Can be hot and sticky or wet.

TBNXWl3Eaa	Penn State Main is not that difficult to get into for Pre-Med or a related biological sciences program.  Those stats are excellent esp. with the honors and AP programs you'll be taking.<br>  <br>  Your goal should be to prove to them that you'll be able to excel in a pre-med program your first year.  To do that, you should take AP Calculus, which will cover you for the first two semesters of Math 140/141; AP Biology for obvious reasons; AP Chemistry for Chem 13/14/15.  Taking the AP tests for each of those is a gamble sometimes.  If you feel you can test high, take them.  If not, don't and rely on your grades for those courses.<br>  <br>  Activities are good to demonstrate, but not necessary.  They can only help if you can handle them.<br>  <br>  For a Pre-Med program, don't worry too much about the quality of the program.  You've gotta get the basics as far as coursework and summer internship/coop opportunities.  A large school such as PSU will offer you all of these, supplemented with strong emerging biological sciences programs (Mol Bio, MicroBio, etc.).  Your Med school choice and experience will be much more important in long-term growth than your Pre-Med choice.  Penn State's Pre-Med program is a little above average for a large state school, but not overly so.|`|qC0qeZaXaa	I'm at main campus and I had a 3.47 in high school.

x79VCZsNaa	shamanism is not a religion but a kind of medicine wich mix nature plants with spiritual rituals to get the healthness and reach the "extasis of spirit" it has the origins in siberian areas and central Asia and extend all over North america and South america. Shamanist make use of special plants to get the "extasis state" like in my country some indigenous comunities whom practice shamanism make use of a fungy pellote which they eat and as a psicotropic fungy make them to enter in a "spiritual state" that let them stay in a close relationship with natural forms and give them an space in their life.<br>  Because it is not a religion but a spiritual medicine there are several kind of shamanist practices such as Animist (like i mentioned before) Budist (where the budist try to reach the nirvana through the liberation of the material and wordly things) and the one practiced for some christians where the goal is having a close contact with God. ?n this kind of medicine the chaman works in the illness as a active factor ie. control of your body and subjecting the illness wich is the difference among it and occidental medicine where the pacient keep in pasive state and the doctor is in charge of "make up" the illness.|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	Shamanism is a range of traditional beliefs and practices concerned with communication with the spirit world.

cWuumdy7aa	Kathak is one of the eight forms of Indian classical dances, originated from northern India. This dance form traces its origins to the the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathaks, or story tellers. These bards, performing in village squares and temple courtyards, mostly specialized in recounting mythological and moral tales from the scriptures, and embellished their recitals with hand gestures and facial expressions. It was quintessential theatre, using instrumental and vocal music along with stylized gestures, to enliven the stories.<br>  <br>  Its form today is the product of various influences in the past: mythological tales portrayed by kathakas or ancient itinerant bards, temple and ritual dance, the bhakti movement, and Persian influence of the Mughal courts from the 16th century onwards; and the impact of these elements continues to readily discernible. There are three major schools or gharanas of Kathak from which performers today generally draw their lineage: the gharanas of Jaipur, Lucknow and Banaras (born in the courts of the Kachwaha Rajput kings, the Nawab of Oudh, and Varanasi respectively); there is also a less prominent (and later) Raigarh gharana which amalgamated technique from all three preceding gharanas but became famous for its own distinctive compositions.<br>  The name Kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word katha meaning story, and katthaka in Sanskrit means s/he who tells a story, or to do with stories. The name of the form is properly katthak, with the geminated dental to show a derived form, but this has since simplified to modern-day kathak. kathaa kahe so kathak is a saying many teachers pass on to their pupils, which is generally translated, 's/he who tells a story, is a kathak', but which can also be translated, 'that which tells a story, that is Kathak'.<br>  Bharatanatyam is a classic dance form originating in Tamil Nadu, a state in South India and is also a National Dance of India. This dance form is a 20th century reconstruction of Cathir, the art of temple dancers. Cathir in turn, is derived from ancient dance forms. Bharatanatyam is usually accompanied by the classical Carnatic music.<br>  Bharatanatyam is considered to be a fire-dance — the mystic manifestation of the metaphysical element of fire in the human body. It is one of the five major styles (one for each element) that include Odissi (element of water), and Mohiniattam (element of air). The movements of an authentic Bharatanatyam dancer resemble the movements of a dancing flame. Contemporary Bharatanatyam is rarely practiced as Natya Yoga, a sacred meditational tradition, except by a few orthodox schools (see Yoga and Dance).

ay8tXLD2aa	Agree with the above post on Big Brother Britain, but the cash fare on the bus is 2 quid, Oyster fare is only a quid (actually I think it's gone down to 90p) - so double price....nah. <br>  <br>  The point where the Oyster "maxes out" depends on the zones you are travelling in. I do zones 1 through 6 so for me it's 14.80 -- the price of a day travel card.  It used to be that it would max out at 50pence LESS than the cost of a day travel card but I think that's changed now, but not 100% positive. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/faresandtickets/oneand3daytickets/2911.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/faresandti...</a><br>  <br>  This webpage lists the day travelcard costs per zone.  Using Oyster you'll never pay MORE than that in one day, and like I said, it might still be less, you'll have to read up to see.|`|3arJsZ91aa	It is usually capped at the price of a one day travel card.  If you start your first journey before 9.30 a.m., the cost is more than if you start after.  How much depends on how many zones you pass through.  I live in zone 3 and when on PAYG, I allow ￡6 per day for travel (although there is usually a little left at the end of the day).|`|km9cQNAXaa	Are you sure you really want an Oyster card at all. Using one allows LT to  track where you travel and LT has no problem passing on details of your movements to others.<br>  <br>  If you pay for it with a credit card then that gives them your identity as well. This is Big Brother at it's worst. <br>  <br>  If you have to travel in London then I say get the bus and pay cash.<br>  <br>  Ian M

IstwJtBraa	Punta Cana is definately the most visited part of the DR.<br>  <br>  There is nothing there other than the beach and all inclusive resorts.  No history and no places of any sort of culture..<br>  <br>  If you want historical go to the Capital Santo Domingo but there is no beach there.  Visit Zona Colonial which is the first city in the New World, the first church and the first University.<br>  <br>  Another interesting place is La Romana.  Go to Altos de Chavon which is a copy of an old Italian fishing village that has an art school, galleries, restaurants, amphitheater and much more.  Take a boat from Bayahibe to Isla Soana for a real enjoyable day.<br>  <br>  This is one of the nicest islands I have ever seen and you can't spit across it as it is very big and diverse.  We have the Highest mountain in the Caribbean Pico Duarte that gets frost every day and snow often.  We have Jarabacoa which is a mountain town that has a cooler temperature and activities that revolve around rivers.  There is Samana Bay where the whales come to breed every year.  You have the first lighthouse in the new world in Puerto Plata.<br>  <br>  This place is rich in everything and most tourists don't leave their all inclusive hotels except to go on silly tours in the country and then they leave as experts:)|`|hT7BhNamaa	Pean, the medical clinic at your resort?

They usually had something going on and it was great fun and entertainment. Last time we were there we went while they had a Tequila Carnival.<br>  Take a bus to the area inland from Wal-Mart and Sam's Club about a mile or so. Walk around Pitilal.  Nice shops for just about everything and reasonable (clothes, hair dressing, meats, hardware, etc).<br>  <br>  Depending on what we were going to do and where, we would either drive our truck or take the bus.  Grocery shopping, drive. Bank, money exchange at HSBC (best rates), old town, the bus.  Parking can be a real headache at times.
Ssn0ojAGaa	Here is the proper term:<br>  <br>  Under the intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to drink alcohol. It is also illegal for an adult to buy drink for a minor.<br>  <br>  However the act states: "It shall not be unlawful for a person (other than the holder of a licence of licensed premises) to purchase or deliver intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under the age of 18 years in a private residence with the explicit consent of that person's parent or guardian." <br>  <br>  So in pubs, off licence, etc no, but at home with parent with consent yes.<br>  They are thinking of changing that last law do.<br>  Do not see why. Isn’t it better that a person has a mature attitude to drinking, than to binge drink at 18?<br>  <br>  If I had a child I would prefer they drank a few pints at 15 and continued drinking that way, than to become a binge drinker at 18, for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wEaQQGFeaa	18|`|WVVdf4ILaa	I think its 18 thats what it is in most of europe|`|SHwuzsPyaa	4|`|A9GN1kfuaa	well, you can be any age to drink<br>  it depends on if you're talking about alcohol<br>  i assume you are.<br>  it's 18 to purchase alcohol|`|Cp06GyiQaa	Im Irish, in ireland its 18, some countries in europe are 16.|`|a6JNx1tgaa	What's with all the weird answers?

jK4ALmXYaa	You won't be able to go to any clubs. But the shows would be good they cost between 30.00 to over 100.00. Golf during the day and the Bunny ranch is also an option. If you are staying more than 3 night that maybe to many then.|`|urHPuzMsaa	You might want to read this webpage.|`|AA10240904	Sorry there is zip.  You have to be 21 to go to the clubs.  BUT you can enjoy the shows and there are hordes like cirques Mystere or Love.  Plays like Phantom of the Opera or Jersey Boys.  Dinner show at Excalibur called Tournament of Kings.|`|AA11338392	You could go to the movies, take in some shows (if you hang on the Strip for a little while, you would get a bunch of free passes to magic shows, comedy shows, & you don't have to be 21). And all the casino's have mall's and entertainment for people who don't, or can't, gamble. There are arcades, excaliber, a big roller coaster. <br>  Have Fun!
ig25vB1qaa	All the credit goes to the British ...|`|PG7WfGpHaa	It is called land of riches because of things like the worlds largest railway system, built by the British.    It still is very rich, but the middle classes do not pay tax, and any money which is gathered gets spent on rockets and missiles.<br>  <br>  India is not a poor country. Only poor people are poor in India.|`|cWuumdy7aa	India was the land of riches and oldest civilisation but time to time outsiders invaded us and we became poor. moguls,French,dutch and british ruled us and and we ourselves were so divided for which these invader took the Advantage by dividing us. today also our politicians are doing the same thing dividing us on caste religion creed and we pay for it|`|3On59BLLaa	the poms (brits) stole everything. but, hey, it's not poor anymore: it has the fourth largest economy in the world and some of the richest men and women in the world. it is flush with cash as we babble on here.<br>  <br>  oh, and if you're from russia, here's something you ought to know: india is a darn sight richer than russia today, a long, long way!!! in fact, white russian women can be had in the brothels in ritzy, cash-rich resort areas like goa, and russians in general have swarmed in by the plane load, with their drug peddling trade... and i'm not kidding: go there and see for yourself!
fZjgIE9Baa	I like Southwest Airlines and US Airways. Southwest has low fares, and I have never had any problems with them. Their staff is also very friendly<br>  US Airways is the #1 On Time airline in 2008. Out of all the times I have flown with them in the past year or 2 (which was A LOT), not 1 of my flights was delayed or canceled.<br>  <br>  "WyattEarp"- Southwest has American low cost services. Aeroflot is Russian. Maybe it does beat Southwest, maybe it doesn't. But I KNOW FOR A FACT that Southwest DOES have low fares, it is not "nonsense"|`|1bTYCUDkaa	My favorite airline(s) are Virgin America and Southwest Airlines. Southwest has the low-fares, the open seating, and the free checked baggage with no "hidden" fees.  Virgin America is low cost, and has person televisions on every seat in economy, and leather seat along with mood lighting.  These are on all of Virgin America's aircraft.|`|GyqAKGTGaa	JetBlue, JetBlue and JetBlue. They are just amazing. All the coach seats have extra legroom, big comfortable seats and personal tvs with Direct TV. The bad thing about JetBlue though is they do not fly out of too many places. It is most likely that you would have to connect out of your way if you wanted to fly with them. I would also suggest United. When it comes to most airlines they are pretty much the same but I like how United has some smaller planes that are only 1 seat 2 seat across.|`|3On59BLLaa	aeroflot, because it's unpredictable, both in scheduling as well as safety, which makes it all the more exciting.<br>  <br>  oh, and don't fall for that 'southwest has the lowest fares' nonsense. aeroflot will beat southwest with its wings tied to its fuselage (which is the same as saying hands tied behind its back!). ;D|`|HWF5SnCdaa	Okay, my favourite is WestJet, one because I used to work for them, and they treat their staff very good, so my favourite is WestJet also because they have good service and friendly attendants, but if I'm flying international I fly Air Canada or Continental, even though their service leaves something to be desired.|`|AA11496012	For international travel I like Singapore Airlines.  Their aircraft average about 6 years of age and the airline is always updating their fleet.  The flight attendants are really professional as they go through a 15 week training program.  <br>  <br>  For domestic travel, Virgin America and JetBlue are great.  Unfortunately the cities they fly to are a bit limited since they have not been around as long as the legacy carriers or Southwest.  JetBlue does not overbook their flights and they have a generous seat pitch.  There is also satellite TV on every seat.
9NpXU7D2aa	yep. <br>  i used it last time i was on the way back to the airport. and its actually not awful. <br>  <br>  not too much longer til your trip :)|`|AA10024451	Considering the fact that the Magical Express buses are used to carrying families and LOTS of children who may have been on long flights and couldn't use the restroom.......the ME buses definitely have toilets on them for rider use.|`|D8odj7kHaa	Yes. It is a tour bus, and most tour buses have toilets.

7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	If you do not want to go quite far, then go to Taipa House museum for a soak up in culture of riches of old time Macau. If you want, u can also take MT1 or MT2 to its terminus at Macau Square, which is on another side at Macau Peninsular for approx 30 min and cost MOP4.2. Get down and walk towards San Ma Lo away from the Hotel Lisboa and Grand Lisboa and most of the attractions like Leal Senado, Museum of Pawn Shop, Ruins of St Paul and Museum & Fort of Macau etc will let you spend your time quite fast. For eateries, Taipa will be far better and nicer with its Macanese cuisine.|`|1LlhqADoaa	You might try gamble.<br>  LOL, a friend of mine won 5000 dollars last week.|`|dKN5yICSaa	Option A) go to the Venetian. Largest building in the world with an impressive shopping mall in it, all kinds of restaurants and venetian canals in the second floor, just above one of the largest casinos in the worls. (No need to gamble, you can sit in for a drink and have a good time just looking people)<br>  Option B) go for a walk downtown, eat in a Portuguese restaurant, have a bottle of green wine with some fantastic seafood and enjoy the place. <br>  The ride from the airport to the city is like 15 minutes and reasonably cheap.|`|O8zOZzO6aa	Macau? Never been there. But I know there are good casinos there. Perhaps you can spend some time in one of them.
SaeUxO6Gaa	In NYC:<br>  Lombardi's pizza in Soho (in NYC) is the best pizza I've ever had in my life.  Really cool atmosphere too.  The steakhouses are great too.  Don't turn your nose up at the hole in the wall mom and pop and ethnic places either... they may not look like much, but they're often the most fun and authentic stuff.   Make sure you take a walk through central park.  Also, a bit touristy, but check out the View Lounge at the Mariott near Times Square - it's a rotating bar 50 stories up.  Best view of the city.<br>  <br>  In Vegas:<br>  Stay on the strip.  IMO the MGM Grand is the best place to stay if you don't want to pay top dollar for the Bellagio/Wynn/etc.  Spearmint rhino is the strip club to go to.  Don't trust cab drivers to drop you off at the club you requested to go to (particularly when leaving the strip), club owners pay them to bring them people.  You need no other advice :)<br>  <br>  In L.A:<br>  Unlike NYC and Vegas, LA is not even remotely walkable.  It's completely decentralized, it's hard to wander so you've really gotta know where you're going.  The Sunset Strip is always fun at night, Hollywood blvd is fun during the day.  Santa Monica near 3rd street has great shopping, tons of restaurants, and is right near the beach.   Go to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, it's kinda LA's 5th ave.  The Ivy (both in Santa Monica and on Robertson's blvd) is one of my favorite places to eat.  Every Mexican place is unbelievably good.  Magic mountain is great for roller coasters, Disneyland CA is really underwhelming unless you have kids or something. <br>  <br>  NYC, LA, and Vegas are a blast.  If you're thinking about squeezing in any other places, San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, and Boston are my favorite places in the US.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Don't bother with Magic Mountain.  It's got rides.  That's about it.  Nothing special.<br>  <br>  Not far from Disneyland is Knott's Berry Farm.  Not bad, if you have a day and you're in the area.  It's an Old West themed park.  It's not a huge place, but they have Western shows, a few decent rides (nothing spectacular), and some interesting shows.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope you have at least three weeks for all of this!

Try to wander around and eat street food like hot dogs off a cart if you can.  Get a day pass and ride all around on the subway.<br>  <br>  Magic Mountain is good, but if you're already going to Disneyland, there's not much point, unless you're really into amusement parks.<br>  <br>  In LA, there's an abundance of cheap food.  Maybe go to an asian buffet, unless you do that in Las Vegas.  Also, eat at a Taqueria in East LA.  It's really much better than such places in other parts of the country, even Northern California (and I live here).  If you can't make it to one of those, at least go to Lucy's Drive In.|`|7ia9rfEHaa	Maybe you should come to Florida, it's kinda similar to Cali(so I've heard) I live in Florida, you can go to Orlando. Though I like in Jacksonville there isnt much to do. But, I go to Orlando once a year. They have wonderful hotels...and OMG THE RIBS ARE GREAT! They have chicago style Pizza. They have disneyland, universal studios, epcot, wet n wild..and more. =]|`|GOpDGnsXaa	All tourist Traps enjoy.|`|cIfbi0Zraa	Where are you comming from?<br>  Sixflags is pretty cool.<br>  Disneyland is a classic.|`|EBrcAyFQaa	NYC<br>  -Central Park<br>  -Elias Island<br>  Vegas<br>  -Old Downtown After Dark<br>  -The Strip Anytime<br>  -Bellagio<br>  -Hover Dam (45 minute drive)

(Traveling abroad is always a good idea! You learn so much.)<br>  <br>  As far as fundraising goes, my personal favorite is through my local grocery store, Kroger.  They offer a program where you buy a special pre-paid gift card for say, 5 dollars.  Every time that card is "reloaded" with more money and used, you get 5% of the profits.  I would ask at your local grocer and see if they have a similar program.  You can give the cards out (or sell them at face value) to your friends and family and you can quickly earn a lot of money just from going grocery shopping. <br>  <br>  Since you don't want to have to mooch off your folks, maybe you could take out a loan with them.  (Super low or no interest) Set a payment schedule and pay them back for the trip over time.  This can supplement your fundraising.  <br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you can go to Jamaica.  Mission trips are always eye-opening experiences and Jamaica is gorgeous.|`|4UtlMm1eaa	Wow! You should really go.

You buy the cases of bars from the company and sell them for $2 each,  and you make $46 per case of 50 bars. You will probably need some help from your church and its people.

uf2D35btaa	In 1951 the US provided the first aid to Israel, $65 million to help Israel take in Holocaust survivors and endangered Jews from Arab lands. Within 3 years, Israel's 650,000 Jews absorbed 600,000 refugees from Europe and the Arab nations.<br>  <br>  There has been economic aid to Israel every year since 1949, with the amounts fluctuating, generally increasing as the cooperation with Israel became closer or in years when Israel was forced to fight defensive wars or terrorism. From 1960 until 1985, there were no grants; aid consisted largely of loans, which Israel repaid, and surplus commodities, which Israel bought. The reference "U.S. Assistance to Israel" gives a table of annual amounts. The aid to other countries in the region has also increased and is similar in total amount. Much of the aid to Israel is for defense and the money is actually spent with U.S. suppliers so it recycles back to the United States.<br>  <br>  Israel is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. Several binational programs allow American companies and universities to benefit from Israel’s expertise in agriculture and high technology, while others aim to break down barriers to trade and cooperation between the two countries to make collaboration easier. Israel was the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the US, which has resulted in a quintupling of trade between the two countries. The US-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has served as a model for other trade agreements including the October 2000 FTA between the US and Jordan.<br>  <br>  For many years Israel received US financial and military assistance in a combined total of about $3 billion, divided into $1.2 billion in economic assistance and $1.8 billion in military aid. As the Israeli economy grew, and Soviet-era refugees were absorbed, the need for the aid package decreased. In recent years the economic aid has been reduced, while the military package has grown a little since the start of the al-Aqsa intifada.<br>  <br>  KILLING PALESTINIANS AT A RATIO OF "8 to 1" YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEN CLAIMING YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF TERRORISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM IS SIMPLY LAUGHABLE BY ANY RATIONAL, LOGIC, RELIGION OR CREED.

Israel is the most important ally to US, if it weren't for Israel, the US operations in the Mid East and their economy would be worse off. I think the US should send aid not just to the Gazans, but what about the Israelis that were attacked. Hamas intentionally targeted women, men, and CHILDREN just for being Jewish and living in their homeland. Indeed Gazans need help, but Israelis also need help. To promote peace the US should be fair and give help to both sides.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	staying out troop wise for now >.<, as long as we don't get fully dragged in I'm happy|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  For the record I am 100% pro-Israel and for Israel making her own decisions. The US just meddles too much.  It was Bush' idea to do Disengagement and Sharon bought the Bush plan and it  backfired on Israel as there have been thousands of rockets launched from Gaza. America was too optimistic about the abilities of the Palestinian people. Besides Gaza,  they also meddle in Judea and Samaria by being too optimistic about the capabilities of the Palestinian people to be an honest partner in peace, and hopefully,  America's action (with Israel concurrence) won't come back to bite Israel. They trained and armed Fatah to combat their own terrorist activities within their midst, but during Operation Cast Lead then Fatah threatened to turn that training and arms back onto Israel. See what I mean? America's prior policy, not just for this conflict, but exhibited over many decades is that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."  This behavior of American meddling has to STOP.  It is damaging Israel.  America and Israel have always had a strong loyal partnership and will always remain, there is no question. America is just overzealous and too optimistic in looking for peaceful solutions, and since Israel suffers the direct brunt of the failed American policies, Israel should be the leader and America take Israel's lead.  After all, Israel is an East meets West country, and is expert in these matters.<br>  <br>  Positive things is that the US sends aid to Israel and Gaza to sustain itself until peace can be worked out.  The US acts as a broker for peace and actively seeks arrangements but so far there has been "no show" on the Palestinian side. The US acknowledges this that the Hamas is to blame for the hostilities that emanate from Gaza and fully supports Israel's actions in combating the terrorists.  America has always been a strong anti-terror and freedom loving country and it goes back to the Reagan Libyan campaign to fight terror  The US acknowledges that there isn't anyone credible to negotiate with, as the Palestinian people have not one honest leader to negotiate peace.  They didn't have it with Arafat, and they don't have it with Fatah or Hamas.  The best that can be done is to just sustain the situation until the Palestinians can find a credible leader. America does a great job at that. Besides American help, we also have Euro French and possibly some British help controlling the arms smuggling into Hamas on the Gaza strip via the water, and Egyptian help controlling the arms smuggling via land.  The Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit who is captive in Gaza is also to my understanding a dual national France and it's my understanding Sarkozy did ask about his health and whereabouts.<br>  <br>  For the record I am Jewish American and I do not support US meddling in Israeli internal affairs.  I never supported the Disengagement nor to secede Jewish territory to a separate Palestinian state, and especially not one in Judea and Samaria.  The time that the Palestinians become non-hostile then one can consider the viability of a second state in Gaza.  I do fully support the continued humanitarian aid that is offered by America and Israel to benefit the Gaza people and the continued armament of Israel to help combat the Palestinian terrorists and keep Israel a free and safe society. <br>  <br>  Some links that might help you with your project.

e2sHP0Zpaa	Eze is a lovely village perched high on a hill overlooking the sea.  It's pretty hilly, so if you're a smoker, or otherwise incapable or unwilling to walk up fairly steep inclines, you may not enjoy it as much.  There is a restaurant in Eze called the Chevre d'Or, the Golden Goat, at which I had the best meal of my life.  They serve cocktails and appetizers on a patio with a spectacular view overlooking the harbor, then take you into a lovely restaurant with impeccable service, spectacular food, and, unfortunately, prices to match.  When I was last there they had two stars from Michelin.<br>  <br>  The village has lots of quaint stores that are fun to browse as well.<br>  <br>  All that being said, if you spend time in Eze, you will likely devote more time nearby in the towns of the Cote d'Azur or in neighboring Italy.   The whole area is great, with plenty of charming unassuming villages to the north, and all the glamour you could ask for in Cannes and Nice.   Also, spend a half-day in Villefranche admiring the multi-million euro yachts.  <br>  <br>  Eze and the neighboring areas are very welcoming of tourists and you'll have no trouble finding English-speaking people in the service industries.  There are a number of well-regarded hotels, and I've found that Trip Advisor is a good collection of reviews.  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187222-d207390-r20256893-Chateau_de_la_Chevre_d_Or-Eze_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserRevie...</a><br>  <br>  You might also want to consider a bed and breakfast for a more interesting experience and a less touristy feel.   The highest rated B&B in Eze is the Bastide Aux Camilias.   <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187222-d309534-Reviews-Bastide_aux_Camelias-Eze_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-...</a><br>  <br>  This is a destination that is really worth your researching.  It's all too easy to miss some really wonderful experiences if you restrict yourself to the waterfront.  Don't miss any of the familiar tourist sites, but get a good guidebook and see if there is anything tucked away that might interest you as well.  Oh, and pick your season carefully;  the entire area is a madhouse in August, and prices peak then as well.  Also, the Cannes film festival in May makes it tough to visit then, unless you happen to be a movie star.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|BMWM9l9Baa	Eze is really nice but not much of a resort.

It was ideal for them. <br>  <br>  Don't attempt to see all of Ireland in just 5 days. What most Americans in particular don't realise before coming here is that the roads in Ireland are not built for large volumes of high-speed traffic, so you cannot drive 100 miles in 100 minutes - it simply isn't possible. Much better to settle on one area and stay there. <br>  <br>  Also, be aware that there are very few automatic cars in Ireland, and the rental agencies don't have that many available, and the ones that are available cost more to rent and insure. You still have time to learn to drive a real car if you can't already, use it wisely.<br>  <br>  A useful website for you is www.discoverireland.ie, and you can also try the Everything Ireland forum on www.delphiforums.com for information from Ireland veterans from the US.|`|afeoTehEaa	Sher it's the middle of the night in Ireland at the moment.<br>  Come back in the morning when the rest of them will be around.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Well theres Boyle in Roscommen that has pretty much everthing your looking for a little town accommodation, great natural beauty has a huge park in it with dear roaming around it and boat rides out to the little islands in the lake and has a pretty historical background with a museum and and the like. <br>  Oh and congratulations on getting married.
fKpBXXJbaa	Yes, the Royal Mail postcode finder says that's a valid postcode for even-numbered properties between numbers 4 and 44 in Fore St, Hatfield, however this doesn't necessarily mean anything as any address can easily be discovered and used in an email. If you are being offered a job which you have not applied for, you should be extremely suspicious. In particular, if the offers include a telephone number which begins 070.... or, in international format +4470... then you should automatically treat the offer as fraudulent, as these numbers can be redirected to anywhere in the world.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Yes, it is a real address.

Of all the maps I've used since moving to this city in 1994, the one I found most useful is the ADC street map of Greater Atlanta with Street Atlas ($49.95).

i1AsTUG0aa	The topography of San Francisco is extremely variable. The topography actually effects the climate of SF extremely. The Sunset District can be foggy and 55 degrees while Downtown can be sunny and 65 degrees. SF actually has 50 official hills and several valley's, with just about each hill and surrounding valley being its own distinct neighborhood. The tallest of these is Twin Peaks (900 ft.) which is responsible for the climatic variances in SF. Take a trip there and you will see nothing but hills and valley's. The downtown area is actually somewhat flat, but hills surround it in each direction besides to the east, where the Bay itself is.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would say the topography is variable.
z0U64kbqaa	I am an American expat living here,and the American consulate has not yet sent us any travel advisories. Some of the reports of drug related violence in and near Cancun are true.<br>   Please get out of that all inclusive and see the beauty of the people and the jungles around you. Take that day trip to Chitzen Itza , visit beautiful Tulum, take the kids to Xcaret and Xhel Ha. You should also visit Coba ruins near Tulum and the Cenotes of  Hidden Worlds, they have the best zip line sky bike in the world, it is the only one also. Nothing like it .You pedal on an ariel line thru the jungle canopy and thru underground tunnels filled with spring water that is crystal clear.<br>  I would be more worried about the boring awful food at the all inclusive than getting involved in a drug related incident.|`|pWhyuXJ5aa	it's very unlikely. <br>  if you stay where all the hotels are, you are completely safe and there will be other tourist there. <br>  <br>  our family went to see tulum and chitzn itza and the people who work there are so nice and helpful. <br>  <br>  just don't go to the "local" side of mexico b/c that is where all the drugs are. <br>  <br>  however, just a word of advice, ur children will probably hate chitzn itza b/c it's very hot and the whole tour is done in spanish! so unless u and ur family are into looking at old ruins and understand spanish, i wouldn't recommend it. <br>  <br>  have fun :)|`|Osmyhvc7aa	You'll be fine if you stay in the main tourist areas which all of those are.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	the tourist destinations are safe as long as your smart, obviously since you are going with your kids you and your husband aren't going to be falling down drunk and not aware of your surroundings. <br>  <br>  The places to worry about are border towns and mexico city and monterrey.

b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	We rented one for 2 weeks last summer and drove from PA to Nevada and back and it cost ALOT (I think around $9-10k when you consider the rental, gas, campground fees, etc.).  Of course, gas was about $4 a gallon then, but even at $2 a gallon you're going to spend a lot when you're getting less than 10 mpg.<br>  <br>  If you do it, here's a tip...take photos of everything on the RV before your trip when you are inspecting the vehicle.  The RV dealer we went through accused us of breaking things and turning it back in "dirty" when the things were broken before we left and we spent an entire day cleaning the thing when we got back. He had his kid do the checkout when we were leaving and he kept saying stuff like "don't worry about that" and he was trying to get us out of there in no time, but the owner was sure to inspect every little detail when we got back.  It was really a scam just so they didn't have to pay you back your security deposit (which was a substantial amount). - - - - I don't think I'd ever do it again unless I could rent it off of someone I knew and trusted.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	It depends how long you go, it depends where you rent one at, it depends on your insurance to im sure...

Most Chinese don't apply Confucianism to their lives though. I studied in Hong Kong and the curriculum forces us to study Confucianism in Chinese culture lessons. Confucianism is like a perfect world. People are friendly and respects each other. The world can be peaceful if everyone follows Confucianism. But when people apply Confucianism values extremely, it can cause a lot of problems. Obviously some is happening in China. And it assumes that everyone is born to be a good man. But someone's just plain evil. If you use Confucianism in laws, those people will never change and will just continue harming the world. So Confucianism is just an illusion. A world that will never exists.

Texas was part of the Confederacy, and it did have segregation, so technically that makes it a "southern State".  As was said before, portions of Texas, especially the eastern parts of the State are very much culturally part of the South. Parts of South-east Texas are darn near cajun, and craw-fish are considered a delicacy.<br>  <br>  That being said, the further west you go in Texas, the less southern it becomes. El Paso is darn near a part of Old Mexico, and Lubbock is stereotypical Oil/Ranching Texas flatland.

AJmCHSwmaa	You generally want to use a credit card and not a debit card, if there is any dispute with services they try to charge you for that you didn't use your pretty much out of luck with debit but can get charges taken back by your cc company.<br>  <br>  Also, be careful when booking a hotel with a debit card, your room may only be $92 but they will probably put a hold on your card for about $500, they won't charge it but that money will be tied up, basically just incase you trash the room, run up a big phone bill, order a bunch of expensive porn movies on the tv, etc.  If you only have a couple hundred in your account this could tie up all your money.<br>  <br>  Final thing is even if your room is only $91 there are taxes and other fees often charged. If your staying in Chicago they have ridiculously high taxes on hotels and tourist type things. It's pretty stupid if you ask me that hurts our tourism part of the economy but that's mayor daily for you.|`|7toznquyaa	There are usually two types of additional charges and hold.<br>  <br>  First, you'll pay room taxes, surcharges and any mandatory gratuities that the specific hotel collects.<br>  <br>  Secondly, they put a HOLD on you card based on how many day, how many people any what your expected use would be for incidentals.<br>  <br>  If this is just an overnite stay in a business area..it's likely to be only $100 or so.  If you are going to a resort location or somewhere where it's likely that you would put your bar bill, restaurant charges or spa services on your room charge.. then it could be $250 or more.<br>  <br>  Depends on the type of hotel and services available.<br>  <br>  If you use a DEBIT card, the amount will be taken from your account, and then a refund processed .  which means that those funds are unuseable for the time it take for the refund to be charged back to your account.  This can be a week or so.<br>  <br>  It's better to use a charge card.. or even cash as your room deposit.

Look at it this way, you can park in a permit spot and have to pay between $50-$200 (depending on whether you get ticketed or towed) for parking illegally OR you can pay like $12 flat and know 100% that you're not going to get ticketed or towed.<br>  <br>  Park in one of the lots a few blocks from the UC.  The neighborhood isn't that bad anymore, and you'll definitely be walking with lots of other people who are going to the game.<br>  <br>  Make sure to have a drink for Stormin Norm.|`|DI8kBr84aa	you can i do it all the time and havent had any trouble with it.

SaeUxO6Gaa	Desert and rednecks.  That's all there is to them.<br>  <br>  Phoenix is 100+ degrees in the summer and is nothing but tract housing, retirement homes, and golf courses.  It's like Las Vegas, but with all the casinos removed.<br>  <br>  Houston is a congested, sprawling, smoggy metropolis.  It's like Los Angels - only remove the beach, young people, hipster neighborhoods, and the movie/music industry and replace it with oil companies, fat people, and crazy humidity.<br>  <br>  Dallas is a generic large city.  It has absolutely zero defining characteristics.  It has neither the public transit, history, or culture that you tend to see in east coast cities, nor does it have the youth, scenery, and outdoor life that you tend to see in west coast cities.  Dallas is just there.<br>  <br>  San Antonio is fun for a day or two.  Ditto with the  Grand Canyon and some other natural stuff in Arizona.  Austin and Tuscon are supposed to be cool, but I've never been.  That's about the only positive thing I can say.<br>  <br>  The rest is horribly depressing redneck towns and vast open space.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Texas also ruins national politics by producing people like  George W. Bush and Tom DeLay and filling the House with neo-con idiots.  That doesn't help.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Try living in California. Living in California is the ULTIMATELY worst state!|`|St0g6Ng7aa	I think you're asking two questions: 1) why do people joke about these states and 2) what is it about the states that might justify the jokes.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't hear that many state-specific jokes, but when I lived in Texas I did hear my share of Oklahoma jokes.  Most jokes I hear about a particular region now are about the South or Appalachia.<br>  <br>  Where do you live?<br>  <br>  One explanation for why you might hear jokes about Texas is that Texans make themselves targets by bragging about their state.  And they do it a lot, about everything.  George Bush didn't help the reputation of the state much either.<br>  <br>  As for livability in Texas and Arizona, both states have good parts and bad parts.  Austin, Texas in particular is a very livable city.|`|oWXSnTDjaa	I know so many people that moved to AZ after getting a good college degree and ended up working at a restaurant until they could save up enough money to move back.

Vlp50eEGaa	In one question you answered that you been here before.  So you should know that Koh Samui is not that big and getting to the pier for Koh Phangan is not more then 30 minutes from most of the popular beaches here.  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|AA11691241	Closest area for staying is Phai laem or Ban Rak -both have guest houses etc ,the speedboat piers are along this road.<br>  <br>  Bophut is the next closest (Around 1-2 miles away)-Has a better beach and atmosphere than Phai laem or Ban Rak.Maenam Beach is a bit more further .<br>  <br>  If you want to get a boat to Phangan then they are the best places.If you stay at the first 2 places recommended then you wont need to mess around with taxis or anything,just walking distance.<br>  <br>  Other place to consider is Maenam Beach as Lomprayah has a catermaran service running daily to Phangyan and is cheaper than a speedboat.|`|YiWprWRDaa	Recommend at Samui Pier Resort <br>  Good location and easy to take a boat to pangan ,There neighbour the famous Big Buddha Pier, where you can catch a boat or ferry to Koh Phangan, Kho Tao, Angthong National Marine Park <br>  Chaweng Beach (by car) : 10 minutes. <br>  Samui Airport (by car) : 5 minutes. <br>  Big Buddha (by car) : 3 minutes.|`|7MDe2OO0aa	You can stay at Menam beach.

Ok so the food was OK, nothing special. The entertainment was not as good as other airlines, (BA/Emirates/SAS/ China Air even KLM!) and the crew were actually pretty rude. I know it's a long flight and the crew may get tired, but it's their job, and at over 400GBP per rtn ticket for 2 people I expect a reasonable service. <br>  <br>  (Even trying to speak a little French didn't help). <br>  <br>  Only way I'd use them again was if they were considerably cheaper than any rival. I flew 3 times with them and each time the service deteriorated.
Bgqi0pOuaa	Sorry, I can't answer your question without doing your work for you.<br>  <br>  I just wanted to say, Eneri, you represent everything wrong with the public education system.  Are you from Oregon by any chance?  It would be ironic, but yet it would make sense if you were, given the schools there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Geez, Kyle...another product of Portland Public Schools?

HvyE4qpYaa	Canada?  Mexicans can go to Canada without needing a VISA.  Double check first.  Most European countries allow Mexicans to stay up to 60 days visa free.,.. <br>  <br>  I would brave it and go visit her in Monterrey.  Fly.  And be prudent.  MTY is AWESOME...  But yeah, those r the only other ones i can think of.  Maybe South America.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	She needs a visa to come to the US, good luck getting her one. What if yall met up in a tourist destination for a few days and just took a min vacation? Monterrey is one of the areas that are not safe.|`|pBxquWW2aa	In my opinion you're just as safe in Monterrey as any U.S. city of equal size.  Use common sense and you'll be fine.  I have been all over Mexico and not once have I felt scared or in danger.  If you still feel uneasy you should look into Canada.  Neither U.S. citizens nor Mexican citizens need a visa to enter Canada, only a passport and you can stay up to 180 days.|`|73221af91aaa16bc944f2688cb6cc0aaaa	Hi, JD my name is Christie and I live in Garcia, Nuevo Leon, about 45 min. outside of Monterrey. I am going to be honest, there are some dangerous parts of Monterrey just like any city. There is a few areas that I would not go into no way, no how. Guadalupe is extremely dangerous, and becomes more and more everyday. They gangs are taking over the streets and I would not advice you or your family to go there. Escobedo is the next place gangs are taking over as well as nartitraicanas (how ever you spell it AKA drug runners) Please DO NOT go there. My husband worked as security there for about a year where he was brutally attacked by 13 teens in a gang. He lost his left cheekbone and has a plastic replacement now. Then again you can go into other neighborhood's that are safer than any town inside America. I feel completely safe in Garcia. I am really interested in what part of Monterrey your friend lives in, and then I can give you more true information. I cross the border by bus an average of 6 times per year, and thus far have not had any problems. I have never driven across the border so I can not be any help in that area. You can have a wonderful time visiting your friends, just be conscience of your environment, and do things to protect yourself, do not be a target. I say the same precautions you take in Dallas, or New York city do the same here. Feel free to write me, Monterrey is very familiar to me.|`|eBAxaVO0aa	Living here in Monterrey and never been in danger, robed, or something like that. But its truth, Insecurity feeling has grown in the past 3 years (with a peak in the last year when we started to see battles between drug cartels in the cover of the citys newspapers).....drug cartels battles ceased and insecurity feeling donwgrades (nevertheless is a lil bit higher than we used to feel).<br>  <br>  Drug Cartels Battles are very impressive, but are focused among memebers of the drug gangs /and or the Mexican Army. Citizens out of their business are normally safe.......<br>  <br>  Its not like its happening everyday and everywhere. Drug Crimes are significantly lower today than some months ago. Normal Crimes (Robbery and other crimes that occurs in the big cities) are more frequent in the Guadalupe and Escobedo counties and in a zone known as "La indepe" (Independence suburb). Just try to avoid those zones and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  I live as i used to live....and nothing has happened..(i Usually go out on weekend nights and still feel very secure walking alone, getting some cash at the ATMs in the night, etc etc)...Monterrey, San Pedro Garza, Santiago, García, San Nicolas and Apodaca are pretty safe counties in the metro area.<br>  <br>  Canada is the closest option to meet with her outside the US and Mexico (She must take a non stop flight, passengers with a stop in the US must have a visa too.. whether they are just in transit to Canada or not).<br>  <br>  Cheers.
SU6AP3t5aa	ok they have already cut you some slack by renting to you in the first place, if caught they could lose there  business.  a camp ground works like a motel and prices are based on a 2 person occupancy with a charge for each additional  person, also if the person already told you it will only accommodate 2 that's what they mean im not trying to ruin your good time or to make you mad but that is the way it is perhaps since the people were so nice to you by letting you stay under age maybe they will be ok with extra people,but it would be bad to get kicked out and have no where to go|`|IK7Uo4baaa	i have to agree with the other person  it would be bad to be kicked out with no where to go

I personally always bring a laptop with noise canceling headphones but remember laptops are a hassle at border checkups (especially if you have illegal stuff on it, lol) Depending on what airline you fly and the length of your flight. If you flying United/American/Delta you should prepare for the worst. However if you are flying Singapore/Asiana/Emirates etc. you don't need to worry about too much. Check the in flight entertainment on your airline's website and you should know what you need. I usually sleep on the plane.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	Every time i fly with an airline, I must have my Bose noise canceling headphones, my iPhone, a magazine or 2, and my Macbook.

gm9QYLjIaa	Alex: 2-3 days?! Are you kidding me? Were you taking a boat or something? Do you even think that's possible? It takes 11-12 hours from Washington to Istanbul (and vice versa), a trip I have made I don't know how many times.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it should take about there are no direct flights that I know of but you could check this out: <a href="http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=fexp&flag=q&city1=IST&citd1=CGK&time1=720&time2=720&cAdu=1&cSen=0&cChi=0&cInf=&infs=2&date1=03/13&date2=03/20&&rdct=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qsc...</a> <br>  <br>  But Turkish Airlines has a direct flight to Singapore, which takes about 11 hours, so if there had been a direct flight to Jakarta, I would assume it would be around 11-12 hours. But expedia has the duration of the connecting flights written under the dates, it all varies according to the time spent at the connecting airport as well. The shortest is 13 hours (with a stopover in Singapore, check Singapore airlines), the longest 33 hours (stopover in Amsterdam, it might be cheaper but seems like such a hassle). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Sorry if I am too late to help.  I only have seen your question just now:<br>  Basically what you should be looking for on French websites  (clicking on the French flag at the bottom of this page) are "Soins pour bébés" and you will find lots of sites that give you the right info such as this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.doctissimo.fr/html/grossesse/bebe/soins_quot/index_soins_bebe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.doctissimo.fr/html/grossesse/...</a><br>  but you know things are not that different  for babies in France from what is done in other  western countries: vests, disposable nappies and babygrows, cots etc.... . <br>  For French brands and baby gear look at "Puériculture", for instance:<br>  <a href="http://www.france-puericulture.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.france-puericulture.fr/</a><br>  I have grandchildren who were born on both sides of the Atlantic and they even had the same Graco cots.
yKIr3C40aa	You might be interested in the Genki English program, which lays out a curriculum for elementary school English for Japanese students. There's even a curriculum written in Japanese that you can give the Japanese teachers. You can use as much or as little of it as you like, but it's a good starting point.<br>  <br>  As for the original question, you might also want to look at Sesame Street, since there's a localized Japanese version that the kids might be familiar with, and the show uses a lot of songs and repetition to teach basic concepts. Barney might be good too, that show has a lot of easy-to-sing songs with simple language.|`|3Of4chl8aa	Dora the Explorer is the bomb!!! but u might get the children mixed up because Dora is bilingual(Spanish/English) and also teaches alot of Spanish.<br>  Bob the builder is a good show, Thomas the tank engine is a good show, U cant go wrong wit Sesame Street. Try this website Pbs.org, they have all the children shows that are good for just starting to learn the english language. Plus they also have a section for teachers. I hope that this helps you out.|`|KwUfhcmwaa	Disney videos are always children's favorite!

oyr13KYmaa	10 min from my house :)<br>  <br>  From the confusion as to the exact location of Bachelors Grove cemetery, directions are being given so that everyone can have the privilege of seeing one of the most important pieces of history here in Illinois. Some thought that it was located at the Bachelors Grove Forest Preserve at 143rd Street and Justamere Road. Its actual location is southwest of the Rubio Woods Forest Preserve entrance on 143rd Street, just East of Ridgeland Avenue.<br>   <br>  <br>     You can find the entrance to the path leading to the cemetery across from this preserve. The Rubio Woods parking lot is where you can park your car to make your journey out there. Please, DO NOT attempt to park your car elsewhere! The families that live in the neighborhood near the Grove do not appreciate it when others park in their driveway (yes, this has been done) and the residential area around Bachelors Grove cemetery is off limits to parking on the streets. You WILL get ticketed and towed.<br>    <br>  <br>     Another area off limits to parking are the little "driveways" next to the cellular towers across the street, they are not a part of the Forest Preserves and you can expect trouble if you do park there. Also, remember, being that the cemetery is located inside of the Forest Preserves, you must keep in mind that the Forest Preserves are closed at sunset. Because of the long history of vandalism, late night drinking parties (often the source of the vandalism), and other problems occurring at the cemetery, the Forest Preserve, local, County, and State Police typically have little patience with individuals found in the cemetery after sunset. They can, and often do, issue tickets and fines. If you must break the law and go back there at night, please don't do to the cemetery what many have already done. Break the cycle of abuse and don't let the only piece of history left of Bachelors Grove go to even more shambles.<br>   <br>  <br>      At one time there was a settlement called Goeselville located near Bachelors Grove cemetery and oddly it can still be seen on current maps. By using Yahoo.com and the maps available there, you can find a more wider view of the roads around Bachelors Grove cemetery using Goeselville as a reference.

q6uyloYdaa	A lot of MassArt kids live in Mission Hill, but they seem to be pretty spread out across the city.<br>  I lived on Hillside Street in Mission Hill for 2 years. The area is mostly college students, but it is near an unsafe area. I personally never felt unsafe, even at night, but I would recommend that if you live there to not live on the first floor. I have known people who have had their first floor apartments robbed. If you live there, don't expect a quiet lifestyle. There are a lot of parties every weekend since there are so many college students (mostly from Northeastern) and other shenanigans. However, you do get to see a lot of entertaining things go on.|`|5cBiN90Waa	MassArt students are known to be extremely promiscuous. if  spotted avoid at all cost. mass art students can be found in places such as<br>  Arlington, Brighton, Fenway, North End and many more places. MassArt students are usually found from 6PM-12PM. they lurk at night looking for their next victim. they are usually found in groups. there has been several cases of gangbangs and orgy rapes. these cases has even lead to murder. I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT APROACH A MASSART STUDENT! spread the message.|`|bC5RfHUpaa	I didn't go to MassArt, but went to a COF and therefore lived on Mission Hill.  The side of the hill that faces Boston is practically all students, so it feels overall pretty safe.  I lived off of Calumet for awhile and it wasn't ever an issue to me.  The further outside of the city you go, the more sketchy it can feel.  I'd suggest walking around the area of your potential apartment and see how it makes you feel.  Gut instinct is really most important for something like this.|`|FEEE9vcKaa	hi

I subscribed to their local paper and read it online looking for jobs.  It helps if you know someone in the area you want to live in, I had a family member tell me where the good and bad areas were to rent in.  I applied for jobs, saying in my cover letter that I would be relocating on blah blah date and I got a job before I even moved!  It was a little tough talking an apt. manager into trusting me, therefore there were a lot of phone calls and faxing and sending my deposit before I even got there and had never even seen the place.  But my family member was right, I got a great place for a pretty cheap rent for the area.  As for the moving part, I tossed as much as I could into a duffel bag and carry-on and had a friend drive me to the airport, stayed in a hotel for 3 days until the moving van got here.  I had sold my car before I left, so I'd already been looking in the ads for a used car and got one a month later.  Sometimes I can't believe all that worked, but it worked out very smoothly.

5ZtSR0IQaa	Since you are familiar with guitars, you probably know how much quality instruments cost. I would start at $500 for a cheap shiamisen and go between $1,000 and $2,000 otherwise. Aside from web stores, stores in Japan are probably the better choices.<br>  <br>  As a popular instrument, the shamisen has a diverse range of styles. It's just like the guitar, played in the style of classical Spanish masters to buskers on the street. So yes, there are more vulgar versions of shamisen playing, but that doesn't make the instrument generically shameful to play.<br>  <br>  The shamisen has three strings (literally what the name "shamisen" means). The neck has no frets. The strings are plucked with a large pick called hatsu or bachi. I grew up playing the violin, so I'm not phazed by fretless strings, but I don't know how a lifelong guitar player would be up to the challenge. A tradition shamisen would use silk strings, but those are expensive and wear out quickly. Modern shamisen strings use soft material, often nylon or similar synthetic materials.<br>  <br>  A very traditional and expensive shamisen uses real ivory for the pegs, bridge, and pick. Those would be illegal to bring into America. But then, you can't buy a shamisen like that for $1,000, so it's not something to worry about if you want a starter unit.<br>  <br>  There are other stores, but you can also try:<br>  <a href="http://www.chordscanada.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chordscanada.com/</a>

AA12068233	It's like that with most cities. Some are worse, such as New Orleans and some cities as much, much cleaner, such as Seattle.<br>  <br>  The more people there are in one place, the more trash that will be produced. It's pretty simple.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	On some parts of town there are trash everywhere. EVERY CITY and state have a trash problem,  some people are putting it I the trash but the wind blows it away.

I am from New Hampshire and for the most part it was always clean everywhere and while living here in TN it is clean but man some spots are just dirty as all heck even smaller places, because while driving people just throw their empty cups and all of those things on the side of the road.

They just record the information in case you try to skip without paying.|`|aIakDSstaa	This happens in most hotels in the UK, they take your details iin case of damage to the room etc. I guess it depends on the sort of hotel, if its a little sleazy one I wouldn't want to hand it over either.|`|FCFdYuchaa	<a href="http://spa-thai-guide.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spa-thai-guide.blogspot.com/</a>|`|p8UAIAisaa	It is normal whenever you check into a hotel to give your credit card information to the clerk, that way they have the number to cover any incidentals such as movies, food , phone .. etc.. They never will KEEP your card, if they insist they do, than there is a problem|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	common practice- even in hotels in the USA.  The hotels will do a blank charge with your card- they'll give it back to you once they imprint it.  Then, upon checkout, they'll either charge your card for any meals, services, etc... you may have made.  If no charges are made, they'll return the charge slip to you.<br>  <br>  Not a scam at all...|`|d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	if you intend to pay by credit card they will take the first few days up front but will not keep your card.

Like many hotels, in Asia, Europe or USA, they require a credit card to be put through their accounting for incidentals, they will run an imprint of your credit card for incidentals and then when you leave you can either charge your credit card or pay cash for the items on your bill if any.  <br>  <br>  If they do require to keep your credit card, that is different.  Do Not let that happen, put up a cash deposit or something.  <br>  <br>  But, I think it's just the way they explained it to you or the words that person chose to you.  It's just a misunderstanding.  Please note that many Thai do speak english and they are taught english to the 6th grade but, conversational english is not openly taught unless they go to school for that.  So, be willing to ask for clarification whenever you have doubt about what a Thai person says.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have a good trip.|`|nhYABprkaa	never use your credit card in Thailand unless you absolutely have to.<br>  <br>  There is a credit card skimming device that is used to read your card and its attached to someones belt, looks harmless until you get your statement.<br>  <br>  Always let your credit card carrier know that you will be in a certain country and only accept charges from your home country and the counties you visit, that stops the clowns from selling your numbers, they only make $6 a day working in a hotel, but if they sell your credit card, they get $30<br>  <br>  Pay cash, use debit card at ATMs!|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Just tell them that you don't have one, but offer a cash deposit. For ID they will only need to see your passport. Most hotels are good but unfortunately, a few give the rest a bad name. If you feel uncomfortable that's fine. There are plenty of other hotels that will gladly take your business if you really don't want to part with your card information. Just get a receipt for the deposit.<br>  A major chain should be ok, a smaller locally owned hotel will be happy for cash as it's pure profit and needn't go through the books for tax purposes.<br>  <br>  Laundry is a bad excuse, that should be included in the price of the room.

Either book the hotel through an online agent or pay cash.|`|AA11960711	If this a 5 star Hotel then they will check your credit card but you will keep it.

Never allow them to keep your card. If they insist keep a deposit in cash, which will be refunded when you check out.

Just let them know that at the end of your stay you'll be more than happy to pay additional costs with cash only.  <br>  <br>  If they won't accept that, then before you hand over anything get them to put down in writing that they will only use your credit card for these additional costs and not any other costs.  That way if they do screw you, you've got it in writing (and signed) so you'll be able to claim fraud and get your money back.|`|YCKr2MWlaa	I travel extensively and in my experience it is standard practice in most hotels around the world. There is usually nothing to worry about. I always hand in my card when asked and have (touch wood) never had a problem.

NYC is not a very cheap place to eat out (I live here), unless you go to McD, Burger King, or any of the other fast food chains. Dinner at an average restaurant will cost about $20, and I'm sure you'll want to buy souvenirs for friends and family, so budgeting $40 a day should be good. <br>  <br>  End of May will be warm, but you may want to bring some light outerwear in case it gets chilly in the evening.

pA64PtGLaa	The two parks do have a few similarities, but they are incredibly different.  The short answer is that Glacier has rugged mountains, beautiful turquoise colored lakes, and (obviously) glaciers.  Yellowstone, though it does have some mountains, it is totally different.  It sits on a huge plateau, so you have alot more valleys and plains.  Being so much flatter isn't a bad thing though- it usually allows you to watch wildlife better.  Yellowstone is also the only place to see hydrothermal (meaing hot water) features like geysers and hot springs.  The two do share some wildlife species in common too, such as grizzly bears, elk, wolves, and moose.  However, you're much more likely to see a bighorn sheep or a mountain goat in Glacier, where as Yellowstone is one of the only places to see bison.  They both have amazing unique features to offer, and you should definitely make an effort to see both of them!  If you're having trouble visualizing these places, do an image search for both parks on Google.  I've also put the links for both park's websites below, which can be very helpful with planning your visit to each.  If you have more specific questions as you start planning, feel free to keep asking- I could talk about both of these places for days.|`|z28QboW7aa	First of all, I thoughts Yellowstone was amazing. I was just there in the summer and its great. Yellowstone has geysers, rivers, the grand canyon and alot awesome hikes. The views are unbelievable.<br>  <br>   I hear glacier is also amazing. There are no geysers in Glacier. Glacier has mts, rivers like yellowstone. glacier probably wil be less people, yellowstone wasnt really crowded during the summer. Yellowstone has so much more things to see. But both parks are very nice and fun. Researching will help you to decide what you like.

dA13XSbYaa	During World War 2, Korea was a single country under Japanese control and was considered to be enemy territory by the USA and Russia.  <br>  But after World War 2 ended in 1945, the winning side (USA and Russia) was allowed to divide up Korea into two separate sections. <br>  The Russians took over the northern part of the country (north of the 38th latitude parallel) and USA took over the southern part of the country. Under Russian guidance, the northern section developed a communist government. And under USA guidance, the southern section developed a democratic government. <br>  With two totally different forms of government, that is why they became two separate countries.<br>  During the Korean War, North Korea invaded South Korea hoping to convert the two Koreas into one Korea under communist rule. North Korea achieved early success in their invasion when they occupied nearly all of South Korea.  However, the United Nations sent troops that eventually pushed the North Koreans back to the 38th parallel where a stalemate was declared and remains in effect until this day.|`|CHCPnvksaa	For the same reason there's not just one whole Dakota or Carolina.

The United States is technically still at war with North Korea and is abiding by the cease-fire that was agreed upon by the two sides in 1953.  If American forces were to leave South Korea at this time, North Korea would probably invade and overthrow the South Korean government. Thus, as you suggested, the two Koreas would then be united as one communist country and would be a terrible enemy to the United States.<br>  You should read the book, The Korean War by Max Hastings.|`|mEcJUfEqaa	Their armies are big because all the men are essentially in the army.   But they have other jobs too, so they would join the fight but wouldn't be near as effective as the real active soldiers.   Plus, they both only have little navies and air force, so the number of men isn't that important.<br>  <br>  They will reunite one day, but right now the S. Koreans are growing their economy and don't want to have to support their poor northern neighbors.   One day the N. Koreans will kick out the dictators, then start trading to build their own economy, only then will anyone be interested in reuniting.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Short answer: Because they are still officially at war.<br>  <br>  Long answer: At the end of World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were still technically allies, although they mistrusted each other.  After Japan agreed to surrender, Russia and the U.S. agreed to share the duty of ensuring a peaceful withdrawal of Japanese troops according to the agreement. The Russians handled everything north of a line roughly deliniated by the 38th parallel of latitude and the U.S. handled stuff south of that line.  <br>  <br>  Between 1945 and 1950, relations between the US and Russia deteriorated rapidly and this shift was most apparent in an increasing of tension on the Korean peninsula.  On the 25th of June, 1950, the Russian and Chinese backed North Korean Armed Forces launched an offensive into the US controlled southern half of the peninsula. <br>  <br>  After 3 years of bloody conflict and tens of thousands of lives lost, an armistice was declared, with both sides returning to their respective sides of the 38th parallel.  Even after 50 years, the two halves of Korea are still at war with each other, although only rarely are shots fired.  A large reason I believe they have not made peace and reunified is due to the belligerent nature of the North Korean government.  <br>  <br>  The Kim regime have set themselves up a government where the dead former leader Kim Il Sung is regarded as a minor god and his son Kim Jong Il almost as much so.  If they made peace he would lose much of his status. Another contributin factor is that North Korea has a policy known as "Army First Politics". This means that the army gets EVERYTHING first.  Food, Money, Supplies, Medical equipment.  If Kim made a move to make peace and reunify, the chances of his own Army Corps trying to kill him are pretty high.  It wouldn't be the first time one of his Corps tried to stage a coup.  Good luck getting a guy who has indoctrinated 3 generations of his fellow citizens into worshiping him like a god under penalty of death or gulag to back down. Don't forget that Kim Jong Il invented the internet!|`|PClCEFQgaa	North korea has a communist governemnt system, while korea is against communism. So their government system would be completely different. There was a war fought for this reason, to keep communism away from South korea. And South korea has one of the better economies of asia, while North korea is very impoverished, so if they were to join, South korea would suffer greatly (more people to provide jobs and relief for). Also the U.S is trying extensively to stop North korea from making a nuclear bomb, but north korea will not. So if south korea joins with north korea, it could cause the partnership between the two nations to end. And even though they have the third and 4th biggest armies, think of the first and second biggest armies, they would be able to stop them dead. and also a complete, all-out conquest would shatter both nations economies. Plus now i the time when korea is rising and growing, so a war would stop their growth.<br>  <br>  <br>  gosh long answer!|`|LIxYGrqdaa	Only if China abondons its interests in north korea.

COWsSguVaa	It's expensive to live here. Especially Oahu, because it is one of the most developed and populated of all the islands. Just like the mainland, it is hard to get work here nowadays. Unless if you are a doctor or a nurse. Nowadays, hospitals are always looking for doctors or nurses. There is a big shortage. Besides that, it is very hard to find work. A lot of people are unemployed, just like that mainland. <br>  <br>  If you lucky enough to get a job here, the worst you can do is earn minimum wage , which is about 7 dollars an hour. Maybe you can afford to pay like 300 or 400 dollars a month if you live with a room mate. There are always good room mate deals on craiglist. <br>  <br>  It's a bad time to move here if you don't know where are you going to be working or staying. A lot of mainlanders move here thinking they will get a job right away, but they are still unemployed. <br>  <br>  I recommend you come and visit here, and see if you like it. Living here is nice, I love it. But I wouldn't have never moved here if I didn't get the job offer to move here. I am a medical doctor. I make about $245,000 a year, so I live quite comfortably. <br>  <br>  Maybe go to college first and medical school. Doctors live really well here.

The machines are looser, 21 can be played for as low as $2. Mermaids is awesome, we found at the Mirage and T Island you hardly got a drink and lost your money quickly but when we were in Mermaids, we had drinks coming left and right, got drunk quickly, still lost our money, but had a lot of fun doing it! Just catch the Deuce bus, $3 one way or $7 for a one day pass, great way to get around. If you dont go there, check out Harrahs and Wild Bills, both were fun. If you want a fun meal, go to Margaritaville, Jimmy Buffets restaurant. Also, Freemont st. had way better meal prices. Have FUN FUN FUN!!!|`|MUBMh3DEaa	It might be too late but I would consider a Cirque show. Some of them are fairly priced and every seat is usually a good seat.

Visit the Flamingo....they have a really cool wildlife exhibit.

I recently went to Las Vegas in June 2008 and had a great time! Being on a budget i would reccomend staying at some place like the Stratosphere they have hotel rooms for about $25 dollars a night! There are many public shops and places you can see in Las Vegas, you can look at all the Amazing architechture in some of the casinos like The Luxor and MgM grand. I would also reccomend going to Planet Hollywood cause it is really neat and has some great things to do! If your looking for some place to eat you should check out Paris Paris, some of there smaller cafes had great food!(im not sure if there is a lot of places cheap to eat in Las Vegas). for fun(if your a big gambler) you should defenitley check out all the casinos on the strip or you could check out circus circus, or even indoor bungee jumping. You will have a lot of fun, just dont go out alone on the strip becuase there were a couple of people cusing at people and stuff like that. <br>  Hope you have a great time!!|`|AA11759382	You might consider getting a Visiticket.<br>  <a href="http://www.visiticket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.visiticket.com/</a><br>  <br>  This card lets you get into most of the top attractions for one set price. you can buy 1, 2, 3 or 5 day passes.

irljnVkAaa	You can fly from Gatwick to Plymouth with Air Southwest, but it would be much easier to get the train. At Plymouth you would have to get a train back to Exeter, then a train to Barnstaple.This would take over two hours. The train from London would only take about three and a half hours.|`|UzPFTdUFaa	You can't fly to Ilfracombe or anywhere close from London's airports. You need to take a First Great Western train from London Paddington to Barnstaple changing at Exeter St Davids. Average journey time including the change at Exeter is 3 hours 30 minutes.

LgxVVDWraa	My first kiss was a guy from Quito, I liked how he always opened the door for me and said sweet things. The thing was, when I had met him we were with a group of friends so naturally I thought the normal thing to do was just talk to him since we were all hanging out together anyway.<br>  For some reason he seemed very confident in talking to me, saying that he thought I was a Mexican because he knew that there were pretty girls from Mexico.  <br>  Then I read in a book later that if I go up to a guy I don't know in Ecuador, they will assume that I am interested.<br>  I guess that explains it, but it worked out in the end afterall.<br>  <br>  Where I stay at now (in america), the guys don't open the door for you, the people are not as warm, guys think it's corny to say sweet things to me, they don't like to be romantic.<br>  So yes, that specific Ecuadorian guy I fell in love with.<br>  <br>  However, I met another guy from Guayaquil.  He turned out to be an womanizing asshole, all he did was talk to girls.  He seemed to think that I would believe all the corny things he had said, when I could tell he was lying and said those same things to a 100 girls before me.<br>  He was stuck up and seemed to act as though he is the boss of everything. He was only my friend, I simply talked to him to learn about the guy from Quito more but he insisted on dating me.<br>  <br>  He makes me sick.<br>  <br>  Ecuadorian girls are so warm as friends, and they are very polite.  If I say something they don't like, they politely change the subject or do something to correct me, which I need.<br>  <br>  I like the Ecuadorian hospitality, I like that when I around them I don't have to worry about being hungry because we share food together.<br>  <br>  Although the man from Quito said it's normal to ask before I take food, with my Ecuadorian friends that were girls they took my food without asking and always offered me things.<br>  <br>  It seems like Ecuadorian men are allowed to talk with many women, but Ecuadorian women don't talk with as many men as the men do with women.<br>  I don't like the idea of a Chongo, if my fiance goes to one of those I will leave him.|`|c8f6610b26c2b6770fcefdeeec88655baa	Ecuador es el país más bonito de toda Sudamérica.

d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	With the exception of pronunciation, Chinese IS easier for English speakers HOWEVER, genuine interest in a language can make it easier (or difficult, if you are not that committed). Because of the grammatical differences between Japanese and English, even SKILLED speakers of Japanese sometimes don't understand all the nuances of their statements. With Chinese, one can be sure most of the time that they know EXACTLY what they are saying.<br>  <br>  As far as which is useful, the answer depends on you. Everyone always says "Chinese", but that's not true. Both have potential to be useful OR useless. It just depends on your goals and interests. What do you want to do with the language? Are you more interested in Chinese or Japanese history/culture/travel/etc.? <br>  <br>  No one can really tell you which is more fun. It depends on your interests. For a tourist who knows NOTHING about Asia, the sites in China are probably more impressive to behold. If you know some history about the location and sites however, you can better appreciate both countries. <br>  <br>  Why not look up some of these famous places:<br>  China:<br>  -The Great Wall<br>  -Forbidden City<br>  -Teracotta Warriors<br>  -Leshan Buddha<br>  -Yungang Grotto<br>  -Potala Palace<br>  -Temple of Heaven<br>  -Three Gorges Dam<br>  -Wudang Mountains<br>  -Mount Tai<br>  -Yangtze River<br>  -Suzhou Gardens<br>  (Cities to look up: Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, Wuhan, Kunming, Xi'an, Turpan, Lhasa, Hong Kong, Harbin, Suzhou)<br>  <br>  Japan:<br>  -Kinkakuji Temple<br>  -Itsukushima Shrine<br>  -Genbaku Dome<br>  -Toshogu Shrine<br>  -Mount Fuji<br>  -Kotoku-in Temple (Kamakura Buddha)<br>  -Kiyomizu Temple<br>  -Himeji Castle<br>  -Korakuen Garden<br>  -Izumo Shrine<br>  -Ise Shrine<br>  -Onsen<br>  -Mount Aso<br>  -Mount Hiei<br>  -Mount Koya<br>  -Naruto Whirlpools<br>  -Iwami Ginzan<br>  -Koke-dera<br>  -Horyuji Temple<br>  (Cities to Look Up: Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Naha, Sapporo, Nikko, Kamakura, Matsuyama, Beppu, Takamatsu)<br>  <br>  In general:<br>  -Both have a lot of Buddhist temples <br>  -China has more Confucian temples<br>  -Japan has Shinto shrines<br>  -China has more stone-carving sites<br>  -Chinese has more old sites<br>  -Japan has castles<br>  -both have palaces<br>  -both have many gardens<br>  -both have modern cities with lively nightlife (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong - Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka)<br>  -China has more wildlife.<br>  -China is more diverse (many ethnic groups throughout the country. Tibet has its own culture, and Xinjiang feels more like the Middle East, because it is a Muslim area)<br>  -both have many holy (and beautiful) mountains<br>  -China has more nature (once again, also more diversity in these sites)<br>  -Japan is cleaner<br>  -Japanese food tends to be easier for foreigners to eat<br>  <br>  Those are some things to consider, but this is something you need to fnd out for yourself. You will make more progress if you know you are studying a language that you WANT to study rather than just learning a language because other people tell you to.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	For standard Westerners, learning Chinese is much easier than Japanese because of its similar grammatical structure to Western ones.<br>  <br>  In addition, Chinese who speaks Chinese are living all over the world and its population is more than 40 times to Japanese.<br>  <br>  You don't need to learn Chinese with any gender difference, conjugation, particles, ambiguous expression, unclear usage of words in Japanese  either. All you have to remember is Chinese characters and its pronunciation.<br>  <br>  In Japanese, you need to keep remember the combination of Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana all in one instead.<br>  <br>  Japanese is just only good to pronounce as it's like very simple less than Hispanic. <br>  <br>  China has its political and economical power in the world year by year.<br>  In addition, if you master basic Chinese, learning Japanese would be easier than starting to learn it from zero. No reverse is workable though.<br>  <br>  Talking about the fun place to go, it must be China because it is less expensive than Japan and the food is awesome ultimately if you don't mind most primitive style to eat and don't have any dislike to eat in the world.|`|VyJC1MNiaa	I would choose China.

Whether China controls the world in 30 years from now, it's undecided, but I doubt realistically that will ever happen so need not to worry.  As for Japan, their peaceful and don't really have an army, much like Canada.  I would say Japanese is the way to go, simply because the language to me is more beautiful, and I'm more likely to go to Japan more frequently than China.  I do know there is a booming trend for Japanese because of anime, manga, pop culture, etc... So if it were me, I'd learn Japanese, and quite a bit of the Japanese culture at that.  I would also recommend that you learn about the Chinese history and culture as well.|`|eAMbWkahaa	The problem is, no one can accurately predict the future.

PPsALPcfaa	There is no particular type to buy, but make sure which ever shampoo you buy, just pop it into a resealable bag, that way if it explodes or leaks, it will not go through all your stuff. <br>  <br>  Another tip for traveling, (if you are a tidy person this will work best) Go to a supermarket and buy a box of resealable bags, approx A4 size. When packing either roll or fold you clothes into the plastic bags. This way you can keep all your clothes neat and tidy while traveling and know where everything is. And also if anything leaks ar explodes, or even it is raining while your bags are loaded onto the plane, nothing should get wet. This may seem silly when you are packing, but it definitely works for me.<br>  <br>  Happy traveling!<br>  <br>  I.|`|fe1fb057c5c82b734b2027481e503befaa	I have been flying for 30 years and have never had a bottle explode.

AA11496012	There are different reasons why airplanes crash.  It can be pilot error, weather, structural failure, bird strike or a combination of factors.

In Mexico, just about any day is a reason for them to celebrate, wear costumes and dance in the streets or parade!!  You may have witnessed a school production, or perhaps a huge important wedding.  Nothing national falls on that date, so I'm going to say it was something the community planned.  Sorry.

fFnsJ7maaa	In some office at the Red Sox Foundation. According to a Globe article (Feb 2006): <br>  <br>  "Remember that glorious sign? It was the ''Reverse Curve" sign that was traditionally altered by spray paint to read ''Reverse the Curse," for the Red Sox. Once they won the World Series, some flexible person with a can of spray paint changed the tense to ''Reversed the Curse." Then, Governor Mitt Romney blocked Storrow to take down the sign in a photo op, and it was donated to the Red Sox Foundation, although the state had promised this very column that it would remain untouched."<br>  <br>  "We're glad it was taken down, for soon the sign will be auctioned or raffled off to benefit Teddy Ebersol's Red Sox Fields, a private-public partnership to rehabilitate the often flooded ball fields at Lederman Park on the Esplanade near the Longfellow Bridge."<br>  <br>  But it was never auctioned off.|`|hQWucH5uaa	It was removed while Governor Mitt Romney was still in office.

He also armed a group of guerrilla fighters, the fedayeen (self – sacrifices) who, between 1950 and 1956 killed more than 360 Israelis. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) was formed in 1964 under the leadership of Ahamad Shuqairir, who was a client of Nassar. This organization was established by Nassar in attempt to control the fedayeen groups, whom Nassar feared would drag Egypt into another war with Israel. <br>  The PLO was an umbrella organization, consisting of the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) and later the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) established in the 1960s and Fatah which was established in the late 1950s who held the belief that the only way to "liberate" Palestine was through the use of force.  King Hussein of Jordan strongly opposed the creation of the PLO, believing that the organization posed a major threat to Jordan  since most of its population was Palestinian. In 1968, the Palestine National Charter was established, calling for the destruction of Israel<br>  <br>  In 1969, Yassar Arfat, the leader of Fatah, took control of the PLO, due to the total lack of faith in Nassar’s leadership – for the past five years the PLO had proved ineffective due to its dominance by Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, in achieving its goals. The PLO now adopted violence as its key method to liberate Palestine. The PLO carried out terrorist attacks, with its headquarters based in Jordan.. <br>  <br>  edit: Ahamad Shuqairir was the first leader, but it is historic fact that Nassar was the man responsible to create the PLO, and that information is readily available with any search engine.  The things some people pick to thumb down here are astonishing.

You must also already have a job lined up. There is an online test you may take, to see if you even qualify to apply, and you must score a minimum of 67%. It also costs lots of money to apply and successfully immigrate, like in the tens of thousands. I assume you are a student, so you can apply for a student visa to be able to attend school here, but you will have to pay non resident/international tuition fees. Check the link I have included. <br>  <br>  Now, to answer your other questions:<br>  Best place to live is relative to what you enjoy. I like the country, forests, lakes, minimal amount of people, so I choose Northern Ontario as my now home. If you are young, and enjoy nitelife, you may want to opt for the major cities, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver....etc. We have excellent colleges, and there is no shortage of them. They  can be found pretty much every where there is people. It takes about 3 months for a person on a visa/new resident to be able to access health care. If you are here illegally, then obviously you will pay out of pocket for those services. The West coast tends to be the warmest part of Canada. Some parts of BC rarely see snow, and have a rainy winter instead. <br>  As I said before, you musty apply, and the wait list is rather long. A student visa is your best bet. Read the link thoroughly.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  The warmest place in Canada is Toronto,Niagara Falls area, Windsor in Ontario and all the southern parts of Ontario .<br>  All of our provinces have free Health Care.<br>  All Provinces have the best colleges and university.<br>  To become a resident is very hard as Canada is taking 3rd world countries rather then lst countries.<br>  There is a quota each year on how many new immigrants Canada will take.  You can apply for a student visa that will make you stay for a year or so just like in the USA.  Money wise it all depends what you are going to spend on.  <br>  Good Luck|`|D9zgZvpoaa	I live in Alberta. We have free health care but insurance is a little more costly. I pay 130 a month. Southern alberta, like Drumheller, is fairly warm. Kelowna BC is very warm most of the year. I have heard good things about SAIT and NAIT which are technology schoold in Edmonton and Calgary. the U of A is also good in Edmonton. And Grant McCewan. It really depends what you want to take. Alberta is the only place I have lived. the small towns, which are still fairly close to the cities are cheaper to live in then the big cities. You could find an apartment for 700-1000 a month. Food is about the same price as the states when you bring into account exchange and stuff. We also only have one tax in alberta which is 5%. most of the other provinces have more than one and are more. I am not sure how to become a citizen because I was born here but here is a link that might help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/citizenship/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/citizenship...</a>

To get a great price,<br>  <br>  My suggestions: <br>  1) Check-in on a week day and not a weekend. <br>  2) Check the convention calendar to make sure there are no major events in town. <br>  3) Book on time. <br>  4) Look for deals and promo codes. <a href="http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/special.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/special.p...</a> <br>  5) Remember you can cancel your reservation 48 hours before check-in and get a full refund.

The closer it gets to your trip, the more expensive the roomw will be unless you can get a good rate at lastminutetravel.com. Saturday night will always be the most expensive, so if you can come in on Sunday, your rates should be better. Right not there are some very good deals out there. Also go directly to the hotel site as well as other sites. sometimes the hotels have specials.|`|AA11875616	Yes, that would be true.  The hotels are hurting right now because the economy is bad here, so deals should be pretty good.  You just have to shop around.  Also, it doesn't pay to spend more at a prestigious hotel.  There are many really nice and reasonable hotels right off the strip or downtown.   Good hunting!|`|JLA2Wncfaa	Book direct though an offer check that it is fully refundable and book as soon as you can, if the rate drops after you book you can call the hotel and they will drop your rate, the worst thing you can do is wait partaicully if you use the method I have just said. <a href="http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/las-vegas-hotel-discount-codes-mgm-grand-nyny-luxor-plus-more/" rel="nofollow">http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2009...</a>|`|Ekrk11tZaa	Weekdays are much cheaper then weekends.<br>  Check <a href="http://www.smartervegas.com/hotels.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartervegas.com/hotels.aspx</a> for promo codes.|`|urHPuzMsaa	Weekends in Vegas are always crowded with people driving in from California. This drives the prices up. Come Sunday they all leave to drive back and leave the hotels empty. Always try to arrive on a Sunday or Monday and leave Thursday or Friday. <br>  <br>  Airfares are cheaper on Weds and Saturdays as business travelers book for Monday and Friday travel. So you have to weight the airfare prices with the hotel prices to get the best deal. Do you want to spend more on airfare or more on the hotel. It's great when you are flexible.|`|dFBccLExaa	The closer you get, normally the higher the price. You will want to check early on in the week, since many people book their hotel right before they leave, making the prices spike. And you will want to purchase online, since there are usually better deals online.

9y2Qd6aLaa	There is no One-Child Policy in Taiwan; like the first answer said, the government is encouraging couples to have children because rate of childbirth in Taiwan is 1.5.  <br>  <br>  China says it owns Taiwan, but Taiwan says it's its own country; Taiwan has it's own government.  Albeit, China says that Taiwan still belongs to it because Taiwan and China are in a "two government, one country relationship".  <br>  <br>  And to note, I do not believe that Taiwan thinks it has power over China or anything.  It just thinks that it should be an independent country and be able to be called one.  <br>  <br>  I hope nothing sounded biased.|`|8K5Aiqq5aa	haha... Taiwan is a free country baby. no, there ain't no one child policy in Taiwan, you can have as many kids you want. In fact, the Taiwanese government is putting in a stimulus plan to encourage people to have more children. i believe you get a check for the 2nd kid and onward. in other words, everytime you have a kid given that it is your 2nd or more, you'll get a paycheck!! anyways, this is done mainly because the population in taiwan is aging, and the govt is trying to revitalize the society by encouraging people to have more kids.|`|pqxuHVRLaa	I can't agree anymore for those answers before me.<br>  <br>  I'm a guy live in Taiwan,and I have a younger sister.<br>  how do you think ? <br>  <br>  one-child policy doesn't exist in taiwan at all.|`|7K3RcnNcaa	China says it owns Taiwan, but it exercises no government control over the place whatsoever.  Taiwan has its own elected government, currency, passports, armed forces, and every other characteristic of a legitimate sovreign government.<br>  <br>  Taiwanese people can have all the kids they want.  They are not subject to mainland Chinese law at all.  Except, of course, for the many Taiwanese people who live in China.  I believe that China only subjects its own citizens to the one-child policy.|`|adL8Qm7yaa	pstt no<br>  china does NOT own taiwan because the chinese laws have absolutely no effect on taiwanese ppl.<br>  in fact, the government of taiwan pays each couple 3000 taiwanese dollars to have a baby, as many couples dont really have enough money to support more than one kid's education.

That's also true for it's supposed ''bad'' neighborhoods. In Manhattan, it's especially true. There's so many cop's in Manhattan, to the point you're sick of it. Needless to say though, it's very safe. It's a big city, so naturally, they'll always be a few people who are up to no good, but that area in Manhattan is obviously one of the safest places, mostly do to it's upper-middle-class to rich nature. If you're only going to make a middle class income, and plan on having children, you'll either be living tight, if you move there, or won't be able to afford it.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	300 East 56th Street?

df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	Chinese buses are cheap and a good way to see the country.  Long distance buss es are air conditioned but sometimes people smoke, even when they are not supposed to.  The bathroom stops are not wonderfully hygienic but that is part of the China experience.  Some long-distance buses are "sleepers" and double-decker bunk-type beds, but if you want to see the country go by, travel in the daytime. <br>  <br>  Trains are more comfortable, they have bathrooms on board and you can walk around.  Hard seats are cheap, soft seats almost cheap. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend that you find a Chinese person your own age who would like to travel with you and show you the country.  Good interpreter, knows how to do things and already has a network of contacts.  <br>  <br>  Don't try to see all of China. Pick our a region or two and get to know it pretty well.  If you contact high schools ahead of time they will invite you to visit their classes, which can be a lot of fun and you make friends with the students and English teachers.

So somebody smart had to figure out how to find a way to measure things and keep them square with each other. He was Mr. P.

Could be that moving stuff by the river was useful too. <br>  <br>  One other neat trick on the great pyramid was how they leveled the building site. You know that thing is so level even today that it makes many of our buildings look crooked? Anyway, they built a square dam around where the pyramid was to be built and filled it up with a little water so that islands were formed.

AA11632370	I got the following from internet search:<br>  <br>  1. Pakistan: Urdu is the national language despite not being a native language or being the mother tongue of any native group in the country. English is the official language of Pakistan.<br>  <br>  Many other languages are spoken within the country including Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Balochi and Brahui. Most of the languages of Pakistan are part of Indo-Aryan languages family with Iranian languages most significant in west as well as Dardic languages in north & northwest.<br>  <br>  2. India: In the "Hindi belt", Northern India.<br>  <br>  a) 422 Million speaks in Hindi.<br>  <br>  b) 180 Million speaks in Bangla in West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, and Tripura.<br>  <br>  c) 74 Million speaks Telugu in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Orissa.<br>  <br>  d) 72 Million speaks in Marathi in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Goa.<br>  <br>  e) 61 Million speaks Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra.<br>  <br>  f) 52 Million speaks in Urdu in Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. The official language of the Republic of India is English, and its subsidiary official language is Hindi.<br>  <br>  3. Nepal: The majority (58.3%) of Nepali’s speaks Nepali, but by no means is it consistent throughout the kingdom. Generally speaking, most Nepalis in the central and eastern development regions speak Nepali fluently. However, there are many areas out west where people still do not speak Nepali. Most of this has to do with the fact that the development has been more intense in the central and eastern regions.<br>  <br>  Radio Nepal has since recognized about 7 primary languages and currently broadcasts news in all of the primary languages. They are Nepali, Newari, Hindi, Gurung, Limbu, Gorkha.<br>  <br>  4. Bhutan: The official national language, Dzongkha (language of the dzong). Traditionally, public and private communications, religious materials, and official documents were written in chhokey, the classical Tibetan script, and a Bhutanese adaptive cursive script was developed for correspondence. In modern times, as in the past, chhokey, which exists only in written form, was understood only by the well educated.<br>  <br>  Along with Dzongkha and English, Nepali was once one of the three official languages used in Bhutan. Dzongkha was taught in grades one through twelve in the 1980s. English was widely understood and was the medium of instruction in secondary and higher-level schools. Starting in the 1980s, college-level textbooks in Dzongkha were published, and in 1988 a proposal was made to standardize Dzongkha script. Sharchopkha, Bumthangkha, and Nepali also were used in primary schools in areas where speakers of those languages predominated. In 1989, however, Nepali was dropped from school curricula.<br>  <br>  5. Bangladesh: Bengali is spoken by almost all people across Bangladesh, which shares the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal with the Indian state of West Bengal.<br>  <br>  Although there are 38 different languages of Bangladesh, Bengali is far and away the most widely-spoken language in the country - an estimated 98% of the population can speak it and it enjoys the status of official language and the lingua franca of the nation. English is also widely spoken and understood especially in urban and tribal areas.<br>  <br>  Btw, I can speak and understand Bangla (my mother tongue), Urdu (Pakistani), Hindi (Indian), and English (lingua franca), but unable to comprehend anything spoken in Nepalis and Bhutanese language.<br>  <br>  Hope above helps.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	You are asking which language group, so obviously, the answer is "INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE FAMILY".<br>  <br>  Urdu (Pakistan), Hindi (India), Nepali (Nepal), Bengali (Bangladesh) are all Indo-European languages.<br>  <br>  Dzongkha (Bhutan) is a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family, and is related to Tibetan and Chinese than to Hindi.|`|5HPkIxZHaa	india, its mostly hindi, and bengali<br>  <br>  pakistan- its mostly punjabi and urdu<br>  <br>  bangladesh its mostly bengali|`|2f23751a5a49ab1f0bfb5390a26faa2baa	i am pretty sure most spoken language in india and pakistan is hindi. i dont know about other. you can try google it..|`|ab80d0264b289a4b7ce14e4fefa34b91aa	pakistan- urdu<br>  india- hindi (same as urdu but a few different words)

wVsjgj35aa	It enjoyed the covert support of Shin Bet for many years,but the relationship has apparently been terminated due to exposure in Haaretz. Apparently they were attempting to engender an enemy since by the late 80's the Zionist claim to being a David surrounded by great big gigantic evil <br>  Arab empires was wearing thin and in reality no longer had any factual basis; they had to look within for new enemies. They still claim be surrounded by hostile states however. Actually other than Syria all the surrounding states are U.S. allies: Jordan,Egypt,Saudi Arabia,and Lebanon. And they have refused to make peace with Syria. They continue to occupy the Golan heights. They were willing to return the huge Sinai to Egypt back in 1979 but for some reason they refuse to exchange the same pleasantries with Syria. I suppose it occurred to them they were running out of surround-sound enemies and it might make their endlessly repetitious propaganda slightly more credible if there remained at least one hostile state. But from the last pull-out from Sinai in 1982 they went charging into Lebanon and before you know it we have Hezbollah. No Hezbollah before the occupation,only after. Strange. But a "warrior state" must have someone to war with. Lately they've casting a wide net; now even far-off Iran has been suddenly looped in as a surrounded-by-enemies enemy,apparently because they maintain a nuclear power plant.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Note:  Israel tried to not permit Hamas to be part of the elections because of their war rhetoric.  It's the US that pushed for them (Bush is really "smart" now isn't he), & made the mess.  So, there is NOT WAY you can claim Israel wanted this.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  What's ignored is that Arafat walked away.  There were offers to build roads...so what if a few small spots (settlements are less than 5% of the terroritory land) were members of another country.  If peace was offered by Arabs, then everyone could start moving around freely.  Better yet they could join with Jordan & be even more viable.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered how the PA Arabs could work SO hard to avoid forming a country.  Choose constant war instead.  Then look themselves in the mirror as they justify whining to the world they they are suffering from the effects of their war.<br>  <br>  "dependent & subservient to Israel like Apartheid" is insanely obvlious to what Apartheid means, & is deeply insulting to those who lived under apartheid government rule.  It doesn't mean econmically & physically interwined countries.  They'd have their own government & do CURRENTLY.  Also, notably at the time PAs & Israelis were so economically dependent on EACH OTHER, that the intafada threatened to take down Israel economically.  So, at the time an intertwined offer was TOTALLY valid - it already existed.  Actually, many of the Arabs has moved into the Terrororties AFTER Israel acquired it because the economic ties with Israel made for better job oppportunities than Jordan or Eygpt.<br>  <br>  The Clinton offer did include part of Jersusalem.  Making it a captial is hardly the critical stopper to whether a country if "viable."  Right of return was discussed, however, then you have to work with the 900,000 displaced Jewish Arab refugees too.  It was discussed as finanical compensation, because sometimes it's just not practical to wipe out a country (Israel) in exchange for forming a new one (Palestine).  Anyone who wants peace understands that.  Anyone who wants Israel annihalted, makes the arguments your making.<br>  <br>  Hamas is NOT legitmate government.  They were elected to part of the governmennt (NOT all).  And lost their status when they did a miltary coupe to take over.  That's not elections & it makes them no longer legitimate but just hoodlems.  The whole world doesn't want to talk to them, so don't make that about Israel.  They don't recognize Israel, so they can't talk to Israel.  That's not Israel's fault.<br>  <br>  =====<br>  <br>  What's striking about your answer is that you are trying to blame Israel for Hamas's existence.  You aren't talking about how to make peace or ways to make it happen.  You are simplly trying to vilify Israel for Palestinian choices.  <br>  <br>  There is a predjudice at Arabs that they are barbarians who can't manage themselves & all movement forward is the responsiblity fo Israel.  I dont' subscribe to that predjuice.  However, apparently you've shallowed it.  Hamas makes it's own charter & it's own choices.<br>  <br>  If you want something better, stop swallowing the idea that only attacking Israel will bring it.  The Palestinians Arabs have a LOT of house cleaning to do.  For starters, either get the PLO/Fatah to clean up it's act (corruption) or find some political parties that know how to treat you right without making Israel wrong as their focus.  That "scapegoating the Jews" works well in the world because the world has done it before.  However, Arabs are better than that.  They can build empires, & real culture.  Time to start making it happen.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Tell Me<br>  Studies have show most suicide bombers come from upper middle class, & have no particular family connection.  They are recruited & kill themselves within 9 months - enough time for cultlike training, but not enough to get out before they are dead.  Many are doing honor killings on themselves as well- to save family face.  Studies showed it wasn't about "the situation" but overwhelmingly about personal issues that bring them to it -- a way to commit suicide but make it seem worthwhile.

The admission counters the 1994 Oslo Peace Accord between Yasser Arafat and Yitzchak Rabin, which envisioned the PA's guaranteeing security for Israeli by its wiping out terrorism in return for a new Arab state within Israel's current borders.<br>  <br>  In a summary of the PLO's defense, U.S. District Court Judge George Daniels said defendants argued that "subject matter jurisdiction is lacking because this action is premised on acts of war, which is barred under the ATA [Antiterrorism Act of 1991], and further is based on conduct which does not meet the statutory definition of ‘international terrorism.'"<br>  <br>  Abbas, usually cited as the chairman of the PA but he also a senior member of the PLO, has been designated by both outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his hopeful successor Tzipi Livni as a moderate.<br>   <br>  The court rejected the defense attorneys' arguments, stating that the terrorist attacks "do not constitute acts of war" and are within the definition of international terrorism. <br>  <br>  Middle East Forum director and Hoover Institution fellow Dr. Daniel Pipes commented that the PLO response in court is significant because the organization "publicly maintains it remains at war with Israel 15 after Oslo supposedly ended the state of war [and] four years after Mahmoud Abbas took over and supposedly improved on [Yasser] Arafat's abysmal record."<br>  <br>  He added, "The PLO argues, even in the context of an American law court, that blatant, cruel, inhumane, and atrocious acts of murder constitute legitimate acts of warfare."<br>  <br>  Judge Daniels stated in his ruling, "The use of bombs, under such circumstances, is indicative of an intent to cause far-reaching devastation upon the masses. The 'benefit' of such weaponry is its merciless capability of indiscriminately killing and maiming untold numbers in heavily populated civilian areas."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128180" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/N...</a>|`|J03Qy5aoaa	"Israel consistently undermines efforts to achieve peace.

Getting used to the dry air can take some getting used to. I've lived here 3 years and I still haven't gotten used to the dry air. <br>  <br>  UCLA is in a good part of town and has a beautiful campus. This is coming from a person that hates the Bruins. <br>  <br>  Compared to Minnesota you will be shocked at how much litter and graffiti there is. <br>  <br>  We have every ethnicity in the world and I love that aspect of LA because of our numerous ethnic restaurants. The people seem fine to me, although I'm from another big city that is just as materialist as LA. People that live closer to the beach tend to be more laid back than people farther inland. <br>  <br>  If you miss snow in the winter or like to snow ski than you can easily drive to Big Bear or Snow Summit. <br>  <br>  The traffic is the worst in the nation. It deserves its reputation. You also need to drive fast and aggresively. <br>  <br>  With the exception of Malibu, the beaches in Orange County are cleaner than in LA County. <br>  <br>  The beachcalifornia.com web site has some cool pics and info on the area. It is a tourist web site so they do make it seem like paradise here, it isn't. <br>  <br>  For all the faults here I have grown to love the LA area more than I ever did my home town.

People watch shows on TV and think that’s what it’s like out here. The “Real OC”, Newport Beach, The Hills, etc. Ever wonder why people in those shows never have to pay bills, do laundry, and are NEVER stuck in traffic? Because it’s FAKE. And the news doesn’t help either, since they know that sex and sensationalism sells. News flash: There aren’t running gun battles in the street. There aren’t shootouts every day. Also, you don’t see celebrities just walking down the street, all glammed up, or sipping a cappuccino at Starbucks waiting to sign autographs. We don't go surfing during lunch hour. <br>  <br>  Some sections are REALLY nice, others are “ghetto”. Too many people have this vision in their head that LA is one or the other (either Beverly Hills or Compton). They either think LA is a fairy tale fantasy or an apocalyptic ghetto. In fact, most of it is working class and middle class stiffs working to pay the bills. Like me.<br>  <br>  You NEED a car to live in Southern California. We don’t have an effective public transportation like New York or San Francisco. One reason is that LA is larger in area than either of those, without a central hub where everything is. Back in the 1960’s, we might have done it. But by the time local governments got their act together, it was much more difficult to make a working public transit system. Also, unlike NY, we have earthquakes, which make it a little more difficult to build underground. <br>  <br>  The freeway traffic is probably the worst thing about living here. The 405 is the worst. Know why they call it the 405? Because you go 4 o' 5 miles per hour, and it takes 4 o' 5 hours to get where you're going. Freeway Traffic is bad from 6-10 AM and bad from 3-7 PM. I don't know why they call it rush hour. It's more than an hour, and nobody's rushing, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  The gangs are the cause of many rumors. Keep in mind that there are gangs in any large town, in every part of the country. In LA, the gangs aren't really downtown, they are in South LA, East LA, and north Long Beach (an extension of the South LA gangs, actually). And here's the deal: Mostly, they just kill each other.<br>  <br>  Gas is expensive in California. It’s about 20-30 cents above the national average. <br>  <br>  Yes, gas and real estate are very expensive in SoCal. However, this would be the best time to BUY a house because it's a buyer's market right now. There are a lot of foreclosures, and too many houses on the market. <br>  <br>  Yep, freeways are a drag, it's smoggy in summer, and expensive to live here. Yet, if it's so bad, why do we have thousands and thousands of people moving here? <br>  <br>  Weather, Activities, Plenty of jobs, Beaches, mountains, deserts all within driving distance, and plenty of opportunity for those who have the skills and tenacity.<br>  <br>  In colder parts of the country, people keep their cars in their garages all winter. Kids get snow toys for Christmas. Here, kids get BIKES, scooters, and skateboards. 10 AM Christmas morning, the streets are FULL of kids on their new bikes, scooters, etc. <br>  <br>  The job market is good here, mainly because there are SO many people here that it creates its own job market. Then there are MANY industries, including tourism, entertainment, shipping, manufacturing, etc. It’s an incredible economy.<br>  <br>  However, it is not for everyone. Every time someone posts this question, you get the LA haters who post their bile and venom. A lot of them don’t know what they are talking about. Some people never even visit, and hate it on principle and stereotypes. Some actually visited once, and found out it wasn’t like it was on TV, and it certainly wasn’t Mayberry. And some actually lived here, and couldn’t deal with the expense, the traffic, or the somewhat impersonal nature of living in a large metropolis. To those I would say “good luck” to you wherever you are, but please don’t spew your hatred in this forum. <br>  <br>  As for lifestyle, it’s rather casual. You work during the week, and then go do something fun on the weekend, so that you can impress your coworkers around the water cooler on Monday. <br>  <br>  To summarize, LA a HUGE metropolis that really defies easy description. I live in one of the nicer suburbs, but the commute is no fun, often 1-2 hours each way each day. However, 340+ days of sunshine really helps. Yeah, it's expensive. Mrs. Obviousman and I both have to work to pay the mortgage. But is it worth it? You bet!|`|6upJQTcTaa	The weather is probably the best in all of the United States it doesn't snow at all and it rarely rains if anything it should rain more, the traffic is horrible it has a lot of traffic jams, the people are pretty nice the area where UCLA is at is awesome you will like it a lot just make sure you don't go to a bad area which are not near UCLA, the beaches are good|`|Q4sOO2Gvaa	The weather is nice for the most part. it gets cold on occasion, but never snow. the traffic is horrible, but with the right timing, you can avoid the congestion, or you can find alternate routes. The people are okay. mind you what you say and you shouldn't run into problems. The beaches are okay, but its ocean water so its always freezing, unless your willing to drive two hours to Lake Peris for warm waters. <br>  Good thing about the city is that if you go to the alleys of downtown on the weekends you can get super cheap stuff, like five dollar knock off shirts that would cost 30. Another god thing is that there is a chinatown, little tokyo, Plaza olvera, lots of museums and theme parks. <br>  bad thing, watch out if you plan on going to the suburbs. Compton is relatively safe, but don't go out at night. There is also a lot of evident poverty, such as all the homeless people and the children selling gums and bootleg movies. Also, try to avoid eye contact with thugs. Minorities can be very racist. But the city has been heavily cleaned up in these recent years. For the most part, you can do just about anything if you're with someone who can blend in with the crowd.|`|fa7e17ae5e79327378e35d3394cfed94aa	The campus area is wonderful. The parking will be rough though. In the surrounding area, there are mansions and huge houses. The rest of LA varies. There are some pretty hardcore spots that are filled with bums, gangs and overall just ghetto people. There are some nice areas. The good part is that you can say you live in Los Angeles, where the stars are from. If you just adventure out, you'll find that there is more to the city. You should really try to go to Universal Studios, Disneyland and Hollywood. Those are the major hot spots. As for clubbing, there are tons of poppin' bars and clubs all around the area. The lines will be long but well worth it. Don't be scared of the exterior of buildings, most of them are pretty awesome inside. Always go somewhere with a group. Make tons of friends in school. If you're staying on campus, it's really nice. Be sure to check out the gym, and the hall of fame. Get involved on campus, whether it's through sports or an organization. They have plenty of great sororities and fraternities out there that will not only help you have a family away from home but build on your professional skills as well. Oh and the beaches.. Newport is decent. Huntington is overrated. Santa Monica is beautiful and has rides and an atmosphere, but it is quite far from LA. Try to visit it though and maybe plan a road trip to Santa Barbara and down to San Diego. There are plenty of things to do and places to see.  Just be careful and try not to trust anyone. Hope you have a wonderful college experience. Oh, by the way, I've been to the University of Miami also. The weather over there isn't really the best. I really think you'll have a better experience in LA over Miami. It really just depends on your major and what you plan on studying.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The area around UCLA is really nice.  Westwood Village has a lot of shopping, clubs, restaurants and other student-oriented places.  I'd strongly suggest you live in the dorms (transfer students get one year) for the best experience.
vNeTmHu9aa	The entire Atlanta metro area has a fairly high crime rate.  The slightly safer suburbs are generally to the north of the city.  <br>  <br>  The quality of the college/university depends entirely on your program of study and what you put into it.  I graduated from Georgia State Univ., in the Robinson College of Business, which is ranked well.  I was an older, non-traditional, evening student, so I didn't attend any campus activities.  <br>  <br>  Clubs: there are some clubs, but I don't know much about them.  You can try metromix.com - maybe that site has some more info.  <br>  <br>  Weather:  the winter is pretty mild compared to some other places.  However, today (3/1) it is snowing heavily.  It looks like a winter wonderland outside my window.  I think there is about an inch of accumulation on the ground so far.<br>  <br>  One other big consideration about living here is that traffic is awful!  My commute to work is 22 miles, all of it is highway, and it still takes me nearly an hour each way because of the traffic and the people who don't know how to drive properly.|`|kF2TI78kaa	the cost of living is quite cheap you can find like a 3 bedroom house for like 180,000. i don't know aout apartments though<br>  <br>  <br>  crime....umm.....it happens every now and then ,im still safe in my house though :D<br>  <br>  entertainment-i say one thing..........i never get bored here :D<br>  <br>  weather!-usually it's pretty mild in the winter,sometimes we get like a really cold week,but it barely happens....and i think it snows like once everyone 1 or 2 years...depending<br>  <br>  <br>  overall-it's great here,and i haven't died yet :D|`|NlU0GJ75aa	Oh, of course Georgia has music and protestants.

Plus you have to be back to check in for an international flight almost 3 hours ahead of time. <br>  The airport does have tons of things to do there with great resterants and stores.<br>  There is Haritage Park in Taylor<br>  Greenfield Village in Dearborn (will cost about $30)<br>  Losts of shoping in Allen Park, and Taylor(southland), and in Dearborn there is Fairlane Mall<br>  By Fairlane there is the Henery Ford Estate, great for a quite picnic lunch (great places to eat along Michigan Ave.)<br>  I suggest going to AAA and getting a trip tick|`|dv8267AAaa	Malls etc...|`|JMVkZJzUaa	Run for your life!|`|EnMB5V7eaa	Most likely your layover is at Detroit Metro, which is an enormous airport. It is several miles from any attractions and is located in Romulus, MI off of I-94. All things considered I would say that 5 hours would not be enough time to navigate the large terminals out, find a cab to take you somewhere and find a cab back and navigate the terminals again. You'll see what I mean when you get here. Google maps: Romulus, MI<br>  <br>  There are actually some really nice restaurants inside the airport. <br>  <br>  If you felt confident that you can pull this off, Id say catch a cab to Greektown in downtown Detroit. Eat some fantastic Greek food at The Parthenon and check out the casino. Someone will be able to get you a cab back to the airport from there. This round trip experience should take maybe 3 hours. Its 30 minutes from the airport to Greektown and that allows for an hour at The Parthenon and then an hour or so at the casino. This would be pretty ironic considering you're on your way to Greece proper. <br>  <br>  There are other things in the area down there like the Detroit Science Center and the Detroit Institute of Arts, but these are day adventures. <br>  <br>  I hope this information helps.|`|VmiLwLt7aa	Your not going to be able to check out Detroit or the nicer suburbs. As others mentioned you will be in Romulus. If you want to escape the airport go down Merriman Road (North) past Ecorse Rd there is an Italian Restaurant that is nice on the right side. Don't remember the name of it but its the only decent thing I've found in that white trash redneck *** region of the suburbs. If you are flying Northwest or transferring through McNamera terminal, I'd just stay there, its new and nice and has plenty of restaurants.|`|qTS0SX48aa	my goodness. :]<br>  <br>  for restaurant: Cheli's Chili bar(owned by Chelios of the Detroit Red Wings) best burgers.<br>  <br>  Also, go to Greektown. Pegasus is the best restaurant there.<br>  <br>  I would just go around and sight see. Take a car, i would not walk if i were you. Take a ride on the people mover. See the FIllmore theater, Look at Comerica Park.

72hMibsVaa	an average of 100 per day.   food is expensive.  even mcdonalds is higher than where you live i am sure... on disney property, a big mac meal is 8$ <br>  <br>  food at the parks average 9$ per meal per person.  if you eat 1 meal there, and one at McDonalds, that is almost 20$ just for 2 meals, plus sodas of 2.-2.50 per bottle and you may drink about 5 a day.  Food at the hotels is outrageous.  <br>  <br>  Depending on what hotel you are staying at.  Some have Arcades.<br>  <br>  Downtown disney host disney quest *35+$ per person to enter, and cost of food inside, but once inside, all games are free except for the little arcade type games that you see at restaurants and stuff with stuffed aminals, and dvd's, etc in them.  <br>  <br>  the movie theater is 9$ per person I believe plus cost of snacks which are 7$ for popcorn and 15$ for a large popcorn and soda.  nachos are 7$ each I believe also. <br>  <br>  there is also Circus Solie'   which is expensive, house of blues, etc.<br>   <br>  You may manage on 50 a day, but it would be hard if you are a big eater.  Even if you got the food package on your ticket, it only covers about 50$ of food at parks and hotels only.  Not at privately owned restaurants ie... wendy's mcdonalds, etc.|`|3eRDHl4Saa	$400-$500. It's good for souveniers and food. Foot is pretty expensive in the parks, and so are refreshments like ice cream, drinks, and snacks. If you're planning on buying a lot of nice souveniers, then this amount should work for you. Also, if you're planning on going to any 18+ clubs, you will probably need money for admission. Two weeks is a long time. I guess if you only have the Flexi Ticket, you're not planning on going to Disney. But if you are, I recommend making dinner reservations for every night you're there. This way you always have a place to eat. Even if you decide not to go to your reservation, you can just skip it. I only think you should make dinner reservations and a few breakfast reservations. When I'm at the parks, I usually either eat at quick-service restaurants or skip lunch altogether because I'm too preoccupied. This is at any theme park.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have fun!|`|p1dcw35Qaa	I'd bring $300 in cash and $300-$400 in travelers checks. You won't NEED to spend that much but it's better to have it and not use it than need it and not have it. Make sure you write the travelers check numbers down and keep track of which ones you used. Universal and Islands of Adventure have a $22/day meal deal that may be good for you. You can go to the Universal website and check out the details. If your going to eat lunch and an early dinner in the parks (they close at 6 on most days), it's worth the money. You can buy the deals each day in the park (there's no discount for online purchase so you can decide each day if you want to buy it).|`|RM3vIeDVaa	I'm from the UK and was 21 when I went there for 3 weeks.<br>  I spent about ￡1500!! you buy everything when its your first time i.e photos, key rings, etc.<br>  <br>  Also the drinks around the parks and add up and you will get thirsty....|`|AA11297266	You will spend every penny that you can lay your hands on - there will never be too much - believe me!|`|AA11349881	Depends,i'd say $600|`|IxQbHeHnaa	when i went 2 orlando for 2 weeks i was 19 and i took about $600 with me. i am goin again this year and am takin roughly the same! r u not getting any disney passes?|`|qNmDtXY1aa	3-400$

Qtys8AiTaa	People overreact about customs. It *is* strict. And Australia will be just as strict. But just remember this:<br>  <br>  Declare all food and animal product items. Don’t bring an apple or fruit item off the plane. It is much better to be upfront and to tell the officers. Some food (eg bags of crisps, food in sealed packets)  is often ok but you need to declare. <br>  <br>  You get fined $200 automatically if you are caught with certain items. Don’t worry too much. Just declare. <br>  <br>  Oh, and regarding cigarettes – if your friend was charged that much for cigarettes they were considerably over their duty free limit. I think the limit is 200cigarettes – so this is generally one box (as in, a box with 10 packets). Just read up on the duty free restrictions before you go. <br>  <br>  I can’t actually comment about the quality of the seats, although I know a few people who travel business regularly (lucky ducks!) and really do prefer it over some of the other airlines – Qantas and BA particularly. Although, I am not sure I know anyone who regularly travels via the US. Most are via Asia.

But when nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or even as an ambulance driver, his brother Roy, who worked at a bank in the area, got a temporarily job for him at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio through a bank colleague .[17] At Pesmen-Rubin, Disney created ads for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters.[18] It was here that he met a cartoonist named Ubbe Iwerks.[19] When their time at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio expired and their both were without a job, they decided to start their own commercial company.[20]<br>  <br>  In January 1920, Disney and Iwerks formed a short-lived company called, "Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists". However, following a rough start, Disney left temporarily to earn money at Kansas City Film Ad Company, and was soon joined by Iwerks who was not able to run the business alone.[21] While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on cutout animation, Disney took up an interest in the field of animation, and decided to become an animator.[22] He was allowed by the owner of the Ad Company, A.V. Cauger, to borrow a camera from work, which he could use to experiment with at home. After reading a book by Edwin G. Lutz, called Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development, he found cel animation to be much more promising than the cutout animation he was doing for Cauger. Walt eventually decided to open his own animation business,[23] and recruited a fellow co-worker at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Fred Harman, as his first employee.[23] Walt and Harman then secured a deal with local theater owner Frank L. Newman-arguably the most popular "showman" in the Kansas City area at the time-[24] to air their cartoons — which they titled "Laugh-O-Grams" — at his local theater.[24]
db4364cbdfee80cd73b4e6424bc57dfdaa	The two cities were already the capital of Brazil, Salvador was the first capital in the colonial period and Rio de Janeiro was the last capital of the colonial period.  Both received great coming contingent of black slaves of Africa in Diaspora.  In Salvador that happened because of the proximity of Africa, in the Rio de janeiro the slaves came to serve the King of Portugal that fled to Brazil during the invasion of Portugal for Napole?o Bonaparte. The two city has a great architectural collection originating from of the colonial period, in Salvador a larger number of historical buildings exists.  <br>  The two cities have intense cultural life.|`|AA10355279	Salvador sucks.<br>  Rio is amazing.|`|c844e94379547d7dc8e712d6f28b9e05aa	Well.<br>  I can tell something: in Salvador you must to know a friend to guide you to the real nice places. (and they are not the postcards ones)<br>  <br>  In Rio you can go to the postcards places, but have to walk away with a brazilian friend to not be robbed.<br>  <br>  You can enjoy in both if you be guided well.<br>  Both of them, there are nice attractions<br>  ;)|`|gd93aAH7aa	They are quite similar cities. Salvador de Bahia has a lot of history of the Arts: Music especially...rio is fun if you go during carnaval, but salvador also has their own carnaval too.
POzCKBzvaa	Toronto could be -30 in the winter to +40 in the summer months (particularly July and August. <br>  That's -22 and 104 F respectively. I would think all three would be similar but not 100% sure. I live 2 hours from Toronto and have all my life.|`|D9zgZvpoaa	July and August are the warmest. It can reach up to 35 degrees celcius. Average is 30 I believe. It can get cold too though to like 15-20. This is all in celcius<br>  <br>  I pasted a good link in to look at some weather trends and festivals around that time|`|WWlUrwJxaa	www.weathernetwork.com is your best bet.|`|Twzg9s0caa	They would be around the same as any northern us city like NYC or Chicago.|`|MIqdsUdnaa	I'd just like to offer a correction to mummyof1...  In winter is gets a heck of a lot colder than 15-20 degrees C.  It's more like minus 20-30 degrees C, not including the windchill.

Don't drive because parking in Philly is crazy and getting your car towed there is no joke.|`|AA11383464	Greyhound bus, BOLT bus or one of the chinatown buses...I suggest the Chinatown buses because they go from center city to basically the verizon center in DC fast and cheap|`|xo2xyl78aa	There are a bunch of buses.

I bring as many of the LV in-room magazines home with me as I can on each trip. The only coupon I can find for the Carnival World Buffet(from 07-08) is from December 2007 and it was not for $$ off it was for a "free steak" with your lunch or dinner buffet. You still paid full price, but the steak was free(uh okay), not such a great deal since with most buffets the steak is included. At one time >before Harrahs took over< you could ask at the security podium in the casino and they usually had coupons for the buffet, not anymore. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a good value buffet, walk next door to the Gold Coast or take the free shuttle from the Gold Coast over to the Orleans. Those two along with Main Street Station are IMO, the top three "value" buffets in all of LV.<br>  <br>  ~Jack~|`|2b7305d1c95ef00f36adb96e6bd2ca68aa	Never game *me* a coupon the many times I've stayed there.

When I stay at Rio, I usually go across the street to the Gold Coast if I am in the mood for a breakfast buffet.

The seafood buffet or the Carnival World buffet?<br>  <br>  Well...honestly...I guess it doesn't matter, because the answer is the same for both:  No.  They don't AUTOMATICALLY discount it for hotel guests.<br>  <br>  However....<br>  <br>  If you ask at check-in, they MIGHT give you a discount coupon.  Or...if you're a member of the players' club and you play enough, they might comp you for it.  <br>  <br>  Also, in the free magazines that are flat-out ubiquitous around Vegas, there are usually $5 or $10 off coupons for the Rio's buffets.

It's a really cool water park, but I don't think they would be open during March, but I wouldn't know. Anyways, you could go shopping. There were bunches of stores to shop around. =) Sea World was awesome as well, but you can't swim with dolphins there, that is a different kind of Sea World that is not located on International Drive. Oh, you should check out the dinner shows there, they are really awesome and they do awesome stuff. But, the food wasn't great, but the show made it worthwhile. =) But it is kind of expensive, but like I said, it is really worth it. There are three different shows and I've seen two of them. One word: AWESOME! Anyways, I hope you enjoy your time. Have a lovely day and God bless.|`|72hMibsVaa	sleep and the pools.  take you downtime day for rest.  you will need it before you do Disney.

Write in your journal each night after you return to your hotel too.. Years from now, you will thank me, because written in that travel journal will be some of the happiest and most memorable times of your life.. Enjoy it all...

2HETgiwgaa	In most cases, you can just kayak for free.  DOC (the Department of Consveration) would be a good place to check for a specific area, if it is national park or other conservation land.  Generally, it's not illegal to have campfires on beaches, except at times of high fire risk - the local regional council should be able to tell you when there are fire bans.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Ask in the New zealand section your on theAustralian one. But as for kayaking go for it but use sense I used to have a canadian Canoe and was going into the sea and the life guard said no way Or else he will be bringing my body back . If you go down the wanganui river where you can't get off apart from some banks and overnight camp areas then you are suppose to tell the ranger or sign in and out it takes about 3 days from taumaranui to Pipiriki but if your just having a kayak say on the river at hamilton or somewhere you can get on and off ok then thats good
54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	I live in a suburb of Windsor, ON (just across the border from Detroit), and the city has a great selection of cigar shops.  My personal favourite is La Casa del Habano, located in the heart of downtown Windsor.  Here's the rest of the details:<br>  <br>  Address - 473 Ouellette Avenue<br>  Telephone - (519) 254-0017<br>  <br>  Casa del Habano on Ouelette is part of the Cuban government's officially licensed distribution company. The cigars there are authentic and well-kept in a walk-in humidor.<br>  <br>  They used to have a very nice smoking lounge, but the Ontario government's smoking ban outlaws smoking even in tobacco shops. Now it's just a nice area in the back.<br>  <br>  Stay away from any convenience store cigars. They're probably fakes and even if they're not, they're not keeping the cigars at the proper humidity.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the cost, but if you call them up I'm sure they could give you a quote.|`|yo65rDLDaa	cuz canada has free trade with cuba.. a box go for about 30 bucks|`|WWlUrwJxaa	Gl man!

AA10024451	If you are the sort who wants to experience "everything" (shows, parades, and rides of ALL types), then you may want to consider a good 7-10 day vacation time. This would include time spent in each of the 4 theme parks as well as Downtown Disney also. <br>  <br>  If you're one who could care less about shows and parades and just want to do the rides, a solid 7 days should be more than enough time to do the best stuff in each theme park (multiple times, even). <br>  <br>  "Must-See" attractions per park: <br>  <br>  MAGIC KINGDOM: Space Mtn, Splash Mtn, Big Thunder Mtn Railroad, Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, Tomorrowland Transit Authority, Peter Pan's Flight, Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Mickey's Philharmagic, Snow White's Scary Adventure<br>  <br>  EPCOT: Spaceship Earth, Soarin', The Seas w/Nemo & Friends, Test Track, Mission: Space<br>  <br>  HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: Rock n' Roller Coaster, Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, Toy Story Midway Mania, MuppetVision 3D, Great Movie Ride<br>  <br>  ANIMAL KINGDOM: Expedition Everest, Dinosaur, Kilimanjaro Safaris, It's Tough to Be a Bug, Primeval Whirl<br>  <br>  Generally, though.......you will NOT need to spend an entire day in just one park, unless you literally want to examine every nook and cranny of everything you see. Some rides or places will undoubtedly not appeal to you to try, or for you to walk into. The ONLY reason when you would want an entire day in a park, that I can think of, is if you happen to be visiting Disney World at a particularly busy time of year in which the lines for the attractions are long. THEN, you may take the entire day just to see the things you want to see. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  For us, typically we NEVER spend an entire day in just one theme park. We never need to because everything we personally enjoy seeing and doing we can get through in just a few hours (this is especially the case in the Animal Kingdom park which has the fewest "must see" attractions that make our list). For us, every day of our vacation is a park-hopping day. We'll do a few attractions in this park, then head over to another park for some of the attractions there, and may hit a third park or even go back to the first park we went to. (We don't do the parades or live shows, so that helps us move things along.)<br>  <br>  For us, this is how we do it (generally going to 3 parks in a day, and maybe all 4 on our last day): <br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom - 3-4 hours at most<br>  Epcot - 2-3 hours at most<br>  Hollywood Studios - 2-3 hours at most<br>  Animal Kingdom - 2-3 hours at most|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Assuming you have never been before, you will probably need 2 days at Magic Kingdom, 1 day at Hollywood Studios, 1/2 day to 1 day at Animal Kingdom, and 1 day or more at Epcot.  If you get into the back section of Epcot (World Showcase) and really enjoy it and want to explore all the countries, you may need an extra day.  And like you said, this will allow you see most things, maybe not everything.  But this is a good plan for most people.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	if you plan on going to all 4 theme parks then you should go for at least 4 days. thats one day for each park. <br>  <br>  and personally i think magic kingdom is well worth 2 days. <br>  so if you decide to go to magic kingdom  for 2 days then you would need 5 days.|`|72hMibsVaa	you will need 1 day per park.  especially if you like doing rides at Magic kingdom, Hollywood studios, and animal kingdom. <br>  <br>  Epcot takes about 3 hours to do Future world, you want to do ride spaceship earth later in the day,  first thing of a morning, it is packed.  a line to get to the line to get to the line that takes you inside.  in other words 40+ minutes wait early in the day.  Test track, Mission Space, Universe of Energy (if open i think it is closed for renovations) Honey I shrunk the Audiance, Living with the land boat ride, (Electric Umbrella is closed for renovations) Innoventions takes about an hour to go through and do everything there is to do there, NEMO ride is a must do.  it is so cool, and don't forget to take the young ones to see Turtle Talk at the Living Seas area. the rest of the day to do World showcase.  Showcase is about a mile round and so much to see and do.  there are shows, food, and sometimes concerts.  Don't miss American Adventure show. and if you like fish, stop by the fish hut at the UK.  <br>  Germany has a buffet takes about 2 hours of you day, and if you are lucky, there is a floor show.    Sorain is a must at The Land pavillion.  Get a fast pass, or the wait line is up to 120 minutes or 2 hours.  <br>  <br>  fast pass avaiable for Test track, Mission Space, Soarin at Epcot<br>  <br>  SpaceMountain, Splash Mountain, and Thunder Mountain railroad, buzz lightyear, and the new Stitch ride at Magic kingdom<br>  <br>  hollywood studios - rock and roll rollercoaster, tower of terror<br>  <br>  animal kingdom, i am sure the Expadition Everst is fast pass, but most everything else is not. <br>  <br>  Fast passes are avaiable 1 at a time up to 30 minutes prior to your first one.  This helps to make sure that you are not to be in 2 places at one time. <br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom is where the rides are.  90% rides.  I love the Haunted Mansion, People Mover, and some of the attractions in the people mover area.  and space mountain roller coaster is in that area with the people mover.  I also like the water ride (splash Mountain, and don't forget thunder mountain railroad)  You may not get it all done in one day at Magic kingdom if the park is busy and crowded.  You wait in line between 30 min and 2 hours for some rides.  also check out the updated Hall of Presidents.  It should be reopened by now.  <br>  <br>  Hollywood studios that are some things to do like the Rock and Roll roller coaster, tower of terror, the new lights camera action car stunt show, and don't forget to stop in the new American Idol.  Be sure to do the Great Movie Ride.  my favorite attraction there.  Little Mermaid show. it is a live action show.  There is quite a bit to do there. <br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom, go early in the morning to do the Safari ride if you want to see the animals.  A bugs Life, and all the other rides.  I seldom go to AK as it is not my favorite park.  Takes about 4-5 hours to do that park if you do everything. There is the new roller coaster there.  I hear it is awesome, but I don't do roller coasters.  That comes from a friend who does do them. There are some rides in the back of the park Can't remember the names of them, but that is the rides my daughter likes.   <br>  <br>  If you have a tendency to get sea sick, don't do Mission Space the original version, do the modified version.   <br>  <br>  Make sure you get your souvioners.  I prefer to do my shopping at Mouse Gear at Epcot.|`|LsAArkUyaa	7-8 "park days" at least<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom: 2- 2 1/2 days<br>  Epcot: 1 1/2-2 days<br>  Animal Kingdom:1 day<br>  Disney Studios: 1 day<br>  Water parks and Disney Quest : 1/2 day each.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	I would say 7 days, you can see and do everything. Have a magical day.|`|NmqODUw8aa	Well, I've gone to disney world many times, and I found 4 days didn't cut it.<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom was great! Although, we had to go back a second time for Mt. Everest, because it was closed, and we had no fast passes. I would suggest one or 2 days.<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom was a mistake to go to every time except once. you MUST look up the weather, or else you will be rained out!! 2 days, probably.<br>  <br>  Epcot is easily seen and toured if you go for dinner. There is a great buffet in Germany that is very yummy! I would suggest going on fast-track (the line may fool you, but it moves quickly).

IddUz8kyaa	In the 17th Century, French missionaries arrived in Vietnam. The Catholic priests received a friendly welcome from the Vietnamese people and they were allowed to live and work in the country. However, the Vietnamese authorities became concerned when the missionaries began to recruit the local people to Roman Catholicism. The converted Catholics were told to abandon their religious customs including that of taking several wives. The missionaries also instructed their followers to give their loyalty to God rather than to their Emperor. Hostility towards the Christian missionaries grew and over the years there were several cases of priests being murdered.<br>  <br>  In 1847, French troops were sent to Vietnam to protect the Catholic community. News soon got back to France that Vietnam would make a good addition to the French Empire.<br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWvietnam.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW...</a><br>  <br>  because france wanted to trade with inner china. they wanted to take vietnam because they thought that they could get to china through there, but they realized that they couldn't after the colonization was already complete. this was due to very high waterfalls. <br>  <br>  france also wanted rubber, which was made by burning the sap from rubber trees found in vietnam. at first they traded with the vietnamese. this was an extra incentive, besides route to china, to colonize vietnam. <br>  <br>  france also used social darwinism. charles darwin wrote a book called "origins of species", which promoted a theory called "survival of the fittest". the europeans then decided that the most "fit" nations should rule the other "unfit" ones, which is what france decided to do with vietnam. this craze which swept across europe is known as "social darwinism". <br>  <br>  france also thought that they were doing vietnam a favor. <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_did_France_colonize_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_did_France...</a><br>  <br>  France colonized Vietnam because of it's growing interest in the region since the begnining of the Nguyen Dynasty in the early 1800's. The First Nguyen Emperor, Gia Long, and his next four successors were against French involvement in Vietnam. Their persecution of Catholic missionaries was the excuse France used to invade and occupy Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to create the French colony known as Indochina.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070128152314AAEUVNa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|CeI47C72aa	Rubber plantations.<br>  <br>  All of the major countries had colonies.

You have to have some sort of customer relations in dealing with the public. This is when 'the customer is always right' comes in. The best thing to do is to come and go to school and while you are doing that all the while look for a job and seek about permanent residence.  To be a permanent residence you would have to show that you can support yourself among other things.<br>  <br>  Is is not that difficult to get jobs providing you have the relevant qualifications or the necessary work permit.  The best thing to study and get a job in is nursing.  There is always a shortage of nurses in Barbados since we hire non-nationals all the time.  This is the one of the easiest ways to live here. <br>  <br>  Tourism jobs can be seasonal since the influx of visitors is the winter season or a special event like cricket.  Right now we have 100% occupancy in many hotels because of that. <br>  <br>  Going to school here is not that hard you just have to dedicate yourself to getting high grades and passing them. Studying is about regurgitating in most cases. <br>  <br>  Some people choose marrying a Barbadian to stay here but they still have to wait for their papers.  I am not advising you to do this just telling what people do.  The 6 months here is just what they will stamp in your passport as a visitor.  The student visa will be for longer.

It's Thursday here in the United States and it's Friday in Australia.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	No, because it takes so long to check luggage, get through security, etc., that the trip is more than 3 hours, even if the flying time is less.  That's a joke.  Seriously, I have flown it, in both directions, and the flying time alone is more than 3 hours.

HMBwly76aa	Go to the doctor, ASAP!!!!!!! If it's an infection, it won't go away by itself!!!!!!!  Go get medicine fast. I traveled once sick and it was really really painful. I felt my ears were about to explode, no kidding. Also, drink plenty of fluids, tylenol or something to diminish the pain, and honey/lemon for the cough.  Seriously, I know it's a pain going to the doctor before traveling, but really go. Besides, you may get better while you are on the trip rather than just waiting for it to go away.  Good luck!!|`|i1Q7tMuuaa	DO NOT fly if you can! It is extremely painful. My mom and I both got sick in Hawaii and on the way home, we both according to our doctor perforated our eardrums.(google it if you want..it sucks) You cannot hear the same for up to many months. It took me about 2 months to hear clearly again. <br>  <br>  If you must fly, make sure to get some decongestants like Sudafed and a nasal spray or something to keep all that stuff open. I just re-read your question and you didn't specify that you were flying but if you are be careful. If you're just going on a driving trip, drink plenty of water, rest and just do the normal cold medicine till you get better. Feel better soon!|`|06d3195df0f0d6445a6388f30a77e76caa	nyquil and bed rest
VjPnHxZyaa	If you want to get away for a really romantic dinner try flying fishbone.  www.flyingfishbone.com you will need a car or to take a Taxi to get there, but such a terrific, romantic place to dine.  You can sit actually at the waters edge.  Ask for a table near the water and make your reservation near sunset.  The view and the sunset are spectacular.  There are so many great places in Aruba to dine, and being in the high rise area where your staying you won't lack for entertainment.  There is one place I suggest you go for cocktails at sunset.  It is called Pinchos, it is on your right on a pier as your heading into town from the airport.  Billowing white drapes and over stuffed teak furniture await you under starry skies.  Great romantic place to take in a drink. It will be on your left after the first turnabout from the airport.  You can always rent a car for a day and tour the island by yourselves.  Head on up to the lighthouse or drive down to baby beach.  You can't get lost and it is really an adventure.  For really good information go the the following websites www.visitaruba.com  or  www.aruba-bb.com  these are the two most popular websites to get your questions answered.  The folks on these two boards are very knowledgeable and will answer any of your concerns.  Congratulations on your upcoming marriage and have a wonderful time in Aruba.|`|7jhR6r5waa	The Hyatt is a great place, beautiful grounds. You are at the high rises and are lucky enough to be able to walk to a lot of places. The Hyatt has some pretty good restaurants on site. There are lots of water sports if you want. The Dinner cruise with DePalm (I think) is really nice. You get dinner, drinks, and a cruise up and down the coast which is very pretty as long as the wind is not too bad. Make sure you go downtown just for sightseeing. You can take a jeep tour, a 1/2 or full day sightseeing tour (I think the 1/2 day is plenty). You can do the  bar hoppping party bus which is really fun. You can go online to Aruba.com and look for things; your concierge at the hotel will be very helpful.  There are some really good restaurants in your area. The Marriott is very nice.  Moomba Beach is a party spot.Or you can just choose to relax on the beach. The waves are very gentle and the water is quite warm, but bring lots of sun screen. Aruba is very safe, but just don't take foolish chances.|`|AA11828439	Stay together and watch out for murdering Dutch citizens.

qdsVS1dDaa	First of all, stop worrying. Air travel is very commonplace. <br>  <br>  Metal detectors are used to prevent people from carrying guns and knives on the aircraft, so don't worry about your bra and retainer. The TSA screener will know what they are. Your watch and other things that you have that are metal go into a plastic container and go through the x-ray screener.  You get the stuff back after it has been inspected. <br>  <br>  Your carry-on bag should be no larger than  8 x 14 x 22 inches and will fit under the seat in front of you. Don't pack your makeup or any liquids in it. If it is going to be a long flight. I take along a 1/2 liter water bottle (EMPTY) and I fill it up after I go through screening from a water fountain. <br>  <br>  Take along some reading material.<br>  <br>  Relax and enjoy your flight.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|qkioDbDaaa	Oh jeeze. You are over-worrying. I have flown many times and none of that matters except for the watch. You DO get it back, lol. You should check with the airline to see how big the bags can be. It depends on the length of the flight and class. Arriving that early is average, too. Unless it will be a busy day at a large airport. What is your trip? From where to where?|`|KPDOrmTsaa	As mentioned before, you'll be fine.  <br>  If you are going to a destination where you will be away from your luggage, meaning somewhere you may wish to change a shirt or into shorts from slacks, keep a spare of each in your carry on.  If it is a short flight, you might not even want to bring a carry on.  <br>  <br>  Most airports, if not all, are very well marked so you will find the baggage claim easily.<br>  You'll want to do the empty bottle thing too, good advice.<br>  The movies make everything bigger than for real, don't worry about security.<br>  Have a good flight!<br>  bags<br>  PS: Don't over pack and take too much stuff.  You have to lift your bag, not just the baggage handlers!|`|OGAh1LF9aa	(:<br>  My first piece of advice to you would be to take a deep breath. It's not as bad as you think.<br>  Now, metal detectors shouldn't go off just because of your buttons, wiring, or studs. If they did, they'd be going off all the time. As for your metal retainer, I would just make sure you let the people know it's there. As for your watch and purse, they will scan it and then, yes, return it.<br>  You can't take a suitcase as a carry on. When you buy a suitcase set, it usually comes with a smaller, large purse-size bag. That's your carry on. If it's a long flight, pack a book, music, and puzzles or cards!<br>  Good luck! :D|`|8vWwX8SXaa	Well, you are over-worrying.<br>  <br>  The metal button on your jeans will not trigger the alarm, if the metal-retainer triggers it, they will get a hand-held sensor - when they see that it is coming from your mouth, they will probably assume it's a retainer.<br>  <br>  You will get everything you put in the bucket - back.  So it will be a good idea to put the watch in the bucket.<br>  <br>  Unless ofcourse its a knife or gun or something.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	this website should answer some of your questions<br>  <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/assistant/editorial_1049.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/a...</a>
D6PxRTLiaa	Not sure about prices from Cali but you can easily look online for that. Just a suggestion though, if you're going to Negril, don't stay at an all inclusive. There are many hotels and B&B's on the beach that will give you a better value. Staying in these places as opposed to an AI supports the local economy and business owners. To me, thats what Jamaica is all about. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have a fantastic relaxing time while giving back. Experience the real thing. The AI's are ruining that island in my opinion. As long as you use common sense you'll be safe. Jamaicans are some of the kindest people I have ever met.|`|qGw6FSY8aa	The best deals to Jamaica would be with a travel agent who mainly does trips to Jamaica or at least someone who just does the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  A travel agent wants you to get the best deal so you will be a repeat customer and tell others about them.<br>  <br>  A computer cannot give you that kind of service.
Tj7qWySBaa	The climate change a lot in chile because it is long. In the North it is really, really hot (Antofagasta, Iquique) even in winter, and it never rains, but does not matter because you are close to the sea almost anywhere in chile. In Santiago, Vi?a del mar, Valparaíso (centre), the climate is great, is hot in summer and not too cold in winter but it does rain a lot, although if you are in Santiago (east) it could snow  some days in winter. In the south (Punta arenas, Concepción, Puerto Williams) is cold always,  in winter rains everyday and the temperatures are very low. <br>  About the storms, we have a few, mostly are in the south.|`|YRuVebSsaa	Chile can hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes, ranging from desert in the north, to alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and south east, humid subtropical in Easter Island, Oceanic in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile<br>  and no not really|`|UiiviOCgaa	when i was there, it was winter. it was not even that cold.  it was only really sweater weather. i thought it was awesome. our summer is there winter.

If you can imagine our solar companion setting beneath a sea of land, you already have a distint image of Texas. Temperatures, at least in the DFW area (of which I'm a native), will be in the sixties for the next few days with chilly nights to juxtapose what will likely be a marvelous weekend. <br>  <br>  However, if you're looking for consistently warm weather and a picture-esque destination, it's hard to match Galveston. A thin island just off the coast of SE Texas, it resides in the Gulf of Mexico and stays considerably warmer thanks to the it's 360 degree, ocean-front scenery. If you're looking for warmer climates and good times (and perhaps the best slice of Florida outside Florida) I definitely recommend Galveston.

French Polynesia's currency is linked to the euro and prices are based on the high wages earned by French civil servants. That and the fact that most of the resorts on Bora Bora are owned by the most upscale hotel chains make it several times more expensive than comparable hotels in Fiji. The best months in both Fiji and Bora Bora weather-wise are from May to October, the cool, drier, less humid months. Flights from North America to the South Pacific are long and maybe tiring, so plan on staying at least two weeks.

952c8ef7f6f33b3718c0e152cf4cc0f4aa	I've stayed in several places in CHCH - some were paid for by my UNI and others paid out of pocket.  Personally I like staying at the Grange on Armagh Street.  The Grange is a B&B in a quaint old house, but I usually stay in the apartments in back.<br>  <br>  You can get a studio or a one bedroom unit, complete with kitchenette, Sky TV, and wireless internet and it is very reasonable.  The upstairs units have balconies.  <br>  <br>  The location is just about two blocks to the Free City bus service, which loops around the city.  I usually walk to New World (grocery) and then catch the bus back when I've made my purchases.<br>  <br>  The Grange is only a few blocks from the city centre, just beyond the gardens, close to Cathedral Square, the Conference Centre, the Art museum, and the Casino.  Of course you're just minutes away from the shops, cafes, clubs, and bars in the downtown area if you are into shopping or clubbing.<br>  <br>  I prefer the Grange if I have a choice, because I like being able to cook my own meals instead of having to eat out.  Plus it is handy to most of the attractions, and a good central location.<br>  <br>  I've stayed at the Hotel Grand Chancellor, which I thought was overpriced for the value.  Also stayed on Bealey Avenue at several different places.  Never again, too noisy with all that traffic.<br>  <br>  There was a decent place called the Russley Scenic Circle - with rooms that opened into a private courtyard, a swimming pool, good service, etc... but I heard it was being torn down to build a retirement complex.<br>  <br>  Check out the Grange and see what you think, I'll post the weblinks below.  Good luck and I hope you find what you are looking for...<br>  <br>  P.S.

TqmBGomPaa	Chinese is the world's most difficult language.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	Chinese of course...|`|MR4WwKoZaa	There are a lot more Chinese in the world than Japanese, so chances are you will get more use out of being able to communicate in Chinese.|`|mtMmhIDcaa	Mandarin I'd say. generally it will be a lot useful in the future compare to Japanese. However you have to consider your personal needs. What do you need the language for? then choose one of them.<br>  One thing you have to know is that Japanese is a little bit easier for english speaking people than Mandarin, since Japanese combined English and Chinese.<br>  For visiting, I'd say both are great! Japan is a great place to shop and everything(if you enjoy a more modern aspect ), it also have some culture places to visit. For China, it's HUGE! You can spend years in China and still have places that you haven't been to. There are many different cultures in China. It definitely worth to go to.|`|fKPHLjYPaa	I think Mandarin would probably be your best bet.  I live in China right now to learn the language and the culture.  It will definitely be a feather in your cap to have that on your resume.<br>  <br>  As I said, I live in China but have also been to Japan.  I think that Japan is a more comfortable place for most westerners to be - China is still a developing nation.  You're also less likely to be ripped off in Japan.  That being said, if you go anywhere in China or Japan  be prepared to have people stare at you and, possibly, take your picture.  In Japan, they have a bit more respect about it but in China you have no recourse but to just deal with it.  It's kind of interesting being treated like a celebrity because we really are but it also gets mighty tiring.  The best way that I can sum it up is that Japan was exactly what I thought it would be; China is NOTHING like I thought it would be.|`|9C0thBTzaa	i would say chinese..china is rising..i'm  learning mandarin chinese too..tough i would say..well u have to consider why are u learning that language and whether u would apply it in ur daily life, i would say, but learn both if u can, after all, u would lose nothing by learning extra language..bout both places, i would say it depends on an individual..both places are equally fun actually..|`|Y7Em17BOaa	Learn Chinese if you want to be a businessman.<br>  Learn Japanese if you want to understand the content of porn movie.|`|dKN5yICSaa	Japan: 130 million people<br>  China: 1300 million people<br>  By a factor of 10, Chinese is a better option!<br>  Also, what do you want it for? To order food in a exotic restaurant? either!<br>  to help you in your work? By far Chinese!!! To make business? by far Chinese!!! to travel? Chinese of course!!!! (Fantastic country, and ...dirt cheap) (on the other hand, if you want to travel in Japan, make sure you have a lot of money with you, everything there is obscenely expensive) Also, if you want to have fun, come to China! (no, I am not Chinese...just live here!) if you want to feel discriminated...go to Japan (People in the subway will not seat next to you, some japanese friends have tried to convince me that is due to respect for foreigners, I think it is they don't like westerners) instead, in China, you will feel the warmth of people! Safety? both are equally safe, with one advantage. In China people drive on the right side of the street...the RIGHT! in Japan, they messed that little detail and are constantly running over careless, jet-lagged foreigners that turn to their left before crossing a street.|`|eGgOe6xEaa	Well, i am originally from China, and i have also learned Japanese, which i forgot most of it since i came to the US long time ago.<br>  i personally think that knowing Chinese is definitely an advantage, and China is rising FAST! so i will go with Chinese (simplified).<br>  and after you can speak Chinese well enough, it is easier to learn Japanese.  they share a lot of similarities.  <br>  btw, China is definitely more fun to travel. it is much diverse. Japan now is just very westernized.<br>  don't get me wrong, i love Japan, but China is just more original.

The French wanted it, the Dutch wanted it, the English wanted it.  Many battles were fought over possesion of the island.  During 400 years of Spanish rule the Spaniards constructed many fortifications in order to fend off attackers.  The most famous of these was the El Morro de San Felipe constructed and modified during 300 years.<br>  <br>  Puerto Rico (Porto Rico as known then), was acquired as a war prize after the Spanish-American War of 1898.  A short war where the now politically and militarily weak Spanish Government had no choice but to cede the island to the US, along with Cuba and the Filipines.  The US wanted Puerto Rico for its strategic location and ease of management, being small in comparison to Cuba.  Nothing to do with communism as Cuba and Puerto Rico were not even considering communism at that time.<br>  <br>  The US took over possession of the island and put a US military government in place.  That situation lasted until WWI were the US military needed additional troops, and declared through an act of congress that Puertorican citizens be declared US citizens in order to legally draft young men into US military service.  So... in 1917 Puerto Ricans became US citizens.  In 1957 Puerto Rico was given its own style of self-government by popular vote, which then elected its own government styled after the US congress and State Executive model.

d2QVB6Qyaa	Personally I would do Milford Sound if you can manage it. There is a beautiful boat trip where your mother could sit down, and this really is one of the most highly rated of New Zealand's many beautiful landmarks!<br>  <br>  I have done the Tranz Alpine Rail trip and while it is lovely it isn't up there with Milford Sound.Although in April depending on the weather there could be snow through Arthurs Pass which would make the Tranz Alpine very special. For the best views from the train you need to go to the open car which was very full and standing room only.That is not to say you don't get good views from a carriage.You do.                                                           <br>  <br>  Milford Sound is quite a distance from Queenstown. It would be preferable to do an overnight tour, ( fromQueenstown) or trip if you are driving yourselves.So it may be pushing it a bit to fit it in comfortably.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Milford Sound unless there's a huge snowfall in the interim. The TranzAlpine is best experienced in winter.|`|yTdQUqVRaa	I personally prefer Queenstown/Te Anau. Milford Sound is breathtaking and there are other boat tours you can take as well down there - such as Doubtful Sound. There are several bus companies that run tours in those areas, and a place in Te Anau where you can store a rental car and be picked up directly from the premises, so walking would be minimal (once you reach most of the sites, the only walking would be from the bus to the boat and they are all wheelchair accessible).<br>  <br>  The only thing I would consider an issue is time. Queenstown is a few hours drive from Christchurch.|`|PPsALPcfaa	I live in New Zealand and I have never been on the Train trip from Christchurch to Greymouth however I have heard it is wonderful. There is also another train trip, and that is the Trans Coastal which goes from Christchurch to Picton, at the top of the South Island. Either trip would equally be wonderful!<br>  <br>  I have been to Queenstown and it is lovely down there. When i went my grandmother and grandfather were with me and they both enjoyed the gondola ride and beautiful views. I believe there are many walking tracks around the Milford sounds and Te Anau area. <br>  <br>  Because both options are absolutely wonderful it is hard to choose which to do. I would ssuggestthat because your mother doesn't have a good knee, you choose the train options. Visit <a href="http://www.tranzscenic.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tranzscenic.co.nz/</a> to view options about both Tranz Alpine and Tranz coastal!<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful trip in New Zealand!<br>  <br>  I.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	In thinking of your mother's comfort, I would suggest the Tranz Alpine - it's very comfortable. The trip to Milford is a long trip in a coach. Don't attempt to drive a car in. It will be too uncomfortable.<br>  (My advice actually would be to forget Milford if you insist on seeing a Sound, and go to Doubtful Sound - just over the hill from Te Anau. It's far more spectacular and it's not overrun with tourists like Milford is.)<br>  <br>  Do the Tranz Alpine and enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you'll be able to see Milford (or Doubtful) next time you're in NZ. I hope of course, you will come back.<br>  <br>  Added later.<br>  Do you realise that from Christchurch, the Tranz Alpine is a one day return journey, whereas Milford Sound would be a 2 but more likely a 3 day return journey.

It's definitely something different and is fun for everyone of any age. It's a little bit of a drive from SA but it's definitely an experience especially if you have never been to a place like it.
AA10258539	BSP's Regulation on the Foreign Currency Declaration Requirement<br>  <br>  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) wishes to clarify to the public that the written declaration requirement by BSP from travelers bringing in or out of the Philippines foreign currency in excess of US$10,000 which has been in effect since February 1, 2002, is not meant to prohibit or restrict the amount of foreign currency that may be brought in or out of the Philippines.<br>  <br>  The requirement is aimed at monitoring the transport of sizeable amounts of foreign currency as part of the initiatives taken by the BSP to assist in the government’s efforts to curb money laundering activities in the country.<br>  <br>  The bringing in or out of the country of foreign currency, regardless of amount, continues to be allowed under BSP rules. Furthermore, the Foreign Currency Declaration requirement covers only legal tender foreign currency banknotes and coins, thus it does not cover travelers checks which need not be declared.<br>  <br>  This clarification is issued by the BSP to correct the misconception in some sectors that the BSP has effectively re-imposed foreign currency controls.<br>  <br>  Note: I am not sure if this has been superceded. This is as of May 23, 2002.|`|qzZAIijJaa	You are allowed to bring $10,000 cash outside the country.|`|dGZ4qyfaaa	25 million dollars
jLTDqVHsaa	Long Island, the geographic formation, is made up of the following counties:<br>  Kings County (Brooklyn)<br>  Queens County<br>  Nassau County<br>  Suffolk County<br>  <br>  So, both Brooklyn and Queens are PART of Long Island.<br>  <br>  However, when many locals say "Long Island," they typically are referring to Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  In that regard, Brooklyn does not border Nassau County, while Queens does.  When speaking in these terms, Queens is closer to what many people refer to as "Long Island."<br>  <br>  Just giving you both ways to look at it.  Still, there's no reason for so many correct answers to have gotten thumbs-down here.  Amazing.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Long Island is made up of 4 counties.  In order from west to east are:<br>  <br>  Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau & Suffolk.|`|gJ8F634Haa	Queens is closer to Long Island.  Queens is adjacent to Nassau County (if that's what you mean). Queens is west of Nassau County and Brooklyn is west of Queens. Native New Yorkers consider Long Island as Nassau and Suffolk county... that's why they said Queens.  <br>  <br>  To my fellow Queenites.... thumbs up to you because I knew what you meant.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Actually both are on Long Island. If you look at a map, (see link) Brooklyn and Queens are part of New York city, but on Long Island. It depends on where you start out - both are next to the LI border, Queens might be bit closer.<br>  <br>  It's not a stupid question, no one knows everything.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	Queens|`|8Lmu2kXEaa	they are both part of lon island. it depends what part of long island you live on. i lived in mastic for 11 years|`|Uopgj45zaa	Queens.
