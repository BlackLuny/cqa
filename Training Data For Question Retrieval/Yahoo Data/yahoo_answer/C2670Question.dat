20090219170256AA4GIEf	Pets;Dogs	How to introduce a pit bull in a household with small dogs?	I have 2 smaller dogs and found a stray pit who looks fairly young. He seems well behaved and he was ok with the smaller dogs in the backyard until one of them tried to get his bone and then the pit growl at him and tried to bite the smaller one. It scared us to death but it turned out that the pit slobberd all over the small dog and didn't really bite. He seemed very sorry afterward but still protective of his bone. I think that if he wanted to bite or kill he would have just gone for it without us being able to restrain him but it leaves me uncertain about keeping him. Does anyone who have a pit and other small dogs have any advise on this? I can take the dog to a shelter but that is where he comes from and the guy who adopet him just abandoned him so I am not sure they are able to find good homes. Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20090219172825AA7u8nD	Pets;Horses	Cribbing Problem [Out in the Field]?	So I recently bought a 4 year old thoroughbred mare off the track.  She came a bit skinny, so what I've wanted to do with her is feed her unlimited roughage so she could gain some regular weight.  She's fed grain in her stall, then goes out usually day and night in a field with a round bale, and it's been this way for almost 2 months.      The problem is, she stands by the plastic water trough most of the day and just cribs on it, instead of eating the hay bale. (There's 2 other mares in her field, but she loves them and they all get along, and if she wanted, they would all 3 fit around the bale to eat; I've seen them before).  She likes the hay, and for the last month would eat the hay all day, and just crib when she went to get water.  But now she stands over by the water trough almost all day to crib, and doesn't go over to the hay bale.      Do you guys have any solutions to this?  I really don't want to put a cribbing collar on her, because I personally think they are cruel; her cribbing wasn't a problem until the last 2 weeks, as she's choosing to crib over eating her hay.  Also, I would try chew stop or something on the water trough, but seriously, it's a water trough: it would eventually seep into the water and make it taste like crap, which is bad.      Any ideas?

She had this problem last year but we thought she grew out of it. We also have a dog and are wondering if she is mad because we got him after her?  I know cats are territorial.       Is there anything that we can do to halt this behavior?  I don't want to get rid of her, but we can't keep on if she is going to continue this way.  Also could this be a sign that she is ill?  She is only 2 years old.

20090203104915AAGkeK1	Pets;Other - Pets	One of my rats died, other one now depressed  and sleeps all the time.. help?	Ok so I had four rats totall, 2 boys and 2 girls(boys in one cage girls in the other). A couple of ago I noticed one of my girls(Oreo) had a little bump on her head. I firgured it was nothing so decided to wait to see if it went away. The next day it was bigger and I left for a friends and spent the night over there. The next night I came home(saturday night) and it was an open hole now(a tumor). That night I debated on what to do and figured euthanization was the best option because she was very old and I didn't want her to suffer.    So the next morning I called the humane society and they said to bring her in whenever I can so I left right then and me and my mom brought her. I was so upset because even though she had a big hole in her head she was so sweet and wanting to be held and petted. We had a group of people wanting to pet her because she was so cute and friendly. So anyways they euthanized her that morning(Sunday morning).      The point of this is now Cookie(my other female rat) has withdrawn from the world. She sleeps in this box i bought her Sunday(i cleaned her cage out and bought her new boxes and stuff so it wouldn't smeel like Oreo). She just lays around and has a sad look in her eyes. My mom says shes just grieving and it'll pass but I feel so terrible for her. I hold her as much as I can and even let her play on my bed while I do my homework. Anyways I need some advice. WHat are some things I can do to get her mind off the loss of her sister Oreo? Some fun games or toy ideas(that i can make from home)? Any advice or ideas wanted. And I give her treats alot too btw.      Oh yeah anyone who is gonna be stupid about me loving my pet rats that much dont bother writing I dont need your lame remarks ok. I love my pet rats just as much as I love my bunny and my dogs ok.

He plays nice with us, but he's sly, keeping one eye on the cat. The dog even keeps one eye open while he sleeps to watch the cat.We are working with him in a positive manner to control his focus, but as you can imagine it only last for a short time. We need some tips to help get him focused and relaxed without displaying his intensity to attack the kitten. Any suggestions are welcomed. thank again!

In humans a six foot tall skinny person could weigh the same as a 4 foot tall overweight person. Their waist measurements would be way different though. Same would apply to horses, right? so pretty inaccurate...?

Well, I was wondering something else. I have heard conflicting things concerning a female cats heat. Some people are telling me that she can go into heat every 2 or 3 weeks and others say only twice a year. Which is it? Is it even possible she can be pregnant right now? And in my experience with worms, the belly sticks out on the sides as well as on the belly, but hers isn't doing that, so I am almost positive she is pregnant. I have an appointment with the vet on Monday to find out. Wish me luck!

20090219184439AAWBdlX	Pets;Birds	Squeaking/Squaking Budgie?	My English Budgie, "Tank" is acting strange.  He doesn't look sick, is puffed up like usual, but he keeps making this wierd squaking noise.  He started this about a day ago.  I thought it was just a new noise he had learned, but he does it constantly now.  Especially when someone walks into the room.       When we first got him as a friend for our regular parakeet "Tweeter" which was about 5-6 Months ago, he kept opening and closing his beak like he was having an asthma attack or something, but he continued this for a few weaks, so I just figured it was the stress from switching homes.  He's not nor ever been very friendly like our other male bird Tweeter.  He's always let you take him out and hold him, but he still doesn't like to be petted or socialized with(he perfers to stay in his cage).  When you set him on your shoulder he'll run and hide under your hair like he's always done.  His wings were clipped when we got him which was about 5-6 months ago, but he still fliies into walls thus the name "Tank"      Now, he is making these wierd noises.  It kind of sounds like a squaking but more of a squeaking noise kind of like a finch(sort of), but it's extremely rythmic and he continues even when you take him out of the cage.  When you leave him in the cage with tweeter he talks to him and everything, but as soon as you walk in, Squeak, squeak, squeak!  Sometimes he even squeaks when he's pruning or tucking his head under his wing.        I can't really tell if he's eating or drinking, or pooping for that matter because of my other parakeet, but when I went to put him in a different smaller cage, he bit me and ran to his and Tweeter's cage.  My mom and I started to think he was constipated or eggbound so we dipped his bum into warm water, and when he continued with his noise, we took him out again and dipped a little vegetable oil around his bum.      The squeaking got so bad last night at 3:30 in the morning he woke me up (i'm a very heavy sleeper) and kept squeaking to the point that I had to take the cage out of my room and bring him out into the family room.      He's never done this before and I'd really like to know if this is normal, or if it is something more serious.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, and if you need more details, feel free to email me or question me in your comment!  Thanks in advance.

At first it let me hold him all the time, it would let me just pick him up with ease whenever my hand was in there. I went away for 3 days (got back a week ago), and my mom fed him and turned on and off the lights. And I tried to hold him today to give him a bath, and he would not stop sprinting from me and freaking out. I finally got a hold of him and i gave him a bath but it seemed the bath stressed him out because he was just sitting there with his tail straight up. He also scratches the glass at nights way hard for about 30 to 40 mins after i turn off his lights. I feed him romaine lettuce, shredded carrots, and either around 4 or 5 dead or alive crickets. It is around 3 to 4 months old. its in a ten gallon tank, but it is not half the size of the tank yet. almost tho.   Anything that you can give me as tips will be greatly appreciated. thankyou.

I've stayed this height and weight for a few years now so I'm not supposed to get much bigger, if at all. I have great strength in my legs and arms (softball player) and can think quick. Apparently I have great horse sense, have ridden 8 years, and people have told me I was born in the saddle. But, I've never ridden as a jockey!      How would I go about this? I don't mind working my way up. I'm in it more for the experience rather than as a job and to jump right in. Honestly, I don't mind grooming and cleaning stalls at all. I actually enjoy it. So should I offer my services up in return for them to teach me to ride? And then start working my way up from there to hopefully warm up their horses more?      Any advice would be GREAT! Thanks!

My 9 week old puppy has been having diarrhea all day, but the worst of it started a little after noon. He was just pooping out a little bit at a time, and eventually he just started pooping yellowish-clearish liquid.      He did throw up twice, but other than that he was still playing and eating and stuff like normal so everyone told me I should wait a day and see what happened.   Well, it's now night time and he won't eat, he will hardly drink anything, he's been sleeping all late afternoon and evening, and he's still having diarrhea...not as frequent as earlier (he was going out like every 15 minutes earlier) but, still.   He is normally so energetic and psycho and seeing him so mellow like this is freaking me out! I feel so bad I want to cry :(   I wish I woulda taken him to the vet earlier in the day. They closed a few hours ago.      It doesn't sound like he's dieing, does he? Like will he be okay for tonight? I am so taking him to the vet as soon as they open tomorrow morning.

20090220223113AAAgoGh	Pets;Fish	My molly has ich.  How long does it take for the parasite to come off so I can treat the water?	She has had the white cysts for 4 days now and they're just getting worse.  I bought a malachite green treatment and treated it 1 of the 3 times directed. But I've read it's best to treat the water once the parasites fall off to reproduce because that's when they're susceptible to it.  I've tried to raise the heat some by keeping the light on and covering the top to keep in heat, I've added a little salt as well.  She's just getting worse and I know she's having a hard time getting oxygen because she's been at the top of the tank all day.  How much longer should it take so I can treat the water?  Is there anything else I should do?  Thank you!

It's a pretty bad cut but it's not physically bleeding. The vets are closed and to them this doesn't count as something that needs emergency service.  We put some neosporin on it, weve done that before, and now she's licking it?      Any advice (that's actually helpful?)

20090220182600AA7H3Eg	Pets;Dogs	For the oh-so-wise dog owners out there...?	I have had dogs my entire life(17 years so not THAT long...)   and I have always wondered why some dogs lick you so much.      I know it must have to do with personality...  My 2 yr old female golden retriever licks excessively only the people in my immediate family(mom dad brothers sister)  but can be so cold/aggressive towards other people, even people she is familiar with, then the next time she sees them she is all loving(but still doesn't lick them)      Why does she have such weird emotions towards people???    Why does she lick only us? (obviously bcuz we are her family but anything else...)      My other dog who is MY dog not a family dog and a male 3 yr old Newfoundland/lab mix only licks me but is NEVER aggressive or mean to people even strangers(unless they are outside are fence he gets a tad territorial)       why does he only lick me? he is sweet to my family.. just nvr licks them!!WHY??       sorry i kno this is long...

20090220225226AAsyzT6	Pets;Fish	Stocking a ten gallon tank~?	I've recently set up (and cycled) a ten gallon tank, wanting a small community tank, as I've got another ten gallon with an aggressive betta, and I wanted to leave him on his own, haha.      Temperature in the new tank ranges from about 76-80 (The normal being around 78, it never goes lower than 76.).    At the moment, I have 3 male guppies in the tank. They're mostly in place, at the moment, to help continue to cycle the tank. I wouldn't mind if they stuck around, of course, and wouldn't mind maybe another guppy, but you know. Starter fish.      What else would be good tankmates? I'm thinking maybe a cory, and I wouldn't mind a dwarf frog. Right now, having the three guppies in the tank (and only a betta in the tank beside it!) makes it look so empty.

Thank you for the help!

20090220191825AAVtLkD	Pets;Dogs	Help!! I have an aggressive English Bulldog and would like to know what to do about this situation!!!!!!!!!!!!?	My Husband and I have a 1 year old English Bulldog we got her when she was about 3 months old.  "Jessie" was fine when we first got her and then it seems as though something changed and she started to become aggressive.  We have always been very caring and affectionate towards her as she is considered part of our family I really think of her as my kid.  Latley she has  been biting at us and viciuosly attacking other dogs, she has also gone as far as biting a friend of mine and my little nephew.  I have taken her to training but it did not seem to work, although I felt the trainer did not do much to correct the problem anyway.  I cannot take her anywhere with me because I am scared of what will happen next.  I would love to take her to dog parks and feel safe with her around others but I just can't.  I always thought that Bulldogs were a docile breed and not vicious so I am not sure as to why this is happening.  If anyone has any ideas please let me know it would be greatly appreciated.  Please do not tell me that it is us because I have not done anything different with her then I have done from day one (before she became aggressive).  I am at my wits end and love her so much!!! Any suggestions would really help me alot?  Any bully owners out there who have had this problem also?
20090220192802AA1vrpw	Pets;Dogs	Question about my pup's vaccines?	So, I got my pup from a breeder. She was up to date on all her shots and stuff. Then I took her to my vet to get her final rabies vaccine and to get her fixed. Well, I moved here recently and took her to a new vet that I found. I wanted to get more of the Heartgaurd medicine (the little chewies for heartworms) since I only have a few months left. The vet at this place said they can't give it to her until she was blood tested to see if she was heart worm negative. I don't understand this. Why do I have to get that done now, when the other veterinarian gave it to me? Does this mean that she probably already got the blood test done? I just don't understand why it is an issue all of a sudden. My old vet isn't open on the weekends (small town) so I just found this out today. Any knowledge on this would be greatly appreciated!

Now they do sometimes get scared of new people but it only takes them 5-10minutes to get over it and they would come in a room full of strangers if I was there only though.

20090220223246AAmUrsX	Pets;Fish	Emergency tank draining, My fish are screwed, whats the next step?	I was forced to drain my 90gal tank because of a bad leak.  The 20 fish (approximately 60 inches worth) that were in there are now in a 3 gallon plastic bucket.  I'm forced to change the water in the bucket every 2 hours in an effort to keep the ammonia under control.  The ammonia goes from 0ppm to around 6ppm in 2 hours.  The fish cant take the constant water changes and are getting increasingly weak and sluggish.  So far I've lost 6 out of 20 in 11 hours.  I should have the tank fixed in a minimum of 4 days but I don't think the fish can hold out that long and I don't have any more buckets that are clean and haven't been exposed to harsh chemicals.        I think the fate of my fishes are sealed.  Rather then have them slowly die I feel I should just end their suffering.    :'(      I never thought I'd be asking this but how can I kill the remaining 14 fish quickly and humanely?

20090220225159AASnYU9	Pets;Rodents	Still so freaking skittish! What am I doing wrong?	Okay, I got my little rat on Feb 2nd, and I think we've made some excellent progress.  He'll take treats from my hand now, although he still eats them in his little sleeping area, he'll let me pet him without shying away and on occasion, he'll nibble and lick my fingers.  But as far as holding him goes...he's still the most skittish little bugger I've ever met!  I know patience is key, but I'm just wondering if I'm doing something wrong.   When in his cage, he's perfectly fine, but when I detach his cage to let him run around, he just won't stop running.  Even when I try and pet him out of his cage, he's very jumpy and when I go to pick him up (in a scooping motion as I've been told to do), he tries to scramble out of my hands, which in turn makes me scared to pick him up at all in fear of losing him in my room...  Am I doing something wrong or do I just need to give the little guy some more time?

20090221000742AAN7nh9	Pets;Cats	I rescued two cats... I need help with introducing them, one is violent !?	In 2007 took in a cat that was living in my condo's parking lot for many years.Her former family got evicted and the pound took the dog but this cat was left out to fend for it's self. One person took her in but sadly that lady passed away within months ( she was 90) That ladies family put the cat out again. Another person took her in but within months put her out again. Winter of 2007 she was staying warm by going from car hood to car hood as people parked for the night. She scratched a few cars and there was talk of taking her to the pound so I took her in. She has been abused and can from being very sweet to violent.  I have made a commitment to her and I she with me for the rest of her life.   Anyhow ,  Xmas night someone dumped a tiny kitten on my porch ... she had a red collar and Xmas bow attached. I think she was an unwanted Xmas present. Anyhow , I took her in and tried to find if she had an owner. Surprise , no one has claimed her and I have been unable to find an home for her.    I have her in my bedroom but I would like to introduce the two cats. I have brought items back and forth so each could learn the others smell. I have also placed the now teenage kitten in a carrier and then brought her into the living room with the other cat. The older cat becomes violent and hisses, growls and then sometimes strikes out at me. She stays very angry. I have also held the kitten and walked around the living room. The violent cat still growls and hisses.    The violent cat really hates other cats. She is extremely large 20 plus pounds ( yes , she was that big when I took her in and I am trying to reduce her slowly)     Can anyone offer any advice? I fear really introducing them as I would hate for the teenage kitten to get hurt or killed. However it is unfair to confine the kitten to my bedroom ... or is it?
20090220230530AAu5TAs	Pets;Dogs	I think my dogs had Nyquil?	My puppy got into my bottle of Nyquil.  I could tell by the way the bottle was chewed that he got a taste of what was inside and didn't like it and left it alone. But, I also think that once it spilled all over the place, the other two dogs had to come along and taste it.  So how bad is this?  I don't think they liked it either cause it's just a huge pool of Nyquil on the floor.  All three, I'm assuming, tasted it and just said yuck.  Should I be worried?      And I don't need a lecture on dog care.  Everyone makes mistakes and me leaving a closed bottle of Nyquil on my evening stand is one of them.

20090220230925AAIVyQY	Pets;Dogs	Spousal interference with puppy training?	My husband of 15 years never showed a real interest in any particular pup I had in training. Now, he has his little favorite and is checking me a nd questioning my every move.I am about ready to kill him.  He thinks that his baby will just do whatever he wants because she loves him, and discourages me (even picking her up and carrying her in to the house) from training her.    Our other dogs are the picture of obedience, and I have trained them all. The difference is that he is semi retired this year and sees the training, repitition and exercises when he never did before.  Besides shooting him and trying to involve him  ( he thinks our dogs are naturally smart and know everything)   HEEELLLPPPPP

20090221011755AANbVWA	Pets;Dogs	There's something in my dog's eye. What is it?	I have a 6 year old Boston Terrier and when I took a really close look at him I noticed something in his eye. It's hardly visible and black in color. It's round and no larger than a tenth of an inch.  I counted about three of them. I noticed that they float because when he rolls onto his back, these things floats upward which makes it seems like they are buoyant.       I don't think it irritates him because his eyes aren't red or anything. What could it be? Is it something I need to worry about?

20090221004347AAWR7Gx	Pets;Rodents	Three Questions For My Guinea Pig?	1: A close friend of mine had two guinea pigs. Last year, they gave birth to eight of them. I've adopted one male named Aundrus two days ago. The moving process was fairly okay. The cage was shut and a black cloth was draped over the cage so that people wouldn't point at it and make unneccessary fuss and scare him. He settled down quite well and ate, slept and drank normally. BUT he's really scared of what I do. I always talk to him while I take out his food bowl, use and old shovel to clear the wet wood shavings, put fresh grass, etc. And everytime I put or take something into/from the cage, he makes an arupt movement and a few hundred bits of wood shavings fly along with him. This sudden movement is freaking both him and me out. What should I do?      #2: How do I hold a guinea pig? See, the thing is, I'm rather scared of animals and although having repeatedly told by my friend they don't bite I've never stroked him up to now and I don't want to scare him even further. How do I make little steps to change this?      #3: What homemade toys can I give to Aundrus? I would like to make toys out of easily found materials that aren't so expensive so that if it gets soiled I can just throw it away.      THANK YOU! If you can answer all three to my satisfaction I will give the ten points away!!! -Liz-

I have a pretty aggressive looking GSD X, she's jet black with great big golden eyes and she's also been compared to dogs such as Scooby-Doo, Marmaduke and the dog from Hound of the Baskervilles, even though she would never hurt anyone on purpose.      She loves to run off lead but if she see's a person, she will walk towards them until i call her back, and I always have to apologies to the people if they looked scared.    When she does meet someone, she may get too excited and lick all up their legs, so once again, i have to apologies.    If she barks at someone, i have to apologies.   And if she lunges at someones cat, I'm behind her apologizing over and over again.      She is going to training so I don't need people to tell me to train her, but does anyone else find that their always apologizing to people for something that their dog has done?

20090221012929AAyrGww	Pets;Cats	My siamese cat eats raw sugar - why?	Hi,      My siamese cat Archie has always had a bit of a penchant for odd food - he doesn't like things like seafood or sausages or pork etc but loves stuff like pastry and cake and bread - he will steal any cake that is left out, and bring bread in that we put out on the bird table.      We have taken him to the vet to check everything was okay, and were told he was in perfect health, and that was just the way he was.      Last night we were making pancakes, and had left a sugar bowl out on the side, and you can imagine how surprised I was to turn around and see Archie with his face in the bowl eating the sugar. I know cats can't taste sweet things, so why is he eating it?

20090220231119AAkywt2	Pets;Cats	The act of rescuing cats should make me feel happy but turns out I feel more depressed than ever?	I like to rescue cats, bear the cost of medication and stuff but when it doesn't work out, I feel even more sad. Supposed caring for cats make me feel happy but it says the things that you like the most break your heart the most.         Mum say maybe it's better that I stopped because I couldn't seem to handle the pain quite well. It took a lot of time for me to recover should something bad happen. It gets worse when it happens so many times. The hardest part is if the cat ran away and die.          I preferred to be able to bury it as a final stop. Like it's been concluded and sealed, otherwise I feel harder to let go.          What's your opinion or thoughts on this. I just need to know if there's anybody out there like me or is there anything I should do. I like rescuing cats but I feel depressed doing the things I really enjoy. I have the space and the money.

20090221005703AAdrY2f	Pets;Dogs	Which muzzle for my dog?	I recently enrolled my new rescue dog into an obedience class. So far, I have successfully helped 3 pound dogs through obedience school, but none that were as aggressive as Morgan. He's a 3 year old german shepherd and has major stress aggression. He's perfectly fine with my other two black labs but not with dogs he doesn't know.      He's a strong dog and i sometimes have trouble controlling him. I would feel much better about the safety of the dogs around him if he wore a muzzle.      I don't want to take him out of the class because then he would be an aggressive, antisocial dog for the rest of his life and i want to stop this problem now.      I would never let my guard down around Morgan because situations can change in a second when he's involved so a muzzle wouldn't give me false security but i need to know that there's going to be something stopping his sharp teeth ripping into another dog's neck.      Which muzzle would be best?   I need to be able to give him treats while he's wearing it.   He needs to be able to drink.   He needs to be able to pant as usual.   He still needs to be able to sniff other dogs or he will never become socialized.

20090220231318AAHEvdJ	Pets;Dogs	What dog breed or combo should I get?	I have always had larger sized dogs, black labs, large beagle, samoyed, and mostly golden retrievers... my favorite.  Our last two dogs died in the last 2 years, each of cancer, both were Golden Retrievers.  I don't want to get a dog right now but I am researching breeds.  I think since our family travels a lot that maybe I should consider a small dog that I can bring onto a airplane with us...not under the plane, but in the cabin.  (I will never travel with a dog under the plane again, i did it once and still regret it)  This means a dog that is less then 12-15 lbs.  I would ideally like a less allergenic than most maybe a poodle mix, but I also have a 3 year old daughter so one that is good with kids too.  The last thing is that I hate the really high pitched barky dogs.  Am I asking too much or is there a small breed or mixed breeds out their that fits this description?

20090220232356AAEieXj	Pets;Dogs	Worried about my dog, he was acting weird tonight?	Don't worry, this isn't a medical question, I know to go to the vet if there's a medical problem. this one is more behavioral.      My dog is a really sweet, and he's a very happy boy. He has a sister who we rescued last year and the two get along beautifully.       The only issue my dog (Ninja) has is that he really hates going to the groomer. he starts shaking, and when we get to the door he tries to run away.      the groomer always says "out of sight out of mind, he does so good once you leave." Grooming for my 2 dogs usually takes 3 to 4 hours, because it's a busy salon.      Well, we never notice anything weird, they come out looking and smelling great, only one minor nick in the 2 years we've been going, and they seem really happy when we come to pick them up. So we really thought nothing of it.      well today, (about 2 weeks from their last groom), my mom and I were sitting on the couch playing a computer game. Ninja was playing with my other dog Shadow, and their toys. Everything seemed normal.      My mom was tapping on the keyboard during my turn trying to be funny, so I lightly slapped her hand and told her to stop. (You know, that playful kind of joking hand slap.) we were both laughing.      even though it was all in fun, Ninja stood up and looked kind of weird. So my mom jokingly said "See Ninja doesn't like when you're mean to me. You tell her ninja, mean girl huh?" then she jokingly slapped my hand back and said "bad maggie".      Ninja freaked out, tucked his tail between his legs and started running in circles. He's never done this before, so we started to worry.      I slapped my mom's hand again and he freaked out, so I thought maybe it was me, so my mom slapped my hand... same reaction. I slapped my own hand, then my mom slapped her hand, and he reacted the same each time. It was the hand slapping motion that was freaking him out...      So I raised my hand above his head to see how he'd react, and he freaked out, started shaking uncontrollably, tail between his legs, cowaring. That's when I started getting concerned something happened to him.      this happened around 6pm, it's now 1:12am and he still doesn't want anything to do with us, he's in another room ignoring us. (Usually he sleeps in either my bed, or in my mom's room with her. He hates being alone, but he's in our guestroom sleeping on that bed all by himself. It's unusual for him.)      He's never reacted that way before, but my mom pointed out... it's not like we go around hitting each other, even in a joking way... so we wouldn't exactly know.      But that got us to thinking, My dogs have never been punished by us. We don't even yell at them when they do something bad. We just ignore bad behavior and praise good behavior (not that it's hard cause they're rarely bad.) So how would he even know what a slap was? we were laughing, it wasn't loud because it was a light tap more than a slap, so there wasn't anything angry about it... so it was weird to see him react so emotionally      That got me worried that maybe something is happening at the groomers. Maybe he doesn't like the slapping motion because someone is hitting him. I know one time I went to the groomers they complained that he was being naughty and wouldn't sit still, so his cut was a bit uneven... but they just laughed about it like it wasn't a big deal, and he seemed very happy... but now I wonder if they punish dogs who don't behave...      The groomers is the ONLY place he goes where we are not present with him. We don't take him to doggy day care, and when we go places like the park, or the vet, or Petsmart, we're always with him.      So now it's got me freaking out that maybe someone there has hit him. I cancelled all my apts. with them and am trying to get in elsewhere...      Do you think I'm over reacting, and that it's not what I think it is... or am I right to worry that something happened to him at his last apt?      I mean, it was 2 weeks ago... but at the same time... my mom and I haven't jokingly slapped our wrists in front of him before... so maybe we're just not noticing this till now.      I'm really upset about this... has anyone else experienced this with their dog, only to find out it has NOTHING to do with being hit by someone... or am I right to be concerned about that groomer?

20090220235311AAps1Tw	Pets;Dogs	Dog Park Or No Dog Park?	My dog is a very sweet and laid back dog. I started taking him to dog parks, we have been 4 or 5 times. He doesn't seem intrested in the other dogs, he sniffs them and than comes back to us. He doesn't play with the other dogs and he doesn't touch any of the tennis balls there.  He won't go over to other dogs, unless I go with him. He is such a momma's boy I know. The other dogs are not big helps, they are always trying to hump him and bark at him. I'm always having to protect him, because the other owners don't do anything. Should I keep taking him or should I just stop? But I don't want him to become dog agressive and I'm afriad he will become dog agressive because he basically is the only dog around.

I got the bird only a week ago and It was different then i thought. My mom said if you get the bird you can't get a dog for another 8 years. I was air headed enough to agree with it.:( Anyways. Before getting the bird I wanted a dog for about 2 years straight! I wanted a dog for sure. I don't know what kinda dumb idea i was thinking. but i decided to get the bird. Please help. I don't know whether i should tell my parents how i feel. Or. I should just deal with the bird for the next 8 years when i can get the dog. I JUST CANT DECIDE. please tell me what you would do. I want your opinion. Thank You all.

20090221004245AAw2Uvg	Pets;Dogs	Why does my Basset Stink?	I have read thousands of thing about Basset's and smelling bad from changing diet to regular baths to skin and ear irritation and on and on.  I don't feel like those things apply in my case.  This is not just "Dog" Smell...My dog can be clean and perfectly healthy but I put him in the car to go somewhere which he loves to do...and with in 5 min it smells like a dead body.  This only happens in the car not in the house thankfully.  I use to think he was nervously licking himself causing a pheromone thing but I have noticed now he doesn't even have to be licking himself at all.  What is causing this?  It takes forever and a scrub down to get that smell out of my car.  Please Help!

20090203113940AAb1Eb7	Pets;Other - Pets	What's better to use in a ferret dig box-potting soil or long grain rice?	Since i'm going to have the money soon, I want to be able to make a ferret dig box. I'm going to get one of the big 'rubbermaid' container type things from WalMart, but i dunno what to fill it with, long grain rice or potting soil.      I know I would have to freeze (or something of the sort) the potting soil to kill of any bugs, and it would be cheaper, which means I could get more of it...Rice would cost a lot, even in the 'big bulk bags'...Suggestions please?

20090221014830AA74kS8	Pets;Reptiles	Random questions about Bearded Dragon?	I have a bearded dragon that is approximately a year and a half old.  I broke my bank setting up his habitat, but now that I've got all of his supplies it seems to be very nice and easy owning him.  However, I've always had a problem with feeding him his greens since I've owned him.  Terrible twos, like my little sister, wont seem to eat their vegetables.  I've started using a method that has worked decently, but I just want to run it by some dragon pros and make sure I'm doing the right thing.  In his tank, I have the warm side on the left, with a basking area. Then next to that, in the middle of the tank I have a large water area that is approximately an inch to two inches deep, and two small feeding bowls.  Then I have a hiding area on the far right, with some bushy fake plants for him to crawl through and a half log for him to hide inside.  It's a 55 gal tank.      In the two bowls I leave two different foods. I leave some Flukers Buffet Blend for Adult Bearded Dragon food in one bowl.  He'll pick at that here and there, but typically I leave the food there for two or three days before having to refill.  I got into a habit of using this to make sure he was getting his calcium.  I'd mix some of the calcium powder in with this bowl.  In the other bowl, I keep his vegis.  Every morning I change some lettuce and carrots out of the bowl for fresh stuff.  He doesnt ever eat much of it through.  If I hadnt witnessed him from time to time picking at some of the vegis, I'd think he never ate any, because theres typically not a noticeable amount missing the following morning.      Basically my question is asking if this is a safe practice, by just leaving his food in there all day.  I've been reading online and I've seen other people have some more structured feeding times.  I have a separate tank for him that I keep crickets in, and to feed him crickets I'll put him right in that tank and let him go to town for a couple of minutes.  I try not to let him eat his max of crickets because I want to encourage him to get his greens through the day.  I'll typically snatch him up after he eats a dozen crickets or so, while he's still running around hunting.  On the times I'll let him just go crazy on the crickets, he'll eat up 20 or so.      He seems healthy.  Very active and alert, all of his limbs have their full strength (I get plenty of scratches from his nails while playing with him).  I handle him multiple times a day.  He spends probably a total of two or three hours outside of his tank with me while I'm watching TV or while I'm doing homework.  He enjoys relaxing on my lap, and every once in a while will liven up and feel the need to run up me onto my shoulder, then climb along the back of the couch.  I've had him for a few months and everything has gone great, and I love owning him.  I just want to continue to grow as a pet owner and make sure I'm not developing poor habits.      Also, I've had a few problems with very minor impactions.  I try to spot clean out his poor daily, so if I cant find any poop for a day or two, I immediately give him a warm bath in my bathtub.  He'll swim around a bit, then stop and sit still for a little while.  After sitting in the water for 10 minutes or so, he'll start getting active and run around again, then he'll poop in the water. (Note to potential lizard owners, I've found that lizard poop stinks worse than baby poop).  Then I'll clean out the bathtub, and put him back in some warm water.  He'll then run around and play in the water going from the deeper end to the shallower end for a little while.  Then I'll take him out and put him back into his tank.      It is below freezing outside, and has been cooler in my house because its the middle of the winter, so I've been having a harder time keeping his basking area up to 100 degrees.  Its more often around 90 degrees through the day, but it's all I can do.  I've got 250 watts of heat, as well as a UV light to try to warm him up.  I'm not sure thats the problem though, because its about 50/50 that he'll poop on his own in his tank, or he needs his impaction treatment in the bathtub.      Any tips that anyone can offer for these problems, as well as any things that I may have overlooked for taking care of him would be great.  Thanks for anything and everything!!! :)
