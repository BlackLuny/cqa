X4i2jej5aa	Its either she has other very important things to do, or she feels that since this is your homework and not hers, she has no right to do it for you. But the best way to solve these problems is to talk to your friend. Communication is the best way to fix a problem with friends, because that's what me and my friends always do. Talk to her and listen to her side of the story, it will clear everything up I'm sure.|`|T0KHIFgaaa	she probably didn't want to spend her saturday helping you with your homework project, i know i wouldn't want to.|`|6HP348pAaa	I see why your offended. But you just need to ask her straight up. She's the only one that can tell you.|`|ew8wxzYQaa	im not being mean or stupid, but i dont get why you were offended...|`|9eMYzY0Paa	She just had stuff to do too, plus she might not wanna do someone else's work.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	ohh..you should talk to her and ask if she's mad..and if she sais no then you can just explain to her what you think and feel.<br>  Orr maybe her mom didnt let her go and just said that she couldnt.<br>  happens, i had to do that once.<br>  it sucked.<br>  good luck!<br>  =)
9PaRdlwcaa	Okay, so usually, girls are very shy about expressing their feelings. There's a good chance that she does like you, and I think the best way to be sure is to be confident. When you feel the time is right, talk to her and tell her how you feel. If that doesn't seem like something you could do, flirt back a little. Eventually, though, if you want something to happen, someone will have to speak up.|`|qlNfbBMvaa	dude this is a really bad situation. if you know she likes someone, and yet you feel like shes somewhat infatuated with you soley on the basis that she sometimes stares at you, i would say you mistaken. but you do find out that she no longer likes that guy, then, considering your situation, i would say that you definitely have to take that chance. ask her out face to face, none of that via phone or friends or letters crap.|`|dymHSSgVaa	She likes you, that's a little obvious with the giggles and especially the blushing. I advise you to get to know her some more, and spend a little time with her. like maybe bowling? perhaps lunch, to really get to know her. and it could be your "first date" :] just don't blow it! lol|`|vEpSsRDxaa	Well from a girls perspective, it kinda seems like she may like you and maybe she's a little shy about it. Just keep talking to her and getting to know her before you jump to any conclusions :] good luck to ya!|`|La5D6jnRaa	Clearly she's flirting.|`|UH2zPEpQaa	yes. she is trying to flirt with you. FLIRT BAKK!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>                                        YEW + HER = LOVE!!!!!!!!!|`|5RvjBiQcaa	She probably does like you, keep on talking to her and making her laugh and eventually maybe you'llbe in for a chance!|`|MWdBiGNjaa	Ya think?!?!?!?!?  DUDE, on Monday.... ASK THE CHIC OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JW5sc6evaa	I'd have to say yes, ask her out!|`|Th6ncJGwaa	yea man she digs you|`|iLhTHtuvaa	well it kind of seems like she does<br>  <br>  <br>  but you should ask her = )|`|veZLfnGFaa	It sounds like she does like you.  :)|`|HPAcASpOaa	Yup  she likes you i'm like that too!|`|knvXQDvzaa	it's possible that she likes both of you. just make your move and ask her if she wants to hang out sometime or if she would like to get to know you better. it wouldn't hurt. just start out simple. if there's a school function coming up, ask her if she would want to go with you. <br>  it's worth a shot.|`|kZzasq1laa	DUH!  She likes you!<br>  It's soooooo common for a girl to like more than one guy at a time.  It's totally obvious.  hahahahaha!|`|6IjBUqAfaa	its so obvious she does. thats EXACTLY how a girl acts around the guy she likes (: awwwwwwh.|`|8zfXJxxraa	She Likes U Dude!!!!!|`|Te4uu4tyaa	she probably does like you. or she could think of you as a really good friend...just don't jump to conclusions about her...get to know her better and as time goes on tell her you like her. if she doesn't like you back, oh well at least she's your friend. it may be weird at first but then you will start to move on and like someone so it won't be as awkward.|`|56RvQTWIaa	I don't find it shocking that she has a bf and she is still "looking at you". Many people do that, especially towards me at my school. Personally I think that she is just looking for attention. If you REALLY wanna see if she does like you, try flirting w/ her only in very menial ways. E.G. Try making fun of the way she looks at you.|`|FYPl8CYjaa	Yeah she soo likes you, believe me i am a girl (:<br>  i know my stuff, and unless shes just overly weird she likes you, i think shes going for the elastic band method by saying she likes someone else, get in there man.|`|kBYdS2IQaa	idk answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307100346AAVztLH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|xMJ2r7Vcaa	yeah probably.<br>  if you like her tell her<br>  what do you have to lose?|`|QKKYVeJZaa	I think  so u shuld ask her then if u want to find out I wish that help you!|`|YQUrWyH3aa	YES! any man has achance with any given girl|`|tmfhieP7aa	Maybe. Do you like her? Ask her to hang out and get coffee or ice cream one day. If you like her too then flirt with her and let her know that you are interested. Girls are extremely afraid of rejection so she will try not to show that she likes you until she knows that you like her (it's dumb but we don't want to get hurt).<br>  <br>  EDIT: there are a lot of posts that say she loves you. She does not love you, there is much more to love than just staring. She is interested in you. I just wanted to make sure you know this because people really overuse the word "love"
jGKGlxAuaa	Don't get yourself caught in a middle of a soap opera. There are thousands of cute guys, and girls out there.<br>  <br>  If you are not sure you like him yet, take it slow. Wait until you meet somebody you are sure you like. Don't hook up with somebody to keep a friend happy.<br>  <br>  Remember, put yourself first.|`|SsmxE0f4aa	He has a girlfriend. Stay away.|`|veZLfnGFaa	If you really like him, go out with him and see what happens.  Apparently he likes you or he wouldn't have asked you to go out to eat.  :)|`|HoZYr3bXaa	I think that you firstly need to think about the friend that told you - is she trustworthy? If you believe she is, then she wouldn't want you to split up the relationship between her brother and his girlfriend, and would confide in you how she feels.<br>  If he has a girlfriend and is being as polite as that, then he must be confused with his feelings.<br>  Maybe you should get to know him more as a friend, before deciding that you like him, as you don't know much about his personality, only his looks.<br>  Good luck.|`|PiaPe6Xnaa	I agree with Mimzy! You like him, he likes you...so go for it girl!<br>  <br>  Also if his sister is trying to break them up, I don't think he knows about it. So it's not like he's liking you because he wants to break up with his gf you know?|`|FFKbVKWDaa	yeah<br>  he has a girlfriend?<br>  <br>  what does that tell you?
15dA7weiaa	If you have a car & can drive you could go out on trips (eg. Niagara Falls) & share the expenses. There are all age clubs where you could dance to live bands.|`|qgXaWVMKaa	invite them to your house and play pictionary<br>  :)|`|5HfsDZh4aa	Go Skating or out to dinner|`|6HP348pAaa	Beach? Is that too far away?|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	go to a restaraunt and eat, and from there go shopping or out for some ice cream.<br>  Or plan to go take pictures.<br>  =)
CvtDsOB4aa	I Would Ask Her If <br>  She Would Like You to Be <br>  By Her Side During the Wake for Support|`|AA11866559	I think she's avoiding you. How can a wake "probably" be on a weekend. Those things generally get set quickly. Can't keep a dead body around too long...|`|CpevWaQ7aa	I don't think she is avoiding you. Maybe she really does have a wake this weekend. Is there any reason why you wouldnt trust her?<br>  <br>  It doesnt sound like shes ignoring you considering that she's replying to your messages|`|naPYuaDQaa	I think she just has a busy schedule, it doesn't sound like she's avoiding you. Just say hey do you still want to hang out this weekend.|`|3WGU6Nvvaa	I would just wait a day, or text her and talk... If you text her enough, she might end up feeling guilty if she lied and is avoiding you.|`|YzArBxQFaa	She sounds unsure.  Be a good guy and let her know you are there for her.|`|Semz4Tshaa	she most likely really wants to see you, but she's busy, and some things are coming up...it should be nothing to worry about|`|oY1YzPMzaa	First STOP cappy all the letters for ur question when this really isnt important. For 2, ur being paranoid. She like u.|`|PiaPe6Xnaa	Hmmmm...i don't think she's trying to avoid or ignore you. If she said she's busy, then she's most likely to be busy....|`|FFKbVKWDaa	i say ask her staright up|`|irvlGp3Taa	thats sweet and i kinda think shes avoiding u
96dd1ddeb6999bc938d40452d39493b5aa	I'm sure it depends on the individual.  If he is of Persian descent and has been in this country for generations and his family are well assimilated to Western life, it could work out, as it can't be any better or any worse than it would be with other men in general.<br>  <br>  However, in these times, frankly, I wouldn't trust in getting into a relationship with a foreign Muslim, especially if he's talking about you moving to his country.  You would lose all your fundamental rights as a woman and as a human being in a heartbeat.  (Besides, Persia is the old name for Iran).<br>  <br>  Have you ever seen "Not Without My Daughter" with Sally Field?  I recommend you check out that movie and watch it before you make such a decision, because it is based on a true story that happened in the 80s --- And things were better then than they are today in that country as far as their attitude towards Americans.<br>  <br>  I realize that some may take exception with my comments and I'm hesitating as I'm writing them because I consider myself a fair minded person and I realize some may be offended by this.  However, I much prefer to offend someone, than to see another woman hurt or killed not only by her husband but by the society she's living around, and without the recourse that is available here.<br>  <br>  ========<br>  <br>  To the responses below:  I didn't say what I said above lightly, but I do stand by my words in the matter.  Whether "Not Without My Daughter" may be one side of the story, the fact is that this woman isn't the first, or the last to be held in a foreign country against her will.  If this isn't true, why are there so many books and so many documentaries in the matter?<br>  <br>  I don't doubt that there are good Iranian people there, but it is also true that we are living in very trying times in the world, and Iran has had an active role in it  -- especially when they are building up their nuclear arsenal.<br>  <br>  To the person who mentioned Nancy Grace, I don't deny whatsoever that we have our fair share of domestic violence in the Western world.  However, it is also true that we do have recourse that women in many parts of the world do not have.<br>  <br>  Ultimately a question was asked:  "Do Persian men make good husbands?  I'm sure they do.  But personally I wouldn't bet the farm on it, as far as American women goes.  Not the way things are like today.<br>  <br>  =====<br>  <br>  The truth sometimes is very unpopular, and thumbs downing doesn't take away from it.  Unlike Iran, people can still speak their minds quite freely in the Western World, and most especially in the United States.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	It depends on character and values, not on ethnicity.|`|c998b0820f5eab481123e2a3db854d7daa	i agree with irani and the first answer...<br>  definetely dont listen to the person who said to watch not without my daughter. she has no clue about an iranian... trust me<br>  especially this part that she wrote made me really pissed off, " And things were better then than they are today in that country as far as their attitude towards Americans."<br>  <br>  coz its not true, if you go to iran, they love americans. they take them home to meet there family @ hav dinner, show them agood time.. check it out in youtube, theres heaps of clips of american people in iran who are treated like kings and queens<br>  <br>  so yea dont listen to her...<br>  persian guys are awesome... trust me!!....(well the hundreds that ive seen)so yeaaa.<br>  persian GUYS are perfect.....<br>  <br>  Ur so lucky if a persian guy wants u<br>  goodluck|`|4qPkJqHTaa	well, if depends on what you consider a good husband and also the fact that every man differs.<br>  <br>  Persians are very into family and closeness so I DO think they make good fathers. As far as husbands many persian men are really stubborn so if you want something to get done you have to make it like it was THEIR idea and think if you were to marry one it's good to be a very fiesty woman but some persian men are fairly easy going though i have yet to meet one :] Persian men (the ones i have encountered are also very faithful)<br>  <br>  <br>  the woman who wrote the answer underneath me, SHE IS  CLOSED MINDED and ignorant. if you think you can judge a culture based on a skwed view of ONE MAN and a hollywood MOVIE then you really know nothing about the world and culture. EVERY culture has it's own amazing qualilties and how dare you take every horrid stereotype and act as if it is fact. the stupid movie she is telling you to watch is bullsh** if you base every persian off that, then shame on you. that is repulsive. Do not speak about a culture that you know nothing about.  Seriously, please do not listen to her ingnorant statements, it makes me so sad to know that someone could ever speak of a culture like that, persians are amazing and welcoming people to even say that you would be killed is so ridiculous and fustrating.<br>  <br>  I hope you aren't as crazy as this woman.|`|ZxYxB9jCaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Someone else asked a similar question before, and this is how I answered it:<br>  <br>  Okay...Sorry for the long answer, but Iranians are just such a great catch, that there is so much to praise :)<br>  <br>  I do not want to generalize, but am simply answering your question, based on all the Iranian men I know (family and friends)...<br>  <br>  Iranian men are...<br>  <br>  1. Very hardworking<br>  <br>  2. Value an education (Also, regardless of whether or not they have a degree, they are very smart...for instance, my father doesn't have any type of college degree, and yet he can fix anything--a computer, a refrigerator, install stuff, tear down a wall in the house, rebuild...he just made me a charger for my computer, because mine was broken...he can do ANYTHING)<br>  <br>  3. They are good thinkers …they come up with creative ideas, and are very logical. They are also very good to have a conversation with…they pay attention to the news and what is going on in the world.<br>  <br>  4. Iranian men are very respectable...hospitable. When they go out to visit family, friends, etc., they will try to bring some sort of gift, say thanks a billion times, etc. When they have guests visiting, they try to show them a good time...they are NOT greedy. They will serve the guest with an unlimited amount of the best fruits and the best meals...they will also take you out around the city to show you a good time. They make everyone feel welcomed, and they always want to show you how important you are to them...<br>  <br>  5. Iranians in general are very friendly...if you say "Hi" then they will just start talking to you as if you are family (invite you over to their house for a meal, etc.) and they always try and maintain the friendship...they value your friendship and respect you…they are always there for you, and will offer to help you in any way.<br>  <br>  6. Iranian men are VERY handsome...honestly. They always dress up nicely...nice clothes, hair, accessories, cologne, EVERYTHING. They try to dress themselves in the best brands and the best quality of clothing...if an Iranian is rich or not, you will not be able to tell, because they always take time to care about their outward appearance...they like to look respectable.<br>  <br>  7. Iranians are also very proud people...they are proud of where they came from, as well as their culture...very confident (not arrogant), and yet humble at the same time. It is hard to explain this, I know confident and humble are so opposite, but Iranians are composed of the two.<br>  <br>  8. FUN and FUNNY!!! You will never be bored with an Iranian! They have a great sense of humor, and know how to have a great time.<br>  <br>  Again, I am not generalizing, but just speaking from my own experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  I HOPE IT HELPS!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  DEFINITELY DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PERSON WHO COMMENTED ABOVE...did she seriously mention "Not Without My Daughter" as a way of deciding whether or not you should marry a Persian.?.?...WOW! That's completely CRAZY!!!! OMG!!! SO ANNOYING!!! She's basing life decisions on a FILM, that people have been questioning the verity of.  Check out this documentary that came out about that movie...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2SUn1ZNU0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2SUn1ZN...</a><br>  <br>  She can go watch Nancy Grace, and hear about all of the women in AMERICA being abused/killed by their AMERICAN husbands everyday…what about those? Don’t you hear those? What negative things have you heard about Persians in America doing? NOTHING! <br>  <br>  LOOK AT ANY PERSIAN FAMILY IN AMERICA...honestly, I do not want to make stereotypes...but most of them are living in mansions in Beverly Hills with BMWs and Mercedes Benzes, running their own companies, and treating their wives with RESPECT, allowing them to stay home and not lift a finger...Persian Men are great providers...caring and RESPECTFUL…and they DESERVE some RECOGNITION.  Persian men create beautiful lives for their families in cities like Beverly Hills.<br>  <br>  Check out the following link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian-American" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian-Ame...</a><br>  <br>  PERSIAN men are GREAT, and any woman would be lucky to be married to a PERSIAN.  They are the definition of GENTLEMAN. Period.|`|w2hxmOLwaa	Yeah baby in few words: you cant wish a better husband! because if your husband is persian your kids are persian. and persia is the famous country ever everyone knows that and we are damn proud with it!don't listen what americans and their films are telling about us all these are stupid lies!
fN5Amv3aaa	I've been using this site and it's really helpful for finding female friends that like to do that stuff!  So far, I've met three new girlfriends in my area and we've had fun every time we hung out!|`|5HfsDZh4aa	Do you ride motorcycles?
veZLfnGFaa	I would want you back, but would be embarrassed because I was so stupid when I was young.  Sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees.   :)|`|ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	You cant save someone who doesnt want to be saved and doesnt have it in them to save themselves..  <br>  <br>  That girl knows she's made poor choices, she will probably always wonder "what if" if her life would of been different.. but for whatever reason she has chosen her own path and now has to live with it..|`|kZzasq1laa	I'd totally try to get you back.  Obviously she is very confused and is making bad decisions.|`|xxnfJ4hVaa	you can try and get back with her just be sure that you stay away if you smell drama or any type of trouble..good luck|`|08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	If your really that curious maybe you should go see her and ask her how she's doing? Maybe catch-up on old times? See if she is really happy, maybe she's single? You'll never know until you take the first step.
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	LOL welcome to being married with kids.. ur story is totally typical.. of a NORMAL marriage.. start making "us" time, and work on finding what once attracted u to him.. but no doubt its a two way street but maybe if u encourage the change up maybe he'll start changing back himself..|`|2JPRTMIJaa	I was with wife # 1 and having a helluva lot more probs than you are (including cheating and physical fights) at 6 years, and I hung on until 8. I am not saying someone else should tell you to run, you do have a family afterall. Only you can decide to leave or stay. I think that it's only going to get better if you both want it to.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If he's not willing to seek counseling, he has no interest in trying to work to save the marriage. And it's not worth sticking around if you are going to be miserable. Don't you think your kids pick up on that energy?|`|veZLfnGFaa	It's time to do something.  Whether you get out or not, you need to do something.  Talk to him and tell him that if he wants out, you agree. Either he's bored with you or he has found someone else and isn't man enough to tell you.  Get to the bottom of this or you will be more miserable than you are now.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Both of you have to be willing to work on your marriage, if either of you don't, then it is a lost cause and maybe you ought to leave for awhile and see what happens then, maybe he will see the light and start working with you on the marriage. Good luck.|`|uGEz4X0caa	I know exactly what you're going through.  I've been in my relationship for 14 years, and we can go through an entire day without saying a word to each other.  It's to the point now that he's completely detached from our kids (2), and he'd rather spend his nights on the computer and days sleeping.  I've tried everything and after years of trying, it's time to move on.  He has made it clear that this relationship isn't worth saving to him, he says he's happy just the way it is, but I'm not, and I don't want my kids thinking that this is how life is, so I'm ready to move on.  Good luck and think about what you want your kids to get out of life : )|`|xxnfJ4hVaa	HELL YEAH!!!<br>  <br>  when he cheated it was okay to try again that 1st time but if he is constantly doing it **** that.<br>  <br>  the 1st time he touched you you should have gotten his *** locked up... <br>  <br>  i am married and would not hesitate to lock up my husband if he thought about trying that ****<br>  <br>  he wont even deal with your kids..<br>  <br>  what kind of man, husband or father is that<br>  <br>  get out now and find a strong sexy man and rub it in his face when he trys to come running back to what he definitely does not deserve<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I asked the same question after finding out my husband cheated on me.|`|4vRTPnL1aa	well when you got married it was for good time and bad and right now its a bad time but not a time to run my husband and i have been married for 10 years and sometimes are better then others but its not ever the time to run or get out a relationship takes effort and even if he has no effort to put in you should try tell him again what bothers you and how you think you can change it try a weekend without the kids and its only the two of you try a dinner out try getting romantic cards to write little things in and give to him after work try any and everything you can think of before you think about running also is he to busy because of work school why is he so busy?? a lot of guys dont do the counseling thing good luck
sOpIMeJSaa	I like my Y/A friends, but those on MyYearBook.com are just to wild for my taste. They seen to have no manners at all. They want you to vote for them on their battles but if you vote for their competition then they want to cuss you out and stop writing to you, and chatting with you. They even have the nerve to post disparaging remarks on your site.|`|f2dkqemCaa	Mhmm they are truly amazing <br>  even if some are creepers irl :D|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	yes they doo!!|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	Oh yeah, I'm just wild about them.|`|fkgYL6TSaa	What about REAL friends ?|`|qb23ebljaa	mhm :B|`|A1pEScw8aa	No. I get happy talking to people in person.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	they dont do that to my day :(|`|lBe3zws1aa	yes i truly love them<br>  there amazing :)|`|HPAcASpOaa	I love mine!

b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Hello! he is just trying to get a rise out of you trying to see it you still have feelings for him.What better way to do that is to see if you can get the other person jealous.|`|fMEypXDYaa	It is over and he is just being spiteful towards you, and you don't need that in your life, so drop him and move on with your life, you'll find someone that will treat you with more respect than he is currently giving you.|`|08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	Men are re tared maybe he gave that response is because he wanted you to act all freaked out talking to other girls. Just think how he would react if you were talking to other men? Maybe you should give that a try?|`|a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	Sounds like you are handling it the right way. Move on with your life, if something happens later it happens.|`|3WcGhu7laa	I hate to say that but he is trying to break up with you or may be he wants to leave you.That's a reason he cuts you out completely.He is talking with other pretty women at front of you ,sorry dear this is not a sign of love between you and this guy.Don't let your self down ,find that person who don't try to jealous you,don't annoyed on you and speak with you in loving manner.|`|xxnfJ4hVaa	screw him move on he sounds like a big bowl of drama|`|4POGapREaa	Men like for women to be a little jealous now & again because it shows you at least care a little.  Not only are you acting like you don't give a sh!t, but you're even more than apathetic going out of your way to compliment the girls he's talking to.  There's no need for you to do that so it comes across like you're trying too hard to be secure.  It probably doesn't seem very genuine to him.|`|veZLfnGFaa	He's doing this to make you jealous and you aren't playing his game.  Keep it up - it's killing him.  lol   :)
2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Is your husband a total dumba$s?<br>  <br>  I mean, if he REALLY wanted to chat with a girl, AND he knew that you're snooping in his e-mail, wouldn't the logical thing be to create a "secret" e-mail address and carry out his activities there?<br>  <br>  Either you're over-reacting in a major way, or he's a complete and total idiot.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Sorry, but without trust your marriage will not work.|`|faT4MyVkaa	I would say you are not overreacting. He just sent his "lets meet up" picture via email. The only innocent scenario I can come up with is if he sent it to someone to say this is the pic he used to meet you, and I find that highly unlikely.|`|QfYhCYUTaa	No other explanation for that. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't have text. Now he has time to think up some bs story. Next time, call him and ask him point blank. If he stumbles around, you know he's lying.|`|8026ca5d065c0d69f3f5b183c53fe121aa	your suspicions are probably right!  You gotta remember How you met him.  He more than likely isn't going to give you an honest answer because he doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  if by chance he does admit to any wrong doing, then you guys need help or you need to bounce!  You already don't trust him and he shouldn't be doing anything that will put you back in that place.  If you want things to work out, try some counseling and don't check up on him anymore.  If something is really going on it will come out.|`|FeEU1IDOaa	If he flips out and shrieks at you that you were "snooping" or "spying", then he's cheating. But since he's taken so long to reply to you...I have to say that you're not overreacting. If he was innocent he'd want to clear up the misunderstanding right away. He's probably trying to figure out how best to turn it around on you, or what kind of lie to tell you.

8ab40e110856e04b57a0ea78b7f1ea14aa	Honestly.. I have been with my guy long enough that to put it bluntly.. the vanity has worn off..<br>  I have two kids to take care of, a house that needs constant attending to, and when night rolls around, sleep is WAY  more important than a monkey rub!<br>  I think there is always that fear that 'if I don't give it to him, he will get it somewhere else', but I'm just not interested..<br>  Not that I don't love him, because I do.. it's just no that important to me anymore!<br>  <br>  You did the right thing.. if it made him happy, it really didn't hurt you any.. I'm sure there are things that you want him to do that he really doesn't want to (this is me talking from experience) like shopping, or taking out the garbage.. LOL.. that's really something.. comparing sex to taking out the garbage!! :D<br>  <br>  But you know what I mean..<br>  <br>  <br>  OH, I also wanted to comment on him coming in at 7am, what was that about? And do you think that may be an underlying reason why you didn't want to have sex with him, that you were kinda upset... I would have been mad too.. and with-held!!!! :O|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	You should have your stand or else he will just continue to keep using you as a sex object and what about the thing that he was out all night mean???<br>  Is he creeping up on you too?|`|HoZYr3bXaa	What he is doing is manipulating you. He is telling you that he is horny, and that he really wants to be with you. It sounds like he's a sex addict. You need to be careful, because he may become obsessed with sex and your relationship could be ruined.<br>  Personally, I'd feel angry inside, but would let the boyfriend tell me how he felt, and talk it all over with him - so it's all out in the open, you know?|`|lK3TXGBOaa	OMG!!! thats bad you shouldnt've given him sex....thats kind of like rape.... why was he out all night? maybe he was with someone else? i recommend you tell him that if you dont feel like having sex you tell him good luck :) <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer my question?<br>   <br>  go to my profile under my questions its the first one that says <br>  <br>  " HELP!!! advice...."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it <br>  <br>  thanx:)|`|VQtKujZoaa	umm... why was he out until 7am?<br>  <br>  and no, that is not right... <br>  <br>  I have done it before just to make my bf of 2 1/2 years before...but not to that extreme..|`|yOyqYEPMaa	next time he duz that tel him to go jirk off or sumthing dont let him control u and if u giv it to him wenever he wants it youll never hav a choice!!|`|MWdBiGNjaa	You should only do it if you want to.  If he's going to beg you, then he doesn't appreciate you.  If he's gonna do this to you, then he's just been looking forward to sex for 3 years, and he's not a real boyfriend.  He thinks your a slut, and a person who caves in.  And by the way you did, he's gonna try to do more to you, and you've demonstrated to him slutty behavior, and now he has the complete wrong deception of you.  This isn't the first time he's going to try this, so you might as well get it straightened out now before it gets worse, cause if you don't, I guarantee that it WILL!!!..........|`|QBWiPLVnaa	That sounds fairly distrubing, but if he really respected you then he wouldn't force you into having sex with him. Just tell him straight up that you're not ready or you don't too. Don't let him pressure you into it. But, I guess now that you've already had sex with him, he's probably gonna come back for more. I think that should be time when you really just tell him. If you don't, this problem is just gonna linger on, and turn into a bigger problem.|`|73GkepzFaa	My first was like that, I just pretending to ignore him and go to sleep or tell him some excuse and let him pout then go to bed. Or if he wont shut up just sleep while he sexes you so he gets it over with. Some guys just aren't considerate when it comes to them getting off *shrug*|`|AA12265794	Haha... this Question mad me laugh.. haha...uhm... i've done that tooo may times... i find it kind of amusing for you to just have sex with him to shut up.. i do that sometimes too... and no it shouldn't make you feel violated because you love him, right? All the funny stuff about dating, i guess!!~ ^^|`|Ga2dMpB7aa	You should never do anything physically you don't want to do. Talk to your boyfriend about how you feel, if you don't want to be having sex at all. If he gets angry, he's a sex-crazed jerk, and you don't need to deal with that.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	You should only have sex when you want to|`|AA11317789	I'll usually compromise and do it even if I don't really feel like it. Just cause I love him and stuff :P|`|FFKbVKWDaa	dont do tht to urself<br>  if u dont want to then he shud respect that.|`|g0aoVHVHaa	I never allowed any guy to talk me into doing anything.  If he really likes you then he should understand that you don't really want to do sex or that sex at that time wasn't what you wanted to do because you were really beat.|`|AA10801621	you should do it only when you want to<br>  <br>  p.s. guys are really horny in the mornings not as much as later on in the day.|`|U51MjpBPaa	Never be forced into sex<br>  <br>  But why do you not want to have sex? If it's him perhaps you shouldn't be with him
62chOZxcaa	usually if the girlfriend of you brother is prudy decent friends with the girl you like then, odds are shes telling the truth.<br>  she like you, its so obvious, you should start showing her you like her back, or maybe you can ask her out on a date, w/o your brother and his gurlfriend<br>  <br>  btw can you help me out?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoUlixi8XYJt8PeNWkHOr.MazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307090310AAJHj9I">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|EdidZdtlaa	ask someone else to go ask her if she likes you but not to make it odvious that you ask them to ask her. and you could take her out on a date and see what happens between you two.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	she likes u for sure!!|`|bADza5pRaa	Eh if you ask me, you were at the wrong party if you were listening to techno music.

I would know.|`|dymHSSgVaa	Look at it this way, if she wasn't into you she would have gone dancing with you, holding you hands the whole time. She definitely sees something that she likes about you. Take her out on some one on one time alone, maybe lunch? Get to know her some more!|`|Wud0BJZOaa	Well it sounds like she does like you. Look at the little things. Does she make eye contact when you talk to her? Does she laugh at your jokes? Does she tease you but in a nice way? It's those things that matter. Well I do hope that helps. Good Luck!! ; )|`|kkytrDB2aa	she definately likes you...if you want more verification, try asking your brothers gf if she has said anything to her....girls talk! :)|`|qgXaWVMKaa	tell her you like her but dont push her to response give her time she will say yes..<br>  good luck :)|`|AA10801621	she does like you if shes talking to you so much and hanging out with you that much|`|2GRbmTo5aa	Ask her out!|`|FFKbVKWDaa	ask her out and see wat she sais<br>  u got nothing to lose=]
3qxg10Tpaa	More you shave the easier it become, here are some tips so this does not happen again. <br>  Make sure you take a warm shower or bath first, this way your pores will open up and also it will make you hair softer too.<br>  While in the shower,use shaving gel for sensitive skin and just shave gently don't go over more than twice.<br>  Do not shave against your hair line.<br>  After you done shaving,wash it with cold water that way all the  pores will shrink and it will eliminate any chances of getting ingrown hair.<br>  After that use some moisturizer or goldbond powder. <br>  You can use goldbond powder to stop itch right now too.<br>  Never use dull razor and do not shave dry ever or with cold water.<br>  Actually, it is the same way your shave your face|`|BvBwcdziaa	dont shave that stupid!! just trim shaving itchs to much<br>  <br>  agree that you will trim instead of just letting it grow <br>  <br>  its a win win situation|`|Pclz0z9Qaa	it always itches when it starts to grow back|`|76m8ZVS7aa	You could let it grow back and use a trimmer instead.

KgKVWv9paa	in your email responses to her tell her you don't want her to  contact you anymore and any further contact they will be taken as harassment. keep these email and texts that way you have documented proof.  if she persists, then yeah go to the police and get some kind of restraining order for no contact, if there is anything along those lines.<br>  <br>  another thing you can do is change your cell number, this should be free, it was for me, but a pain in the *** to get the new # to your friends.  only give the new number to friends you trust not to give it to her.|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	Call the police.|`|1T1rI8Vvaa	y would u call da police she didn't commit a crime.jus tell her n a nice way how u feel and hopefully she'll understand where u comin frm|`|H6GIYDdzaa	Call the police, what?<br>  <br>  Are you stupid or something it's not like she's going to come round your house and rape you or do something illegal.<br>  <br>  Wait what am I saying of course you're an idiot you broke up with a girl because another girl simply looked better.<br>  <br>  If you call the police then you're just wasting their time and they're not going to take you seriously.<br>  <br>  And this isn't really stalking, your Ex probably misses you. God knows why, but just tell her you don't like her anymore.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Is she threatening you, showing up at your house, following you?  Or is she just using your number to bug you?  If it's just the second one, I would say change your number and go from there.  If she starts doing the first one call the cops.|`|b1b2189c8ba661d29c84f87088fa4ee8aa	Give her a warning  that if she dose not leave you a lone you will go to the police|`|lTFS226Laa	ye call the cops
vn2Lq7hIaa	Sure you can get bored with boyfriends interest and discussions about<br>  electronics. He gets just as bored when you and your girlfriends talk about girlie things. When the two of you get together you should try to<br>  talk about things more intimate to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|4Za26NTDaa	Sounds like me and my boyfriend, actually identically. <br>  The best thing is to support his passions. He loves it, and chances are he's just excited and wants to share that with you. <br>  What I do, after getting bored, is just sit there are stare at him, and think about how cute he is when he gets passionate about it. <br>  When you can no longer fake interest-tell him how cute he is.<br>  Sometimes you just have to bear it- he loves it, and he'll love it if you are even remotely interested in it.|`|AA10477412	I'm sure Bill Gates girlfriend felt the same way, but Melinda Gates was smart enough to know to listen and parlay the investment|`|6xmIPYimaa	not at all. i would feel the same way too.|`|73GkepzFaa	Wow way too long I skimmed it. If he has a passion for something and you think its just overwhelming nerd talk then that's a big bend in your relationship. Couples should have commonalities in the parts that make them who they are. He's into computers and tech stuff, you watch the Kardashians. Big gap there. Atleast have respect for him if you love him. If it's a problem you guys wont be together for long, sorry.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	When my husband starts talking like that, I sing, "He's a super geek! super geek! He's super geekie, yow!" (daaa dadada--dada--dada) Or I say, "It's all geek to me".  (he gets it)<br>  bwahahaha<br>  Ah well, at least geeks stay employed pretty well....<br>  Part of the problem is you don't understand the technical details, or why they are exciting, and you guys need to find a meeting place in things that you both understand and have in common.  It's silly for him to overwhelm you with geek speak.|`|5EIrFbHkaa	Wecome to the men's world. <br>  If it not be with computers or tech will be on cars, footbal, golf, sports, nasa, aliens, naked girls or action or fight movies.<br>  You have to give the boys some space, but after that you say: I'm not interested on it! and the boy has to compreend your wishes or taste. But if you try to impose your taste or girls wishes to man will be disastrous, he will be bored and dislike you. <br>  So, if you will be the glue to the relation you will have to intelligently make some spaces in the relation and find your better places and discover what you have in commom so the empty spaces will be filled with what the both like.<br>  With time he will discover better your personality too and what you like and little by little will desire to go to your world.<br>  If you two don't discover anything that you have in commom taste, well, don't exists any love that sustain this relation.|`|vJCPoSHBaa	No it's not wrong, if u feel bored u should ask him not to talk about it if yr still bored u should just dumo him you don't want to be dating someone whose boring when u could be out there dating new more interesting guys.
19e9e2869ffff110b0026e269e6b67b2aa	Choosing to use signs to get someone you love back is less potent because is is deniable and nobody enjoys being beaten twice. If you want someone back in your life tell her expressly that you want her back There is nothing to lose. Pride is likely to make you deprive yourself of what is good. It has happened to me before, even when I had the chance to get what was lost back on a platter of gold, pride still deprived worked against me. However, If you insist on signs try showing true love and genuine concern.|`|AA12245572	Tell her I want her back in my life, us guys are just that simple.|`|7436f525e7b327837193183ebebfb4f8aa	call her frequently....invite her out....talk to her friends about how much you miss her.....send her flowers....etc.......

Take my advice.  Don't do the training thing.  Don't ever train or be trained by another person. It dehumanizes people.  A person should like you for who and how you are, not for their image of what you need to be.<br>  <br>  Be you.|`|5f5520831211cea0585336a5ee6df7f1aa	Hey, Ali,<br>  <br>  I say that if he's not interested in the same thing you are, or vice-versa, then he's not worth your time and interest.  It's so important to have the same interests.  If you don't, you won't have much to talk about later, you know?  Best of luck to you!|`|AA12321831	Chances are, if he stopped talking to you when you stopped sharing that interest, then that was probably the only thing he found interesting about you.  Some guys have a one track mind like that.  Try talking to him some more to see if you have any other shared interests.  If that was the ONLY reason why he was interested in talking to you, though, you may be better off spending your time elsewhere of making a new friend in someone else.|`|7b98a2a9f547ef8095b2ba656cb90ac2aa	In your case the feel was not together properly you were saying somthing that he didnot like.|`|AA10934009	to me it sounds like you gave up on something that you were working on...maybe that's what turned him off because it made you come across as a quitter|`|AA11007767	It seems your "connection" with this fellow is based on an interest in video games.

It doesnt really hurt since adequate anesthesia is administered. They take an instrument that would widen the opening of the uterus. Once the dilatation is completed, a curette which is a long flat metal instrument is inserted into the uterine cavity to gently scrape off the lining of the uterus in order to get a tissue sample. That sample would then be sent to the laboratories for examination<br>   <br>  There actually is nothing to worry about! The procedure won't be long and as I have said, you wouldnt feel anything since you are under anesthesia!

You are not alone.|`|AA11500013	she want him... but it is always like that.... it is as if ur dad is ok with ur boyfriends.. it is logically impossible|`|AA11779750	====DO NOTHING =====<br>  ** find fresh one who has his own mind to think ***<br>  -----all the best dear!!--------|`|AA12020399	sounds like to me that you are better off without him, because he is listening to that moron friend that doesnt even know you

839e8fa285cd49d5038282f5c2981277aa	You need to talk to her and find out what's the problem. You're not going to get anywhere trying to gift your way out of this. You need to sit down and determine what is the problem. Two years with out sex is a very long time , maybe too long, If she doesn't want to have sex with you there are probably a lot of issues. Either work on your relationship or get out.|`|19e14050cdabaa19a1da8157c1e21ca4aa	leave her ,she want to have her cake and eat it to|`|281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	Yes plenty of it even after children but as said before there are ups and downs just keep at it but don't be pushy|`|AA11459370	I think the older you get the better it gets.|`|AA12061985	gosh, yes.|`|bad8746f90c84a89ddd263c8832d8376aa	I been married 8 years and we swing from the ceiling fan regularly. There's low and high points. Sometimes one or both of you just don't feel all that "connected". Don't give up. Do things together that COULD lead to sex, but don't push for it. This way theres no pressure on anyone. Take a shower together or give her a massage. Cook her dinner or better yet, take her out. Summer's here... go hit a drive in movie, those are fun to make out at :) Good luck and happy humping.|`|AA11537569	Yes, there is.  What is it with you and 2 yrs.  I don't know many men that would put up with not having sex for 2 yrs and married.  It's time for counseling.  Keep loving on her but get some counseling for the both of you.|`|AA12107979	Try helping with dishes. Tell her that you'll clean the kitchen while she enjoys a nice long bath. Don't expect her to jump your bones the first time that you do this. It may take a couple of times. Make sure that you give her time alone to relax, I promise you it will pay off in the end.
AA11558244	omg it was great...... me and my bf we were in my room adn i went close to hug him and i slowly reached my lips to his.. my heart was poudinng rele fast czu it was my first time. as we were kissing it turned into a french kiss. he put me against da wall. i was feeelin him everywhere. same w/ him. den we fell onda bed.. and soon undresssed and he slowly pulled up my thong it felt so goood....... ugh i wish we could do dat again... :))|`|AA11537569	It was scaring because it was the first time that I had really kissed a boy but it was nice.  No, indeed I did not make the first move.|`|3a839d32d2c80c56a40ed3f160d1defdaa	It wa the best kiss the me and my girlfriend shared when we was alone together until her mother found out and she got mad at her.|`|AA11307826	It was kind of like a "we'll both close our eyes and poke out our lips" thing.|`|e49618b1d67d2df8990f254c1b414c7caa	I did not make the first move <br>  & i felt so good & imbarised <br>  i wished that he make it again

YO3Jhg1aaa	It's just a glance right now. If you want to know if she likes you, you need to investigate further. Right now, she might just be intrigued by you. Your looks, attitude, or maybe your character attract her. She might have also just heard something drop or someone say something and she turns her head to see what happened. Ok, hope this helps!|`|CNIGozwOaa	umm........... if she does it a lot then i would say that more than likely she has at least some feelings for you! :)|`|29YC0kspaa	That's what girls do when they want to get a better look at a guy or when they think that a guy is hot :D|`|pbFzeUdoaa	No, this is not an indication that she likes you. She could've just been looking.

AA10398402	hees a flirtatious guy what can anyone say...|`|AA10789506	Sounds like hes just a ladies man who may never be satisfied with either of you.  Find another guy.<br>  Good luck!|`|AA11476807	He's just flirting!  It's fun!  He has no commitments to you and you have none to him!  Nothing wrong with that!
AA11154006	social pressure, low self esteem, the only way they think they gonna win over guys.....not a positive sign of a respectable person....|`|AA11537569	It's call having a fling or better yet one night stands.|`|AA11070406	where are you going - let us all know|`|AA12196704	Ask them points
AA11899189	Get his cell phone bill and look to see if there's any numbers that are there that you don't reconize and call it.|`|AA11537569	Well, first of all you can ask him to see if he will tell you.  If that doesn't work you can follow him around or hire someone to do it.  And that way you can find out who it is if he's actually having affair.|`|AA11549317	Check cellphone, check his car, get a PI|`|5428f4c501ef344858c6f46862f19904aa	there are various things that you can do to find out.  One is to get the cell phone bill.  It list every outgoing and incomming call.  You can see if he calls one number repeatedly everyday.  Also remember that usually this wont be a 2-3 minute phone call.  The second thing is to look at the credit card bill.  Check to see what he is doing when your not around and what he is buying.  3.) check the bank records ( how much cash is he taking out of the atm machine).  This alone will let you know if he is not being faithful to you.  If you need to know who it is - the cell phone records will work but it wont tell you who unless you can recognize the voice.  Borrow a friends car one day and follow him around.  I hope it turns out that you were mistaken|`|AA12107015	yes and with sally next door
AA11537569	I guess you can look on the internet.

AA10182431	Sometimes you just have to take things into your own hands.  Unfortunately there are swings and ebbs in every ones sex drive and it doesn't always correspond with your partners so you just have to make due.|`|AA12167219	Talk to him and tell him how you feel.  Let him know that you need more sex and even though your pregnant you are still in the mood.  He might just feel weird about having sex with you while your pregnant - or he might be afraid he will hurt the baby.  Talk to your doctor about it if thats the case and have your doc tell your hubby all the information he needs to know.|`|AA11537569	Wow, 10 - 20 minutes and you are complaining.  I should be so lucky.  Just tell him that because you are pregnant, you need  it more.  Good luck!!!
AA10718820	SCHOOL|`|AA11998688	Your school years are the beast years of your life.<br>  To put it bluntly your schooling is for your future...|`|AA10124391	This doesn't ring true to me.  Why would you be suspended from school for not taking a placement test?  The worst that could really happen is you need to re-schedule for the test.  <br>  <br>  If it is true, then your work isn't being fair, or you aren't being true to your employer.  If you can, find someone else to take your shift at work and work for them on your day off.<br>  <br>  If this truly is a "one and only choice of work or school" then I'd take the school route and find another job.
bc17920bbd922f6ed1772a53b96d7a6daa	Every woman is different but the most important things to me physically is confidence and knowledge about your body.  A guy could be the Roc but if he's uncomfortable with his own bod it's unattractive.  Also if a guy is Dexter but he's confident, knowledgeable and sweet he's more likely to get women.|`|AA12365145	because guys look phyiscaly in a woman too..|`|AA12005520	well i like the surfer look <br>  kinda easy going semi long<br>  hair with a nice tan...<br>  no surfer "lingo" though<br>  and for the clothes; <br>  shorts, vans or other skater shoes<br>  and a shirt(dont clash though)|`|AA12147065	whatever u do don't tearn into an Emo and start styling your hair.

There has to be a reason it is hurting her. Are you making sure she climaxes before you enter her? She has to be really wet or it will hurt her badly! Use ky jelly too and buy her some orgasm beads. Also have her talk to her doctor about this too! You need to please her first and do things to please her and make her happy romantically and in bed too.

My husband for example has no complaints there.|`|AA12275978	Those who say that are insecure about their man's love and loyalty to them. Because if you really wants to make love, its because you like it with him and not for other reasons. Satisfaction, although never happens in many, should be experienced by both not just one.

The casino owner is laughing behind your back.<br>  <br>  A guys is supposed to believe that he has to somehow "convince" her to have sex and then she one day "grants" his wish like she is doing him a favor....while she is getting multiple orgasms and he gets ..........one.<br>  <br>  What a crock.

I personally like those that are not too muscular.|`|AA11668765	Not too muscular but not like all flap so yeah.|`|AA11804634	i do, but only because it shows they have drive and dedication in what they do. but i like skinny boys too, really skinny ones|`|AA12008763	I prefer muscular men!|`|AA12144055	Yes...I like a guy with muscles but not too buff (like pro wrestlers, shutter)  but either an athleitc body type or a guy with a medium body frame who is a little buff...but I do love muscles on guys.|`|43b369d9c3fcdff1bff50c0d6c486139aa	Somehow, Yes!

Nothing mysterious about it, sweat on its own doesn't smell, but left to its own devices it will produce a smell, some stronger than others, depending on the person.|`|AA11418483	omg omg omg what a question ..... u dont really wanna know do ya!!!!!!|`|AA12353060	nooooooooooooooooooooor|`|bcab731d9ee5fc44145199eb43fefd2baa	Ha ha .. wow ... what made you compose such a Q?<br>  thanks for making me laugh i have been crying .. and as far as i know..<br>  Question like yours make us stink...lol|`|c4972dcdcccfb6617ce8040f30ec07c0aa	You can tell your immaturity...women don't have stinky feet!

AA10762620	yeah.....|`|AA11200878	Makeup...<br>  <br>  High neck sweater...<br>  <br>  Ask the person to do it somewhere else on your body that can't be seen... ;)|`|AA11537569	I can't remember something about a spoon.  But makeup is good way to hide.  If not, trying wearing something with a collar to hide it.|`|AA12258013	Cover it up with make up.....foundation. If you keep letting people suck the hell out of you, you won't get rid of them. It goes away on its own. Nothing will get rid of it, you just have to let the clogged up blood go away. Its like a bruise. So suck it up....and stop letting people suck you.|`|AA12285832	comb it out|`|AA12363243	i'm the master of this.   three ways.  1)  use ice, or put a spoon in the freezer and hold it on the hickey.  2)  take a lip stick cap and put the open end over the hickey and twist it to almost make a suction (this one works really well).  3)  go to the store and buy some skin colored lipstick.  but, if you do the first to correctly, you'll have nothing to worry about.
AA11553241	you must be pretty lonely and desperate. plus, i don't htink girls will date someone with the nickname "player".|`|AA11992193	Nope!GOD bless you.|`|660e44e48a2567f3b376dd927fc750c1aa	first pick a name other than player we girls dont like to be played.<br>  and i am married so i cant|`|AA10838743	hey sure why not but first we have to talk my email address is dena_brown@sbcglobal.net|`|AA10913954	Umm probably not your name is "player" ha that's funny|`|AA12284192	That is not a proper question|`|AA11335026	sure. how old r u and and ya hung like a donkey?|`|AA11551882	What girl would go out with a name like "Player?"  he he he|`|AA11905294	hey sure y not as long as you're not like your name player and what is your asl hey if you are going to go out with me e-mail me at kelly1993@charter.net or at lyn2norton@yahoo.com love ya
AA11537569	One way to see if you have what it takes.....try your routine out on your friends (girls only) and get there input and watch their reactions.  Make sure that you have your routine together.  It's more to stripping than taking off your clothes.  Good luck.|`|AA11899189	Go for an audition and they'll tell you what you've got to offer is good enough or not.
AA12319981	My girl certainly does..  It'll be like 2 hours later, and we'll be out doing something, and she'll lean over and say something like "I'm ripping"  with a big smile on her face.  It's certainly fun for me, and I like the look when I'm finished.  I would STRONGLY suggest though that you ask first before giving her the ol' creampie, or else you might see a much bigger frown then smile.|`|106a26eab3cd9ebfb3a76c44f5ad218eaa	umm...no..i think its gross...|`|96cbb3400adf35a5d7f3196ddae61ff0aa	If you think so, it must be.<br>  <br>  Does anyone think this is so?<br>  <br>  Why are there no ladies answering yes to this question?

Otherwise I would only if it is a considerable lie that prevented you from considerable financial security.|`|AA11133811	It wouldn't exactly be re-opening a divorce, since the divorce is final, though if you have proof of him lying, you can certainly fight for what you deserve to be fair, given there is new information which could affect the judges decision. Since I'm no attorney, I wouldn't know what forms might need to be filed in order to accomplish this. My best suggestion would be to hire an attorney and consult with them on this issue. Good luck!|`|AA11240201	hope you have your lawyer on speed dial

359b66eaf8de2fdacd0e6ada474dff16aa	Well not exactly. Alot of men are afraid of offending the woman. I had a 6 yr old son when my husband and I got married. At 1st he was afraid of making me or my son mad. They need to have a bond with the children and earn their trust. Just take it slowly. I would not push the subject on him. Just let him take things at his own pace. It's alot for a man to take on, but if he's in love with you and he's in it for the long haul then he will come around. Be patient. I did and my son couldn't ask for a better step-father.|`|3a71b3a254a390925874431b0f2a1a38aa	Men dont like other men in their ex's life to dicipline their children. Thats the real Dads responsibility. Even though the real Dad isnt around we guys have a hard time stepping on that turf just the same. But if they get unruly enough the paternal instincts will kick in after time and he will step up to the plate. If he truely loves you then he will love the children and the instinct will take over. Give it time.|`|AA11616474	I am in the same situation.  I have two children, one boy one girl, who's father also passed away.  My husband has a hard time disciplining them.  He just doesn't feel comfortable.  He will if it is really needed but it has to really really be needed in order for him to say something.  We met and got married fast so it may be a little different for you but I think it will get better with time.  He also has a son and I hate to discipline him.  I am just afraid I will fall into that stereotype of the evil stepmom.  My kids were older when their biological dad died so I can kind of see where my husband might be a little more hesitant about it.  The comment you mentioned though, "they aren't my kids" seems like a cop out to me.  He should, out of love and respect for you, realize that they are pretty much his kids especially if you are married or going to be married.  I looked at it as a package deal.  If you want to be with and love me then you have to want my kids and love them too.<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, when this was really on my mind, I tried doing some research on it and Dr. Phil says that stepparents shouldn't discipline their stepkids, only the biological should.  Can't say I agree but thought I would put it out there.|`|AA11749277	if he loves you he should except the children as his own if you move further on in your relationship it is a package deal|`|AA12048147	sit down and talk to this man...... there may be other reasons why he refuses to act in the function of father to these 2 little guys...... he may not know how...... or he might want them to like him and is afraid they wont if he acts like a dad....... reassure him it is ok....... talk it out....... let him know that being a parent is rewarding in its own way..... if he needs help. ask him to talk to other fathers and maybe get him some parenting books...... support groups are a wonderful way to get the help he needs....... getting input from other step dads etc.......... God bless|`|AA12167219	He should have nothing to be afraid of at all - he would be their only father figure.  Just because they aren't his biological kids doesn't mean he can't be their dad.  He should have a problem being a dad to them if he loves you - he also should love them.<br>  You should talk to him about it and see whats holding him back from being a father.  You need to let him know that he has the right to tell them what to do/talk to them and be their father.  Saying that they aren't his kids isn't an excuse and if he loves you he should want to be a part of their lives.
AA12180726	Don't say it is anyones fault, say it is alright. Talk it over and learn from your mistakes. Tell him how you feel and listen to his side. After all, your only human.|`|8bbf5a4526c6ad8b5986d046e620ff4eaa	Seriously, beer, food and nudity are the way to most mens hearts.

Guys don't hold grudges long, all he needs is to be reminded what he's missing out on.|`|AA11381110	have him come to your house and discuss the recent events by a burning candle, then apoligize and let him say his sorries as well. hope that helps!<br>  good luck!|`|AA12109975	It really depends on the situation.

AA11427901	How do you feel when he's around? Happy, sad, uneasy? Ask yourself that first, then when you found the answer, just go with it. If you feel uneasy when he's around, tell him to please give you some space, if you feel sad, tell him that you don't like him hanging on you. If you feel happy, then return the hug.|`|56d0d2eda3f545e68c5580a9672d3985aa	Well if you still harbour the same feelings for him as you did before, go for it!

If so, no matter how much flirting he does, you can't get all wrapped up in your feelings for him again.   If the reason is no longer an issue, and you've heard from him that he's on the same page as you now....go for it.  But go slow and make sure it's really what you want.  You don't want to invest time and emotions only to break up again.    Good Luck!|`|e63d5dc791c25b88a84e57ff77161d87aa	I would be very careful here. <br>  <br>  You damaged his ego by breaking up the other way around.<br>  <br>  My feeling is he will do anything to get you back and then wam.<br>  <br>  They say we  the female race are complicated but I have yet to see anything as complex and complicated as the male species.<br>  <br>  Stay away and go meet other men.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

And if she doesnt well its not worth you trying so hard when she doesnt care. Long distnace relationships are hard and both people have to be commmited to it or else its just a waste of time.|`|AA11662284	yes,at present.|`|24781fbf61bba55d6c992147572cc493aa	Communication is key to any relationship even if its a long distance one. It probably wont work out b/c people change so much from day to day. Talk to her about how you feel and go from there.. Good luck!|`|AA10683844	in my experience a long distance relationship has never worked because you can't be there to give them what they need no matter how much you talk. if your serious with her and you think she's the one then you might have to move or she will. also you have the risk that she's already found someone else. good luck!!!!|`|AA10990828	Well babe it's not much you can do by it being a long distance and all.  I never supported long distance relationships, unless it's under five months.  She has probably got herself busy, remember she is in a new place, new faces, new things to do.  If you want you can wait it out be supportive don't give up and when she gets tired, and things get old, that's when she will remember you.  Hope and pray that no one has come in to the picture with smooth talk.

EVER!!!!!!!!!<br>  They enjoy the chase, if he is in to you he will call you.<br>  Don't you watch OPray?

If you feel like he's not interested, dtop calling him. But, if he likes to listen to you and is intersted, you should continue to call him. Guys don't like to talk on the phone so it's more comfortable for him to be called than to do the calling.|`|1c628efff2a6f2b9068127b8d7124357aa	stop the calling right away and if he call you back he is interested, if no, move on and don't waste your time.|`|AA10903912	Dear MissLady,<br>  You should probably not stop calling.

That is a good indicator that the guy is not the right one for you. Leave him alone! I've been through this myself once or twice, and I still pursued. They ended up being the worse relationships ever! These men are disrespectful, cheaters, and lovers of themselves. Please sweetie, move on. If he starts to call you the same exact way you did him, then maybe you can reconsider, but I seriously doubt that he is going to do that. Sorry.|`|b80e80a846076675356cad377f0ebd98aa	NOW  STOP CALLING HIM MEN LIKES TOO CHASE NOT BE CHASE.

If she complains a lot, step back, look in the mirror, look to see how much you help around the house, how much attention you give her, how much time you spend with others when you could be with family.  If she has a ligitimate reason, you should change.  The first thing of all is to COMMUNICATE.  Do not accuse her.  Start by saying, I am having a problem.  I really feel lousy when you complain.  Is ther something I am doing that could help>  Give it a try.  Good luck
AA11584516	I find that that is not always the case, but for some reason women are generally smaller then men, I don't know, maybe its because men are the hunters and women are the care-takers, who knows, lol.|`|AA10213441	Because women are generally smaller than men in most aspects of their looks.|`|61c1f7e67adfd6b88fc5f9b572b5acf9aa	cause she should not run away from man.

059eeee3f63499110e2b3a8c02597c97aa	When she's "complaining" to you....are u giving her advice? Is she asking for advice.....I sometimes vent to my bf, about my work especially, and sometimes that's ALL I wanna do is vent, to get it all out......sometimes I do want his advice on how I should handle the situations......just feel her out....see what she wants from you......now that my bf knows not to give me advice every time I open my mouth, I know he does care, b/c I feel he's taking the time to listen.......not just jump to a "solution"|`|0ef896ab0c460df7beeceac1bc9afaecaa	If she is complaining about her work, listen to what she is trying to say and try to ask open questions like:<br>  1. What is upsetting you about your work?<br>  2. Can something be done about the problem you are having?<br>  3. Is there someone who you think can help you about this situation?<br>   if you have any suggestions to offer, do so. It may not solve her problem or complaint but it shows that you are listening to her and concern for how she feels.  If you are at loss and nothing comes to mind, comfort her by saying, "Everything will work out eventually. Just try to be cool about it.  Maybe it's not as bad as you may think." Give her a hug and tell her not to worry so much.<br>  At the right time, crack a joke and try to make her laugh. Laughter can ease the tension.Or tell her that you understand how she feels and ask her if she would like a shoulder massage to loosen her up. Remember when a person is upset about something, they will tense up.  <br>  <br>  If she is not happy with her work, suggest that she could try looking for a better job which she would like to do.<br>  <br>  Life is too short to be spent complaining about things you may or may not be able to change...Good Luck!|`|AA11239388	you drop it. and eventually she will too.<br>  stop bringing it back up every time she is upset. that might not be why!!!<br>  just show her how much you care. do not mention anything bad, or that might bring her dow, just be sweet to her, and do your best to make her happy. she will realize what you are doing, and that alone will cheer her up a little. so don't give up, stay as happy as you can, and if you are in a good mood around her, it should rub off!|`|AA11596276	try to be with her as often...  and never get tired of assuring her...  that everything is all right...  and how much you care for her...  i know she would get your point and would realize...  that you are more important in her life....  than her work that stressed her out|`|fe0328d7c67b8dcbf45ff1b46ed4f12aaa	take her in your arms and tell her exactly what u said there and give her a kiss afterwards. always works for me.|`|2c4ac782d4517eab55fbebfb100aca12aa	Why dont you take her somewhere she wont complain.|`|AA11635302	Play her the song by Neo..called when your mad. Take her out, show her you really care. Heck, rent a motel room just for the hell of it and spend alone time with her and sweep her off her feet. Do something extra special to take her mind of the problem and give her good things to think about.|`|AA12054351	I think you just answered your own question.  Just be honest and tell her that it isn't her but specifically her work.  As far as the depression, try to remain positive and constantly remind her that you are supportive of her decisions.|`|AA10379259	Don't refer to it as complaining.
858f24126ac9f92443ab2d671a1a2ee7aa	It's definitely society.  I mean look at TV these day vs back in the day.  Or like radio talk.  Not to mention 80% of marriages are divorces.  I think ppl just get way to drunk or do drugs and that's what leads them too it.  Guys are very seductive as well|`|AA11018990	they want to wait for the right person, and when they get married they think that this will be the person tehy want to spend the rest of their life with, unlike when they are not married, they just have, well lets say a boyfriend, they are not sure how long it will last, so she doesnt want to have sex, because, if she does, most likely yall will break up and she just gave herself away.. hope i helped..???|`|AA11537569	Because guys keep putting pressure on women to give it up and sad to say some fall victim to it and others just want to do it anyway.  Look at everything around us.......sex sales.  It sells food, cars, videos, music, etc.  So there you have it.
AA10700604	Hello goldbaddy,<br>  <br>  Supposedly that's what you need to do to communicate with your sex partner.  He only wants to please you and be sure that you are getting some orgasms out of it too.  Most guys can't tell if a woman is experiencing an orgasm or not  He is a considerate lover.  Most guys don't talk while they're having sex.  They are concentrating on getting their nut, so maybe you need to start seeing them to get a full appreciation of a guy that is a considerate lover.<br>  <br>  Other people really like their partners talking dirty to them while having sex, or at least to tell them how sexy they are and how much you are turning them on.  It sounds like you don't really get off on that.<br>  <br>  If it really bothers you so much, you need to discuss this with him, hopefully not in the bedroom.  Tell him that when he talks to you in bed that it distracts your mind off having an orgasm.  So, it would be better if he kept quiet during sex.  You will need to re-assure him that he's doing a great job in bed.  Maybe you can have a non-verbal sign that everything is cool, keep it up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  --Rick|`|AA12377184	Forget the "how you feelin'" talk - talk nasty to each other....yeah....baby.....that's what I'm talk'n bout....|`|1ea4af7e296a9d5fe9676819ac8b9d57aa	he talks during sex????<br>  <br>  <br>  .....expect a coming out of the closet party SOON|`|AA11537569	Grab his butt and other body parts and ask him how does he feel.

But, she doesn't do it all the time...definitely not to the point where it's effecting our relationship so, I just play along.  If it's really getting to you, I guess you could talk to him about it.  I've got an idea that would be more fun though.  Next time he tries to start a conversation while you're trying to get off, just grab him by the back of the head (assuming your facing each other), look him straight in the eyes, and in your most evil, exorcist voice tell him through grit teeth..."SHUT UP AND F*CK ME!"<br>  That way, he gets a little bit of dirty talk out of you, you get your point across, and he shuts the hell up.<br>  Be sure to let us know how that goes. :)|`|AA11440256	if u wanna talk more email me at kane011592@yahoo.com|`|AA11960701	practice with phone sex|`|AA12237162	keep his mouth occupied like making him eat that p*ssy cuz thats the way i do it i be concentraiting on that big dick i be riding i be like who daddy **** me i give my man a lap dance a head job and do many tricks on that dick cuz i luv sex i be like f*ck me hard and he makes me screams his name baby just keep yo man occupied he eats my p*ssy real good though i aint gone lie we **** everynite then he *** all ova my face whick i luv that cuz i eat *** but anywayz when me and him having sex he puts that big dick in me lord his dick so big he make me scream i be like ooh daddy f*ck me hard come on daddy|`|d0d638f3751b71afb307fcc673c05aebaa	This tactic is being used by him to distract himself from the climaxing to soon.

AA10892166	I think you're right that you can only like the "idea" of a person until you actually meet them. So many things about a person seem good on paper, as they say, but until you actually meet them, you don't really know who they are. Love includes taking the bad about the person as well as the good, and you won't really get the whole picture over the internet or the phone. Plus, unless you are physically attracted to a person, I don't think you can love them either. <br>  <br>  I recently met a girl through email, and I actually thought for a little while that I might like her, but after about a week, I realized that I just liked the idea of her. Anyway, hope this helps.|`|1f0082d1e0c22c1cb19797c08410220daa	Have you never seen "You've Got Mail"!  My wife makes me watch with her a couple of times a year.  It's a sweet movie.  Sure, I think that people can learn to care about each other through mail and conversation with never seeing each other.  As a matter of fact, it can be noted that it makes things more true because the question of looks is taken away and only substance is left.|`|53070c04932ac343d60c96f7bbd97619aa	I think love comes in all shapes and sizes.<br>  You love your parents, but not in the same way as you love your husband.  You love your friends but in a different way as your family and your significant other.<br>  I believe that you can love someone's personality and who they are as a person without seeing them.|`|749aad2c9d82c71da09459b68f0c4ecdaa	my bf said he felt "love at first sight" whn he saw me....i didnt think this was possible...I was like 12....he searched and found me after 3 yrs of r first encounter.....and ive been with him since....been 5 yrs :-) infactuation draws u towards someone...it doesnt tell u if u love them or not....my bf was infactuated...he followed his heart and found love out of it....now we're togther and going to get engaged soon....this stuff happens to SOME ppl not everyone...i guess its whatever is in ur faith....nothing to stress over...let god do his job :-)|`|14765f9fde5da757b84993af442ee358aa	i think you could love the person to a certain degree. love is manifested in degrees of intensity. thats why we can love our family and love our pets and love our lovers but in different ways. so i think if you dont ever see the person face to face then you are loving the personality or spirit of that person. and that is possible. but what kind of relationship is that? the relationship can never get to the level of intensity as it would if you were in physical proximity because something is exchanged with real human contact. without that contact you are always imagining or anticipating what it will be like. but you will never know until you really get there with them. <br>  <br>  so, to sum up. yes, you can love someone on a certain level without ever seeing the person face to face.|`|21087885f7e3aa42c27124dac180558eaa	I think it's possible. Like with some online relationship you can get to know somebody better then you could have if you were seeing eachother. Some people can be more open about things when they don't see someone. However I think people can also lie about who they are so it just depends on the person. <br>  I've known a couple people who started dating online before they met and some of them have even gotten married.|`|dbda261cedc5a9496e21dee17fdc1de7aa	true love at first sight. nothing you SHOULD go by. but it can always happen. meeting someone over the internet takes time for someone to fall in love with them. although it's not impossible. i feel in love with my fiance over the internet. now we're getting married next year. talk to the person your talking to and see if he/she feels the same way.<br>  hope this answered your question.|`|AA10189606	that's not love if you can love someone today and forget about them tomorrow|`|AA11537569	That's not love.  That's infatuation.   Infatuation is when you talk or email someone and like how they sound and what they write and then the next week you have moved on to another infatuation.  It is not real.   Love is not here one day and gone the next.  Its much easier to fall in love with someone, it can happen all of a sudden but to get out of love takes almost a life time (or at least it seems like a lifetime).

AA10201831	Well 6 years love is not a simple thing to say.you both love each other very much. but the only thing disturbing you is the silly things which you made in the past.you need not feel guilty in this issue bcoz any girl in that situation would do that.now what you have to do is tell him that u won't do anything which makes him insecure in your relationship. And behave at him as he likes and let him know that you wont be leaving him at any moment in life coz you love him so much.try to get close to him in all moments to reduce his mental disturbance gradually.share good things and do something which you feel good and happy for both of you.take him to some special place to share divine love. I think your bf is loving you so much.this disturbance will go away the days go.if you get problem with this then take him to some sychologist but i dont think u would need this.and onething never lie at him and this would create a belief and security in your bfs mind to love you more with full of happiness.you are a lucky girl to say.in our country no guy will love this much and stick to the girl who he loves in this type of situation.I wish you both advance wedding Anniversary.|`|44ac82dbbfbcb27ebb25b60d33160f37aa	So you say your getting married to this guy. Are you accepting and recogognizing ALL of who he is. It sould like he can only see part of who you are, and is choosing not to aknowledge that you have developed the part that needed to seek attention and affection from someone else. It's good that your thinking about this before you're married. <br>  Just think your only dateing, maybe living together right now? You are responsible for your life, and after you get married you are still responsible for your life and choices you make in them. Same goes for him. But after you get married it will only get worse be more expensive to walk away and hurt more.<br>  Take responsibility for your own life, let him join when he can handle you.<br>  YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE AND RIGHTS.<br>  KNOW YOUR RIGHTS. <br>  It sounds like youve already made up your mind you just need to follow through with it.|`|AA11749277	SORRY TO HERE ABOUT YOUR PAST BUT THE PAST IS THE PAST IF YOU WANT TO MEND ALL BRIDGES THEN YOU SHOULD PROVE YOUR LOVE TO HIM BUT YOU ALREADY LOST THE TWO MAJOR THINGS IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT IS TRUST AND HONESTY MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS TO EARN HIS TRUST AND BE HONEST WITCH MIGHT SEEM HARD BUT TO MAINTAN A STABLE AND LONG LASTING RELATIONSHIP  THE BEST OF LUCK AND HOPE I COULD HELP BUT THINK POSITIVE !!!!!!|`|bda1787bc59370118510b852562c821aaa	Try to understand him. if he stayed with you it not because he wants to have a tight grip on you for what you did(oopsie!) but he really must love you!!!!!this will proabably will take sometime for him to gret over but just try to prove to him that you can be trusted! be honest with him at all times and even though the truth hurts its a million times better than a little white lie! good luck;-)!!!!!!!!|`|AA12056184	well you lied to him how is he going to act, how many times are you going to lie to him, if you are going to tell the truth, maybe try to work it out, if you don't want to tell the truth leave before it get worst|`|2e7051f434a467bde6265c66e2a59d80aa	I say try to work it out.

2fe696caf941944a65c70074cd337c75aa	In my experience, it's easier if you stay in contact and friendly, more closure.  And if you were together 5 years, you must have been pretty close.<br>  <br>  It takes a while, much more than 2 months.  I was once living with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years, and during the first few months sometimes he would come by just so we could sleep together (not sex!  we just found it hard to sleep alone), but that was much easier than not having any contact at all.  Years later we both were with another person, and still stayed close friends until he passed away 2 years ago....don't lose touch!  I would have really regretted it if I had lost contact, then found out years later that he died from cancer.

77c13e7330b2355473737c254531fc99aa	If there is no custody order, then you're free to take your child out of state. Do you have family that you can go visit for a while. I'm assuming the paper work is going to have to be done in Ohio though, for the divorce and custody..... which means you're going to have to return. Do you have an attorney? If not, I suggest you consult with one before doing anything.|`|AA11537569	In most states it's is illegal but if he doesn't know that you might be able to get away with especially if you believe that he might physically harm your or the child or even himself.  Check with a lawyer or the state you are planning to move to see how long would the child have to in residence.  This will give you some ideal.  Make sure you get the separation papers first before you leave.  Always cover yourself.  Because if you don't have the legal papers, he can charge you with kidnapping.  Good luck.|`|AA12335352	If you can't do it without help you will probably be better off calling a shelter and a lawyer, or just get out of the state and contact a lawyer and a shelter in the area where you are going. <br>  Just make sure you get everything you need when you leave, so that you don't have a reason to go back. <br>  They are your kids and you haven't gone threw a divorce yet, then the answer to your question is yes you can take your child out of state, you are the mother, you gave birth to them, him or her......|`|0e59e05355e3a0f85b55ae8366a8c73baa	i think that it is ok to move out of state as long as there are not any papers stating that u have to stay in the state. there shouldn't be because you haven't filed for divorce yet. good luck and i hope you and your child are safe and happy in the end.|`|AA11171720	Talk to legal aid in your area to see what the regulations are. Since you don't have anything in writing yet through the court system I would think you could take the child anywhere. It is important for you to communicate with the father of your child and can be looked upon as bad if you leave the state without telling him.  If it is that bad file a restraining order and get some protective custody for your child and yourself.|`|AA12107238	If there is no court order saying you cant take the child across state lines then there is no legalities involved.|`|d7109f67b48d98ed859a5db9cb400ac6aa	he could press charges on you for kidnapping....if he is abusive, or you are afraid he will hurt you, you need to file a complaint or press charges against him....call a woman's abuse hotline or ask your lawyer, or go to your local PD to ask how to go about leaving the state with your child legally. Unless the judge says you can, you can't leave the state with your child.|`|099cf8d9cb4b2e1249baf1fd33d52b86aa	I don't know Ohio Law but Mass law yes it it illegal to take a child out of the state with out permission of both parents.  <br>  <br>  If you fear for your life you can get a restraining order against him, to prevent him from trying to hurt you.  That would be the first thing you should do.  If he gets with in x feet of you, you can then call the cops and he will go to jail for violating the Restraining Order.  Then you can go about the filing for seperation and/or divorce|`|378a0d827b34bc30fb10b722ce9e23e3aa	It is against the law to leave the state w/o letting him know, but in your case like some of the others said you sould seek advice and put a restraining order on him. He has the right to know where his kids are put yourself in his shoes. Legal is best. Go where he can't hurt you. Make plans then do what your heart tells you. Best for the kids as well. <br>  Good Luck

AA11581021	OK are you ready?  My husband and I just had this talk.  We both knew it was coming and neither wanted to say it.  We've been married 22 years.  I finally sat him down and said I love him more than anyone and I don't want anyone else.  I don't want to leave or for him to leave.  I can't imagine being without him, he's been my best friend for too many years.  I don't want a divorce, I just don't want to be married anymore.  Sounds stupid, I know, but that's how I feel.  He said he felt pretty much the same way.  We had a long talk and set up a bedroom for me.  We are going to continue living like this until one of us finds someone else or just wants more privacy or whatever.  We took off our wedding rings and put them away for our daughter.  Since that day, the entire house has been much happier.  We get along better than we have in years now that the tension is gone.  As I say, we both knew it was over years ago, but neither wanted to actually leave the other.  It isn't that we didn't like each other as people, or we had a fight, hardly ever, we just lost the feeling of intimate love for each other.  We both love and care for the other, just as you said, not in "that" way.<br>  Our friends think we're nuts, but it works for now.   Maybe forever, who knows?  <br>  Good luck in however you decide to do it.|`|5c2469822fc61f1e9929f82e02df0232aa	You either love her or not.  In that way?  When you love someone, you take chances to do whatever makes the relationship work as long as there's not danger or life threatening situations involved.  So, what if it's not your thing now, you may grow to love it too, as time pass if given the chance.  If it was a young w---- outside wanting to get the works, you wouldn't hesitate to build your ego.  So, why not try to keep your spouse happy before she's forced to try getting things resolved elsewhere.|`|AA10093099	Explain to her that you love her as a friend...a forever friend who has a deep deep place in your heart. You're just not "in-love" with her and it's unfair to her and to yourself to go on pretending that you do. It will not be easy to say but in the long run, you'll both be better off. Pray over this answer before you make the desicion to tell her, so you might receive guidance from God.|`|b52a21f69a160e212fa0f0b8dad1d118aa	what way is "that" way? and if you don't love her in "that" way, why the HELL did you marry her???

If you know the girl well enough and you are sure she like you back, then kiss her privatley first and see how she reacts.|`|a536972198d1b77e01fd38e59b3945c8aa	I say wait until you see a twinkle in her eyes or sh gives you those eyes that just make you melt inside. Everytime my girl looks at me with eyes like that, I just go in for the kiss on the lips. Often enough, we end up start making out for a while, and then just go into french kissing.<br>  basically I'm telling you<br>  It will come naturally to you eventually. I'm 17 btw|`|ad561221a243d110a1b14d72f92c6d27aa	Go by eye contact. You can say a lot that way and tell if she's ready for you to kiss her. Kissing is all about communication. Don't go into it with a routine in mind. She'll prolly expect you to lead her along, but also conform to her response to you. Once you get into it, you should just go along and not think about it too much. Also, I'd steer clear of tongue early on unless she initiates. Most guys just end up screwing it up and grossing out the girl.|`|AA11662284	according to the availability.
002562e717f9f76cf761abb897102c4baa	i'm sorry, dude, but a long distance relationship like that doesn't work. the only way i personally think it will work is for you two to live in the same place. otherwise, chances are she'll find another man. believe, my first relationship was like that. my gf lived in another town and we barely got to be together which is part of the reason we broke up.|`|AA12011005	people meet and stay with each other but are never sure if the relationship will last 4ever. how can you think that in your case (without even meetin) will last that long? of course you can always hope but you have to be realistic too at times.|`|AA11856388	well...big trouble...but if i answer ur question directly i should say"no,it won't."cuz as u see,even the simplest relationship can be broken easily so what will such a relationship go on?and u said u would never meet each other?!that's ridiculous indeed(4give me).actually i think u two only can be friend,chat friend.but u'd better give up such a relationship.it's so weak.maybe u get reverie before u meet her..u know reverie can comfort u,and it also can hurt u stealthily.maybe this relationship can last 6 months...1 year...3 years at most..but it won't and impossible to be last 4ever.even urself said u worried that u would find another one.change ur mind.it's a better way.

67f1379cd1d846914f17158ab25c5ef8aa	AWE!!!!!!!!!!This brings back so many memories. First of all, Let me suggest this. Print this out, put it somewhere safe, and look at it again in about 10 years or so. Im serious. At that time you will understand. I'm sure you've heard us old folks say, If I knew then what I know now....Well there is a reason for that. If I could go back to my freshman year, my first bit of advice to myself would be, now this is hard, but don't sweat it girl. There are many many many boys out there, and this is just one. You can't really get someone to like you. It don't work that way. Now I know your not gonna take that advice. I would't have either. So try this...Play it cool. Pretend that he is nobody special, just another face in the crowd. be very casual around him. Don't go out of your way to see him. For some reason, Guys gain interest in you when they realize that you've lost interest in them. This isn't foolproof. Everbody is different, but I have found it to be true in many cases.|`|323361dd5844272e98d2db70c0bf0f03aa	only he knows what he feels and there is not anything you can do to MAKE him like you.  tell him how you feel and if he does not reciprocate, then it is time to click the dust off your prada heels and move on, sista!<br>  remember, he has a CHOICE.

After a long day, he will come home and dinner will be ready.  After we eat, he and I sit on the couch and watch what ever he wants for a short while.  While we are on the couch, I scratch his back - he loves that.  Then I give him a facial - cleanser and mask.  He takes a shower and washes off the mask.  I finish the facial - moisturizer and eye gel.  Then I give him a complete body massage.  This is done by candle light with some Kenny G playing softly.  Sometimes it is strictly a massage and sometimes it turns sensual.  After he is completely relaxed from his massage, I give him a manicure.  I cut his nails, clean them if needed, rub lots of lotion on his hands to keep them from being too rough, and we even use the paraffin wax dip.  Once his hands are done, I move down to give him a pedicure.  This is not always relaxing.  I cut the nails.  If he has any ingrown toe nails I take care of those - this is pretty painful though.  Then I soak his feet to soften the skin.  I scrape the rough skin off.  I rub them with the loofah sponge.  Then I rinse them and massage them with lotion.  The massage can be a gentle relaxing one or a deep one to hit any spots that need attention.  This depends on the mood and the need.  It may not be all gently but it is taking care of him and he loves it.|`|AA12107566	hand job

119b857778a402654323ea177f045627aa	I applaud you for your question.  The truth be told.  The status quo is not ready to see a black male romantically involved with a white female on the big screen.  You are observant when you notice minority women being romantically involved with white men but not vice versa.  The strong, strapping, handsome black male is seen as too dominant, too threatening and too sexually appealing.  That threatens white males.  In which, white females are told to run or hide from us.  Ironically, history says blacks have more to fear from whites then whites of blacks. Secretly, white females are attracted to black males like they are attracted to every other race.  It is nature. Period.  I get stared at by white females or flirted with by them all the time. We are all human, the first attraction is the physical one, we then incorporate the social aspects and say you should not date outside of your race or color.  Because of the social and historical aspects the majority of whites are not comfortable with seeing a black male bed a white female on the big screen.  For race relations in America, it is one of the last frontiers.|`|AA12268114	I'm also wondering why?|`|AA11801071	You already asked this question and chose a best answer.

I was so in love with this guy...and he didnt even know I was alive....just thought we were 'friends'.... Drove me crazy.  But try this 'If you love something...let it go'               'if it comes back, then you know it loves you too'. I remember my boyfriend that I have now....he was so AHH about everything when i first met him..he liked me...he liked another girl...i wanted him bad. Then I ignored him for a long *** time.....then he started to call me up...saying that he missed talking to me....he was sorry he hurt me...that he still had the girlfriend, but missed being friends with me. After time....we because better friends and then....we got to where we are now. Happy and totally in love with eachother. Sometimes....people dont realize what is standing right in front of them until its gone...then they realize they are missing something...Just try to avoid him....make it seem like you dont love him....he just might come around at some point. But dont you hold on forever. he might not be worth it!~
348fea181baf4d729cefbb1180380fafaa	Imagine yourself being a tower being built.  You start with the foundation.  You lay brick by brick, year by year.  Sometimes you’ve gotten off the blue print a little and the building starts to tilt.  Maybe you’ve put in a window where one doesn’t belong.  So you can tear down some of the most recent mistakes, and correct yourself but other times you didn’t even realize something had gone wrong until it’s way too late to go back.  So then you’ll just have to fix the mistake by making an extra bathroom on the next floor instead…  The answer to the question is that you are always going to be the person your foundation was built upon.  And the previous floors too.  But maybe you are on the 14th floor now and you suddenly realize this floor’s design is much different then say the 8th floor.  So now the 14th floor more accurately represents who you are today…  and tomorrow the 15th floor will be more you at that time.  But the 14th floor will still be there even when you are on the 50th floor’s construction.  You are who you’ve always been, and at the same time you’ll never be that person again.|`|AA11909745	Something has obviously changed, if your grades are slipping and you have gained weight and your game is off..<br>  <br>  So you lost your best friend, could it be that he or she has noticed some changes about you and so is not wanting to be around?<br>  <br>  You need to examine yourself and figure out why all these changes, somehow I think you have gained a few more than 5 lbs and what really is worrying is why you suddenly do not want to be girly, it sounds very like you were assaulted, these are all symptoms of a woman who has been assaulted, if you were please go see a counselor either at school or college and get help immediately.|`|335540f74e495a3f1878f042660a8467aa	Damn thats very strange well this is wat i can say "every dog has its day "in ur case every girl has hers .lets hope 4 the best adious

8a9b061fef7b9def0fefbe8f76b2012faa	Explain this to your husband first.  If he is in denial, call his new wife and ask her 'politely' if your daughter and she are having an problems relating to one another. She may not know she is making your daughter uncomfortable or that she is having issues with her father's new wife.<br>  <br>  Is this a new marriage for your ex-husband?  Is your daughter angry because he remarried or because his wife is mean to her?  Perhaps talk to your daughter about counseling and explain to your ex husband that because of your daughter's mental health you are going to allow her the space she needs and time to go do counseling to work out her issues.<br>  <br>  Try to get to the root of the problem and then take the appropriate direction.  You can also consult your attorney for advice in this matter if it is really a problem.<br>  <br>  Also, be careful that YOU are not the root of the problem by bad mouthing the step-mother.  Your daughter is going through enough pain to have to choose sides.  You may not love your husband any more, but HE is your daughter's father.  Even if you think he is a worm of a father, let her discover it herself.  Of course, that is if he is not an abuser to her.|`|AA11537569	You need to talk to your ex.  Explain to him it's not you but you all need to talk and maybe together can come up with some solutions.   Also you need to find out why your daughter does not like her step mother.  Then take it from there.  Good luck.|`|3d1a7385632871984e6a4b41f6a3acbdaa	dont force her to go, or shell turn on you, tell her dad something else has to be done, visits somewhere else without her being there, or the visits stop.|`|12350c3e15a27e34b396fec263524327aa	you should have a sit down with the the daugther, father and step mother. Have the daugther put everything out on the table and express herself to her father as well as, the step mother about how she feels. If she doesn't say something to them about the they will never know how to go about handling the issue. <br>  If you can't get anything resolve then their is nothing you can do but pray for your daugther. But as your daugther gets older she may not want to do her own thing, That could be one of the reasons why she doesn't want to go over their on the weekends.|`|2705f3dfd2d4b45de7cf3a92e55d29a6aa	Ifshe doesn't want to go dont make her go. maybe something happened between the step mother and her that she doesnt want to tell|`|a59e5f59dd12b7b3bcf6f9d30e7ffeabaa	Being just about her age, I say let her cool off a bit. I'm in basically the same situation, I really don't like my mom's fiance. Don't try to force her to spend time with her step mom, and don't make the have time alone. In a few days, you should begin gradually introducing eachother more. You/her dad should be there with them, so she doesn't feel like shes alone or trappped.

AA11537569	No, that is not true.  It is nothing wrong with wanting your husband to pamper you, he is suppose to treat you like a queen.  Most of us that want this, the reason is because we do love them.  The women who are manipulating and don't love them, want you to do way more than pamper.  Matter of fact they don't really want the pampering all they want is the finances.|`|29772c3a68c5c632300ff3ae55102ef5aa	Absolutely not......Face it, women are emotionally involved, kindness, consideration and attention goes along way.....

When we get hurt we really feel it and most of the time when we are hurt that bad we tend to close up and get a little edgy and block our feelings. We do that so we can have better knowledge and understanding about what we want in a man as well as how to better our relationships is all.|`|AA11537569	Yeah, you got it.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Guys are so insensitive and mean|`|AA10027595	yes a person can only take so much and when a women has been dogged out over and over she can only do what she thinks is best for her and that is to put up a wall for protection. its a sad way to live and believe me none of them really want to be this way.
335540f74e495a3f1878f042660a8467aa	Asking someone out on a date is not rocket science, but forsome people it can be very overwhelming, especially when askingsomebody out for the first time. By following the tips below youcan help increase the odds of getting a YES when asking someoneout on a date.<br>  <br>  1. For starters you should wait for a relaxing environment whenasking someone out for a date. Never make that move in a tenseenvironment. You don't want to come across as tense or stressedout. You want to appear calm and confident. It's important thateverything should just flow smoothly.<br>  <br>  2. Do not pop the question out of nowhere. The conversationshould naturally lead into asking someone out for a date. Forexample, it would be ideal for both of you to have justfinished talking about something that you both are interestedin which brings comfortability and then an "Oh by the way..."is a perfect opportunity to ask for a date.<br>  <br>  3. Be sure that when you ask out somebody for a date try to dosomething that you enjoy doing and are good at. This willincrease your confidence both when asking them out on the dateand during the actual date. Confidence attracts people towardsyou.<br>  <br>  4. If you did get that first date then your next job is doingall of the right things to get the second date, right? So whileon that first date, be sure to have the attitude of givingrather than getting. Try to involve activities that he or shewould enjoy. Do your best to create the date around them,showing your attention, and making them feel special.<br>  <br>  5. Last but not least, just be yourself when asking him or herout on a date. Do not try to act like someone else or pullthose one liners. Trust me, being original works every time!<br>  <br>  All the best|`|c8a7fccbc3a3ba10bf5fd61b819bb9aaaa	Dinner & a movie. That's the best I could think of.

I'm going to assume by your lack of puncuation that you probably aren't way beyond the levels of people your age, hence you're probably not mature enough to be dating, let alone long distance dating. Get a hobby and save yourself some emotional distress.

Thats why we will pay for it in one maner or anther.  Cash, rings, gifts, houses, cars, bills, you get the point. While women do go thought the same needs but at varying times.

He does what he does while he's single and you don't have any say in what he does when he goes out to parties (as a friend) - again, you need to make a decision; are you willing to sacrifice the friendship for this crush.  Besides, "committing to liking each other" is the definition of friendship, it doesn't mean your "committed to each other" as lovers.<br>  <br>  3. Make a choice; best lovers start off as best friends first (you need the friendship to be true to each other) but who would you turn to (other best friend) if you lost this one romantically?  You need to sit with yourself, no one can answer that for you.<br>  <br>  4.  Friends can usually tell when you crush on another friend.  This friend probably sees that the two of you may like each other more than friends.  If you "like one or the other" this probably isn't really "just a friendship" you're probably crushing on both of them but willing to be satisfied with being just friends.  I'd find a boyfriend out of that circle of friends and keep the drama to a minimum.|`|cd5e8f01d94c46dde6d91c21674c506faa	i'll go down 1 by 1<br>  1) if he is ur best guy friend then there is a possibility that it might go deeper<br>  2)is this a question?<br>  3)if u r interested in him then start flirting with him also to find out if he is interested in u as well...then when u r ready pop the question<br>  4)when one guy says that u and the other guy look cute together, it usually means he is trying to use reverse psychology to woo u or (seldom)he has no interest in anything more than mutual friendship with u and is actually complimenting the other guy and u being nice together|`|8201e5aa84d3e7e555f1aef0e5c30b00aa	first of all how old are you.   and besides your friends if you are concerned about it , and you like the other guy also you are not ready to be with anyone in a relationship.   if it happens it happens.   guys are just weird that way , and if your such good friends then flat out ask him why he says things like that ,  but remember you get what you ask for .

AA11957255	Being a guy, it may seem strange to get this answer from me, but base don experience and heart to heart prior conversations, here it goes....<br>  <br>  The majority of women believe that they are the prime factor of a relationship. That is to say, if you want sex, you have to earn it. The time you spend with them is absolute and not to be shared. Not all, but the large majority of women are given the 'princess' position started by their father and perpetuated by media, toys, etc that they are to be thought of in high regard ... thus Sweet-16's are big and what do boys get? So we've established that dating, relationships, life ... in the minds of women ... are supposed to revolve around them.<br>  <br>  Add the fact that they have the ability to give birth and be a quote-unquote "mother" ... then they really think they are special because "without them how would they populate the Earth."<br>  <br>  So ... I say, without Men how would they do it also...but thats another story.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, with all the propaganda putting women on pedestals ... and we, men, also doing the same early in the relationship (hence the words 'early in the relationship because it's at that time we work the hardest to get the pootang) ... when it's over and we leave, the average woman clearly has that, "How dare you leave me. I'm the sh*t and it don't stink either. After all that sex I gave you, how dare you leave. After all those damn football games I suffered to watch, how dare you" ... and then they chat it up with their girlfriends, sisters, etc who give them third-person advice on how to deal with it ...<br>  <br>  and next thing you know, your car is burning or your stuff is on the sidewalk.<br>  <br>  And the topper of it all is if you found someone else (I wouldn't say better because that's relative) ... if you 'dare' to find another piece of **** and leave the original woman, it's a greater offense and you will be likely in for revenge tactics because she's hurting.<br>  <br>  Always remember a woman or a man who is in love will act out if hurt. Men are worse on this topic... at least women will just break your stuff. men have been known to kill.<br>  <br>  The math equation is simple, though. The better the pootang, and if she is a head turner, the higher the love quoitant from the man. Liek buying a brand new corvette. Great engine. Great curves. She's a keeper.<br>  <br>  For women, the better the security, the bigger the love. And security means strength, trust, money, all wrapped up. <br>  <br>  If either party looks to loose what they love, they act out.<br>  <br>  My two points.|`|AA11537569	It all depends on how you did the announcement that you wanted to leave.    It sounds a lot immaturity.  I would rather you divorce before cheating.  Because when you have cheating spouse it really hurts.  But she should not seek revenge on because it's still not going to make you want her back and in the end it will no really make her feel better either.  She is hurting but not doing it in a productive way.|`|f9038995e61c0e67c5ce960c4b9dc45eaa	Probably just hurt pride. But i always say that if you aren't ahppy with me then I would prefer to be left rather than be cheated on because that hurts way worse. Some women are just petty though.|`|1fbbda9db3a9e4123a6631c7dfa5cdc0aa	People are immature!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|26895520b344fbc3d9d0e7496f0e96ebaa	I agree with you about leaving things alone and just letting go. <br>  BUT................on the other hand..................<br>  <br>  if you are married and someone messes with your man, it's just an instinct to go after the woman he was messing around with.  For no reason, really, just to let people know that they can't mess with you.              <br>  <br>  And sometimes, too, some people go off when they are mad.....not even knowing what they're doing.|`|58e8fd1ce44ce9c02802268a0c1b9234aa	This applies to both males and females. It's not only a woman thing. Depends on the person. <br>  <br>  Generally when a person comes to that stage of being violent or revengeful, it's usually because of cheating and being lied to over and over again and hurt. <br>  <br>  Something bad usually triggers it but there are a minority that I account for who are just plain angry when hurt. Either way it's their choice with what they want to do after it all, but I agree they should not take it out on the ex. Just a waste of time but in all fairness you can't expect a person to be happy if they were cheated upon because obviously they were in a relationship with a person who they had feelings for.<br>  <br>  It's always a BAD thing when you're in a relationship and there's a NON MUTUAL break up or divorce etc. There's no good that  will come out for the other party who is at loss after investing so much time and feelings into something they wanted to grow and maintain. Let's put it in a male analogy: Making you believe you get a free ticket to a sold out football game with your favourite team playing and then when the day draws near, having those tickets ripped infront of your face. <br>  <br>  It only hurts when it's not mutual but there is nothing they can do but accept it and move on. More fish in the ocean.|`|77f1ab8b164b735e0c932034e63c51f7aa	I don't know. When I broke up with my boyfriend a few months back, I was heartbroken. Even though we had grown apart and it was for the best, it still hurt. I knew I was going to miss the connection that we had and that things wouldn't be the same. For me, the change is what hurt. But I could never do anything like try to get revenge on him or anything. I respect him for speaking up now and saying what needed to be said before we invested anymore time, effort or money in it. <br>  <br>  If the relationship ended poorly *like if he cheated on you or did something horrible* then I could understand being a little bitter or upset. but going out of your way to be a crazy ***** and ruin his life isn't right. those women need help.|`|2e16dd5fbb9edcbd1eb33f4d65516b9eaa	You feel like you're losing everything in life.

Then focus on finding another girl and u will and you'll love her even better then the first one.

AA12306645	Evolution has it pretty much down to a science:  Most guys stick around until the kid they sire is 4 or 5.  So, you are right in the pattern.  The mature man, who wishes to be part of his child's life, be a parent, and a father is able to overcome evolution, and raise his child(ren) with his wife.  You, apparently are still an immature male, and there are lots of you out there---age has nothing to do with immaturity.  They feel the grass is always greener on the other side, that an occasional screwing fling is just fine, and that the sex with their wife is no longer as good (but few men realize that in reality, it is indeed their own fault--- they are lousy lovers, and their wives rarely tell them so. You are probably such a lousy lay that she has had to fake it, just to get it over with..... and women will do that, because they don't have the heart to tell you..... and women can fake it all, even to vaginal contractions!!!! Married people know each other well enough to have sex, but to rarely talk about it.... a book you might find interesting written by THE sex therapist in the nation today, "For You Both" by Lonnie Barbach -- get it cheap in paperback at Amazon.com.  Could be at your house by Friday---worth every dime).  <br>  <br>  Sir, there is and always will be temptation out there, and there is still AIDS and other STD's, and no one thinks it will get them.  If some babe is phucking you, she is doing it to others as well -- and don't forget, you are in bed with everyone she has ever been in bed with, and that could be a very large number. Oh, and don't do the big confession bit with your wife: you have made one horrid mistake of betrayal, don't make two by telling her, and expect her to wish to stay with you.....if you do, she will never again trust you, and in the end, your marriage will be irrevokably eroded.   My thoughts?  Build a solid trust with your wife, be a terriffic supporting dad to your child(ren), and be a contributing member of your neighborhood and this society. (Learn to be a good, unselfish lover!!!!  read that book.) Be a good employer or employee.  In other words, cultivate yourself to be a wonderful person.   You asked.

When things like this happen, you need to sit down with your wife (not to discuss the affair) but to discuss what you need out of this marriage.  If you want your marriage to work, you will have to give this other woman up.  When you are feeling bad the person that you need to go to first is your spouse after all this is your lifetime partner and you should be able to go to her about anything.

I have been with my boyfriend for over 2 years and it's been nothing but romantic and anyone that knows me and my boyfriend know that he isn't exactly the "hot' type but so what i don't care i love him for him and not what he looks like. Im so sick of girls looking for guys just for their money or for sex how sick and disgusting is that. I understand what you mean though.|`|67184ad7c1f11121cd1c17741c7de726aa	Good question...Its hard to really say ,they want romance and when they get it they don't...I can tell you tho,there are alot of guys who are romantic and will show a woman a good time...Women have to make up thier minds and let us know what they want...Hope that helps..|`|76089b93eeb5ba79fc790de2cf57febbaa	some do, thanks to girls who give it out and beg for it; but some aren't like that, and they will respect you so just wait for a one like that-and when you find him, never let him go!|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	Romance is nice! but having a good looking man with a body does help.|`|bcf038aadea985ef7487c53bcff56f7eaa	some do...& its sad
7ca763f1af09b37df688aef485edc2baaa	DEFINETELY INTERESTED!!!! Come on- do you think she really wanted to know the answer? And if she did, don't you think she would've asked one of her girl freinds for it...or the teacher? Welcome to the female psyche my friend :-)  This was her way of making a move....and now, it's your turn.|`|GBluVLZ6aa	I dont really think she's interested just by asking a question about a test. Try striking up a conversation with her sometime and see what happens.|`|2698acc46096172214e2cc5deb1ee481aa	possibly make the first move|`|7a468e640b98748bdcdfe93708b20983aa	I don't think she's not quite interested yet.

She's trying to talk to you cause she likes you so let her know you like her back by starting up a conversation with her for what do you have to loose? Nothing who knows you might get a valentine for valentines day or at least a friends. So open up the COMMUNICATION and see what happens.|`|f40f0342e35545d4dbee669a04b23027aa	woah there speedy, no need to take it so fast! time will tell in this relationship. i'm in the EXACT same kind of situation i kid you not. i'm trying to find out the same thing, but i think that time will really draw out. start with small talk and move up to talking everyday, even if it's about absolutely nothing. get an excuse to talk to her. try to go for her phone or online or something and if she wants to get to know you as much as you do her, it'll work out. i plan on doing the same thing. i'm a little farther than you, though, i try to say hi and bye to her everyday and make sure she notices me (she looks likes she's pretending to ignore me, but in a playful way).|`|f9pc26BKaa	She was trying to open up a conversation and become familiar with you.<br>  <br>  Who says making friends is a crime? <br>  <br>  I talk to just about anyone who I feel dominant and controlled over. To other people who just mind their own conversations to their other friends discourages me from saying anything. <br>  <br>  If you are both in the same classes, you find her attractive, you've initialized the informal greeting, I would say that she's likely interested in getting to know you better before making any ultimate conclusions.|`|khviIoI1aa	To me it sounds liek that was an excuse to talk to you... but i'm not so sure.|`|nIig5tuVaa	I think she likes you.  Just keep it up and eventually ask her what shes doing this weekend or when ever you ask her.  If she say nothing really ask her to go watch a movie or something.

AA12308445	Maybe your feeling guilty about something, or something from your past is bothering you. If they are really bad, I'd call a suicide help line and usually they have ways of momentarily talking you out of it until you can recieve further help.|`|AA10858602	Keep upbeat, everytime you start to think negatively, replace the thought with a happy thought, and keep yourself busy doing things you like to do.|`|1e4899664da1f2eb059c1a61e5a328e3aa	How long has it lasted? Could you be stressed about something?<br>  Sad about a loss?<br>    If you don't  want to talk to someone, try writing in a jouranl, exercising and reading some self help books. <br>   If the feelings persist and or get stronger. ..you have to tell a trusted friend and eventually a therapist. You could be suffering from depression.  Good luck...hope you feel better.|`|6ffc39f2ca35ae3d8c481a55d56df888aa	I think you need to go to the doctor and tell them about these feelings.  You may have seasonal depression and should be put on medication.|`|bd47e93e34da178e01a16e058e147fd5aa	ask your therpist what else there to help you|`|f03cb8a85defb2896538e8fedafe3ee2aa	well besides talkin to some one..wel just think..think about why you are feeling this why.what has made feel way.do you think it is a guy?just think for a few minutes..it always helps me.|`|6d773e65f456a364002cef9f3296f53aaa	Well, someone to talk to would be great. But if you chose that route, I would talk to someone(counsler) who doesnt know me well, because it would be easier to talk about my suicidal thoughts. Even though it would be hard to talk to someone about this, but with everything that goes on in a persons life, it always feels good to confide into someone, wheter it would be a counsler, a friend, or even someone on here. It would let a big burden of your chest. Also, try to think whats been making you so down lately, and try to resolve that situation. If its a friend for example, thats pissing you off, a boyfriend thats constantly hurting you, get rid of them, whether you have love for them or not, if thats whats making you think certain things, then you do not need them. If its problems with the family, try to solve them also, and make mends with family. Family problems are the biggest problems people have these days, and they cause a lot of people to think these strange things, and makes them choose to do harnful actions to themselves. Another, thing you could also try, is to maybe get an animal. Whatever animal you choose would be fine. I have an aunt thats bi-polar, has depression, and etc., and is always very down and out. I recommended for her to get a kitty, she loves kitties. Anyways, ever since then, since she has had a pet (someone) to love, she has felt better. She didnt want to do anything to herself, bc she wanted to continue to take care of that animal. It helped her, and plus she did talk to someone too. That does always help, so please try to reconsider it. Even if you havent attempted to hurt yourself. If you are thinking it, talk to someone who knows what to do from there. Hope you get better with this. Good luck... Hope I helped a little. Remember life is great.|`|AA10048088	When all else fails.....read the directions.  This may or may not help you, but it always helped me when I was feeling low and all out of sorts.  Now don't laugh. Just pick up the Bible and open it, then read the first thing you see, and keep reading until everything else around you becomes faded and all you hear are the words jumping off the page.<br>  This really works!  Try it, you will love it!<br>  After you have mellowed, you will find that things look differently now.

If something happens, it happens fro a reason and it shouldn't be ignored. If you find yourself thinking about your mate more than your boyfriend then maybe you should be with your mate. However do be careful because if it goes **** up you could risk losing your best friend, and then realising you should have stayed with your boyfriend. I hope you manage to work things out. I hope this helps.|`|3c5e965f7baa4dd86407173545e33075aa	There are a lot of these stories today.  Well I guess you'll get the same answer. Follow your heart.

He has to dictate when and how the kids get home from his house, which is 6 hours away by car.  He ruins any plans I have made just so that he can have his visitation.  The kids don't want to see him anyway and I have to force them to go.  He spends money on them by buying them stuff that he knows my fiance and I don't approve of just to make himself look good, but won't pay anything toward child support.  I've had it.  Christmas was it.  I'm NEVER sending them back to him.  He says that he will physically come to my house and drag them for visitation even though they are teenagers and don't want to go.  He never wanted them to begin with and I raised them mostly by myself.  He has no real relationship with them because he is abusive and mean and neglected them all their lives.  I think he's just jealous because even though he cheated on me throughout our long marriage, I was the one who left and found Mr. Right so easily.  He knows how uterly happy we are as a family and he's so jealous and hateful about that.  Even though I paid for the plane tickets to get them down to see him, he forced me to buy the tickets home because he didn't want to - then he made them miss the flight by being late and I had to take off most of the day from work to pick them up because he didn't want to use his cell phone minutes to call and tell me when they would be in.  Jealous and spiteful.|`|c1f44600ad9add5a554344237e4d15c5aa	Tell him to piss off. He has no business sticking his nose in your dating, unless you are doing something that could endanger the children. And, most states send child support through their Department of Family Services. If he is in arrears by usually $7,000 or more, they will issue a warrant for his arrest, and make him appear in court to tell them how he plans on getting caught up.|`|da4755952b9c5c022ecefb387a3f6cc4aa	Do what I did...my ex complained and whined about EVERYTHING I did after we split (even who I slept with).  I sat down and wrote him this LONG letter telling him EVERYTHING I had wanted to tell him since the day he left.  I reminded him that HE was the one who left and that what I did after that point was absolutely no concern of his and then I started pointing out all the crap he had pulled since we split.  I just recently took him to court for not paying his child support and lucky for me he's more afraid of jail than he is of me.  Just stand up to him and remind him that you are no longer married and what you do is none of his business.  As long as anything you do has no impact on your children-it is none of his business.  I could write for days about the bull my ex has pulled...not enough time in the week!|`|8dcccef2557b9c305ed425335e7fc851aa	:)<br>  <br>  Not married yet.

I'm sure the kids are just as sick of his 500 pages of bad behavior as you are.|`|AA11537569	Most of my friends and me included that are divorce and with children by the ex have some of the same problems.  It's not so much about who your children are expose to because most men know that if you are a good mother you are not going to expose your children to anyone bad especially on purpose.  It's like they try hard and even work overtime to make your life miserable.  It's just their way of getting back at you for some reason and another they don't have life so they have to constant pick at yours.  Loneliness can create some real monsters.  Keep your head up and hopefully it will get better in time.

Who cares what your friends think. If their only problem is the physical aspect, then simply ignore them. Its the inside that counts. A lesson that you have apparently learned.|`|d537776618198eb71d73279c06a461bbaa	Whats your question?  Do you wanna know what we think about what your friends say?<br>  Well i will tell ya, it doesnt matter what they think.  It matters what you think.  They are not the ones who have seen beyond the hot/nerdy side.  Sounds like your friends are rather shallow in the fact that they base their likes upon looks alone.  Think about it.....if you ended up loving this hunky guy......he tragically gets into a car accident that disfigures him (God forbid), but say hypethetically it happens......does this make you not love him anymore?  No.  The simple truth is....even though the outside is what first attracted you, the inside is what will make you stick around or not.<br>  Give this a shot.  You cant lose when you look at someone from the inside first.  <br>  And the inside is what makes the outside so appealing.<br>  Good for you for not being shallow.  Good luck.|`|0353c5a94540fe362e84264d8849e968aa	Are you attracted to him? Because if not, you're headed for trouble. People always slam girls for not giving "nice guys" a chance, but I don't think that's entirely fair. No one expects a guy to give a "nice girl" a chance if he doesn't find her attractive. <br>  <br>  You absolutely must be attracted to the person -- otherwise, nice is simply not enough. Trust me, I've found myself in a relationship with someone who couldn't be kinder or more gracious -- but I'm not very attracted to him. I thought I should give him a chance -- and now we're having major problems in the bedroom.<br>  <br>  If your friends don't like the way he looks, but he's got some winning combination that really turns you on, then you're golden. But if you agree with your friends, and he doesn't truly do it for you, I'd spare myself the heartache. I think you're going to have take a good look at what you really feel about him.|`|8a10b6f39fb42887c12091449ffe7f2aaa	its your decision if u like him than go with him and dont worry about what they say its ur man|`|d691671443ada8eae3ece5d8497f1c4faa	aww thats cute. i dated someone like that, and all of my friends told me that i shouldn't be seeing him. but you have to do what you feel, and i made sure that my friends realized that this was my decision to make and not theirs.|`|0d511a9b4e6c8e46d1f7955057fd007daa	So because your friends think he's "ew"... that makes hiim odd?<br>  I don't get it. If you like someone, why does it matter what others think? And do you only go out with him because he's nice or is there other things that you like?<br>  Don't lead him on.<br>  Best of luck.

The people that answered no, have lost in few relationships and as a result lost hope, OR they simply believe that you choose your own destiny and can make a logical decision as who you want your mate to be, as opposed to one being "out there" waiting to be found or desperately looking for you. Me personally, I choose to be alone for now, if it happens it happens, if not, I'm not stressed. I don't look for him, nor do I melt at the first guy that pays me any attention. I just have more important things to be concerned with.|`|a9be3beb0b5fc63202d10721c0b7c4f3aa	I think that there is for most people, but some people are just meant to be alone.
AA10572438	Sister dear, I'm a college student and let me tell you from experience, you don't need to be dating a guy when you're in middle school. Dating is for finding someone to marry. You're not old enough to get married. Just hang out with your friends, do well in school and most of all, have fun, sister!! :)|`|4925710a6b8780d6bcf9e7049454a68faa	im in the same situation im 15 and he just turned 20.

At your age you are much too young to be dating especially dating a 11th grader.  Continue on with your junior high years and maybe when you turn 18 if he's still interested and you are then get it a go head.  You both will be legal then.
3ac6d1a349ea5dc40537da1aeaac8bb1aa	I think its OK to be interested in a guy a couple hours away. Sometimes, when you keep in control of your emotions, those are the best friends.<br>  <br>  Here's what to do. Ask your cousin, or whoever knows him, his email address. Then write him a very ordinary email. Tell him that you really had a good time when he was here and decided that since most guys aren't like him that you would like to email him to stay in touch. Then let him decide if he wants to stay in touch. Also let him know that you like guys at your town and let him know that you want to be friends and he can keep his girlfriends. Over time, you will either learn that he isn't interested in you, or he is. Then he has to figure out how to come see you more often. Whatever you do, don't give up on the guys in your town. You are young and need to experience guys to determine your likes and dislikes. A long distance boyfriend only creates frustration.  Just be his friend. Smile and be polite. Good Luck|`|7841b85f4771dd5498b2f5730663a25daa	don't even think about trying to be his girl.. it won't work.<br>  <br>  you both are too young for a "long distance"<br>  <br>  just be friends. you'll thank me later|`|4a521ffb6c3f17ebd3403e2aaeeb42d9aa	i understand wat ur sayin, things like that get complicated sometimes, all u need to do is look deeper into things that u did together and if anything important stood out, or u could like get his phone number or something so u can get to know him better, maybe somethin can happen then, talk to him more maybe|`|AA12333449	don't make the 1st move. for a guy to have fun wit a girl is something noramal. but if he shows any signs then go for it

c1d7c3f3333e3dece86e6becf9167258aa	No; generally speaking, educated women are cold and analytical, and too caught up in statistics. Plus, they're too smart to fall prey to the sort of ...ahem... man... whose pickup tactic is to get the chick liquored up in order to get her into the sack.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with the aerobic instructor babe, though. (Did you use spell check, or do you really know how to spell "aerobic"?)|`|c0813f537ba56bdcb020796a413e769daa	I beg your pardon but I am not highly educated (I did go to college but I'm certainly no rocket scientist) and you can ask any man that I have been with and they will certainly tell you that I rocked thier world many times.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should stop shopping around in the slums and look for someone who is intelligent.  But then again that may be hard for you since your question indicates you may be a bit of a moron anyway.|`|766f5ec0349de9d0d510c27699476a28aa	I don't know whether to laugh or cry....Are you really serious!!!

But educated women are usually spent most of their time studing and are book worms (some of them) if you like. They could possibly think a lot ofhow they would have sex and stuff, so, they got more imagination. <br>  <br>  But on the other hand they could possibly have less experience then those shallow girls because they had less sex.<br>  <br>  Hard to say but personally I think education doesn't make a lot of difference if you are a kind of guy who only like women to have sex with.<br>  Personally I wouldn't use women like that.<br>  <br>  Wolf.|`|97b4121c2712b16030663fa9a8cc95fcaa	What I'm left asking myself is 'Why do you associate education with sex anyway?' <br>  You sound like you've done your fair share of ladies and I'm sure by now you must of figured out that every encounters quality depends on factors that are completely variable e.g state of mind, reason for wanting to get laid, how they feel about you, blood alchol levels.<br>  Personally I can tell you that if I'm just up for abit and I've got the guy wrapped round my finger I'm gonna work him to get all the extras I need and then I might think about doing something for him if he's been very very good. Or if he just genuinely likes the sex I'll do my bit as I admire a guy with passion and not a chip on his shoulder and doubts about his manhood.<br>  Maybe you should ask yourself how many women 'clever' or not are getting a good ride out of you? Just a thought...<br>  Incidental I trained as a Beauty Therapist in my teens and now in my twenties I teach Psychology so it's the old story of books and covers.|`|eceae77e93654ca780658aabb5d9ec22aa	to be honest you are sick how do you look a female and only think i wanna nail them. you know that's how people end up with STD's. you have a mind set of a child who just found out about his manhood. sex is what you make it. it doesn't matter if the girl is smart or not.

Some of us go for a nice man with a great personality, fun to be with, and the ability to make us laugh. <br>  <br>  Appearance is very important too, a man with nice eyes ( a twinkle in them), a sexy cute smile, ( and his own teeth!), a nice body and a <br>  nice ***!   <br>  <br>  Not all of us are gold diggers!

Some guys are looking for a mommy replacement. Some are looking for a free ride. Some are genuinely looking for give and take. If you give too much too soon, a guy can take advantage of your kindness. But, when you feel that the two of you have reached a point in your relationship to give from the heart do just that. Give from the heart. Remember that the best gifts are the thoughtful gifts, not the expensive ones.

fc33d154f585165b2e1de14dd20d3d83aa	Well...you remeind me of myself.  I describe myself as an introvert.  Of course there are times when I feel l lonely or left out and desire that social interaction with others but mainly I enjoy my own company and keep to myself!  There was a time when I couldn't innitiate a conversation with anyone and so I wasn't very popular.  People just thought I was quiet but my personality emerges when I was with my close friends.  This happens because you are more comfortable around them.  You know they accept you whereas others may think your weird or in my case may not get my jokes.  LOL.  The only real way is to push yourself.  Force yourself into talking with others despite the fact that it may be really uncomfortable at first!  After you do thins for a long time it starts to get easier and kind of becomes a habit.  I wouldn't say your intentionally throwing out signs that make it hard for others to approach you but maybe they feel that you are a serious person and because they don't know what your into then they may not know how to approach you and what to talk about.  Once you take the step to approach them you'll show them you are interested in them and because you're reaching out to them then they are likely to do the same if they are good people!  I know it can be hard and sometimes easier to just crawl back in your shell for fear of making a fool out of yourself but it's worth a try and takes loads of practice.  Besides you do have friends regardless of how many or few and they like you for who you are!  Allow people to see the real you and hopefully they will be receptive and begin to like you as well.  Some little things to keep in mind that helped me out is to just be calm and maybe write down a few conversation starters and try to remember them.  There are  always those times in a conversation where there's that weird silence so maybe you can remember a few things you wrote to break that silence.  Just allow yourself the ability to grow.  If you accept yourself then others will like and respect you for that.  Keep practicing!  Good Luck!|`|499c9fe53d6be550bf42b5ebb1cd82d8aa	remove u r shell and trust yourself don't scared taiking first nobody will eat u . u can talk me if u like|`|da643f59e30a5ced8f0824d0d630f1acaa	you are just a little shy sometimes we all get like that sometimes you will eventually find a friend that will be able to bring you out of your shell then you will never be able to stop talking.|`|f9c340f9e6013152900cdbaa0f761311aa	You're shy, it is pretty obvious.

AA11302181	You should make your move.  However, remember that what you do may have consequences.  If she cannot act on that "chemistry" you think she also feels, then things could get awkward for the both of you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3a047de9d1555cbcf2eff83ee378bc4aaa	I think that you should talk to her and make your move dont wait any longer!!

Don't just make some stupid move like trying to kiss her out of the blue-but ask her out on a date.  Make sure she knows it's a date and not a platonic thing.  See where it goes from there.|`|ad937ec0cfbe6956cce49cc405f2ff90aa	There is nothing like the present to do something. There is no perfect time to do something, but you have opportunities.  The opportunity is now!  Who is to say someone else will not come along and ask her out.  Don't wait until it's too late.  If you don't do something about it you'll never really know if something more could have come out of it...,and that feeling can be worse then not knowing if you should make a move or not?  Good luck to you!|`|af60dec109a9a6738c2da98d50036aefaa	You should take her out to dinner, get to know her more, get to know her family background, get to know her family, her hobbies,etc. Just brainstorm of ways to get to know her better, and if all goes well and seems that you have a lot in common and it look like you are going to have a long,long relationship, then go for it! I wish you the best of luck! But please don't waste your time. You have to be on the move or you might lose the girl of your dreams! I wish you the best of luck again!

Sometimes, such moments come in person’s life that he needs friends desperately. Such moments are very common who r computer savvy and spend most of their time on the internet. Sometimes they start feeling lonely. They wish to hv friends on the net with whom they could share their experiences or many other things. Some may like to develop the Web Friendship further also.

87f6c31a38feeb81b04978a2ebf8650caa	Einen Mann umzuerziehen ist sehr schwer, wenn er es seit Jahren so gewohnt ist nichts zu tun. Sowas muss man am besten am Anfang einer Beziehung gleich durchsetzen. Aber das ist bei Dir ja leider zu sp?t.<br>  Umerziehung musst Du langsam und vorsichtig angehen lassen. Fang mit Kleinigkeiten an. Zum Beispiel "Schatz, kannst du bitte den Abendbrottisch decken w?hrend ich noch das Badezimmer zu ende mach? Dann k?nnen wir gleich essen."<br>  Wichtig ist, dass du das sehr lieb und bittend formulierst und er meint, er k?nnte sich entscheiden. Wie bei einem Kind dann auch die Begründung nicht vergessen, warum er dass machen soll und Du solltest auch sagen, was du in der Zeit machst. Am Anfang sollte er auch unbedingt einen Nutzen daraus ziehen. Du musst ihm ordentlich den Bauch pinseln, damit er sich überlegen fühlt. Wenn er die Aufgabe dann Erfüllt hat, musst die Ihn unbedingt ausgiebig dafür loben. Dann hat er noch ein zus?tzliches Erfolgserlebnis. Wenn er dann ?fter für dich Kleinigkeiten erledigt, dann kannst du auch mutig schon gr??ere Aufgaben, wie z.B. Stube saugen, versuchen. Es ist ein langer Prozess und Du brauchst auch Geduld. Er muss langsam und UNAUFF?LLIG an die Aufgaben geführt werden. Kritisier Ihn dabei nicht. Das wirft ihn zurück. Und auch solche S?tze wie "Du machst hier ja doch nichts" wird ihn trotzig machen.<br>  Viel Erfolg und lieben Gruss|`|06e29c3f4dba545724fe2d78578992beaa	Also ich glaube nicht das die Maenner umbedingt umgedreht werden muessen denn es gibt sicher genug andere die auch wissen das es bei einer Partnerschaft immer geben und nehmen gibt.Also ich koche meist immer dafuer hasse ich Alles was so mit der Waesche zu tun hat und das erledigt meine Frau.den Rest macht immer der dem es gerade auffaellt.Wnn wir verschiedene freie Tage haben kann der freihabende entspannen und selbst nach der Arbeit koche oder putze ich dann denn an meinem freien Tag mache ich auch nur wozu ich Lust habe.Bester Tipp ist ein neuer Partner|`|1985de6f2849f26a371c6b5abf43e6f5aa	nicht alle M?nner sind so aber viele.

Da weckst du den Krieger und L?sungssucher in ihm.<br>  <br>  Punkt 2: Akzeptier ihn einfach so wie er ist oder lass die Finger von ihm. Umerziehen in seinem Alter geht einfach nicht mehr.

Hab Verst?ndnis dafür, wenn er sich nicht ums Cloputzen reisst und berücksichtige auch, wenn einer von euch vom Job her mehr leistet, dass derjenige auch im Haushalt etwas weniger macht. Aber auf jeden Fall rede mit ihm, ohne Anschuldigungen.

7638a1dd7565aeaf06ff4a7227f29b5baa	that is a very good and interesting question. I say that I need love but lately i notice that when I get jealous FOR someone, not of someone, it's because they're paying attention to someone else. I think all of us desire love. I think that everyone was born with that hole in their hearts that only love can fill. But along with that I think that a lot of us really crave attention. We want the feeling that someone is listening and actually cares about them and how they feel. <br>  I think that we need both. But out of both of them we need attention most. Look at the babies in romanian orphanages. They desire, need, crave attention. If they don't get that attention, even if it's just a hold or a hug or a kiss, they become distant and creates emotional problems. which makes them emotionally stagnant when they're older and they can't develop personal relationships. So, to sum it up, i believe we need attention. With that attention can become love.|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	Love and atention-both is what ppl need.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	For my money, there are only three reasons to tell him you're bipolar:<br>  <br>  1) You're really, really serious and thinking about long term committments. You owe it to him at that point. Get him to read bits from The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide (Amazon link below).<br>  <br>  2) He just found your psych meds in the bathroom cabinet and wants to know what they are. If you're vaguely serious, then don't lie.<br>  <br>  3) You have a doctor's appointment and he wants to know why. See above about lying.<br>  <br>  4) OK, I know I said three reasons... You want to dump him, so you just tell him you are seriously mentally ill. No explanations about bipolar etc etc|`|AA11537569	When things look like they are getting serious.  Tell him before someone else does.|`|419ac1935f74b8c60bd977019c7d802caa	Preferably before a "down phase", but in reality you tell him when you feel comfortable revealing it. If it's a serious relationship, then he has to know to be able to deal with anything that could hurt him.|`|3e27601ebed640feea4cf9276d0781b4aa	Seriously, you need to tell him as soon as possible.  Next time you see him infact, sit him down and have a talk about it.  Be sure to tell him as many details as he should know.  I wonder how long you've been with him holding this secret...|`|AA11022206	If he loves you, he won't care. I have multiple personality problems, including Borderline, and that doesn't deter our relationship at all, because he's supportive and understanding.<br>  Just bring it up sometime when it fits the context of the situation.|`|a7806b35229d65df79a5c5cade6412c7aa	I dated a girl who was bipolar and I always thought she was just mad at me.  When she told me I felt a little better.  Best thing is to be upfront early on, I would give it 2 weeks so he knows you a little better before you tell him.|`|AA12150008	I can understand this situation because my sister is bipolar and it was hard for her to find dates because she wasn't sure how to tell anyone of it. Not many people knew of it.<br>  Anyways, I would definetly let him know right up front. Don't be embarrassed or shy about it. And if he doesn't like it or acts like its weird, he should be knocked in the groin. If you just tell him upfront, "Im bipolar and I want to let you know before we go any further.." then he should respect you and understand. If he cares anything about you, he'll be find with it.|`|bfa8c120a5119bb8e86448be35ba2fb9aa	I would tell him asap.  But also inform him as to what it really is and how it affects you. Get some books on it and give it to him to read up on. Make him understand it as much as you can. That way he can make an informed decision on how to handle the situation. <br>  Don't do what i did. I went threw 2 very serious relationships, and never told them that i was bipolar.  They really didn't understand any thing about me. and in the long run it was worse cause they didn't know why i was doing, saying or thinking some of the things that was going on.  Now that i am married, i did tell my husband when we first started dating, and he said "oh ya i know what that is" but had a stereo type of what he thought bi bipolar was. he thought it was like having a multi personality disorder. He really didn't have a clue and it has caused huge problems. If i could have done it over again, i would have make sure he knew what it was all about, and that way he knows what to expect and be able to support me better when times get rough. <br>  best of luck hon.  let me know how it goes.
103a4de4126259dec4d1b7688c343036aa	I like this poem.If your going to give it to someone then you might want to make it clear on what you mean in the last part, to the person you are going to give it to because, they might take it the wrong way.Other then that it is very good in how you word things and I absolutely love the simile you use in line 8, your lips are like a feather.|`|24fbe9fbed816eb842ef2cfccb270da0aa	I think I'm going to cry, not because of your poem, because another man lost his balls, turn in your man card poofta.|`|7d3c06caf309f84a08d541b3076cc8a3aa	Oh boy! your in love with someone.It just brings out the best in people when there in love.Nice poem!! now go tell her you love her.|`|AA10833232	Its pretty good, I would like it if someone read it to me|`|a00b82799734194a0e201bcd5ccda889aa	REALLY SWEET!!!!!!!!!!|`|c956eb17967d323763559ac1fae31075aa	it is nice, but it seems more like a fantasy. something u wish to have, but u know that the love or whatever it is u looking for is impossible and u can only dream of it.|`|ed51b329d88ca15e26b311aed77742aaaa	I like it, it's really good!!!|`|d2f8081589bd108f39f7de769291dcb1aa	not bad|`|d53b1c092292409eff6bccc1a77f4edeaa	It's good.

f1de8f973980424180faa6a8c3e538b6aa	Don't worry about it.  I read a story once about a 4 year old girl who didn't want to eat a meal unless she could have her plate on the floor like a puppy.  I don't remember how long that stage lasted, but keep in mind that children go through phases.  <br>  <br>  I actually have a friend who let her four year old wear a training bra.  Her age-appropriate older cousin had just started wearing one.  Sometimes parents can let their children do harmless things although they seem weird, and it helps the child to lose their fascination with what they wanted- like letting a boy have his fingernails painted.  Weird, but not life-changing, seriously.|`|a57c2db5e1066fbfd6555b50f210ba27aa	OkK WElL iF U DONt NEED iT tHEN U DONt NEED iT BUt lEt PEOPlE DO WAt EVER tHEY WANt tO DO|`|AA10266678	its not really inappropriate for that.. its not like its hurting anything at all. some girls have older role models and they wanna be just like them .. plus the younger generation IS growing up faster, but a little kid wearing a bra isnt hurting anyone.

08fd1838b0ff8fe24d37501821756927aa	When he surprises me by opening the front door to my apartment after I've just gotten home from a long day at work (we don't live together), and gives me a hug and kiss. Then he takes my hand in his and walks me upstairs (during the walk he asks me about my day at work) to the living room where he sits down and allows me to rest my head on his lap w/ a pillow, and fall asleep to a movie while he slowly runs his fingers through my hair. Then I wake up maybe 30 minutes later to find that he too has fallen asleep, so I get up quietly and change my clothes, grab a blanket (maybe 2), then go back to the couch, take off his jewelry (he wears 2 thumb rings, one on each hand, and a watch on his left hand) and lay back down on the couch, but this time I let him lay on top of me and I stroke HIS hair. Then we share several more kisses and a little intimacy before we both finally fall back asleep.<br>  <br>  This has already happened once. It was so beautiful.

AA11390972	Hi,<br>  I saw your question and I felt compelled to answer as I am a Father myself who was absent at one point in my childrens lives.<br>  I am also someone who never knew my Dad untill later on in life.<br>  People make mistakes in life and I dont know the reason why he wasnt there for his kids but people do grow up,(hopefully).<br>  If he is making attempts to see his kids thats great! I understand that you are sceptical and dont want your kids to get hurt but from experience I was hurt more by the fact that I never even knew my Dad.Believe me even though though your husband is raising them as his own the kids(Props to you Bro) know that he is not thier Father because I did and always wanted to know my real Dad.Dont take that opportunity away from them life is too dammed short.I would let the ex know that you hold all of the cards and that this is his last chance and that you will not allow him to hurt those children with false promises and false hopes.<br>  I know it is alot to deal with but remember that its all for the best interest of the children. If you need someone to talk to thats been thier with thier own father and also his own kids feel free to hit me up. I am at this place here under w no spaaces fountain no spaces519.Good luck and God bless the children.|`|AA11023745	You have to be fair to your daughters.  That is their father and they should get to know him.  Even if he comes into their life right now then goes later on down the line they need to get to know him.  You do not want them to be teens and then blame you for keeping them from their father.  Notice that I said father and not dad their dad is your husband their father is the man who wants to see them.  There is a difference.  Your husband should understand what you need to do.  Good luck|`|AA11607937	ouch! Talk about a volatile situation. This comes down to a personal call on your part. Denying your daughters desire to see him could end up in resentment. No matter how long he has been gone or how little contact he made, all your daughter sees is Daddy. There is no excuse for abandoning 2 children. You need to discuss this with your husband and work it out as a unit. There is no easy or right answer here when you are dealing with a child's affections. Take the time you need to really come to a decision that is right for THEM.|`|ea67fe797230feecd2abc2b48297ca76aa	Mrs. Nevz, the father and the daughter are asking to see each other.  I know you don't want the kids to get hurt but they get to call how they handle the relationship with an estranged parent.  Your daughter is choosing to take the risk.  Just be there for her.  Be her Mom.<br>  <br>  Do you have Child Support and Visitation established?  Have conversation with the ex and determine how you want to establish both.  You do not have to have a lawyer for this.  Just go to family court to pick up the paperwork and fill it out honestly.  Then go to court on the date they assisgn.  Child support is something you do For your child, not Against the parent.  <br>  <br>  Try to establish  a conversational relationship with the ex.  When you speak to him , speak with respect.  Respond to what he is telling you.  Do not react.  Take a breath, think of what you want to say and say it calmly and respectfully.  This teaches respect.  If he disrespects you in conversation then you can say, " I can't talk about this right now."  And end the conversation.  <br>  <br>  You have an opportunity for rest.  They have an opportunity to know their father.  And he did ask.|`|30457c1158972526ce5a920452223741aa	its better to if he lets her down than u.|`|4e908e9daf59dfc667973e972dd99af6aa	whatever decision you make know this, it will be in your daughters best intresets and if its not nessarily the one they want they will understand when they are older. They wont hate you for it. Discuss this with your husband. If he has been raising them as his own then he gets a say in the matter.

And you should not be going alone with this type of behavior and then get mad when she's no longer doing this.  The reason why she is not showing you the unprofessional attention is because now there is a possible witness to her behavior.  So now she will have to keep it  totally professional or she could be charge with sexual harassment.  See it would be hard for your to prove on your own.

Some guys can sense that if you don't feel good about yourself, then you won't put much into the relationship because you are hung up about your own perceived issues.<br>  <br>  Okay, here's my advice. Get to feeling better about yourself. What are your QUALITIES? Expand on them without fooling yourself. Second, if you think you need to lose weight, then do something. Remember, diet AND exercise, but consult a doctor and dietician. But if you are a size 8 and your friends are size 0, then you have nothing to worry about and they have to worry about bulimia.<br>  <br>  Lastly, look to different venues to meet new guys.

If you don't like this fact then maybe a little appetite control and exercise will help you out.  On a second note, it's much easier to change your lifestyle to a healthy one while you're still young then it is when you get older.  Start going to a gym, start working out, start burning more calories then you consume on a daily basis.  You don't have to exist on a diet of rice cakes and green salads for the rest of your life, you just have to burn off more then what you eat.|`|721b1a8f19c6c39d3ff8dbcae4c12bfbaa	your not fat and dont let any one call you that just be your self and guys will notice|`|AA10543597	some guys want a girl that is thiner then them and theyr mean 2 be like that. some guys dont care aobut size at all. some want a bigger girl just keep on looking 4 a guy u will find one that luvs u just 4 how u r|`|AA11434321	nope, guys dont care about your size, just be who you are and just live life to its fullest, a guy will come your way eventually becuase tere is at least 1 person for every person in the world|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	i wouldnt say you were fat- id say underweight personally, sorry if it offends. if you ask a large amount of guys - they will tell you they prefer a girl with meat on their bones ( shapely boobs and ***)<br>  <br>  I am a witmess to lawyer and her remark she posted on here.|`|e1036b0d771782209ae6e6aff05452ecaa	First off, how much larger than a 6 are you?

First by talking general things and let both of you get accustomed to being friendly. Don't rush to talk about feelings. Let it flow. <br>  Remember, girls like if you are honest and understanding. Capture her heart by listening more. By listening more you will understand her unmet emotional needs. Fulfil it and she will be yours. Just keep the attitude even after you date her.<br>  Good luck!

I know this doesn't help with the pain of losing loved ones. I lost my husband to a tragic death, then I re- married two years ago. Now we're going through a heartbreaking separation.

I can tell you this though, time eases the pain. hang in there cuz it will get better. Life has lots of hills and valleys. just be good to yourself and honor your feelings.

It seems like you may have jumped into marriage before getting to know each other. Marriage isn't about controlling one another nor is it about sex. It's more than that. Think about it, what will you gain if you are trying to control him? Nothing. If you start doing that, he might stray.

I use the attention in public but when we were in private nothing.  He just might be one of those guys that doesn't like to show affection in public.  He might feel he doesn't need an audience to see how he feels about you.  Now you have only been married 5 months, give him and yourself some time to adjust to be married.  Change does not happen overnight.  I'm sure he loves you for more than that.  Men don't usually marry you for just that.

And then secondly you should just come out and explain yourself its simple, "The other night when i told you that I loved you, I meant that I loved you as my friend. Honestly(his name)<br>  we are better friends then we would be together in a relationship. I didnt meant to lead you on in any way, shape or form, but I am only interested in our friendship and not a relationship with you." I mean it sounds like a movie because that is what life is except things arent as easy at times. But really your truth to him should be that and you cant worry about his reaction because if he is a cool dude he will understand, if he was really into expect him to be upset and just give him time he will either come around or he wont. You cant worry about that though because if you continue to lead him on then it will be worse for you in the end. ;)|`|d141cf80c17e5189ae7a69bb2205fa4caa	sex his best friend

He made it seem like just a hang out thing because he wants you to be comfortable just hand out this time then at a later date ask him if he want to go on a DATE then see what he says be bold take the first step|`|a9274461572c2a2e2b03f12613d0c6cdaa	Hello there, i think that he wanted it to be a date.

qMROtvxLaa	Wow, he is definitely playing head games with you.  The thing to think about is what he is actually saying he is jealous of you when you talk to other guys.  You are not doing anything wrong, and most guys would like to be with someone like you who doesn't get jealous at every whim.  The problem is with him and his insecurity.  Ask him this: "is there any reason why I should be jealous?"  If not, then why should I worry?"|`|Eq0K5Oj4aa	well did say he loves you .. and if he did say your not just simply for the fact that you know he loves you and he wouldnt do something like that to hurt you|`|db8d7da4ae795e91f24e11913d8fb855aa	sheeesh..<br>  no hes a freak.. he wants a jealous girlfriend.. thats what makes him feel wanted.. thats all.<br>  You are trusting and junk.. there is nothing wrong with that..<br>  the boy has issues|`|z2aIIubgaa	Wow. I say he's really insecure.  See if you can live with the relationship like this. If not get yourself a new guy. Because I bet that there are plenty of guys who'd love a girl as confident as you. <br>  You could also tell him that there's no reason for you to be jealous because you know he loves you and not those girls. Also ask him if he loves you because jealousy is such a negative emotion so why would he want you to feel it if he really cares?
d18e88aa7a76031ffdaca14e56e08e98aa	You've taken a strong moral stance, and one that is in opposition to the mainstream. If these people were confident in themselves and their own choices, they'd respect you for your decision, and act supportively.<br>  <br>  Instead, they're mocking you and making you feel like freak; that's actually a sign of their own insecurity, because (whether they admit it to themselves or not) they have made a choice that may not be the right one. When confronted with someone who made a different choice, they feel like they made the mistake -- so they treat you poorly.<br>  <br>  At the same time, they might be acting surprised (it is an unusual choice these days) but nothing more -- and you're projecting your own self-doubt onto their reactions. In other words, you are actually doubting your own choice, and you're imagining that these people disdain your choice when they really don't.<br>  <br>  So, consider your own feelings on the subject, and have the confidence to stick to your guns -- or to change your mind -- as you see fit, without worrying about peer pressure. Having said that, remember that sex is not the end-all-be-all that people make it out to be; if you stay celibate, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, and don't put sex up on a pedestal or you'll likely be very disappointed when you finally decide to do it.|`|0f48f3a80fdfdbd3c99fe6c3974d98a1aa	Oh dear,I don't think so...<br>  I allways prefer having sex with a man who is ur husband.|`|6CgxEbZ4aa	in all honesty sex with virgins is terrible!

Think about it: you wouldn't get mad at them if you felt indifferent towards them would you?!?
6a6f31ece245cb95814d7e0750e2ce8eaa	They can be amazingly deceptive.  Just remember when men cheat it is usually because they are missing something within themselves and searching to satisfy that through other women or risky behavior even.  It rarely has anything to do with him being dissatisfied by the wife herself or not loving her or her being bad.  It is usually all about him and his problems.

AA11537569	You will probably have to go to counseling to help you get over this.  It's not easy getting over a spouse cheating with another woman but somehow you feel a little at ease with that.  But when its a man, how do you begin to compete, you just can't.  So you will need some extra help and time to heal from this betrayal. Because your hubby knew he was gay or at least bi when he married you and he also knew that is gay best friend was more than just a friend and failed to tell you and was having you and boyfriend at the same time.  Now that's sick.  Get the help you need and take the time that you need to heal.|`|1216a1fd08725c7aa02894cc26d6bb62aa	Try to look at it a little differently...<br>  <br>  Your husband cheated on you and that was wrong, and yes you have the right to be extremely upset about it.  He should have told you.  He has no excuse.  Be upset...  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I think you would have felt *much* worse had it been a woman, right?  Because then it's a competition where you wonder, 'was she better than me? does he love her more?',is she prettier?  thinner? better in bed?' and your mind wanders 'til it drives you crazy.<br>  <br>  You husband is BI.  He had an affair (?) with someone who could give him something you can't - not because he doesn't love you enough or you don't love him enough - but because you are not properly equipped.  He should have told you but he may have felt you wouldn't understand or that you'd judge him.<br>  <br>  BTW, you weren't "dumb".  Unless your husband had mentioned or expressed a curiousity about being with a man, you would never have had any reason to suspect he might try it.|`|04070d0d9dca47458d274c5ced2b317caa	With a great deal of counseling so that you will be able to understand that "IT WAS NOT YOU" that was the reason for this. Your partner may have been suppressing his feelings for a very long time and due to shame or lack of confidence in his feelings (or any other number of other reasons) was not able to come honest with himself.  You have to get on with your own life and the lives of your children so that all of you will become whole again and have a normal existence.  I wish you the best of luck and hope that one day you will meet a mate who will love you and cherrish you and your children.|`|AA10292058	I always wondered how women didn't know there spouse was gay and that if it ever happened to me it would be better than them cheating with someone of the same sex because you not wondering what they have that you don't its obviouse and you couldn't change anything to give it to them.|`|AA12144404	Cheating is cheating...how can you trust him in anything, if he even keeps his sexual orientation from you?|`|b984345da5ffc81ac67daa3ecfff2effaa	Wow, he cheated on you and it wasn't even another woman.  How do you even compete with that?  You can't.

d4bf78af4a0dd47d8004b820b5dc63dfaa	From the point of view of the Catholic ceremony, the only required padrinos or "sponsors" are for 5 things: velacion, lazo, arras, anillos, and libro y rosario. The rest are extras not usually required by the ceremony (but many people add them as you've noticed).<br>  <br>  Note that if you stick to a traditional Mexican wedding you don't have a best man and maid of honor but instead have the padrinos de velacion. Usually these padrinos de velacion are an older married couple who, if not related to you, have some other close ties to the bride and groom. They'll stand/sit next to you at the altar instead of the best man/maid of honor. They'll also pay for, or help pay for, the church fees.<br>  <br>  And in an American wedding you'd have the best man carry the rings and present them at the altar, but in a Mexican wedding the padrinos de anillos do that job. <br>  <br>  It's not required, but we thought it was a nice added touch to have our padrinos at the ceremony be married couples. It adds a nice symbolism to have other married couples taking part in the ceremony. <br>  <br>  Of course you can mix American traditions with the Mexican traditions and also have a best man/maid of honor march in with you along with other bridesmaids and groomsmen if you want, but they won't have any other major role in the ceremony. <br>  <br>  As for other extra padrinos, you can really add as many as you feel comfortable with, without making it look like you are begging for money!  I have seen such things as padrinos for:  the church flower arrangements and decorations (arreglo de iglesia), the banquet/dinner/food/cake/drinks, the music/mariachi, the DJ, the limo, the photgrapher, the champaigne glasses, etc, etc.  If you have a big family, you can give everyone an option to be a padrino of something big or small and they will all feel included!    <br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|1abdaf34c4b381fdc79bbbaa61cd6d95aa	I agree with the two answers.

Yes it can look tacky with the padrinos paying for EVERYTHING or almost evrything but they are also helping you out. I see padrinos as family and friends that are willing to help you out because weddings can get expensive.<br>  <br>  We are planning a wedding too and plan to pay for the reception but are thinking about getting padrinos for the things we cant afford such as the photos.

With shy men, just not making the first move yourself may result in you losing him for good, so take the initiative, it is good sometimes.<br>  <br>  BEFORE you do this, meet your friend who has asked you out 5 times and tell him that you do not have a crush on him but you cherish his friendship.|`|AA10322594	Be straight forward.|`|AA11275880	The best thing to do is be honest with your friend and tell him your position on liking his friend, and if he is your friend he will understand and maybe he will give you some input on how to approach the one you like or he will tell you that his friend likes you too.

7e2b1c4ec2d5de6e7ece7f35d34ec4c8aa	ok I'm one of those really girly girls. You know likes pink and stuff. And if she is too then i think i know what you should do. just do suttle little things that will get her thinking maybe you do like her. Hug her in a friendly way, call her every now and then and make sure you buy her a present 4 christmas or her birthday. Not a big thing, just a sweet little thing. Just do stuff that she can't accuse you directly of falling for her. Do friendly things that could be taken in 2 ways. Now if you do these things she'll be thinking about it and no doubt talkin to her friends about it. If she starts coming up to you more and talking more but in a kinda flirty way then you know, that she's interested. Then ask her casually. Coz you've been such a good friend and so nice to her she won't hate you and break your heart if she decides not to. But if a guy was that that nice to me and didn't act like a jerk i'd go out with him. Treat her with respect and you'll get some back. This is useless crap if she smokes, dresses in black and does drugs. A bit of romance is always nice! good luck! What ever you do don't be straight out and kiss her before you know.

19f81337ba0bacce88b42787e50bf0c6aa	First of all: I'll apologize to you for all of the idiots here, since half of them are trying to tell you that you are wrong for being who you are, or change your mind, when that is NOT the question we're dealing with!!!<br>  <br>   [[ oh- and I'm sorry, this will be kinda long...but  I know how this feels and I wanted to give some insight! ]]<br>  <br>  Now, that being said. =) I went through the same ordeal and I've beens friends with teens and adults, male and female, who have been through coming out as bisexual or completely gay/lesbian. I've seen them deal with parents who were unreasonable and hateful, to those that were loving and open-minded.<br>  <br>  I am my g-ma's "pride and joy", I suppose, and when it was pretty clear to me that I was bisexual I got a little frightened because her sister is a lesbian, but we "don't talk about it" because my g-parents are strict Christians. <br>  I waited a couple years to see how the feelings played out. If you're a teen it's completely NATURAL to go through that stage, a lot do (even the guys you think don't). Whether a not it's a stage is something you only tell with time. I started feeling that way before I had been sexually active with a guy, even. After a couple years I decided it wasn't a phase and after my first girlfriend I sat down with my g-ma.<br>  <br>  ===Be very self-confident and sure of yourself before you speak with your mother. The more steadfast you are, and the more secure you come across, the more mature you seem. No matter your age, your mother will always try to question your judgement if she disagrees, but this is harder for her to do when you present yourself as a level-headed man!!!!===<br>  <br>  My grandma was very accepting. I was surprised. It sounds to me like your mother is already open-minded. Don't worry about being perfect! You'll "break" her idea of you being perfect (if that's truely how she feels) sooner or later in your life. That's her fault of seeing you like this, not your own.

Otherwise just relax and let things take their course.|`|9490cc31e63b3e2949a248e69bacf006aa	My best advice for you is to wait until he's ready because if you push things with the both of you he'll feel like he is being presser into something he's not comfortable in doing and he might say things are going to fast for the both of you and he might tell you he needs a break. Just wait it might be worth it.|`|9fcc6e46bb2c44fdf25a65e524e72132aa	Whoa, slow down girl.  Give it a little longer.

Congrats, I wish you both the best!!|`|AA11537569	You need the  certified one because after all we are dealing with the federal government.

AA10621712	Has she moved yet? If she hasn't march right up to the courthouse and get a "temporary parenting plan" and file it on the spot. You need to set a hearing and it should keep her in the state until you are able to come up with a plan. Then you need to file for paternity. You have to prove the child is yours with a blood test or the court won't do anything for you. <br>  <br>  If they have moved then you need to file the same thing in your daughters county. The jurisdiction is wherever your daughter is.<br>  <br>  Once those are filed you can petition the court for partial custody and she has to prove it is in the child best interest to move out of state. <br>  <br>  Unless the mom has serious issues (ie:drugs, child abuse, neglect) you will not get sole custody. Courts now a days recognise that in order to have a healthy minded child, they need to have BOTH parent's in thier life. Not one or the other.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions email me at jamers2004@gmail.com|`|082023338de0f87fe155ca441deb4010aa	no the mother is the mother you idiot. don't even TRY!! a child needs its mother more than its father..and if u really wanted wants best for BABY u would stop being so selfish.  physical environment is nothing compared to a mother. so THERE!!|`|83dc622a9447fc8c5ffba386894737ceaa	As the baby's father, you have a right to be in the baby's life.<br>  <br>  Get a paternity test to document you legally as the father.<br>  <br>  Take the mother to court to have visitation and custody schedules determined. <br>  <br>  It is next to impossible for you to get full custody of a newborn. Newborns need their mothers, unless you can prove her unfit due to neglect, mental illness, or substance or physical abuse. You will need evidence, not opinion, if you want to prove she's unfit.<br>  <br>  Pay child support, no matter how the mother treats you. It sets a really good example to the courts, and is what's best for the child.<br>  <br>  When you go to court, tell the judge about your plans to move closer to your baby. I don't know what state you live in, but when you've established paternity and visitation in most states, the custodial parent has a difficult time moving far away enough to prevent you from seeing the child.<br>  <br>  More than anything, always treat the mother, in and out of court, as best you can. The child would benefit from two loving parents if possible. Judges are pretty smart about knowing when claims are for spite. Keep your focus on the baby's best interests.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|AA10450745	You can't win custody of your newborn baby unless you can somehow prove that the mother won't be fit to care for the baby. Otherwise, no court of law will take a baby from it's mother. And you shouldn't try to unless you know or can prove she can't take care of the baby. You could possibly get joint custody of some sort. But just as badly as you want to be in the child's life, I am sure the mother feels the same way and would be heartbroken if she couln't ever see her baby. So try to work something out where both of you have a part in the baby's life. Good luck|`|AA10690363	get a lawyer see what they say.  you have to prove you are the better parent and she pretty much has to be  unstable mentally or hurting herself...  good luck to you.|`|AA11537569	Unless the mother is unfit, let the child stay with its mother and see the child when you can.  You should have thought about that a few months ago when you were making a baby with a woman that you were not going to be with.  I'm sure at this point you know what a condom is.  Try using them and you won't have this problem.  If she moves out of state, you will not be playing a big part of this kid's life.
AA11537569	Contact your local news stations and newspaper.  News people love stories like this.  They have a lot more contacts than the police.  It's free and it should cannot hurt to get the word out there about your missing children.  Maybe if enough people see the report maybe they will put up an award and maybe since he is a drug addict, he will turn the kids in for the money.  Also put flyers out, that's also another way of getting the work out.  God Bless!!!|`|658315d5fabd9378db4c17e2d5bec6c8aa	get legal help, they can help you get your kids back, try contacting child protective services and tell them about their father.|`|AA10146727	just because his name is on the birth certificate doesn't mean you can't fight for custody.  just have proof the he is a drug abuser and you don't have any negatives against you and take it to a lawyer that you trust that can help you.

You might want to go for a few counselling sessions as well. But there really is no way to erase it. Try to look at it as something you can learn from. There are people like that out there, but there are also very good people out there as well that would never think of doing that to someone. It is horrible that you had to go through that and you have my support. "What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"  . . . . think about that. It is completely disgusting that someone could do that to a small child(or anyone for that matter, but a child?????) I become enraged when hearing things like this. I think every single person who does something like this should be locked in a room with me for 5 minutes. That would solve MANY problems   ;)    <br>  <br>  If you ever need to talk or vent, my e-mail is always open to you. <br>  Good luck!!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	It may never get out of your mind, however, with the proper counseling services. Over time the pain will lessen. When trauma such as this happens to anyone, it makes changes in that individual. Counseling is a great way to cope with the issues that come along with it. Ask your mom or dad, if they can get you into some counseling services and be sure that it is with a trained professional that deals with children who have suffered child hood sexual abuse.

69cd36328eaef0b19b8030fabeaa9a1eaa	My wife and I have a set of 2 and a half month old twins.  We haven't had sex since they were born.  With them breastfeeding, she is always so drained and tired.  Plus, in her mind, the touching of her breasts is putting her in "mom" mode and she is seeing it as a feeding supply for her children, and no sexual stimulation at all.  That's her side of it, and I support her in that.  I look forward to when we resume, but it will be when she is ready, both physically and emotionally.  As for me, and a lot of men, there are jealousy issues, whether we admit it or not.  Yes, the boys require more attention, just so they can even stay alive!  And while I know this, I still feel somewhat neglected.  Plus, those breasts should be mine!  Yet they get some...and I don't.  So while it is all understandable and normal, it is still difficult for me as a new father to deal with.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest just holding on.  Let him know that you want to understand how he feels and make sure to listen to him and see if there is something that you can be doing.  But it's a two-way street.  Let him know how you are feeling so that he can understand what you need as well.|`|00ba14df888a1fbc98d0509d2fdf84a8aa	Hard to say but I don't think so...<br>  We have a 6 month old son and we've had sex twice in over a year. Timing is just way too tough and the stress of changing our lives to include a new baby is the reason. We both talk about it openly and reassure eachother that we are still in love but we both agree that we are just too tired and distracted. Sometimes we get "warmed up" but then one or other says that we're just not in the mood. New baby certainly changes a lot.<br>  Just make sure you have a lot of communication with your hubby and that will help.|`|21aced07776c9b1afef8531ff9f325b2aa	Ur english woman ur english, I can't make out anything, wait may be I could but I dont have the patience|`|47f1fc1f765baf699a4ec0fa12cbee27aa	Sounds like there is something diffentlly up.  I know it may sound harsh but it doesn;t look good honey.  Sometimes after a child men seem to seperate themselves because they have another responsibility that he may not want to deal with or just doesn't know how.  Maybe you should try and spicen things  up a little.  See what kinda imagination you really have.  If things still don't feel right, you need to confront him.  Also, how much effort do you put into spending time with him?  Could be that he feels you spend to much time with the little one.  Just give my suggestion a try, it might help.|`|47ff23d8737af81bc19f63510823e3edaa	Is this Ebonics?<br>  The man may be a fa g/g/o/t.|`|AA11537569	Well, for some reason for some men when their wives have a baby they now see you as a mother (kind of reminding them of their mother) and not a woman.  It doesn't happen all the time but in some cases it does.  You will need to talk to him and try to make him understand that you are the mother of HIS child and not his mother and that you are still a woman with needs.  You might want to let your mother or in laws keep the baby why you plan a romantic evening with lingerie, etc.

AA11537569	Check my answer from last time.  I gave a good answer.
AA10769523	I think u already answered your own question!  She is 20 years old and has NO IDEA in the world what she wants!  She is terrified of losing you and not having you in her life but at the same time she wants to be free and explore.  It sounds like u care about her deeply and truly love her but Id say for right now- give her space to figure out what it is she does want in life.  She needs to set goals for herself for her happiness as well as yours.  Let her know exactly how u feel and how deeply u love her but also let her know she cannot keep playing games with your heart.  Let her know u r giving her space and once she decides what she wantas you MIGHT be there to still be in her life.  Dont put your life on hold either.  Their could be someone else right under your nose who is an even better match for you.  Good luck!|`|1bcf228b5eeaaf3f36db06aabe21cacbaa	I'm in the same situation right now. I am in your g/f's shoes.<br>  <br>  She is probably just genuinely confused. In my situation I love him, and he feels the same way about me as you do about her, but I have reservations about certain compatibility issues.<br>  <br>  If I am looking at marrying someone I cannot ignore certain things that I have seen and so it makes it very confusing when you love that person but at the same time you may not be truly compatible in the end. Just b/c you love someone and they love you doesn't mean you are necessarily meant to be together or would be good together.<br>  <br>  Of course I do not know her or what she is thinking specifically. My advice to you is to give her space and let her have time to really think about it. You deserve someone who wants to be with you wholeheartedly. That is why I broke it off with my b/f b/c I do not want to be unfair to him.<br>  <br>  It might just work out the way you want it to, but don't wait around or count on it.

This is a serious situation, and potentially can be deadly for you.  It appears that he is manipulating and controling you to work on his behalf; stay away from him, and stay safe. <br>  Although the two of you are not living together, here are some steps to keep you safe in the future. 1) Do not allow yourself to be cornered in a room, especially a kitchen, bathroom, a room where weapons are stored, or rooms without doors or windows. 2) Keep important documents in a safe location (bank locked box). 3) Mentally address escape routes, and where the keys to the vehicle are. If you do not have a vehicle and cannot safely drive...go to a neighbors house or PUBLIC PLACE. 4) After talking on the phone, call a local business in your area to make your calls untraceable. If he gets the phone bill, all of your calls to domestic abuse hot-lines will not be listed. When it is safe for you to leave, the number below will get you in contact with local assistance. 5) If you write this number down, put your local area code in place of the 800, and put a persons name by it that she is not suspicious of. 6) This will be painful, but take pictures of you injuries, and put them in a safe location, such as a locked bank vault. <br>  He can attended Battery Intervention Groups, but he may not agree to attend unless he is mandated by the court. <br>  I am sorry that you are going through this, and it is NOT YOUR FAULT.

AA10404959	Speaking from experience.....<br>  <br>  I was adopted when I was 5 after many years in foster care.  When I became a teenager I started wanting to find out who and where my birth parents were.  I knew there names and approximately where they lived but not much more than that.  I found myself passing people on the street that I thought looked like me wondering if they could be my mom or dad or brother or sister.  I was lucky because at the same time I was looking for them one of my brothers was also looking for me.  My siblings and myself were able to reunite after 15 years of being separated and we still talk to each other regularly.  There is a bond there that keeps us together and I love that.<br>  <br>  I can understand wanting to know what he looks like and how he is.  If you know the hospital he was born in you may be able to find him as there may be records of adoptions kept there.

But the most important thing is, work on your friendship with her.  If you become real good friends, you will hook up outside of school for SURE...!

d403f79685dc75b5a6dea7a7e13f7723aa	I have the same problem and let me tell you there is no easy way to stop it.<br>  <br>  What was really helpful to me was when someone took me aside and told me that EVERYONE fights with their partners in a normal relationship, and many have a tiff every single day. I think it was that realisation that made me begin to think of it less seriously and see it not as the potential end of our relationship, but as something that happens that is small and not enough to worry about.<br>  <br>  When a fight comes up, and its over small stuff I approach it like this:<br>  <br>  1. Is this worth arguing over?<br>  2. If I dont bring this issue up will it affect me deeply?<br>  3. Is all the pain the argument will cause really worth getting this small stupid thing off my chest?<br>  <br>  If no, dont bother... talk about the really significant stuff sure, but the small stuff aint worth it honey. Not everything needs to be brought up every time.|`|20197e178062d18611e09a43125664efaa	My suggestion is to find a person that LISTENS to you.

(we have broken up sense then) but I can give you advice on how to handle it:<br>  <br>  1. Someone has to be the bigger person and stop the conversation from becoming into a fight. If he insists to argue then you should not say anything and just walk away, get a breather (smoke a cigarette).<br>  <br>  2. Somebody say SORRY! that was the problem in my relationship, we had to much pride and insisted that what we were saying was right. relationships are all about compromise.<br>  <br>  3. Try and not to sweat the small stuff, i know that sounds hard so you BOTH have to work at it. My ex boyfriend and me once fought over who is going to open the door (it gets worst than that believe me). We made a big issue over it and didnt speak for days, we reconciled but we were both exhasted by the tension and you dont need to go through that. <br>  <br>  <br>  As I said before relationships about compromise. He has to learn to say sorry and you have to learn to say sorry. Learn it fast, or otherwise when i real topic comes between you, you wont be able to handle it. and I honestly say GOOD LUCK|`|1728281b58dafa932c015c63fec55d0caa	Ask him to sniff your cute little stinky feet. But only if you have sexy feet. Otherwise it can backfire.|`|605b624c7f55984602f36f60814d7fe9aa	I have been through the exact same thing. Basically, there is no getting around it. If it is something little, you'll either get over it or get used to it. I for example, have been arguing with my bf for 2 years now, and it just starting getting better when he actually started listening, but I was (supposedly) always the one starting the argument by "complaining." If your trying to tell him something that you don't like about him that you want to change and that turns into an argument, he's either letting you know he don't care what you sayin, or that he aint gonna change. Heck it could be both. Either way, you can't just stop. <br>  <br>  PS- It doesn't matter how you tell him, the reaction is going to be the same either way|`|AA11480683	It depend on the problem, it really sounds like your both frustrated have some good sweaty sex maybe outside, make it a little dangerous, like on the hood of your car while your, in the middle of a big traffic jam........................................|`|AA12267104	just marry him|`|a9274461572c2a2e2b03f12613d0c6cdaa	Hello there, fights and love, never are together.

And would open the door for u, but it will also open the door for him to be more receptive to other girl's feeling, and ultimately he could end up leaving u the same way he got with u. After all he did it to his previous g/f for u, so don't u find it very likely he could leave u for another girl who express how much she likes him.

If they are still together after she lied once, either trust her and lay off, or all the questions everyday because of no trust at all..And they end up hating each other.|`|b99025360602dc514ad582e52f5846d4aa	if i am his girlfriend i will be really angry, because sheis just his girlfriend,not his wife! so you should tell your friend not to do that|`|dc45fe49fb3908f574106e956a9aa2ddaa	It's ok 2 talk 2 guys, but it's not ok when his gf r flirtin or touch another guy.<br>  I bet ur friend talks 2 girls that r his friends or someone else, as long as they keep their hands off each other|`|1f950e795741171570dd0a15337c7ac5aa	Well what makes this hard is that she has lost his trust and that is something she is just going to have to deal with until she earns his trust again, that woud only make sense. It is not ok for her boyfriend to be all up in her life and not trust her but if she was not honest then yes this is normal for him to act this way.|`|2f40382354c7ac4d223905e34b56e424aa	she is a slu-t|`|559e8a61d8c02569505764b4cf49b012aa	Personally, i can't imagine a woman which would tolerate that. If your friend doesn't trust her, which it doesn't seem like he does, then they probably shouldn't still be together or at least he should take a step back and decide if he does trust her before she attempts to decide if all the questioning is worth it, although i don't know your friend, thats what i would feel in that situation.|`|9317936a466ad45f42100e75e5a5f6c7aa	I would never deal with that. That's nearing ownership thought. Does he tell her every girl he talks to? The more he presses the issue, the more likely she is to be spiteful and do whatever it is that made him insecure before, and lie more.|`|AA10124391	He is being overly jealous and possessive - it is not right and does not form a good relationship.  If he is insecure with his girlfriend that is HIS problem and he should break it off until he gets some more self-security.|`|AA12236762	If he has no trust in her, whether it's her fault or not, the relationship is already over.|`|b934e8aa8e9fdfad0183b855dd1ee3a3aa	Not really!  She should be able to talk to other guys.  She should also be able to have them as friends.  But she should not be overly friendly with these guys.  Is he insecure because she cheated or because she lied about talking to another guy.  He needs to work on liking himself and feeling more confident or he will probably lose her.  If she knew he would be upset knowing she talked to another guy; she would lie to avoid the 3 hundred million insecurity questions that follow.|`|c70e975a64458d1d2a2a3fedfc9ba1aeaa	I think he probably needs to ask himself if he trusts this girl or not coz he doesnt seem to if he is asking her that. Also he prob should ask himself if she's worth this much trouble. I know I wouldn't stay with a person who cheated no matter how much i liked or loved them. I dont think its stupid that he's insecure i just think that maybe going this far shows him that he doesnt trust her and if theres no trust whats the point in being with her? You should be able to trust your partner.|`|ed25fe9f464688fd80716b7672f999b0aa	It's definitely not ok.  There's a possibility of a domination (non-sexual) effect growing into the relationship.  There is always a stronger and weaker person in a relationship but it may grow into a bigger divide.  The girlfriend should speak with the boyfriend and give him a nice long heart-felt talk to help quell his insecurities.  It's difficult for me to say exactly what she should tell him, but she should definitely say things that are comforting.<br>  <br>  Good luck to all 3 of you.
edd837d1a03371f4e0ed6e70562f0084aa	I have to say that as long as the other person will allow I would do anything for him/her. But do keep in mind that if there is no return consideration being reciprocated then it is enevitable that the relationship sputter out and die . There never can be a halfmoon type of love. it has to come back around in some shape or form and if not the love cannot continue to manifest.|`|AA10236885	I see where you are coming from....love is a really strong emotion...and I see your passion, but, I feel one has to be a tad practical too. And being practical does not mean we give up on our love. There are people who think ahead and plan, and there are people who are very spontaneous and take it as it comes. Try to take well-thought out risks. Have a back up plan ready. That's just the careful-me saying that. But inside, I am just as passionate as you are when it comes to love =). It's your choice ultimately.|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	Course I would!
eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	If you do what he wants just because he threatens to leave you, what's next? "Do a threesome or I'll leave you". "Do my homework or I'll leave you".

If he refuses to back down, then he obviously doesn't love you! It's false logic, but if he uses it, then so can you. <br>  <br>  Overall, don't let him push you around. You're in this relationship as equals, so if he starts to get controlling and starts to pressure you into things that you don't want to do, tell him straight or let him go.|`|72cace897f96110529fd1359b9065abdaa	dont do it.

d1bcef13691e1dd4e3233ccd73614eafaa	If by 'boyfriend' you mean someone you're in a relationship with, then why do you have so many? If you mean friend that's a boy, then what's the problem with him being gay? Gay guys make great friends, and like you said, they are sweet and are great listeners...kind of like girl- friends but minus the PMS. So, if anything (since you obviously care about him), make sure he knows he can be open with you about his sexuality (since he obviously isn't), and be a great friend to him in return.|`|AA11537569	Unless you can live with him being with other men, I would say keep him in the pack since you have so many but I would not sleep with him.

Just be like, "Okay, let's give this another shot...I just hope that you're not going to pressure me into doing anything, because then it's over." You gotta act like you want him, but will drop him at any given time. Keep him guessing. So just go for it!|`|9d9084a09993fc2fcb74358f0c89f3bdaa	So he told you that he wanted you and then when you said it he said he didnt know?? im kinda confused but if thats right then you really gotta think why you broke up in the first place if you think the problems that made you guys break up wont change then its just gonna be opening up the same wounds and if hes pressuring you to have sex then hes really not the right guy...the worse thing you can do is pressure yourself.|`|AA11313325	Well kinda let my brain descramble for a second. You should make whole sentences. But I think I may know what your saying but I wouldn't get him back or make a move. All he's after is one thing and if he gets it,you might not see him anymore. Well just think of that long pause of silence on the phone. But it's up to you, I wouldn't do it. You need to move on and get someone who will respect your feelings and wishes and treat you right.|`|3d170e30ac8a7463fe2a7d2a4d9b38d8aa	first of all, you have to look back at why the relationship ended. if it was because yall just couldn't get along or because he wanted to have sex and you didn't.  you have to talk to him, face-to-face, if you want a straight answer. ask him to talk one day and lay down the rules [you don't want to be pressured and that kind of thing] and if he doesn't want to follow them, the move on!   goodluck with whatever comes of this! :]|`|a9274461572c2a2e2b03f12613d0c6cdaa	Hello there, i think that if you trust this guy, then you should get back together.

AA10138064	You have to love yourself first of all.  A woman have to know when they are in a bad relationship and it appear as though the feelings are one sided.  You need to take a step back from the whole relationship and ask yourself if you want to really be with a person who is on drugs.  I believe that you deserve better then that and you should wait on someone who is going to love you for you and want to spend time with you.  The relationship does not seem to be going anywhere and he already told you that he wants out.  Take care of yourself.|`|949588da14355c4b0dcd222e0f68add7aa	Move on....So then you both can do what you want..<br>  He will come back....|`|AA11498233	i think he doesn't love u truly|`|AA10145813	if you keep trying to contol him like telling him he can't do this or that then he will be gone he needs time for himself. and people may tell him what he is doing is wrong but he won't listen until he finds out for himself, you may push him away telling him over and over.|`|AA10819912	No man is worth your tears my dear,you can only cherish him before you try other relationships.but once you try ,then you will realise you were even late.You are right to stop him from such habbits b'se you are trying to make him a responsible husband to be.Every thing happens for a reason,let go.|`|lT5jjKznaa	sounds like he is being sorta selfish to me. To be in a relationship that long and to worry about "what he wants to do" (bad things no less) in stead of "what WE can do to better the relationship" should raise a red flag right there. If drugs is on his mind more than you are, then you don't need to deal with that. Even though y'all have been together for almost 2 years, you don't need him blaming you for caring. It doesn't even sound like he really loves you . . .
t9k7Xexraa	I think that younger women like older men because it gives them a sense of security. I have dated plenty of older men and I feel that older men are more mature and experienced. It's the same as being with a younger man except you get to skip all the drama, commitment issues and the lack of communication that occurs with younger men.  Friends with benefits is only good when neither one of the parties wants to make the commitment. It also gives those who want  the tender loving care as well as the freedom that they desire. Hope I was of some help.|`|2731e7a4d3d800a801ebe5d1c5c0d6a9aa	they want to feel special and sometimes the girl feels like the younger guy cant give it to them.  they think the older guys are more mature and will be there for them.|`|6197d1b3b641ee97ed9280312bf08fffaa	Probably because they want it for more than 2 minutes at a time.|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	Probably because they have had more experience of life and they act more grown up!

Many teachers take their job seriously and do not strike up "friendships" with their students.  If she has not done anything specific...but rather treats you like any other student... then just get your homework done on time, participate in class, pay attention to what she says, and show that you are interested in learning something in her classroom.  Don't try to "suck up" to her.... you will reward her for HER hard work by showing that you take her class importantly.

Thats just how it goes.|`|2TlN47Ihaa	Ya know why people say girls always remember their first boyfriend? It's because it's a new experience, and anything new is exciting. People go all out, head over heels, putting their whole entire beings into that first thing because how would they ever know better?<br>  It's not necessarily feeling less strongly about it, it's just that the first few times, you went about it all wrong. Being in a relationship isn't constantly fun where there's always something to say or do, maybe give it time, or maybe she's not the right girl for you.<br>  Best of luck.|`|47iY7d5Laa	A lot of it has to do with the fact that these new ones just aren't right for you.<br>  <br>  Another thing, I think you should give your heart a break. I think you should go single for at least a few months, and give your heart some time to just relax instead of trying to love somebody.<br>  <br>  Then, try going into a new relationship. I bet you'll have some stronger feelings for that person, unless they're totally not for you either.|`|O3x3uecIaa	Maybe because it's fun to chase a girl [not literally] and stuff.

Because that's what it sounds like. He was excited to see her; wouldn't you be? He probably doesn't get to see her or talk to her that often and he wanted to focus his attention on her. Be happy that he was so into her; stop being so self-centered. If something were to happen to him, and hopefully not; that video could be the only thing his little girl would have of him someday and in that moment she would know she was loved by her daddy.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Honey he was caught up in the moment. Seeing his baby was overwelming. I'm sure he didn't ignore you purposely. Don't be hurt. Know he's safe and now happy seeing you on screen.|`|dyKn3WgBaa	ok first of all he is in iraq!! and you know what situation is in iraq!! i think he was jittered!!(nervous)|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Oh honey, he was just overwhelmed with emotion! He loves you, and was trying to be a man and not cry in front of you!<br>  Don't take it so personally Sweetie, men show their emotions totally different than we women do. <br>  Thank him for his service to our country,  and Thank YOU for giving up your husband for us for a short time.|`|1FvUBC4Zaa	When used to work offshore drilling oil wells..yes I worked for evil "BIG OIL" and would come home after 14 days I missed my wife, but my daughter who was 14 months at the time was growing up, talking, walking and generally so much DIFFERENT than when I left.  I didn't mean to hurt my wifes feelings, but my daughter actually had to re-learn and reconnect with me, because outta sight, outta mind.  <br>  <br>  He was amazed at how big his daughter was getting
AA12306303	I live in northern Minnesota, near Duluth. And I am getting married in July 2009, and I know that it was relatively inexpensive for me to rent a garden lot near the St. Louis River, near Lake Superior for the view. Or on the Vista Star, one of the Vista Fleet boats that goes about Lake Superior. I also know that Gustavus Adolphus and First Lutheran Church (the one of 3rd and Maria by Metropolitian State) offer fairly good rates for weddings, and have wonderful pastors, FLC has Chris Berthelsen and GA has Bonnie and Hans Dahl. And both have good reception areas. Also, FLC owns an island in Deerwood, called Bay Lake Camp, they have a beautiful outdoor chapel that is relatively inexpensive to use. Anyways, I hope you find what you are looking for. Good luck.|`|10d730f3058a462be2da58885ab40064aa	Have you checked the major Hotels?  Sometime you can get a good deal.|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I don't know what you are looking for but I found this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.weddinglocation.com/region/48/locations/" rel="nofollow">http://www.weddinglocation.com/region/48...</a><br>  <br>  Also - I found a magazine just at the grocery store called Wedding Sites and Services - it had tons and tons of ideas.  That's where I found my site.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
GmUCtPCGaa	you're thinking too much.<br>  just hug the guy.|`|IFrzXsDXaa	Well if he likes you too whats the problem? i hug like...ALL of my chik friends. its become a greeting. lol lke ya no if u dont its kinda sometimes like not even saying hello. Ha. Im in 10th grade and i think u should hug him and YES you are overthinking this. Let life happen. God is in control. Hope this helped. :) care 2 answer my question?|`|OKrJrDF1aa	You should do it when ur aloneeeee :DDDDDDDDD<br>  Like if yur in an amusement park with all your friends including him, <br>  and you two(ONLY YOU TWO)are going into a haunted house and you get scared, hug him :D then quickly take ur hands off him, like you did it on accident. Then if he turns red, murmur sorry quietly facing the other way to make him think about how cute you were  just then.<br>  Then from there on, start hugging him more then go up and up like  hug per week to 2 pepr week to 5 per week and stuff :O|`|9F8zkLTRaa	Well if he REALLY likes you you should go for it.And trust me it will feel so good.I am in 6th grade and I hug my guy friends all the time.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	i wouldnt worry, just hug him like any other boy. i dont think hugs are a big deal.

313afe838a0489639fc15b0394b300ebaa	Yeah, it's pretty likely that he's got a 'thing' for you. Don't take it the wrong way though; he's not acting like a stalker or anything. He probably just likes seeing you and probably wants to get to know you.|`|NTuzrrpRaa	OF COURSE! Guys like girls who are the opposite...it balances them...a guy NEEDS a woman who is different from him!<br>  A guy loves a woman who is different because he knows being like himself is easy...because he does it...so on the other hand you look independent and strong because you are a totally different type of person...and to a guy (who are mostly dumb founded about relationship) that makes you appear smart, and a guy loves a woman who can handle him...and take control of situations he don't feel comfortable in...situations such as a relationship and taking care of him and if you are the opposite person he knows you could handle that unlike himself (a man needs someone to treat him the way a GOOD mother would) there like a child...even though they want to feel in control....thats not the way it is, and deep inside they know that...lol
AA10702241	If your intrested the best thing a guy would aim for first is prob the face *** and then boobs. Or ***, boobs, face. and prob the most sexyist thing is the legs.  its attractive alright but then the next thing they go for is the personality of the person, if theres no good personality to back up the body they got, its gonna be a less fun of a ride for them|`|3wNbW2lSaa	Just about any part can be attractive if it's shaped well...except internal organs, elbows, knee caps, and that webby flesh thing between the fingers....I'm pretty easy to please.|`|670q0nkWaa	Face, then legs. I love a girl with slim, sexy legs.|`|NPoQwEjoaa	Don't really consider physical because it can change so quick. A big definate is getting to know her quality; meaning what type of person she really is.|`|32c0bd0458ac91f9a64a49f72cb30d4caa	eyes, good figure, oh ya and a outgoing funny personailty.|`|94rS4KHcaa	Honestly eyes neck and the small of the back. that and ankles.|`|HHf24ToRaa	their personality, their eyes, there teeth, and their body...|`|xQDHXgbLaa	t!ts and *ss|`|W3HQwrgBaa	I find her legs to be the most seductive thing a woman posseses, at least to me.|`|4e77a17493071767244cb1ea9bc0bc5eaa	omg, do you even need to ask?!
jBslLP64aa	Crying is a natural way to cleanse the system of an emotional overload.  Give them some time and space to work whatever it is out on their own. Keep a watchful eye, though. Let them know you're there if they want to talk, and when you do broach the subject, do it in a round-about way, let them do the talking, and steer the conversation as subtely as you can.|`|26yDRM2Vaa	i would definitely try to see what's up. sometimes people need a little pushing around to get their priorities straight. maybe they're scared to tell you something or how they're feeling and that's why they are pushing you away. the longer this prolongs the worse it is for them. i know that i wish i had someone who would come and "kick me in the butt" once in a while because i'm the depressive type. they need someone there for them and also, don't let them be too rude to you|`|mPV3M2nJaa	I would give it a day,  but I would check on that person frequently.  Maybe they will be ready to talk in a few or more hours,   <br>  I would go check on that person once they fel asleep to make sure they were all right .<br>  If it is something that is ongoing, i would seek medical help for a possible diagnosis.
gON79yYtaa	feel proud of yourself! they are looking at you and admiring you! and the guy who is making hardcore contacts might have the hots for you!|`|SHnIO5kfaa	Be confident and neglect it at all<br>  Who wants to know anything about you will come to you and ask ,otherwise he is nothing and mathematically must be a zero according to you. In other words let him/them say what they want to say, you will gain nothing from that.<br>  Takecare of yourself and your study.<br>  Nothing is important.<br>  Either you are a boy or a girl.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Obviously they are talking about you.  What are they saying? Who knows!  But I would guess that the guy who is trying to make eye contact with you has a bet from someone in the group that he can get you to go out with him.|`|AA10353609	i'm guessing you're a girl. they think your hot. just be flattered.|`|fedaceb93a23b2ad5bbe91b63f303701aa	Well Lotus you lucky thing! Yeah I reckon it does mean something fella! This particular group of males are infact a Gay Gang Banging Outfit who are obviously plotting to Gang rape you at any given moment! The one who looks at you in that intense/inappropriate manner is the lead man - the "Daddy" of the outfit and he's the one who ll make the first move! I would seriously think about changing ALL my regular routes-ANYWHERE if I were you and even then you 're not guaranteed to escape the gang!|`|fueF9bfCaa	means they are flirting with you and maybe one of them is having a crush on you or else they take u as a source of entertainment|`|Mej9VtKVaa	Are the guys from ur college?.... Are u always alone...?<br>  Don't be alone.. always remain in group of ur friends and if the guys r from ur college then doesn't matter, <br>  ( it happened to me many times, they just used to look at me)..... but if they r not..... then Be very careful..... u never know what would happen....!<br>  .|`|aeec637f1e01bdeddbcf037a4d718f44aa	Hey dont act too much lady........... you like their look. right? Anyhow its natural. You just carry on with your work. Let them look. or else if you want to give yourself, give ya..... you have hottest party waiting for you.|`|ba672544f0e73f26995b3d93e9fe86f0aa	Probably thinking of a way to jump you and take your tampons for theirselves lol Kidding. They're probably talking **** about you. You should give them a hxc look back. Throw some eggs at them. Or better yet, throw a used tampon at them... Check & mate lol|`|dzN5mxm2aa	they r having fun<br>  they want to njoy their youth<br>  honest guys r decent<br>  i'll not say more<br>  if that guy is decent then think bout him<br>  else <br>  leave<br>  and buzz them away|`|gm7apczkaa	they like you and wanna hook up with you!
07d5fc3b7c5c9bdad5f4552d69a33720aa	Yes, we are back together.  We've been on/off for 4 years (we live in separate states).  But recently we've decided to relocate to be near each other and he even asked me to marry him so we can start a family.  While we were separated...at first I cried like a baby.  Over time I got stronger, just when I thought I was ready to move on he appeared singing a new song, saying how much he missed me and would do anything to have me back.  We are in the planning stages of my relocation.  I hope this helps!  Sometimes people make mistakes and you have to give them second chances.  While I have a forgiving heart, I refuse to be anybody's fool!|`|LsAjSUv8aa	Well, I went back to my ex and it didn't work out, I went back to him twice actually but I guess we just weren't meant to be. He was disrespectful and I didn't like that so i departed from the whole situation. When we were separated I felt that our trust wasn't the same but I was still wrapped in him because I thought I loved him but in the long run, he wasn't about anything so I just let it go..But that Ne-Yo song tells it all how I feel now lol because I still wonder does he think of me, even though I wouldn't take him back because I learned from my mistakes.|`|l5jVlLqBaa	my ex is in a relationship.<br>  <br>  and no, i dont thnk i would just b/c we broke up in the first placee but i'm not sure.<br>  <br>  getting back with him has never been an option for me:/<br>  <br>  good luck though|`|4379a92f1f09d1481c76b6cfc44ceb3caa	I've gone back to an ex before. We were taking a break from each other because he was so busy, but we got back together in a few months. We're still together now.|`|AA10926354	Yes, once...but it wasn't the same...I was a different person by the time we thought about getting back together. I had grown and just wasn't interested in him that way anymore; however, we're great friends.|`|Rjx4KwaYaa	it dont work!|`|dj5molfJaa	I did and we have been happy every since. See me a my bf broke up for about 8 months. We still hung out and stuff. We decided to get back together and we have been happy every since. We love eachother more now than we did before. So to answer your ? yes.|`|sXWVbxPuaa	Yea i've gone back several times...it doesn't work. No matter how hard you try.
plBi3hcnaa	because he wants you and knows he cant have you now. by kissing the other guy it only reinforces the fact that he blew it big time .|`|Ug5jvQLOaa	This the character of a dirty man. Therefore one should not have any physical relations before marriage,this is Indian culture,follow it and save one self from spoiling ones life.|`|f92b24ff91bdb49b8780e5f88588c32eaa	Because this type of man wants his cake and wants to eat it too.<br>  <br>  Basically he is a controlling jealous man who wants all for himself, and gives nothing back. <br>  <br>  Leave while you can.|`|kj42KvGhaa	get over it and MOVE ON! Don't get trapped into such an unhealthy for a relationship situation!|`|0t8C4d3Saa	They can't and you shouldn't worry about it. You're free to do whatever you please.<br>  <br>  Are you free tomorrow night? :P|`|7436f525e7b327837193183ebebfb4f8aa	forget him. he's an idiot|`|AA12105159	Because he wants to control you. Don't let him do that. Most men feel that they can do what they want even though they have some one and get away with it. But if a woman dose the same they are considered a hoe. You go a head and do your think he will be ok.|`|S3u9u9Szaa	he's an idiot|`|jQzNcbtjaa	He is being a fool, he made his choice he can't have it both ways. Maybe he was hurt by you kissing another man because he knows what he lost. You do your own thing don't worry about what he thinks.|`|tiZZcNdWaa	Because he wants it both ways. He wants to do his thing but he wants you to still be in to him. He is selfish. Wants his cake and the extra icing too. Do your thing, girl...He is about to be tied up with a child and possibly some drama..|`|mkxLrKHxaa	he probably likes you but feels responsible for the girl he got pregnant|`|dGFJHuzVaa	Don't mind him... he's a loser... hahaha!!!
nol8AyMeaa	dude chicks check out my package all the time and i dont get  offended at all|`|0b2c25ed623bde84266f08aa45b85c6eaa	I have curves and if guys notice, i dont have a problem it. As long as they are not a pig about it. I work in agriculture and all my co workers are men. More than one I noticed them sneaking a peek, its human...and since I turned 40, its nice to know I still got it! LOL<br>  <br>  And dont worry, you wont catch a woman checking out your package, we are not that shallow or obvious!|`|Zhru5vjnaa	some girls like it because it makes them feel "sexy" or wanted. but they act offended because if you know they like it, you might think she's "easy"....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?|`|fa46f38bb9e13e9616e2991e981595beaa	A. we always know...<br>  B. we may act like we're offended...but we're really thinking in our heads..."yeah i know i look good"|`|AA11537569	I don't take offense to it because I understand that men are going to look if given an opportunity.  If you have a nice package, the ladies are looking.  We always look at the great packages that guys carry.|`|fe8a853f925097d816491329187b043daa	i think it depends on the girl<br>  and what they really want<br>  i personally right now since i have a boyfriend <br>  i would get offended.<br>  but if i like the guy <br>  i mean<br>  eeh its just looking i mean its not like they are touching anything<br>  so yes and no<br>  <br>  hope this slightly helped
YyYBv5bzaa	Its all up to what you prefer in a guy, but the nice guy sounds better. He doesnt drink or do drugs, just like you, so there wouldnt be any pressure in that area. and he sounds like hes nicer to you anyway.|`|92UeIBNAaa	GUY A!!!!!!|`|AA10554197	it depends what you want a bad boy or a nice guy?<br>  i think u should go wit the nice guy or whichever likes you.|`|GErgSyVOaa	Guy A...  sounds better, but, Guy B probably appeals more to you because he's not so easy and sounds like a challenge... why not be friends with both and perhaps all can benefit... guy B sounds like he needs someone to talk some sense into his head with his habits...   'course bad boys like being bad boys cause of the attention it gives them... good luck!!!|`|AA11991351	Guy A is the nice guy guy B is the one who will break your heart huni,go for A,xx|`|ccqIYm0eaa	Definitely Guy A!  I'm sure Guy B sounds exciting and whatnot, but Guy A is your winner.  ALWAYS pick the nice guy!
h9tVRXVPaa	Her preception is that you may be a follower and she wants a little space.
5dXzYB8Naa	The peis size does not matter when it comes to girls, some care and some don't, just depends on the person dude!<br>  <br>  Penis can be bigger with jelqing, it is the only known thing to increase size.<br>  <br>  The penis is not like the chest or the abs or anything close to that. so you needa go soft on it, wihat penis pumpers do not or will never do, you need something easy and soft pretty much, haha. and jelqing can provide that. so just google jelqing forums, sign up and you'll be on your way.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	No matter what u have to work with what u've got. Cause if a women sees or gets the vibe that u insecure about it, she'll thrash u for it. but let me answer ur questions:<br>  <br>  1) not really<br>  2) don't know, but steroids will make it smaller( for the big guys) -LOL<br>  3) don't think so|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	man its not the size its the pound of the hammer|`|09a6e4be19614bb4babe44f26a3cdcfeaa	Stick your thumb up your nose, then put fine tissue paper up your nose and tell me which one tickles more. That will be your answer.|`|5593cbf55deeaf4344a8bf599a5164c3aa	it is not how deep you fish, it is how you wiggle the worm.|`|cf3fe9430b8e58fe263cde22f5212092aa	Ok first off yes it does matter. Hopefully your bigger then a slender tampon or your in trouble. Other then that it is all on how you work it. The nerves in a woman are actually within the first inch of entrance so the length is not so much an issue. The average man is 4 to 6 inches hard. I wouldn't worry about wasting money on a penis pump. If you have cable watch Talk Sex With Sue she is very informative or look her up online. As for making the penis bigger your arousal level helps. Take care.|`|c008cdaf84ea6d0a12eef562e0de2929aa	its not the size of the penis is how the man works it, is what you will always hear/ but honey let me tell you something, its really on how the your partner takes it, its how he/she feels about it. the second thing i don't think that there is really anything out there that will make a penis larger, and penis pumps are hoax they  will only hurt you in the future.
oeHOkG9Caa	no, but i almost moved there once|`|AA12044332	nope, you are very far off!
AA12059817	Well there comes a time when you realize that hiding it..just doesn't solve anything. I'm sure that people have tried to love her..but she may have rejected that love, and support. I hesitate to bring this up..but why did the family "disown her?" There is no good reason for that to happen..but there must be a reason in there minds, and the friends minds. But please try to understand the others point of view here..when you lie to-or deceive, or use others for things..be it attention, or support, or money...and you don't reciprocate any of it.-people feel betrayed, or scorned, and used-depending on exactly why she believes she is a bad person, people won't be all that forgiving when they themselves are very hurt. Why wouldn't she just ask for help? I know many successful people that try to hide their suffering..I always see through it...but accepting help..can be even harder than admitting there's a problem to others.|`|h7WEloXraa	i would have definitely said something to that poor girl. i feel so <br>  selfish that i - for the past few days have been sad over my ex<br>  having a new girlfriend, just makes me realize how pathetic i'm <br>  being and to just move on and forget him.|`|4KHpOztkaa	oh my god that is really bad she should of deserved more than that but you couldnt of stopped her. Yes she should of has love and support through it but her stupid family and friends just ignored it.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	yes, i would! that is such a sad story... wow. but, ya, i think if someone knows that there is always someone there then they are less likely to end up doing that kind of stuff.|`|2iigkuUKaa	oMG.. im sooo sorry for her...thats really terrible and yeah if i had a friend in need for support and love then id take out time to spend with her and tell her how wonderful she was.<br>  <br>  RIP to whoever she was|`|zKAtOueQaa	OMG..<br>  <br>  i would feel so bad if i new her and didn't do anything|`|3ILoAb8daa	I've changed my life twice.

I think it varies. Sometimes there are ones that give awesome advice, and other times  that same person gives not so good advice.

H8i73fnEaa	I'd suggest you stay faithful to your fiance, you do love him right?  Also it wouldn't be fair to the man you're engaged to. <br>  ^-^|`|83b0a2f37010047debb7c085a07c4589aa	My guess is your beautiful. Or this is just in his nature. I know plenty of people who it's just in their nature to be " flirtacious"|`|7cb2736718fc8aefe05adb763ddc8293aa	Watch how he acts towards other people. He might really just like/respect you as a student and as someone he thinks is talented and wants to be supportive and let you know about things you might be interested in.<br>  <br>  He might also be flirting... who knows. Some people flirt as a method of communication though, so it may not be that he means anything by it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't know you're engaged... which he should.. haha, you could always talk about things you're up to in whatever context-friendly way you can squeeze in a "my fiance and i" haha, that kind of sends the message.|`|2816f5850df6d40097ba83a4cd758b5faa	Uh, you just answered your own question.  You're engaged.  If you don't feel the same about your fiance as you do with the professor, then you need to let your fiance know.|`|685f86af0c8794b93a27cfcfe2d9e93faa	It doesn't matter if he is flirting or not you are engaged and if you have feeling for your Prof then you don't need to get married.  You should really rethink this marriage thing.|`|A9T7QZ9Haa	I'd say, if you're engaged already, who cares if the professor is flirting with you??  Leave it alone and concentrate on your own guy, that one you're engaged to marry.<br>  <br>  As for the professor, there shouldn't be much school left this school year anyway.  When he invites you to something, say, "I'd love to go to that party....do you think I could bring my fiancee along?  It would be great to introduce him to everyone" or something like that.  Or else just turn him down nicely: "Sorry, but I have other committments that night."|`|JwCjuATMaa	If you love your fiance, you should not be thinking about and getting butterflies because of another guy... did you try to talk about this issue with your prof? If he is really interested in you, you should explain to him that you are happily engaged period... If you are not happily engaged to your fiance, I would really recommend breaking off your engagement before the issue escalates and gets really messy.<br>  <br>  good luck whatever your choice may be.|`|NZsNqvrbaa	if your engaged someone flirting should just be dirt on your shoulders. if you dwell on it to long you might get yourself in trouble, trouble|`|bbBJdMcGaa	probably. but if you love your fiance, stay away from your prof to avoid jealousy that could wreak havoc on your relationship. in respect to your prof, give him the benefit of a doubt and send signals that you would just want to stay friends with him.|`|rCFpwXdEaa	who cares, yuk!!!!!
YyYBv5bzaa	I would just ask him to make you something because it would be more special.|`|BFXnemSyaa	Why don't you tell him you want him to take the day off work and spend the day doing romantic things... walks on the beach, picnic, making love in the afternoon... whatever it is that makes you feel close to him?
0303844f33933188d7bea8da91f19058aa	Well lucky for you its not really that hard.  Dont put a lot of pressure on yourslef.  Just be yourself and act normally and just say hi and smile.  That usually will start some small conversation and get the ball rolling.  <br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|HvWwjnLFaa	get a mega phone run to boys rest room and when she passes ask her from closed doors have fun.|`|F4dZi5qyaa	There is an old saying that goes "The more no's you get the more yes's you'll get".|`|2WPrwyowaa	The only way to gain confidence is to like yourself...since you are whatever you want to be that shouldnt be a problem... Confidence is very important when trying to get together with a girl, without it you are pretty much out of luck. Be yourself, and love the person you are.|`|FKEiN7MTaa	By telling yourself that the worst thing that could possibly happen, is that she'll shoot you down. If that happens (which is unlikely unless she's a total witch) then you'll get over it and move on. You'll never know your possibilities unless you go for some of them.|`|NDTOJhwDaa	I used to never talk to girls. When I really liked a girl, I just decided there was nothing I could really lose by asking her on a date at my favorite Italian restaurant, because the worst thing that could happen would be being rejected. It turned out she liked me too and we still have a good friendship even though we don't date anymore. Even if she turns you down, not many girls are closed-minded enough to never give a guy a single chance. Even if she is, do you really want to get to know that kind of person?|`|uHyqu0ZNaa	be sexy and they will approach you. Nothing makes a girl feel good like being looked at by a cute one. (but only look at the face and not the body)
SWYV1BsLaa	He thinks you are playing games with him.  If you feel like you have to act unavailable are you really interested in him?<br>  <br>  Not really a great way to start a relationship.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Since you answered him honestly, I don't think you were playing your cards.  I think he might be a player and was trying to find out if you are too.|`|Fi2nUvYcaa	I think that he thinks that you are playing him. Aren't you kind of doing that, by trying to seem uninterested in him, or ignoring him, so that he will be eating out of your hand? Just ask yourself the question-do you like this person? If so, then why play "unavailable" games? Your afraid of getting hurt aren't you? I could be wrong, but you either have to open yourself up to the possibility being hurt, or keep on doing things the way that you are doing them, and drive people away. Your choice.|`|cJYVXmwHaa	You both sound like too much work. I have a headache after reading that.
AA11190264	he's saying that "this is how you want to play the game (relationship) now". if you'd told him truthfully, then let him get paranoid if he doesn't trust you. i never like texting in a relationship, a phone call is much more personal. but it's proper to tell him your plan before you turn off the phone. then he won't act so crazy|`|dCmSA6r2aa	he means you are playing games with him
e957642effb2257ef7af4124860565faaa	I think she wants ebay, as in she WANTS ebay. It think its time you get a divorce.|`|aYY7hvHQaa	"IT" seems to me to be sex. How old are you and your girlfriend? If I knew your ages, I might be of better help.|`|d5bd64efb7682148a6c0f51b553f4a48aa	Lol.

I bet if you had her alone and asked her if she wanted it, she'd say no.|`|Uafvhuw3aa	She wants Sex!|`|at2Ar4x6aa	asks her what the f u c k she is talking about...if she wants to play long ball, give her the bone.|`|hvD7efh5aa	what she means is she wants u to have sex with her but if ur not ready say no!|`|cW6kkcV1aa	Hey!

c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Dr.  Phil  says  people  treat  you  the  way  you  allow  them  to  treat  you.........<br>  My  opinion  is  that  you  are  spending  too  much  time  with  him  [you  said  the  whole  day]  and  that  is  for  married  people.  Also,  he  is  already  taking  you  for  granted;  not  calling  or  letting  you  know  what's  goin'  on.  Keeping  you  in  the  dark.  It's  kinda  late  in  the  game  to  start  making  changes   tho.  Just  speaking  for  myself,  I  would  lose  him  and  start  all  over  with  someone  else.  AND  this  time  don't  be  so  "available."  Value  yourself  and  don't  let  people  take  advantage  of  you.  Remember,  some  people  will  treat  you  any  old  way  if  you  allow  it.  Like  I  said;  learn  to  value  yourself.|`|YyYBv5bzaa	If you really like him, you should stick it out for a little bit longer and work it out. But if your tired of it then you should leave. Talk to him and tell him that if you guys are going to be together he has to stop having those moments where he acts strange and stuff. Or at least explain why he does it or something.|`|c9a66880006bf09aa7e0d1bc1e34ae55aa	I went thru same problems with my bf who is now my fiance.. till today i have no idea why he acted that way.. he would be extra attentive when we were together but wud show indifference on many occasions.. but i decided it was best to give him a chance and now we are engaged.. but honestly this behavior sucks while it lasts...<br>  a good thing that i did was to completely refuse to call him.. if he called, we talked.. if not, i never tried... i will still once in a while send him a mushy text or appear at his workplace out of the blue.. but usually i was indifferent too or pretended to be.. that made it stronger and it led to some great things...|`|v8SA8ZHDaa	well most guys do that..and if he gets mad when you do the same thing alk to him about it..but he obviously cares if he gets mad when you do the same thing to him=)

AA11160104	height difference doesn't matter to me... I'm 5'3" and have been attracted to guys the same height as me up to a little over a foot taller than me.  their height had absolutely nothing to do with me being attracted to them or not, nor did I even consider wanting to be dwarfed by a taller guy, that's just weird... as long as he possesses the qualities I look for then his height doesn't matter and his looks are entirely secondary.|`|bdf49c7a73dc3f7da66b0474658b4085aa	I prefer shorter ladies. For me at 6'6" it usually works out to about a foot difference.|`|2dd7630de0f864ff7006e3e24140c040aa	all are acceptable.|`|AA10917970	i am 5'4" and my bf is almost 6' tall. that is about 8 inches and it is perfect. it is just short anough where it is not akward and i dont have to strain (or him lean) to get a kiss, lovemaking is also not that akward. however i am just short enough and him tall enough where i need help with some things like high shelves which he likes. and he feels like a man because im shorter, while he is taller and heavier and stronger. i dont like guys my height and a woman his height would be a bit weird.|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	I prefer tall men as I am only 5 foot 2, and would not go out with short men! I am lucky my hubby is nice and tall.
AA11396927	There's an classic saying on this: "Never argue with an idiot, they'll beat you hands down with experience!"|`|RIt0YvgHaa	It's fun, isn't it? The best part is when they are too stupid to realise when they've been beaten and they come back for another round!

30e19e9cbbb36cd056c6d1804fa919e7aa	Two minutes of a large d!ck sounds great!<br>  An average man that can take me over the bridge sounds great!<br>  So can I have both?|`|AA11276475	well, if they were smart, they would take the "large man" and train him well. No one need last only 2 minutes, that can be fixed easily. But an average man will always be an average man...no cure for that one.|`|0838ddb7cfe7e6eb28ac124b99896872aa	Well being that it's quite difficult for a woman to orgasm within a 2 minute time period, I'd have to go with the average man who can handle his business. I'd rather orgasm than not orgasm.<br>  <br>  Had you given the large man more than 2 minutes...say even maybe 5 or 10, I would have chosen the large man. Large feels GREAT, OK?|`|1a224f3c589d38a106124e6002598931aa	Average is ALWAYS better!<br>  Large hurts.|`|teoPXJiEaa	An Average man for sure... when he knows how to use it, he has it all.|`|xbRKIJyLaa	lol..I don't believe the research paper part but I would rather have an average sized guy that can put it down!

I've never met an average man who can handle his business.  It always feels like something's lacking.  Pure and simple, I like men that are very well-endowed.  I don't care for men who are just average, and I have enough experience to judge.  We would just have several two minute sessions and I think he could be trained to last longer!
30e19e9cbbb36cd056c6d1804fa919e7aa	I would date a brainiac, especially if he's handsome!|`|XsNUpDmHaa	I wouldn't want to date someone with a big head.  but someone smart YEAH!|`|fwpw3kvlaa	I too would also date a brainiac if his d*ck was big!  But I don't like pink heads, I prefer chocolate ones!

uVU5DDjmaa	Well i think changing your last name is a good idea...<br>  Your father doesn't sound like he deserves to have a sun taking his last name!!<br>  But about the middle name i don't know...<br>  It depends on how your family feel about you changing it... If it's a family name it might be important to them that you keep it and in that case maybe you should...<br>  It really up to you... But you may upset people by changing the middle name if it is important!!<br>  Good luck  x|`|ONAgORxhaa	change your name if you want to but do it officially by deed poll-it will mean all your legal papers like your passport etc will be in your new name.it will cost you 70 pounds or so-go and see a solicitor.technically all the time you have the funds you can change your name as often as you want so if you changed it now but in 10 years really regretted it you could change it back.as for your middle name-having a middle name is good,if you dont like the one youve been given pick a name you think fits your personality.my middle name is charteris.ive always loathed it but its a family name.recently i googled it and found out about its origin and meaning.it totally changed how i feel about it.im proud to have it now.
qIpevvVlaa	13 wow ur a slut and tell her if you trust her but if not tell a teacher or a sex counciler...|`|zx8cVDqIaa	If you were my daughter I would show you another pleasure, you shouldn't of been having sex in the first place, YOUR 13 years old.|`|ooRxjLXcaa	tell her, cause what if you are pregnant? You need to tell her so she can help you cause there are a lot of diseases you can get and you will probably have to see a doctor so you don't get them. <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  p.s. she will be mad at first but she will be even more mad if she finds out from someone else and not you.|`|aGaqc3lnaa	just tell her. there is no easy way though. good luck. help with my question?! 1st one on my page.|`|8v3kQdtmaa	oh wow :S<br>  i dont even know<br>  i hope u used a condom though|`|PwkYJoVgaa	umm yeah to young. ur own your own. sorry but yeah. you shouldnt have had done that. this is your brain and you should think of wht you could do. because we dont know you mom so...sorry|`|jkDawQVNaa	man, that's something you can never get back Sweetie! you should have waited in my eyes your still a child not even fully blossomed! but talk to your mom or your conscience will eat at u!|`|SCD6Pdtnaa	I really, really hope you used a condom. Please.<br>  <br>  I agree that you should tell your mom. If you think you are going to be having sex regularly, your mom can take you to the doctor to get you on the birth control pill. She'll also be there to help if you have any other questions.<br>  <br>  I would recommend telling your mom when it is just the two of you, and preferably at home because you'll likely have a pretty emotional talk, and you wouldn't want to do that in the grocery store or anything. You may think she'll be mad, and she might be a bit, but mostly she'll just want to help and make sure you're okay. She might get a bit emotional, too - "My baby is growing up" kind of thing. Tell her that you want to be open and honest with her, even when it's difficult, and you have some questions and things to tell her. Don't get mad or defensive yourself; just try to think of the reasons why you want to tell her, and the things she can help you with. Listen to what she has to say, too - after all, she's obviously had sex at least once before. ;)|`|ynFtyVKYaa	Ok number one: if you do chose to tell your mom do it in a calm settle way and she will have a talk with you probably just make sure she knows at least you are being honest and not doing stuff behind her back without her knowing..Number two: if you chose not to tell your mom make sure word doesnt get out and everybody knows because if it does your mom will eventually find out...P.S. in generally dont like anyone find out becuase in school they might start calling you a hoe etc. and you"ll get a different kind of attention thats not good|`|xyW8PsfUaa	ok, first of all, ur mom was looking out for u by telling u not to go out with that guy cuz he isnt the type of guy a respectable girl dates. tell ur mom. she will be mad at u at first,but thats just cuz she cares about u. How old is this boy? cuz if he is 16 or up then he commited a crime by having sex with u even if you consented. Tell ur mom and she will do whatever needs to b done. she will get mad cuz she cares|`|HL0KTJw4aa	well if i were you i wouldn't tell my mum because<br>  1. if he was older then you ( over 16 ? ) then your mum could get him arrested as he has sexual intercourse with you when you are to young and its illegal. <br>  <br>  2. she will be really bad and probably not trust you to go out on your own ever again <br>  <br>  3. its not that bad not to tell her , she isnt likley to find out as the other boy isnt going to risk telling anyone as he would get arrested asuming he is over 16 ?|`|5HYbJmbcaa	you need to sit down to her and talk, she for sure wont like it, but be calm about it. many people have been in this situation. also get a pregnancy test which you can buy at drugstores. you and your mom can check to see if you are pregnant|`|gqHy3821aa	Umm this is one of those things that you put behind you for 15 years and then you go back and speak about it if you really need to get it off your chest.<br>  <br>  Give it till you are an adult.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227142004AAdIEyb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|U0WMFNC3aa	If you tell her be prepared to have a bad life with your mom for a long time.<br>  i never told my mom or dad i tried marijuana. Lots of kids never tell their parents all these things.|`|nioINr3Faa	You should just sit her down and just say it, ASAP; because the longer you wait the harder it will be to tell her.  And if she gets mad at you, you're going to have to accept the consequences.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	I find sometimes it is easier to write things down.  It is a little bit cowardly but at the same time it lets you say what you want without so much stress of the other person reacting at the same time.  Maybe you could write your mom a note and hand it to her saying "I'm having a really hard time being able to tell you something so I wrote it down."  In the note you might mention you know and are scared of her reaction but at the same time that you love her and she is your mom and you want to be able to talk to her about stuff like this because she is your mom and you want to be close to her.  You can also express yourself (without being interrupted) why you made the decision, how you feel about your decision, &c, &c.<br>  <br>  If you write a note I think you should be there for when she reads it, not just leave it on the table and leave the house.  It's important once she reads it for you two to talk and hug and yell or whatever it is that's going to happen.<br>  <br>  I hope you used protection so you can put that in the letter!!  Good luck!|`|c4OEuojoaa	Um. dont tell your mom. go talk to someone else.. until your absolutely ready to tell her..|`|bhnPUzypaa	Gosh! 13 years old - you shouldn't be having sex! Why do you want to tell your mum so much?<br>  <br>  The only reason its hard for you to tell your mum, is the fact that you know you shouldn't be having sex. If you were 16 then your mum may still be upset or annoyed but she'd soon realize that your growing up and this is your way of experiencing some life skills and realizing who you are. However you are still your mums little girl, and i know you will be thinking i'm not a child but really you are, your only 13 think about it 3 years ago you were 10 and probably still playing with dolls. So take my advise, don't have sex until you are old enough to take responsibility if something went wrong. As for telling your mum, i'd wait the now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|IFrzXsDXaa	First of all...you need to understand what you did was wrong. We all make mistakes. but please understand that the longer you wait the worse it will be. and if you never tell then you will live with a horrible guilt :( and possibly miss out on the help you need. When you weigh the odds, the better choice IS to tell. Your getting the feeling, so you should so listen to it. Is your mom the understanding type? Sit down with her and have a serious mother to daughter talk and explain how sorry you are. and that you regret it dearly. Yes. Itt WILL be hard. but also it will be a bridge you cross. Something you can put behind you.<br>  <br>   THIS TOO SHALL PASS.<br>  <br>  Also when you gain understanding and forgiveness from your mother you will come to realize many things and grow stronger throught the hard times. I am praying for you and i hope you and that boy dont cross paths again. Because if he truly "loved" you then he would not have put you in a situation where you would fall to temptation or forcce you to do things you never intended to do.|`|PS83gPGoaa	your too young to be having sex with an older boy or anyone for that matter|`|Rhw3mmn4aa	Write her a note explaining it, and tell her not to read it till ur not around. SImple and painless:)|`|fdfbb3fed9f6fe854aebbc3c863b7bb5aa	Just tell her, she might get mad but she'll get over it.<br>  <br>  She would want to know, and she will be glad (eventually) that you told her and loved her and trusted her enough to tell her, and plus if you are going to keep doing it, she can help you to get on birth control so you don't end up getting pregnant and throwing away your life at a young age.|`|YhKrFmVYaa	way too young... waaaaaay too young|`|DEIxwvKPaa	dont tell her!<br>  whats wrong with you?!|`|ECnoUtXYaa	You need to tell your mom. But first, you need to be prepared. Know that you will lose a trust bond with her if you tell her but still go for it. Since you did what you already did, you can't go back. Get ready to face the consequences but tell  her face to face. I agree that it will be hard but say what you have to say and good luck.|`|CdUvu8D8aa	umm can you '***' over and help me with my biology|`|wPT33kEUaa	if you didn't wanna get in trouble hen you shouldn't have done it your not even legal, but whats done is done, just tell her while your doing stuff together like washing up or something, or you can just come outright with it and say look mum im nt a virgin anymore.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	sit her down, and tell her that u are about to tell her something that may dissapoint her but if she's going to judge u then u wont even bother telling her.<br>  <br>  then if she doesnt start screaming or anything, then just blurt it out.<br>  <br>  believe me, ur a smart girl for even having the gutts to talk to her about it ;)|`|9KklDAjDaa	hun, for starters, you are way too young to be having sex, and especially with an older boy. but im not here to lecture you. my advice would be to be open and tell your mum-treat her like your best friend, not an enemy! youll feel much better once its off your chest =)|`|Pi0fVzv3aa	don't tell her yett,,<br>  she won't allow you see any guy if you do<br>  and that would suck<br>  mayeb wait a few yearss untill your 16<br>  thats a good age<br>  and wow thats a young age to loose your virginity.|`|2iigkuUKaa	if your determined to telll her then i think you should write her a letter or email her if you cant tell her face to face...|`|Oqf65Cisaa	ask if you can talk to her, and say your worried about telling her something but you would feel better if you did. then just tell her. good luck x|`|121YqxV2aa	tht depends how old u were tell her u lost it and if she askedwho tell he someone elese then tell her u broke up that is wat i did just dont tell ur dad u know men|`|2ZIsX8z6aa	Yes, your mom NEEDS to know. Otherwise, there will always be a blockage between you and her.. she won't understand why she can't fully trust you about yourself. LET HER KNOW SOMEHOW.<br>  <br>  Okay, so..pick a quiet time where you are both alone together. Start out with "I need to tell you something about *insert HIS name here." Then continue on, before you even get a facial expression or comment from her, and just blurt out the rest of it. It will be out in just a second or 2. Then.. wait for her reaction before trying to defend yourself or explain.<br>  <br>  However, if this whole scenario you just think you can't do it then.... Fill out the whole story on paper. Maybe slip it under her pillow, so that she will find it during the night.. she can read it & have time to compose herself, and think it over before she sees you in the morning.<br>  <br>  Another route would be to email it to her.<br>  <br>  But PLEASE let your mom know! Life as you know it won't be the same, until you come clean. Tell her all about it. Hold back no details.<br>  And do this as SOON as possible.<br>  <br>  Thanks.<br>  I hope this will help you out with your troubles.|`|GZeUrQWTaa	haha wow all i can say is that you made a really stupid decision and ur wayy to young to have sex<br>  but id tell her|`|ZfvFjxpwaa	Your mother will be mad no matter what, but it's honestly not worth betraying her trust. I will tell you the best thing you can do is give your mom the benefit of the truth since you pretty much went behind her back to begin with. She will probably take it hard at first, but she is your mom and will always love you. She will appreciate the honesty. But dont be suprised if your grounded for awhile.|`|d6biGqZWaa	just tell her. straight out|`|FbJozo7Zaa	well first of all, you seem too young to have done the deed in the first place. but if you really feel like you really want to tell your mother, id say sit her down and just tell her. yes theres a chance that she will yell and get angry, but eventually she WILL get over it. you are her daughter after all. just tell her when you feel ready.  Good Luck.|`|xf9zCkHDaa	You remind me of me haha. Im 14 now and my mum knows Im not a v. I wrote her a letter but only cos I thought I could be pregnant otherwise I wouldnt have told her.

1xr6T6h0aa	You should feel bad for your uncle, but you did not meet her - so don't beat yourself up too much.|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	she was very special to your uncle and that makes you feel bad for him that she passed. but yet you barly knew her but if you had spent more time with her and got to get to know her you would have felt worse then you are feeling right now. basically it is your choice on how you feel about this. that doesn't mean you have to start crying and have a break down. but you should feel bad but she is in a better place. give my regards to your uncle and your family. i hope my advice helped.<br>  <br>  p.s. i'm terribly sorry about your loss.|`|P4kXX0vBaa	you shouldnt feel horrible that she is gone because you did not know her, you dont have to be sad for her, but you should be caring toward your uncle, spend some time with him, make sure he is ok|`|ATt2n32Saa	The fact that you didn't know the woman and that you don't have any feelings towards her is just fine.  Focus your empathy on your uncle and if you're close to him let him know you are sorry about his loss.  There is nothing you can do to truly comfort a person in this situation.  Your understanding, acknowledgment and kindness is what means most to them.

He said he had something to tell me and would count to 5 to do so, then he kissed me quickly.  I reciprocated by telling him with a smile on my face that was no kiss and proceeded to hold his head and kissed him slowly.  He was my first love, and we are still friends till this day.  The kiss was 15 years ago.|`|1VtAhnVvaa	My first kiss wasn't anything particularly note-worthy hah. It was on my bed with my boyfriend of 2 months. But at least it wasn't a bad experience.

Then surround yourself in those things and the people that are connected to them.  For example if you are good at school, maybe you should tutor to meet people.  This way you have more knowledge off the bat and they can look up to you.  This is one way to build your confidence.|`|CJ5BdtRnaa	I have had the same problem for years. I am 23 and my childhood has alot to do with it. Best advice I can give is to see someone about it. I never have personally but I know exactly where you are coming from, and it has caused problems in relationships that I try to have. The way I am I have not trust in someone in the beginning and they have to build it over time. Kinda backwards from how normal people view things I guess.|`|TmWVS2NIaa	Take chances is all I can say. Talk to people. If your a nice person to them there is no reason that someone wont like you. Build up friendships and you'll see parts of yourself come out.
5v6IGwDKaa	well, i think he is trying to flirt with you, and that is his way of doing that cause he doesn't wont you to know that so he does that to you. so i wouldn't hit him back enless you really do like him. cause if you do he may start to think that you do like him when you may not. just tell him to stop hitting you and if he doesn't listen just ignore him.<br>  best of luck!!|`|G9l6tFJIaa	Its called puppy love younger kids express there feeling by being mean and passing love leaks, but next time he hit you ask him how would he feel if his mom was hit by a guy|`|gj85BSQ7aa	ignore the guy and have one of your male friends kick the crap out of the guy there is no excuse for a guy to hit a woman under any circumstance|`|8437f572141e1646455e3a3713bcc700aa	hit him back..

313afe838a0489639fc15b0394b300ebaa	Go anywhere that's fun and rewarding! Try grabbing a scoop of your favorite ice cream or going to see that new movie that you've been seeing previews for all week. Try playing a sport outside with your friends; something low impact like ping pong or something a bit more intense like shooting hoops or playing 1vs1 in soccer. If you live near a pool or a beach, go swimming! The weather is getting close to perfect! You could also try taking a relaxing walk down a nature trail, nearby park, or downtown/mall area. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, make it into a reward for working so hard on your tests.|`|Grr2Ocaxaa	go get some food, watch movies, talk, do anything u want|`|iiZTPbH0aa	go shoppping
5c14af27714ef0d513dd1b6c3da02cecaa	shes just shy i think. maybe she didnt want you to know that she liked you. shes probably trying to "play it cool" and act like she doesnt. 1. you could back off, because this could go on for a while   or 2. you could confront her. lay the cards out on the table if ya know what i mean|`|H8i73fnEaa	Rather than play eyes with each other, you should just ask her seriously and go from there ^-^
Q8LhpzuHaa	I have had dreams about my boss as well , and don't care for him much  either , I believe the dream is because you are are about <br>  to face something in your life that may require u to make a decsion .<br>  Its really not an obsession ,  with your boss , he is in the dream <br>  because his position in your life is authority , and you maybe looking to him for an answer , <br>  All dreams have meanings , some we can idenify with and realize <br>  why we had that dream , others are seem out of character ..<br>  Nevertheless , focus on the main , the theme . of what was most <br>  prominent in the dream , this may help u better understand it .|`|AA12135516	Dreams do have meanings if you know how to work them out (i don't) but don't stress over the fact that it's your boss you are dreaming about because he may just be a symbol of what's really going on in your subconscious. It probably has got something indirectly to do with obsessing & with a bit of luck someone who knows how to interpret dreams might read your question & be able to help you out. Good Luck!|`|qVzS6cV0aa	dreams often depict your desires and wants

vKOnv7WZaa	I think its pretty fair. just save your money. don't spend it on things you don't really need or want. Or you can get a job near by. and you could get like triple the money in twice the time. i hope i helped :)|`|FKqELZyTaa	It depends. If they buy you a lot of stuff now then no it's not a good deal. But, if they just by you stuff for like you b-day, holidays, and that's about it then it's a great deal.|`|yAld0FEjaa	I think it's a good idea. When I was 14 I did the same thing. It taught me to be really smart with my money. It gave me freedom on what I wanted to buy. And (pssst...secret) if you're really good with your cash and you show a little maturity, the folks will still spring for things once in a while. Especially if you tell them you've been saving up and you need just that little extra help. Go for it. Show your family and friends that you're mature for your age.|`|e7KoyoWsaa	it's a great idea.  my parents did the same for me.

Sounds like she's definitely into you.. but very shy, nervous, afraid that she'll say something that you'll think is "stupid"... <br>  <br>  She is waiting for you to ask her, because she doesn't know if you like her or not.

cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	You are way too young to limit yourself to one person.  You haven't even started to get through life yet since you are still in school.<br>  <br>  Only 6 months?!  I could do 6 months standing on my head!  You need to develop other interests because at your young age it's not just love, there are intense hormones going on.  You haven't met other people yet and have a long way to go.  I know it's hard right now, but a lot of things will change for you once you get out of school so don't limit yourself.  Find other activities that you like to do.  Sometime you will meet that person that is a match for you.  It may be her; it may not.  But don't spend your time mooning away over someone when neither of you has matured yet.|`|01faf6fff9cc2041cbe8f6ce445b2fb0aa	i am sorry to say but it does not matter how you think she feels...like when you said she is happier when she is with me then her bf....that does not matter cause look at it this way she feels for him what you feel for her and you can't help it and neither can she....all humans go through this specially at that age...it sucks big time and it hurts trusyt we have all been there...but you'll get through it...tey to accept that you just can't make her feel that way bout you and try to be her friend...if you can't then you might have to just seperate yourself some till you are able to be around her without feeling misreable...think bout it this way...think of if a good friend of yours felt this way bout you but you just do not feel that way bout her there is just nothing no one can do to make someone like you like that....i hope you get through it...i know it sucks....i wish you the best.....and as far as that guy who wants you to focus all your energy on being an ***...honey that is just a waste of your time and specialy your energy....that is the immature way of dealing with things wish her the best if you stay in her life or not ...she is your friend...it's bad enuff as you say that she has a bf thta's an *** to her...what he wants you to be AN *** TO HER CAUSE SHE JUST CAN'T HELP HERSELF BUT NOT FEEL THAT WAY BOUT YOU!!!!

I had been in love with my best friend. We had been best friends since we were kids and grew up together, we were practically inseparable. Anyways, I was always there to hear him talk about this new girl he liked, or something of that sort! Anyways, when he went away to college, we had slightly grown apart! He had not liked me that way! When he came back to visit me, it was then that he told me that he was in love with me, and could not stop thinking about me! But by that time I had tried to move on with somone else, and he tried to win me over. What I am trying to say is, you are always there, if her BF is not there then, you fil in, you are a great friend to her, but what she would need to see is  when you are not there! If she jsut misses her friend, then, you were destined to be friends! The basis of any relationship IS OF COURSE friendship! And the best bf/gf relationships have great friendships behind it! I hoped that this made some degree of sense in all that I mumbled there!|`|njyFVvlTaa	Tell her how you feel.  Just be ready for rejection.

You then get someone who knows her well to tell you all of her bad points. If you still like her then, you have just got to ask her out and let her say no and ask her why. You won't like her after shes told you why she won't go out with you.|`|AdGJb7p3aa	Well just ask her if she likes u. I have the same problem. I want to stop liking him but also i dont. maybe thats why i still do.|`|FZfwaRWxaa	this girl sounds like she's a tease, and also she flirts with other guys, so she probably isn't  someone you would want to be dating, so just don't play along and don't flirt with her.|`|f26620d9c3c52a69c24444200e8c4b7aaa	hi!!! Well, I don't know if u have watched "desperate housewives", if yes I'm sure that in one episode u foud out the answer to ur question. U can start liking someone else!!!That's the way it goes....U can substitute her with another girl,can't u?|`|l0uvFdmAaa	yo yo yo yo......ite ite ite....i kno............it sounds crazy but first if u kno her best friend ask her if she likes u and if she does and u still dont want to go out with her,its sounds bad but u gotta leave her alone and not forget about her but move on and get a girlfriend and if u want to go out with her then do it and if it dont work out and yall break up,dont hate each other but be friends and ur whole attitude about her will change,not for the bad or n e thing but it will change|`|neQvYvHlaa	Try sitting down with her and talk  about this. Don't say anything about her, pretend it's happening with another girl and tell her whats annoying you. Give her hints like ex of what happens w/ you and her. With this trick she should pick up on it and kinda get the idea that shes doing the same thing and she should stop. hope this works!|`|xjdLWLs7aa	Have sex with her best friend.|`|zLIvCQL8aa	Start talking to other girls.|`|ec7d48fd8d25051bd5d895aa91fe68d6aa	just ignore her, she just likes guys to pay attention to her.  if you look un-interested she will just stop|`|UFx0SFqpaa	here's the thing. If she's flirting with every guy in sight and not flirting with you? She might be putting on a show for you becauses she likes you. The best way to find out is to ease yourself into it. Tell her stories about you and girls or anything that points to your sexuality, you know like "well this girl i dated..." or whatever you can come up with. The point is to get her to start seeing you as a sexual person if she isn't already and then flirt with her....yes you flirt with her. Why not? she flirts with everyone else. And see how she takes it. Depending on her response you can progress or back off after that.
LSOZYH42aa	Sometime you just have to say it. Ive been fighting with my sister a lot lately and i think because we are usually pretty close (we're twins) that its tricky to work out differences. i just said it straight out today. oh well. it doesnt really make a difference. they already know how you feel if you have been bringing up things that upset you. if you havent then thats the first step. talk about what they are doing. and in my case if they just blow you off then name calling is where i kind of left off. it happens, we change the subject and talk again in about 10 minutes like nothing happened anyways.|`|432571c06dd1539633d8ab6b7bfadddcaa	well, just beat around the bush, and maybe she'll understand what you mean..and dont be direct and harsh on her..try to make her understand...<br>  Good Luck|`|AA10213326	well,sometimes you just gotta tell her.she might hate you right then,but she'll forgive you because she loves you..<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck telling her <br>  <br>  remember she'll forgive you over time!
D304VSfIaa	Well, It depends on you.<br>  Just try getting over him for one day... then think,, the next day... ask this question to yourself " Am i over him ... ? " Then if you really feel that you are over him then that's how you get over him lol. But if you still can't get over him.. keep going after him and see what happens. If you really like him or love him you would do that... its the same case as me believe me. Right now im still inlove with him... and he use to go out with me. But i couldn't get over him still and i tried :]. But i couldn't. So i kept chasing after him then now hes starting to like me again : D.<br>  Try it!|`|Pi0fVzv3aa	give yourself chances with other guys,<br>  let him know you've totally moved on<br>  so he can regret not giving you a chance<br>  see other guys, they'll make you feel good<br>  and forget about him, because they will treat you with respect<br>  liek he never had. it does take time,, but if you keep waiting for him<br>  you life will be miserable and boringg<br>  so go out with different guys and explore whats out there<br>  czu you could be missing out on alott. :)|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, put it this way, if you get over him completely, you will have other new opportunities that can benefit you, and make you feel good inside while when you are in that state you seem nothing ever going to take a change, so get out of your comfort zone and step ahead cause other things are brighter while ahead in your life, then sticking to a period that waste your lifetime.|`|64Vq26Yiaa	try to involve yourself in other things so you wont think about him as much.|`|cec710393d00151b1d2083c09840602baa	Keep yourself busy rather than listening to sad love songs.<br>  Play sports, go out and dont waste your time thinking about him.|`|gekVXz9eaa	im going thru the same thing.....im still in love wit him tho..... dont avoid him u just can't live wit out him!!! <3 i kno the feeling.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	its hard, i know! and that really stinks. but, maybe you should just either keep up w/ him. like, who wants to forget someone they REALLY like. b/c i was in this situation, but, it worked out! i dont like him ne more... i mean, i like him but its not like drop down b/c hes so georgeous nemore. or get really tingly when he touched my hair or something, u know? i try to shrug it off b/c i dont want to get where i was! neways, i think you should lose all contact (thats wat helped me, ignore him, kind of. just like talk to him but not as much. or just ignore him completly) hope i helped and if i didnt then i hope someone else does! bye :)|`|5GntOFTnaa	You aren't going to get over him for a while.  Time and just staying away from him are probably the only things that will help.  My sister once told me after I got dumped by the first guy I was ever "madly" in love with, "This will not be the last time your heart will be broken."  While this was true, I did eventually meet my match.
S4K4ZZ87aa	yes and no<br>  i guess it helped me grow up and mature.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	In the blink of an eye....YES!
AA10973840	i just went through a similar situation.  honesty is the best policy.  and if he knows you won't leave him based on his appearance, what motivation does he really have to look good?  my personal opinion (and i know i'll get some hate mail for this) is that you should let him know that the competition is still out there.  he may have your heart, but if the physical attraction fades, doesn't that just make you friends?  be open, honest, and blunt with him.  he'll appreciate it, and if he gets defiant, is that really the person you want to be with anyway?  your partner should take into consideration your wants and needs at all times, no matter how "superficial" others may think they are.|`|ivr0iHVpaa	you should suggest that you two  go to the gym but don't make it look like it's because of him instead say something like this to him one day "ohh i wanna work on my abs on the gym will you join the gym with me, i just don't wanna go alone" that way he feels its because you want him to be there for his company an support not because of his weight..but trust me once he gets there he's gonna wanna start working out.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	not an easy task for either of you. maybe if he lets you team up with him like cooking together, exercising together ... do sports like tennis or raquetball. even fat people can to some degree play that or bicycle riding together and think up good menu choices for a diet that are filling so he stays out of the frig and have lots of heathy snacks like carrot sticks and celery around for when he does binge
W3HQwrgBaa	I'd kiss her on the lips and taake it from there.|`|6tDgRhh2aa	i would kiss her tander on cheeck on her lips side and wait her reaction ;)|`|TJFjmmDoaa	probably a hug, or nothing|`|zstTIaQiaa	good question!|`|Xt41CxMBaa	I would return the kiss on the cheek and ask  her if she would like to go out again because she obviously had a good date.
pxygDg7Aaa	Bella hit it right on the head.  Your previous question is about picking your battles.  If the porn is not an issues to some, c'est la vie.  If it bothers you than let your spouse know.  There are no simple rules to marriage.  It's complicated.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	No I think the divorce rate is because people have a romanticized view of what marriage should be and when it doesn't measure up they go for the immediate gratification of divorce.  It's a personaly responsibility issue, not a porn issue.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Looking at porn is not common in my marriage.  <br>  <br>  I think that porn as an enhancement to your sex life is a good thing, and porn as a substitute for your sex life is a bad thing.<br>  <br>  To suggest that allowing your spouse the freedom to make thier own choices is the reason for the divorce rate being over 50% is irrational and illogical.   When you care about someone and respect them, you don't engage in behaviour that hurts them.  It's that simple.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I think divorce is high because people have a selfish world view and also too many people make dating/marriage choices with their genitals instead of their brain.<br>  <br>  I read a ton of questions here where the spouse has asked for something and the asker thinks that the spouse's request is completely unreasonable.  How about each giving in a little and treating each other with respect? Marriage is not my way or the high way. It is let's find a solution that works for both of us.<br>  <br>  There are so many people who are in seriously dysfunctional relationships and they stay because I looooooovvveeee him.  Then 6 months after marriage that same quality is intolerable. Well, duh.  If people weren't thinking with their crotch and getting into a sexual relationship with that person on the first or second date, they would have recognized the person as a whack job and dumped them a long time ago instead of getting married.<br>  <br>  Too many people fail to look at the dating process as one of identifying and accepting or rejecting the other person's qualities and making decisions accordingly.  Even if the person isn't a whack job, if they have certain qualities that are incompatible with you, then that person is not a good fit for a marriage partner.  If the husband is looking at porn, he most likely was looking at it while he was a bf or a fiance.  If I did not want a husband who looked at porn, I would have broken up with a bf who looked at porn.<br>  <br>  Like bella said, people have a romanticized ideal of marriage. Well guess what? The wife's vision of marriage is going to be different than her husband's vision of marriage.  When the two collide, some people get mad and move out.  Instead they should work with their spouse to tweak the marriage and adjust their own expectations to something incredible.<br>  <br>  Edit:  thanks Shannon!|`|B359bLqsaa	talk of divorce is common in my marriage... isnt that a sad thing....|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Trica T has said it SO well.  End of story.  Thanks Trica.|`|YzObEmUqaa	What do you say?|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Divorce is so common because people give up far too easily, they'd rather give up than work on their marriage. Which is unfortunate.|`|f7Okg0iWaa	women do not submit if so < failed marriage|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	When ppl love each other they NEVER divorce!
rQWwL1Efaa	plain and simple. Once a crack head always a crack head. That's an addiction majority of people just cant kick on there own. If he doesnt want any help then you need to walk before he takes you down with him. Sitting back hoping and praying that he stops is not going to work. If he dont at least admit that he has a problem then you need to walk ASAP! Love is not an option to crackheads....dont ever forget that.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Good grief. <br>  <br>  Drug addiction cannot be overcome by some Jesus freak rebuking the spirit of depression, anger and addiction. These are not spirits.  They are physical or medical conditions.  GOD has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  Will he use again?  Possibly.  Will you stand by him while he works to overcome his addiction?|`|AXbdNdPzaa	He should probably go Narcotics Anonymous.  It is hard to get off a drug as bad as coke.  He will probably need some help.  You can go with him too and be a support for him.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Depression, anger and addiction are not spirits, they are an illness, an emotion and a compulsion. I don't think you should expect a speedy recovery based on what someone else said to him at bible study. If he has an addiction, is depressed and has anger issues, he probably needs therapy and/or rehab. You should expect him to use again and you should expect that he needs real help.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	If you expect Some person to take away his addiction using God. Think again. Pray, sure. But only he can help himself. He needs serious help if he wants to change.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Someone else rebuking the addiction does NO good unless he rebukes it himself.  Change starts from within.  If he wants to get high, he will.  He will only change when he wants to.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	good for him . No drugs ,please. They are bad for you.
MPagmrD4aa	Its not your fault for not responding right away, but as a gay man, he has probably been insulted and judged numerous times, so its normal for him to jump to conclusions. i;m sure  he's a nice guy, and I would still meet him for coffee. <br>  <br>  also, he's no more sensitive than anyone else really. if he were a fat woman instead and came right out and said "I'm 200 pounds overweight" and you didnt respond right away, she would percieve it as insulting....|`|R3DxlK0xaa	Ok I don't know if this is going to help or make it worse but here goes.<br>  My daughter is Gay. I find that she is sensitive to this subject. Not anything much else  bothers but you have to put yourself in their shoes.  They catch negative things all the time. I think that the time lapse left him in the clutches of his own imagination and it  ran wild and he flipped and wrote you that horrible email. But I also leave you with this last thought I know you are bored and just want someone to hang with please be careful and not invite anyone dangerous into you home and if you do invite someone make sure you have someone you know with you the first few visits  just to be safe.<br>  <br>            Love and blessing|`|hV5eWXpsaa	So what if you didn't answer him straight away? He shouldn't be so insecure.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	Being gay in this instance is irrelevant because he told you up front.  I think that you should be influenced by his quick judgment just because sometimes predators use guilt to get their prey in these situations.  Remember this is a blind date regardless of any issues about friendship.  If you decide to meet, park your car in a very public spot and go to a place like a coffee shop or sandwich shop.  Also  he might want to sales pitch you for future back massages or use you for practice if you ask him in an email then you won't be surprised and get sensitive either. Maybe that is his intention.  Maybe he wanted to meet you first so he could just show you he is a good guy.  I would also keep in mind that being that sensitive could mean that he either had his feelings hurt in the past or is going to be a pain in the *** and try to manipulate you.  You are going to have to get a better feel of this guy with the emails or some phone calls to see if you get a pattern with him.  Another idea is to possibly meet someone through people that you already know.  Let them know you need a companion and maybe a little help with chores because of your back.
5MbGYHzXaa	well it honestly depends on wat he is saying about you. If its nothing bad, than chances are he does like you. i definitly think u should try to talk to him. Even if its just a  friendly hello.|`|rxjVVSxNaa	haha dont worry about it if he talks about its probably good just let him know you like him
H8i73fnEaa	If you know she already likes someone and has no interest in you why bother?  Just move on, and realize you didn't have a choice to begin with.|`|tt1Jayfiaa	I would probably be shy or it will feel funny until we talk about or you  could just find some one else to like hey theres other gurls out there.  if i didn't like you back i would pretend like i didn't  know you liked me|`|2HkdLC2yaa	if the girl likes you, shes going to be totally flirtatious, like shes going to giggle a lot, smile, and touch you. <br>  <br>  if she dosent like you, you'll know it. she might feel uncomfortable talking to you for awhile if shes more shy, but give her time if thats the case, if not, then when you guys are hanging out, maybe there will be awkward silences that weren't there before, or she'll cut conversations short. <br>  <br>  i hope that kinda helped.<br>  good luck!!!!!<br>  <br>  and hearts,<br>  Becca|`|910c8277d2665b62a452b2d075dda197aa	allways smile and make eye contact with you|`|FDkdPL55aa	your avatar is cute i really don't care about the looks i really just care about the inside like are you a kind and adventurous person|`|rEfK9zkaaa	I would let you know if I liked you or not|`|tS7rR7mEaa	i didn't come here to fantasize myself as a girl so i can "like you back".
yEMRPW1Aaa	it is true when you turn 18 you can do what ever you want from then on.so she can move in with you when she turns 18.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	yeah, when foster children turn 18, they're completely cut from the program, that's why adopting is so important. Is she already adopted by these people, or are they just a family that take in foster children to care for? If they haven't adopted her, call her foster family and find out a way your mum can adopted her. Maybe when she turns 18 you can arrange a way for her to live with you, since she can legally be on her own and make her own decisions.|`|lWolp5Csaa	Maybe you should wait until she`s 18. just so she can get time to relax and get to know her new foster parents. if she wants to stay with her foster parents when she turns 18 then let her maybe when you guyz grow up and get your own place you can live with her for a while??|`|KYFLS2Qyaa	There's nothing you can do about her moving away. Keep in touch with her on the computer and on the phone is all you can do.|`|mkAR9jXZaa	have her get emancipated|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	As soon as you turn 18 the state see's you legally as an adult. That means you are fully responsible for yourself. And so yes, if you are 18 you no longer are part of the foster care system. But be careful. Don't push decision's on your mom without talking to her about what she can (and is willing) to do. Also don't make promises to you friend that you may not be able to keep. When she turns 18 she will have no parents no family and a whole lot of responsibilities that you may not understand. It's wonderful to want to help her but don't think it will be easy and that you or your mom can automatically fix anything that she may face.|`|XWUPdFjoaa	adopt her or go to court and tell them that you two want to live with each other and give the juge i really really good reasoon why|`|TycCeqtaaa	yeah once she turns 18 she'll be off on her own and she will be able to go live with you. just keep in touch with her and all that.|`|AUsvrW8faa	She can move with you when she turns 18- contact her and let her know|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	First of all, how does your mother feel about this?  Because if she is ok with it she can petition the courts and possibly get temporary custody of her.  (Also, just a little tip, don't name full names and places, weirdos pray on that kind of stuff.  Use different names and places. )  Or you could wait until she is 18 at this time she will be an adult and be able to leave where she is at.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	You would have to get your parents to apply to adopt her.  Since she's so close to 18, you might as well just wait, because that kind of thing takes months to process.  It means filling out about 40 pages of application materials, having a background check and a home inspection, among other things.|`|0PkFuZMwaa	that's nice of you but let her stay where she's at. until she's 18.don't put that burden on your family with hr behavior.|`|UtYllvFcaa	she can take it to court to come live with you if she wants

Tell Him that you have great compassion for these people (You clearly are a very compassionate person.) and that you need His guidance on the matter.  You must be careful not to take on more than you yourself can bear.  I was in a similar situation once and I ended up having to bow out in order to keep my own head above water.  I did not feel bad about it because I had asked for God's guidance on the matter and I am confident that He gave me the strength to stick with it for as long as I did, but He also gave me the wisdom to know when I myself was in danger of sinking.<br>  <br>  You sound like a very kind and caring person.  I will remember you in my prayers.  Good luck and stick close to God during this trying time.<br>  <br>  Just be mindful that God sees it all and is capable of sending in support in ways you may never be aware of.  Do not be under the delusion that you are His only resource for helping these people.  He is mindful of your needs as well.

RKsn5dD4aa	I considered doing that but found out it was only $30 more to have the cake i wanted.  Your local bakers should be able to point you in the right direction.|`|etUc0PYkaa	The link below is for a website that sells the cake dummies. You or your cake shop can decorate it any way you like and you cut a slice at the bottom that will have real cake.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taylorfoam.com/taylorfoam_com/cakedummies/item.nhtml?profile=cakedummies&UID=108" rel="nofollow">http://www.taylorfoam.com/taylorfoam_com...</a>|`|AIrPtuDUaa	I would like to know too. Sorry I couldnt answer your question. Oh and why would you want fake cake? Wouldnt you want real cake so your guest can have some? Sorry if this is a crazy question. As you can tell...I'm not married|`|ODYrypwaaa	Go to your local bridal show.  However, at our bridal show I found that fake cakes cost the same as real (for 150-180 people).|`|MhyuXBoEaa	Your bakery should be able to get those for you. You can usually rent them|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Most bakers that make wedding cakes offer them. If you have a baker in mind, ask them.
GiIFr1rjaa	The most important thing is you could end up in prison and with your name on the sex offenders' register.<br>  <br>  Now surely that's enough to put you off for a year or two until she's at least 16?  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you get to keep up your good relationship with your best mate and his family.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	NO No No No No.  Don't do it my friend.  She's far too young and her brother would probably punch you!!  Seriously, she may fancy you and that's probably flattering but I think it would be risky getting involved with someone so young.(apart from the fact that anything physical is illegal)  Good Luck  x|`|62NmYVHMaa	omg man u r disgusting u know if u went out with her that would make you a paedophile|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Ok, breathe...........calm down! For now, you are going to have to forget about it, she is too young. Of course she likes you, your her older brothers best mate, all young girls love older guy's! But you have to be the adult here, wait until she is at least 18yrs, then see if you still feel the same. Hormones everywhere!! Try and spend time with your mate away from her xxx|`|WkWNCZWdaa	I don't think its wrong, if you love someone age shouldn't matter, plus its not that much of a age difference, i mean like my friends parents are like at a 7-8 year age difference, so 4 years isn't much of a difference. I think if you guys really like eachother it will be ok, and don't worry its not as wrong as you think!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =]
ulzTajOJaa	It sounds like he was a really good friend. He has been decent enough to tell you how he feels, and I'm sure your feelings might make him uncomfortable, and he prob doesnt want to hurt you. His longing looks may be that he is simply longing for days gone by, when your relationship was umcomplicated. Myabe you should get yourself involved in another activity, to keep your mind off of him and your feelings. You might just meet some new people, and then when you see him, you can tell him all about your new experiences, and it wont be so weird bewtween you.|`|J3pTwU0Qaa	aww the exact same thing happened to me but now he has a girl friend but mabe he really does like to just be friends with u and from experience respect his chices b/c its better to be friends with him and still talk then to not speak to him at all i mean i dont now ur whole story but what its seems like i dont think you did anything wrong just talk to him again but in person texting is not the right way to talk about situations like this
pxygDg7Aaa	It's not an excuse but stress murders men's sex drive.  That may not be everything.  You just have to talk to him.|`|jdRKZe18aa	hummm.... sounds like some serious marriage counseling might be in order here and obviously you two need some extremely straight forward communication happening!|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Again, a romanticized View of what marriage is all about.  <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like he's trying to be responsible and not have more children than he can afford.  I applaud him and his high moral standards.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Men don't feel sexual when they are stressed.<br>  <br>  Instead of snuggling up to him with the intention of having sex, get some lotion and give your husband a long back or foot massage.  Focus on his needs and making him feel relaxed.  Notice that I said relaxed and not horny.  Big difference.  <br>  <br>  His sex drive will return.  You just need to help him to relax so he can find it again.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Men, due to the evil influence of Satan, are turned on by physical beauty.<br>  <br>  Smell nice, look nice, feel nice, taste nice.<br>  <br>  Can you do that?|`|AXbdNdPzaa	How about if you shower everyday, and wear a little makeup, and stop wearing sweats.  That is enough to deflate any man.  Your baby is way too young to think about having another one, so find another type of birth control.  If you keep up with the bad hygiene, your hubby will find someone that smells good, looks good, and doesn't want to get pregnant.|`|B359bLqsaa	so, he is having sex with himself and just not with you.  that is very rude of him.  I think that makes him passive aggressive because he is acting like everything is OK but it really isnt and he is punishing you by working alot, cutting you off emotionally, complaining of being too tired for sex, spending too much time on video games, and basically stonewalling you.   It sounds to me like he blames you for having the baby and he makes it your fault if you get pregnant.  I wouldnt take the pill either so I dont blame you.  <br>  <br>  I dont know what to do about it though.  I would be very angry and upset if I was in your position. He does not sound like a nice person at all.<br>  <br>  You on the other hand really should bathe every day.  You make yourself sound kind of dirty.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	sounds like if you husband is working 15 hour days and has an opening of a restaurant, sex is probably not the first thing on his mind. He is worried about your future and making sure this restaurant is successful. You should try and help him out with that so he doesn't have so much of a burden. He smokes because he is stressed. He doesn't have sex because he is stressed. He needs you to help him, not question why you don't have sex.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You sound a little pushy.  You shower every other day?  Wow!  No makeup and you wear sweats all of the time.  Think about it.  Try making yourself a little more attractive to him and just maybe he will take notice.  Other than that 15 hours a day is a lot, I would be tired and worn out too.  Stress can play a big factor in a decrease in ones libido too.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	Yupper... it's time to turn the water on.. and get to scrubbin EVERYDAY eh..<br>  <br>   Time to get rid of the sweat pants..<br>  <br>  15 hours a day is alot of hours to work.... that leaves you plenty of time to get cleaned up... and look some what sexy eh !!! <br>  <br>  About gettin off in the shower... well.. a guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do eh !!|`|AA11383443	Hell I am almost 40 and work all week to but I don't turn down sex, your hubby sounds a bit strange to me. I love to cuddle with the wife we do it almost every night I hold her or she holds me and sometimes we hold each other. been married almost 18 years. I love it to.|`|SHARt1k3aa	10 mos?  I would be asking questions after two weeks?  You must be a young couple if you are just having children.  No... something is wrong with dude.  You need to talk to him about his intimacy problems and fast.  This isn't healthy at all.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	I kinda see his point he wants to open a restaurant and you already have one baby.....|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	There is nothing funny about this situation so I have no idea why you would put lol down after a few sentences.  You state you are very attractive however you do not shower everyday and you wear no make up and wear sweats oh my that is a big turn off to guys.  There are men out there who use to see their wife as a sexy woman however after having a baby he now only see's her as a Mother and that can be a turn off to some men.  He might feel as if he is being ignored in other ways and that the baby comes first before he does.  Get dressed up more take a shower everyday get away from the sweats and do your hair and make up like you use to.  If he still is saying no then you need to have a serious talk with him and tell him how you feel.  If he still doesn't get it then you both should seek counseling.|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	Did you try to sit down and talk to him about it? He might not think it's bothering you that much and expected you to understand (that is if his reason was genuine which i doubt it is...) Anyway I still think being stressed out is not reason enough not wanting it. It's human nature. And if in that case I'd say there's definitely something going on that you have to find out. EITHER HE'S GAY ..OR HE'S CHEATING ON YOU W/ ANOTHER WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE SATISFYING HIM SEXUALLY SO AS NOT DOING IT WITH YOU ANYMORE....|`|YjaVT2JHaa	WHAT!  well you should go on the pill if u wanna get some in the next 10 years so .........|`|SWYV1BsLaa	I am having the opposite problem with my wife.  I also have a 6 month old and she is having difficulties adjusting to the changes which make her not want sex while I want it.  We are closing in on a year without sex.  <br>  <br>  Its hard to understand.  From a guy's perspective, I can't imagine not wanting it for that long.  Have a straight up conversation about it.  Get a sitter and go to a private place and have a serious talk about why he isn't interested.  It is only fair.<br>  <br>  Maybe you and I should get together.  JK :)
XcxL6ZMqaa	well, this is a hard one! lol. but, maybe you should just ask her what she thinks.. if you already have, then:<br>  1. talk to him<br>  2. get her to talk to him, b/c he prolly likes her! <br>  3. threaten.. but then again, your girlfriend.. so that wouldnt be good.<br>  4. try to be friendly to him.. that way he'll think you nice and his friend. (maybe)<br>  i hope i helped and if i didnt then ihope someone else does! bye:)|`|zY7boFYNaa	Tell him about it, be upfront if he continues just ignore him, it's the best thing, cause if you let it get the best of the relationship, you letting him win, make sure it does not turn to any argument nor fighting.|`|n6ThOjYWaa	Just ignore him im very peaceful and children like 3 ft smaller than me start fights so i just ignore un less they take it too far|`|x4EDcAW6aa	Well just ignore him or you may have to beat him up.|`|QISIR2Ayaa	Tell him nicely to go away, or things will get bad.<br>  <br>  Rob|`|nuV7tvVDaa	ask him whats his problem? if he has a problem with you and ur gf being together he has issues. just tel him theres no reason to get violent but youd like him to stay away from you and ur gf|`|gekVXz9eaa	If yall really love each other then you should be able to tell this punk to get lost!!!!!|`|Nz9BU7iXaa	just ignore it ive had guys try to brake me and my boyfriends up but if u ignore them they give up|`|aGaqc3lnaa	tell him to back off. but try and keep the peace, for your sake and your gf's. help with my question?! 1st on my page.

kv8ZFPP1aa	all guys think about i sex regardless of them being religious. it's normal and if you want you can talk to him about it.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Just because he's not supposed to have sex doesn't mean he's not thinking about.  Sex is natural, and so are the hormones that are causing him to think about it. <br>  <br>  You should stop putting him on a pedestal just because he's Mormon.  He's also human, and those urges come before all the rest sometimes. <br>  <br>  Besides, if your boyfriend is on the younger side, the religious thing isn't his choice.  His family is probably pushing him, and he can't help that any more than he can control his hormones.|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	lol thats a little creepy.  but if you two are comfortable then i guess its fine.  maybe he just likes to talk about it and think about it because he knows he wont be able to do it until marriage.  doesnt mean he's going to act on it.  but good luck|`|AA12206581	thats interesting. im glad you are worried about that, for him. all i have to say is just confront him to see how he views himself and his religion.|`|QpRihtQ6aa	lol woahh. tell him to keep it to himelf. when he starts talking about it just tell him to stop or whatever...but say it joking around so he doesnt take it personally.|`|6lirnoXOaa	just because he isnt supposed doesnt mean he isnt going to.<br>  everyone gets horny!|`|PaBdl94Xaa	just confront him.<br>  when you to are alone&in person just say<br>  "i been wondering...you have mentioned your a Mormon and as far as i no they believe in no sex until marriage;but lately you been talking about us having sex and i am really confused"<br>  <br>  look...if you care your relationship,you should be able to feel comfortable talking to him and asking questions.<br>  <br>  okay good luck <br>  daniella|`|r5kG0VGxaa	Well, my boyfriend had had sex before and I haden't and I was the goody two shoes of the relationship. We eventually did have sex though. Just follow your heart. He seems really curious and just wants to do it in my opinion. Just tell him you don't want to get involved in sex right now. If he loves you, he'll respect you and your body.|`|1I4TuZc7aa	get over it all guys think sexual things
6GbyhpTMaa	LOL|`|aGaqc3lnaa	he doesn't really love you!! he just wants you to think so! if he really loved you he wouldn't have slept with that girl, and he wouldn't txt those girls if you asked him not to. help with my question, 1st one on my page!|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	this isnt prolly wat you want to hear, but think about it... based on my definition of love that isnt love. you deserve someone that actually loves you and only cares about you not a blob like that that is using you! look, you want and deserve someone that only wants to txt you and no one else b/c he loves you, a person that will always be there and will stop txting neone b/c he wants to show you that he loves you. love is an action word. not used to say around uselessly like he does! so, i would break it off for good girl. go find that perfect guy! i hope i helped and if i didnt then i hope someone does. bye :)|`|gqHy3821aa	Find out what he's saying i guess.<br>  <br>  Tell him to stop doing it for so long, because it's hurting your feelings.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	the problem here is that u actually think he loves u :s|`|9KklDAjDaa	hun, he cant do the same because hes not bothered! hes a cheat! let him go. itl be hard,i know, especially since youv been togethr for so long, but the fact that he slept with another girl just a few days after u two broke up is so disrespectful. just let him go! u can do better than that!|`|121YqxV2aa	id brake up he had sex and probaly relized he did not like her and went back to u also he might be trin to find a new gf but dose not want to not have a gf men are like tht|`|4KHpOztkaa	When hes in the shower steel his phone off him and read them lol.<br>  No just ask him about it and say you spend more time texting these "girls" than me. If he carries on say that you have had enough of it just say you cant stand watching him text these people when he should be spending time with you.<br>  if i was you he would be staight out the door by the sounds of it xx|`|6lirnoXOaa	oh no. ive been through this.<br>  theres feelings there or else hed make the texting stop.<br>  you dont sleep with just friends. you cant be just friends with most people you sleep with it just doesnt work like that because of an attachment. he needs to stop talking to her hes making you insecure and you have every reason to be.|`|BX6gITKraa	break up with him...or start doing it back and also always put him down and try to make him feel bad about himself and lower his self esteem thats what my friends do and thier boyfriends are wrapped around thier fingers<br>  <br>  ..its like training a bird always hold him lower than u so he knows hes not equal to you and definatley not above you|`|EoH6Fnwkaa	Yeah sorry to break it to you but there's a 90% chance he's cheating there. Been there done that. "friends" and 12 hours that's a very long time for nothing to be going on, I know and you should know there is something going on and I know this is hard to deal with but you kind of got to let go and move on, when you find a guy who's true and real he'll be the one texting you for 12 hours and is always there for you. I say you ditch that guy and once you leave him, he'll realize what he's missing. My suggestion to leaving him is good advice unless you want your heart broken even more and don't worry at all there's lots more guys out there just got to be open and out there. Hope I helped a little! Good Luck =]|`|LETd2hQwaa	The problem is that you let him get away with murder. He's just gonna keep doing it until you put your foot down. Obvioulsy he doesn't respect you if he lies about it--- and he slept with her only days after y'all broke up. Sorry honey, but there is something seriously wrong with this picture. Let him go, you'll just regret it later. He's lying for a reason. He's probably sleeping with lots of girls.|`|ZfvFjxpwaa	First I will tell you men can have friends...but what he is doing is a type of cheating. He is putting all his energy into other girls. and not to you. and HE CANNOT call that just friends when he goes and sleeps with her. Im sorry, but you cant trust him, and your better off without that dog. He loves you? Im sorry he seems to care more about his own agenda than the people around him, especially you. I would do yourself a favour and be with someone who doesnt act like a lying ***.
ze7xiJwTaa	Not to mention following the patterns of our parents. It's super common. The patterns will continue until YOU break out of it. It sounds like you are very conscious and aware of what is happening in your life and how your childhood issues affects your relationships today. You have no idea how far ahead you are of most people who don't understand the root of their troubles. Keep digging and working on it (with a therapist if you haven't been already) and you will break free of the pattern and be so much happier for it. Good luck!|`|sUMuJjZlaa	i think very common. i too am struggling with issues surrounding this and am currently having therapy to help me understand it all due to two failed relationships and still to this day believe that i go for the wrong men knowing subconsciously that they are no good for me cos of the type of people they are, yet carry on with it, basically flogging a dead horse as i have this deep rooted issue that i am undeserving of happiness and so sabotage what potentially could be a very fulfilling life. i still am unsure as to where this mindset comes from, i am from a good home and background. but, my father even though he lived with us and my mum and dad are still happily married was not much of a family man and looking back i never really had a great relationship with my dad and wonder is that why i go for the type of men i do...sorry if i havent been of much help to you as im still on my own journey through this but i can assure you, u are not alone.|`|447b3c2cce6bc6d60c0a2667a9e8a9a9aa	You know what I feel the exact same way but I never understood why. I think its pretty common but some people are worse than others. Childhood trauma also plays a big part. I think the only way to get past it is to stop moping and just live for all the good things in life.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I think it happens to everyone.  You may want to read "The Celestine Prophesy" which details some specific modes of childhood power struggles.<br>  <br>  For advanced reading, try "The Four Archetypes" by Carl Jung.|`|xr8j9Tjhaa	i do it all the time and i am 34...the first step in moving past it is recognizing the pattern and then identifying ways to stop.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	In my opinion, ALOT of people's actions are still motivated (even unconsciously) by unresolved issues from their childhood.  I believe alot of women suffer from low self-esteem which makes them often go after the wrong men in r'ships because secretly they don't think they deserve the kind of man who will treat them like a queen.  I'm like that to some extent....I mean, I always picked wonderful men who treated me great but I do have low self-esteem.  When my husband came along, he treated me so incredibly that it was hard for me to take in....I couldn't believe (and still can't) that I deserved a man of his caliber.  Perhaps after we've been married 50 years, I'll finally believe it!! :) Of course he says the same of me though too.  <br>  <br>  I hope that young women who sabotage their r'ships & constantly pick bad guys will see their pattern and GET HELP to understand WHY they do this - why they are so naturally drawn to guys who don't treat them well.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	It is very common.  It is hard work to forgive the past and forge ahead, but totally worth it.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I think it's common, and many may not even realize they are doing so.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I think it's very common. If you have the courage to face these insecurities and grow, life is much, much better! Many people refuse to look within and it's really one of the most important things we can do.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	it controls about 95% of our adult behavior.<br>  Consciously or subconsciously|`|bXGwTQy6aa	its pretty common and my thought is that almost everyone subconsciously uses that as motivation|`|34b40Vu3aa	Very common.  Doesnt mean you cant get past it though.
0RZuiHQdaa	I would make it clear that sex is important in the relationship and that is not something I can wait for necessarily; yet the question is purely subjective--lots of guys CAN and do wait till marriage, but not all of them know that they can or will wait when they commit to it.|`|1qAiKUXRaa	definitly B, not because sex is everything, but no matter how much you love someone, sex can make or break a relationship, so if you wait till marriage and it turns out that the sex is bad, the marriage probably wont workl out. waiting a long time is not a problem, but i think waiting till ur actually married is a bad idea|`|91570a0146f250c792909304f3b1f793aa	BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	I would move on.  Sex is an important part of a healthy marriage.  Not being compatible with someone sexually can cause MAJOR stress in a marriage.  Would you marry someone that you did not know?  How would you know if you were compatible?  So if you do not have sex before marriage how do you know that you will be compatible sexually.  <br>  <br>  Would I try and change her mind?  I would explain my point of view.  If she still felt the same I would respect her choice and move on.|`|xOqsfebYaa	i could wait......<br>  <br>  <br>  hell...been waitin almost 22 years....what's a little moe??? right?

If you like the bracelet then keep it, your bf needs to accept that everyone has a past but that it nedn't impact on your relationship.|`|QkDBFvBcaa	Who could blame him? It's very hurtful when a current boyfriend think's that you might still care for an ex when he see's you wearing somthing he gave you. Take the bracelet off and put it away!|`|y8kMBObUaa	You have to see it from his point of view: he really cares about you and here you are with a present from an ex around your wrist.<br>  I also see it from your perspective: it's pretty!<br>  Maybe he feels like you holding on to it, you're holding on to your ex.
EJIDB2kIaa	I had my daughter placed in CHINS and it was a waste of my time.  The courts are reluctant to act no matter what your child does.  It may help you get your son in counseling, that was the only thing it did for me because the courts ordered her to attend.  Her really destructive behaviour did not stop though.  It may be different where you live though.
AA12086491	I think its the second one.  If you need someone because you want them, thats lust, if you want something because you need it, thats addiction, which would translate to love.  This sounds like a creative way to be clingy to me.

Even nice hotels that are located near the highway have way too much noise. Not from the traffic, but from the guests. Hotels near highways are easier to find, thus everyone is there making all kinds of noise in the middle of the night.|`|MbD7Qmlaaa	Whatever you do, stay away from the Best Western in Buena Park.

I've got 3 kids, but I know when we're able to escape without the kids it's not nice to be at a property where we can relax.  Lots of the hotels are around Disneyland.  If you just need a place to celebrate your special night (and a place to crash before leaving on your honeymoon), maybe a hotel that isn't right at Disneyland's front gate might be nice.  Check out Tripadvisor.com!!!  Honest reviews by regular people.  Click on "read/write reviews".  Then, enter "Anaheim hotels".  You'll get a list of hotels (rated from 1 thru 200?).  Read the reviews and pick what works out for you.  Expedia.com has fair prices on most hotels.  And, CONGRATS!!
rRRkxplWaa	I'm probably not the best person to answer this as I'm pretty much in the same boat, and it's not resolved.  My boyfriend of 3 years and I have sex about once a month, at the most.  It seems that sex is a chore to him, like taking out the garbage.  He does seem to enjoy it once we've started, but he very rarely seems interested in me sexually.  I don't know whether it's because of problems between us, or if it's a physical problem.  I have tried talking to him honestly about it.  I've told him I feel unattractive and unloved when he shows no interest.  He promised to go to the doctor, and then didn't.  In anger I've threatened to leave over it (although I try not to do that as I don't want to add more bitterness and anger to the issue.  Sex should be fun, not something someone does so you won't get mad or leave them).  I've tried explaining that to me, sex and love go together, and if one is missing, something is wrong.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm sure my boyfriend is not cheating.  I also am an attractive (in my opinion) 27-year old woman (he's 34).  I haven't put on weight, or anything like that.<br>  <br>  So I don't know why I felt compelled to answer this, as I obviously do not have an answer.  I guess I just wanted to tell you I understand the hurt you are likely feeling.  All you can do is discuss your feelings honestly with him, and try not to come across as angry or judgemental.  Tell him you miss your intimacy.  If he loves you, I think he will try.  I'm not sure what that says about my relationship.  I wish you the best of luck (and hope you wish me luck too).|`|4c0a4b646f8d3922998ed3b4a2296774aa	All you can do for him is to tell him how you feel about the situation and maybe ask him if he might need to see a doctor. It's possible it could be a medical thing, or maybe he is just worn out from work. My husband and I went thru that once and that was all it was. Now we are back to normal. Good luck to you.|`|4fa7154454bb55561ee6fb3f79ccb079aa	Find out what is bothering him.  Listen to him and don't judge. It might take time.  Is he still kind to you?  Do you still get along?  Give him some nuturance.  Maybe something is bothering him that you don't understand.  There's more to a relationship than sex.|`|63f0776e4b3d7a7743b5e87d874174f8aa	bring your best looking big breasted girlfriend over and have a 3 some......that will do the trick.|`|AA10926354	Maybe he needs to see a medical professional...or maybe it's time to bring in the toys...|`|EaLgs30Saa	Well, if he's not cheating, then ask him to see his doctor and request a Rx for viagra.  The doctor will probably do a physical to make sure that he doesn't have any unknown physical problems that could be causing it and the give him the Rx.|`|a4SOvK3Laa	Go get a make-over, change your hair, buy some sexy clothes.....and see if he has a positive reaction.<br>  <br>  But really, ask him what the problem is. And explain to him that is non-sex drive is hurting you and the relationship.|`|de7f071bf12ed9898587e22f39bd92e4aa	Does he have a medical condition or is he taking any medications?  I would begin there and if he is taking medication check for the side effects.  If you are sure he is not having an affair I would ask him what has changed that has caused him to have less desire.<br>  <br>  If you have children, see if you can find someone to watch them overnight so you can create a fun and sexy evening for him.  Do something sexy but totally unexpected that he would think is fun but would never ask.  If you are not sure then just do what you think would be fun for you.  Get your hair and makeup done and wear something that will catch his eye and make him remember why he loves you so much.<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|gnj7U8f3aa	NOT CHEATING??? are you sure? how can u say he is not cheating? i mean then what would the reason be? he has to have a reason...talk to him and think about what he tells you...i am not trying to let you down but im sorry, i dont knwo what else to say. He either has an intercourse problem or he is cheating...please check with him...|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	First, Viagra is for dysfunction, not low libido.  You should speak with your physician about this first.  There are many reasons for this condition, some physical (low hormone levels) and some psychological (stress and depression).  Your physician is the best person to determine how to address the problem.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	thats a hard one but u really have to talk to him about this..<br>  <br>  he may be just be exhausted from work or even bills you should find out really because this is something that could so easily wreck a marriage|`|8a262a9c5496ee057e063ab90852f0c4aa	It sounds like he may be depressed, but who knows?  He needs to see his doctor, or a counselor.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you know this, but--If he has no desire, Viagra won't help.|`|AA10444191	Hook him on to the magic pill...V I A G R A !!|`|AA11285272	YOU ARE A NICE LOOKING WOMAN I SAY SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH HIM.|`|uzTx5SSRaa	paranoid people here. Just because the sex isn't happening or not as much as it used to doesn't automatically mean the other is cheating. Think of this, 1.Has the spouse been under more stress than normal? 2.Change in career? 3.More stress from family/medical/mental/emotional issues? 4. emotional problems or mental illness (like depression, anxiety) can bring sexlives and sex drives to a hault. 5.Something medical like ED? Or is he on meds that would kill the sex drive.<br>  <br>  These are things to think about people, and believe it or not, not everyone is in the mood 24/7, and they're not in the mood SIMPLY JUST BECAUSE they are not... Duh

We all want someone we can please and make happy, and all our effort goes into ensuring that they are happier than we are.  The right woman will be the woman who makes you feel happy to be around her, someone who never leaves your mind, someone who just puts your soul on a cloud.  If she makes you feel that way, you won't have to work at making her happy, it would be evident that she is there with you.|`|AA11537569	First if you see the particular type of woman you like go up and introduce yourself to her.

b77963c97585c64935d438a1e0638a83aa	if she is a good friend you should be able to talk to her about anything.  I would be straight up with her and tell her how you feel.  It would ruin your friendship and if she values it, she wont go through with it.  Even if the relationship didnt last, you would always feel that betrayal there.  You are not being selfish by stating the truth.  Where is her respect for you?  Good luck|`|313afe838a0489639fc15b0394b300ebaa	It seems like even though you broke up with him, you still hold some kind of feelings for him. It's only been 3 weeks and you're still not *entirely* over him, which is very reasonable. You guys went out for a long time and you would probably be hurt if your boyfriend started dating any girl this soon.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend this and she should understand. If she's a good friend, she will not think you're selfish and she will wait a while until you know that you will be okay with everything.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens, don't let your friend go out with him without you talking to her first about how you feel. You probably value your friendship with her and you don't want to end up losing a good friend over some situation with your past boyfriend.|`|AA11403755	if shes your friend then tell her the truth!! Ive been through before it hurt to tell her but she understood. after i got over him she got him!! hope i helped??!!!|`|YVybKKrjaa	OK you need to ask yourself the question- is your so called friend really a friend. i mean you just broke up with your man and already she is ready to snatch him up. <br>  <br>  how thoughtful it is for her to ask about your feelings. and you know what? you should tell her the truth! tell her how it would make you feel. how awkward and uncomfortable things will be with you and her once he steps into the picture. <br>  <br>  i mean for crying out loud, you dont have to be mean about it, but be truthful and forceful. tell her that you are still hurting from the breakup and how it would be too soon for you to meet his new girlfriend, especially if it was her. and how you wont be able to hang out with her so much now that she has a new guy. and how impossible it would be for you to meet up with her and him.<br>  <br>  if she's really your friend, yes she may get a bit upset, but she will understand. and this is a test for your friendship. if she ditches you for him, then she was never really your friend in the first place.|`|jj2tSASnaa	three weeks...well, if you two are not even trying to work it out...and if you care(d) for him....you'd want him to be happy, right? If you can't have him should you keep your friend and ex from being happy? Let him go...let her go too, if you have to.<br>  Focus on you and find yourself a nice boy to love.|`|05d80c06750432dc222d9ece5e29c0aeaa	well i supposed u could say u r uncomfortable with it... rmbr do not sell urself out. u'l feel even worse when they r really together. <br>  <br>  this is sticky. if i were u i would admit and if they really want to be together i think u can't stop them too. get urself another guy! learn to move on girl that's all we need.

4YQTbhXZaa	Well youre never going to forget but let me tell you how to get over him faster.<br>  <br>  Write down on a piece of paper all the negative things you just hate about the guy. Now every time you get all sad and start thinking what a wonderful guy he was and how sad it is that you didnt end up with him get that paper out! <br>  <br>  Women are run by their emotions. Thats great when youre a mother but when youre just trying to get along in this world sometimes thats a handicap. Act like a man, dont get caught up in your emotions. This will all work out and you will be thanking yourself for not ending up with this loser some day you just watch!!! And dont drink and dial! LOL <br>  <br>   Be strong, be happy, be busy and fill that list up!! This will all just be a part of your history some day. And you'll be the smart girl that got away!!! Woo hoo!|`|dZwtL9Cbaa	I dont have the magical words, i do wish i did as i am on my second failed relationship,  I found that the best way was to embrace the feelings for awhile, then let go.  You will never forget the love you felt and you will never forget him.  Dont force yourself too either.  Store what you had in a place in your heart and then get out there and find your next adventure.  To deny what you felt i think eats at you more than the fact that he has moved on, then it becomes the idea of him, sometimes it clouds judgements when looking back on your relationship to make it seem even more perfect.  <br>  <br>  It most probably does make it hurt even more to see him have a child with someone else, but once again embrace the hurt and devastation then remind yourself there is someone out there who will give you new feelings, dreams, kisses and cuddles.  I think as you get older you change your perceptions of what love is all about.  You could maybe even force yourself to embrace their happiness and before you know it you will be out there buying little pressies and feeling happy for them (even with a bitter twist).  In saying that if you arent that close to him or never talk to him anymore, a card sent to the couple with your kindest wishes.  I do remind myself that there is someone else who loves an ex that i may end up with.  Sorry but in everything i say you still dont have to like them but that can your little secret stash.   When i embraced the bitterness with my first ex i always referred to her as a ****, he knew i didnt mean it but i do still have that secret she is a **** stash which only i can giggle at and then put it back for another day.  I hope you get most of that..May sound weird but helping me get back up even now.
4YQTbhXZaa	Well the giving thing is good. But dont be a fool. Give to the people that deserve it. And take from the ones that you can take from. I dont usually bring God into my answers but I felt like I should here. So here goes. If God has chosen you to be a giver, a healer of sorts (peoples spirits) , thats what youre going to be. But God also loves wisdom so again just make sure you're giving to the right people. God doesnt want us to deplete ourselves. Okay sorry for the sermon. Amen  LOL<br>  <br>  The ones that hurt you dont deserve you. So keep yourself away from them. Even if theyre family. Take breaks if thats all you can do. Just be picky and choosy as to who gets the best of you. <br>  <br>  I know what you mean, sometimes it just doesnt feel like it all equals out but in the long run it does. <br>  <br>  Do what makes you feel good, like fueling up your car after you run the tank empty. Fuel yourself. Exercise is always an upper, playing an instrument, writing, whatever floats your boat. But DO take the time for yourself, you obviously deserve it. <br>  <br>  You sound like a super wonderful person and believe me, you do in fact reap what you sow.

This girl, that is dating someone lower than you is happy with that level. Some day you will see that you were above her and she was never going to fit in your life. The saying is, "water finds its own level". You cant fight that. <br>  <br>  Let her go, you follow your own path. You will find the girl of your dreams and this will all just be part of your history. <br>  <br>  You can however stay busy and active. Work on your abs, get those endorphins going. Exercise is GREAT for anxiety! So is the breathing, maybe some yoga or tai chi? Paint, do whatever makes you happy. And my favorite bible verse..one of them "This Too Shall Pass".<br>  <br>  Every day you will be feeling just a bit better than the last. <br>  <br>  Take care of yourself, you matter!  Someday you will be having a conversation with  your son about women like her. And you will smile at your wife and thank God you didnt end up with this woman. God has a plan.

AA10284235	I'm a Scorpio. Indeed, sometimes our inner heat drives us to passion but we also can been an iceberg. Of course, the mood counts, but our refilling rate is that way. Don't try to push us, we will know for sure when are ready. Nonetheless, tell us what you think or, on the contrary, leave us somehow intrigued. Surely that will strike right into our minds and we won't cease until we get deep in your mind or your heart.|`|AA10093905	You better come to me then, always ready.|`|4ffbd1621a74f97c7ab756510af4b2a9aa	it has nothing to do with Scorpio or monkey, it all in your head.

jKKK7Z2waa	They always say that you don't realize what you've got until you lose it & in that same way, your family probably realized it once you were away.  At least you know they DO care.  I come from a very close-knit family so I can see what you mean about the annoyance it can become.  I love my family & wouldn't trade them for anything in this world, though. <br>  <br>  The ideal family would be one that was close-knit, but one that would also respect your time & space.  <br>  <br>  I think I'd much rather have a close-knit family than one that neglected to show how much they cared.|`|36a5944b26e9b2825e94299a4cf81b8aaa	I AM IN THE SAME SITUATION U ARE AS WELL. <br>  <br>  MY FAMILY WERE VERY APART AND WE SEE EACH OTHER A FEW TIMES OF THE YEAR.

H8i73fnEaa	Only way you'll find out is if you approach her with the magical question, at this point it shouldn't really matter, better to let her know now or someone else just might. ^-^|`|730e9fe4e038fd0e4cdc9f8ec01b4ee2aa	Sit with her and hang out with her one day and see what happens. It's sometimes hard to tell if a girl likes you because girls are considered"closed books". Find interest int he things she likes and then she will start liking you.

Girls will do this all the time, if they like you. She is talking to u alot sometimes and ignoring u sometimes to get u hooked on her. But here's wat u wanna do, get her to like u not the other way around. If u think she liks u ask her to go to the movies or sumthin, if she says yes she liks u. And wen u ask her do not be shy or a dick, u gotta b cool about it. peace

I don't believe in staying contacts with any kinds of exs unless if I would want them back in the future.  Just tell her and if she thinks it's not really a big deal and laughs at you she doesn't deserve you. It'll mean she doesn't respect you.|`|bbBJdMcGaa	better communicate your feelings with your girl. but do not let her do as she pleases. why would she wanna have contact with her ex? that should be history already.|`|sB4RIJCDaa	Yo man, u doin it all wrong. U gotta b cool about it cuz wen u lose ur cool, u then give her a choice between him or u. not a good position to put urself in.

H8i73fnEaa	At your age you should be more focused on other things, come back here in a couple more years. ^-^|`|AA11056504	yes wait. respect her as a friend and let your friendship grow.

You can do it in a fun, flirty way if you want. It doesn't have to be all serious. Tell her you're really into her and would like to hang out someday...ask her what she thinks. If she likes you  too, she'll smile, turn all red, and say "yeah, I would like that".|`|sB4RIJCDaa	hey yo don't listen to these fools. dere's no age limit to love. jus don't b stupid. Ok to ur question, u can't leave her waiting around for dat. Never ever ever wait for her to make a mov or wait for the right moment. There is never gonna b aright moment  so jus get on wit it.

They aren't part of this equation. If you like her and she likes you, ask her out. Tell her how you feel, tell her that you aren't concerned about what your parents think and see what she has to say. Besides if her parents and your parents are friends then they must both like the both of you. Let me tell you, I am double your age and my best friend and I used to like each other alot but never did anything about it and now she is getting married in 4 months so take advantage of any chance you get.|`|BOQXELAvaa	At that age everything is akward. Start by asking her to watch a movie with you or eat lunch with you. Ask more questions about her...like her taste in music, movies and her favorite classes.
75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	I think you are likely looking pathetic.  Not to be rude.. just truthful..<br>  <br>  Youve made TWO ATTEMPTS... one of which he responded... (probably out of courtesy) and one that he ignored.<br>  <br>  If you are really meant to be together you should just live your life and try to move on and let him attempt to contact you... Dont make yourself look needy anymore.|`|f0b5a1caa64f80bec74b13f3046b9392aa	well I think you broke up and he has went on with his life and you should be tryin to call someone else da!|`|AvmJArNcaa	1st answer says it all. Why are you worring about it still, youre DONE.|`|NGjlRJvxaa	That shows you HE HAS MOVED ON!!! and he doesn't want you and you guys broken up so why would he call you if you weren't his girlfriend anymore he would probably only call you if you were his friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|adqaTo9xaa	You broke up stop acting desperate and move on, or keep doing what your doing and get played!|`|cb27400c0c7f7a5eec4216e2df61bd1eaa	Don't  text or email or call him anymore!! I know its soooo hard, but watch if you don't for like 2 weeks he will call you. He's playing games with you. If you guys went out for 4 years-2 months is not nearly enough time to move on.  Even when he does contact you after you DONT contact him anymore. Don't answer! You have to give it at least a good solid month with no contact to get over a long term relationship like that.  Go have a good time with your girl friends and family and forget about him.  You guys can always be friends later on in life.|`|oun6wGabaa	You leave alot of unanswered questions to give an answer as to why he has not called. Four years is a long time to be with someone. I would hope that your ability to communicate has also matured during this time. Someone is not being honest with the other. This has to be first and formost for any future in a relationship. If he can not communicate with you so that you both understand and realize that this may be the best for both of you, that alone should tell you something. Is he hiding something ? You have hopefully become better friends over this four years also, is this how friends treat each other ?. Finally, four years.... I would like to believe you both care about each other. Sometimes, we find ourselves going in a different direction then our mate. But, the length of your relationship makes me ask wouldn't regardless of the outcome, as friends-lovers who have developed this long of a relationship want what is best for the other, and makes them the happiest.  Nothing is going to change the times, memories and events you have shared over the past four years good and bad. But, lets also realize that we want to see this person happy in the future and maybe that may require us to end the relationship. Its should not be viewed a s personal attack. If handled in the proper manner, your future could be just a fun, and exciting as friends and acquaintances as you shared being lovers in a relationship. Good luck.
OppkDoSLaa	It doesn't take much to work this out. He LIKES you not LOVE you. While he is texting this other chick, and not getting any from her, of course he will hang around. Sorry to hurt you, but I think he considers you his "emergency lay" when he can not get it anywhere else. Although you have a child with him, and it's essential for him to maintain social contact with the baby, I suggest that you move on in your love life and find someone new who will appreciate and care for you, and only you. Best of luck.|`|bc3cc64235ab373dcceba8fb8a44d1bfaa	Dont put yourself throu this!!!!!! why is he still there? get outta this situation... You remind me so much of me when i was pregnent i loved my babys daddy so much but he didnt feel the same way he was only there because i had gotten pregnant. this is only gonna bring you pain in the end get out and just get the child support from him. On top of the fact that hes got a girl on the side??
PSM7zmf7aa	do you know where he moved? my advice would be to talk this thing over and get his opinion whatever he want prepare for it.|`|sS1qzLl9aa	You never know. Long distance relationships can be tough. I would just give him a week :). You never know what's going on, only time can tell.|`|afdaf101c512d0b55cadd8e79a7fa21aaa	hes moved on.|`|79b8f13ff02cbb64e78bc2b75e44650aaa	Although it can be distressing to have someone disregard your attempt to communicate you should stop and think. For what ever reason it is happening it's beyond your control, stop leaving him messages for a while and see what happens. If after a few months you get no response assume he does not want to talk to you and forget about it.|`|gltnp1Nsaa	Hi my people says "eyes that are not in touch quicly forget each other" if you had a lot time to be in touch soon you forget eache other... try for the last time to call him and if it is not work go on your life... "there are everywhere trees to make apples" I want to say that he propably forgets you (most of boys are like this) you must not worry about it all the planet is full of boys and moche better than him. On the other hand if you like this boy so much and you have lived unforgetable times try to find more about his new life and if he has a new girlfriend. if he has, try to meet him and make him to be a jealous (if he see you with anothere boy i'm sure he did!!) Drop me alive at my e-mail tstergiani!yahoo.com
AA11631022	If u love him then go ahead and say him.... That right now its time to built our future... so we will keep in touch and meet sometimes but not forcefully if both wants to meet then there should be a meet.... If he understands then its good... but if he left u.. Don't take tension get happy because u r loosing someone who don't even love u... instead of u, he should be sad as he is leaving someone who loves her alot....<br>  One thing more.. always keep this in mind.. if a guy hav a sex with gal b4 marriage he left her.. as this is guys thinking and mentality... if u can give it to him he needs u can give the same to everyone...
f01413002fdc25ba268d7ffc54c05892aa	he is doin that b/c he still wants for fu*k you. he wants a friend for when he needs someone... ya no!<br>  <br>  just let him go!|`|YJ69l4vnaa	I am a 35 yrs old guy.  I used to to do that too.  The girl that I went out  with was not interesting.  Her sex appeal was low.  I was dating her because I was poor and needed sex.  I did not hate her, and I did not love her.  So I decided to  break  up with her in a nice way.  I think it's the same in your case.
H8i73fnEaa	If you're not against it, a threesome be the solution ^-^|`|rMq9D06Faa	Don't try to juggle.  If they find out you are so easily able to flip-flop, then neither may want to be with you.  <br>  <br>  Why do you believe the grass is greener with the other guy?  Pick one and stick with them.  Otherwise, you may end up alone.|`|JlPWUP14aa	Welll......how amazing is this guy? go for the amazing guy you only live once! :)|`|CVWizvy6aa	Yu have to set your mind straight.  Decide whether the one you want is your boyfriend, or other other guy.  If you want your boyfriend then forget the other guy. But if you want the other guy, please break up with your boyfriend.  Do not cheat on your boyfriend with other guy; that is immature, inconsiderate, and slutty thing to do.  A girl's reputation is very important as well as her physical self. So don't cause a bad name for yourself.  <br>  <br>  YOu said your boyfriend is awesome, so i dont think there's any reason for you to have feelings for the other guy anyways.  Why is it that you people never appreciate the things around you ?????? YOu always want more, and more.|`|ip67o8yoaa	like the saying goes:<br>  "D0NT LEAVE THE 0NE U L0VE F0R THE 0NE Y0U LIKE CUZ THE 0NE U LIKE WILL LEAVE U FOR THE ONE THEY LOVE..."

There is logic behind his jealousy.  And you're also making friends with new men?  I believe that men and women generally don't become just "friends."  I predict that if you continue this behavior, you will find yourself in a position to cheat and will have to make a decision that will be tougher than you'd prefer.  I just think it's better to not put yourself in that position in the first place if you value your relationship.  But that's just my humble opinion.|`|AA11551007	If you are friends with your exes (as I am) your boyfriend should respect that - they are a part of your life that came before him, whether he likes it or not. The fact that they are exes is no coincidence - if you wanted any of them as more than friends, you wouldn't be with him, would you?<br>  Also he should see it as a good thing that you can maintain a healthy friendship with these guys - it bodes well for him should things not work out between you two that you won't go "psycho-ex" on him!<br>  <br>  As for the ex who gets too close, you have done the right thing by remindng him that you are with someone else. If he keeps pushing his luck, firmly tell him that you wish to stay friends, but nothing more, and if he really cares about you an your feelings then he needs to respect that. If he can't (or won't) then you need to lose contact with him.|`|NR8oZyWfaa	some would come here and give you some answer that is almost automatic without thought they will tell you that the boyfriend suffers from low selfesteme. i however must first suggest that your hanging around with boys who you had a  sexual relationship with in the past would be for most people upsetting. <br>   i suggest you limit your involment with previous boyfriends to a bare minium and that means only meeting with them in a group setting . <br>   as for his not wanting you to talk with other guys that bit is a tad much . that part may be because your a flirt . i dont know . <br>   i do think that he is a person that for some reason needs to feel more assured that your his girlfriend and your not planning or likely to go off with some other guy . <br>   i hope this helps both of you .|`|rhUWXOnSaa	Tell him it's nothing big or simple yet, listen to him, or u will have another ex. Good Luck~|`|74Cvd7a2aa	well obviously the jealousy comes from insecurity/possessiveness. he is afraid he'll lose you. so the first thing you should do is to talk to him and assureyou lov him and that's why you're together in the first place. try to be more nicer/affectionate to him, so he would feel more secure. but if even like that he's trying to control your social life, maybe you should think twice about your relationship.|`|G6Ykdtumaa	have sex with him every sunday....haha

No two girls have the same preference of guys but its about 50/50 with bad boys VS nice guys|`|PZTMV3pDaa	Because they are uncomfortable being treated nice. They are not use to It, so It Is foreign to them. They prefer to be treated badly and to be walked all over.|`|5paPd4qlaa	well i'm not exactly a 'bad boy'...i dont drive a harley or anything. but i do seem to notice that a LOT of women, especially those with low self-esteem, respond to a guy who is nice at first but not puppy-dog-ish. then he gets meaner and treats her badly, but is still nice sometimes, still showing that good side.<br>  <br>  they get some weird urge to "change" him and are also turned on by his display that he is not afraid of them. and, if someone treats you badly, you may get the idea it's justified because they're too good for you.<br>  <br>  psychologically, i guess liking 'bad boys' relates to feeling inadequate (this feeling, like the preference 4 bad boys, need not be conscious) and figuring one is lucky to have anyone, even someone mean. sad. but common, even among hot girls.|`|GAUUg2i0aa	Absolute the animal instinct.<br>  Some girls like myself sometimes like rough looking men than the ones who look too good to be true and end up being gay.

I think most do...<br>  <br>  probly low self-esteem, got issues...lol<br>  <br>  its the nice guy they are emotionally attracted to, but the bad boy they are sexually attracted to<br>  <br>  the nice guy will be there for them at all times (which apparently is something a girl doesnt want -- yea, what losers)<br>  <br>  the bad boy will treat them like **** and wont care about them (which apparently is something a girl does want -- yea, bigger losers)|`|tEd23y8Zaa	it's not that we don't like "nice guys". everyone wants to label it that to make it sound ok.  to most people, nice guys equal: unmanly, unattractive, etc.  this isn't always the case, but that's how a lot of people see it.  a lot of guys ask this question and it's not about being a nice guy.  there are usually other factors involved|`|OmIcLjNbaa	its all about image. the girls that pick the bad boys eventually get real screwed up in the end. and there is an old saying nice guys finish last. its true until your 50 or so. the best thing to do is have a 50/50 mix of bad and nice. just know when show each side.|`|ssmSBwsdaa	becaz they don't understand the differnce between good & bad and thinks that at least bad boya will never change their nature , but vice versa is not true!
CrSoV47Iaa	If your friends don't like you they're not your friends.<br>  <br>  If they think you're not cool they're not your friends.<br>  <br>  Peer pressure is intense and can make you do things you know your parents wouldn't want you doing.  Take time and think.<br>  Your friends can be your friends one day and your enemies the next; your parents are forever.|`|AA10963966	Then I would say that they are not your friends.

They are obviously not good friends.|`|10fb91dfd2655b0b8b6b5cd242b06a71aa	well you should ditch them and find friends who appreciate who you are no matter what. That is what you call peer pressure and you should not give into it because you'll be lsomeone you don't want to be. Be unique and proud. Just not lonely so find friends with the same interest okay ?|`|FrBmfynAaa	Get new friends who like for who you are.|`|PQD4U4TKaa	find some more friends that you like to hang out with

H8i73fnEaa	Usually the best relationships are stemed from best friends<br>  ^-^|`|eE79f8ZYaa	Old rule is Don't screw your crew.<br>  <br>  However, some relationships are from companionships.<br>  <br>  I have guy friends that I am physically attracted to but not mentally or vice versa. You remain FRIENDS for a reason. <br>  <br>  To ask women out your not too familiar with is to follow your gut instincts. Be confident and engage in conversation and ask. If you get rejected it is cause you are moving to fast. Try talking to them a few times, feel out if they are yoru type or not and then pop the question. Start out with a very basic date, such as a coffee together. Make sure its a short date. Long ones will get too complex and both of you will feel uncomfotable|`|Eu9aIHAyaa	Don't believe it for a moment.<br>  <br>  Haven't you ever heard of the "Friend Zone"
d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	People who carry out kidnappings are sickos! But what possessed the parents to leave  their children unattended? it dont matter that they checked on them-the truth is they should not have been left alone in the first place. Why has nobody pointed part blame in the direction of the parents? if you take kids on holiday - you cannot afford to leave them for a few minutes!<br>  <br>  Police work differently in other countries-they have guidelines to follow. It looks like people are looking for a scapegoat to blame, the blame is not with the police it is with the parents- but this is only my opinion, maybe others think the same as me- but are too afraid to say anything.|`|7faf93da45d83739157172f0932e02ccaa	zara phillips?<br>  <br>  Are you taking the piss here, or are you the real zara phillips.<br>  <br>  Oh, i really think they are going to reply and say "hey zara, how ya doing. yeah i am the kidnapper"<br>  <br>  And how do we know what their motives are?

aRH8Wy6aaa	First of all, apologize.  Second, make right your wrongs.  You can't just make the bad feelings disappear like magic, you have to do something to make it right.  Third, you have to make amends by doing nice things for him.  Don't skip any steps, only then can there be complete forgiveness and reconciliation.  If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right.<br>  Step one allows you to open the gate.  Step two turns negative into neutral.  Step three turns neutral into positive.<br>  Good luck.|`|a1fbe413ed78d0949fe3148706c9c459aa	There's nothing wrong with sending a guy flowers.|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	Admit that you messed up and apologize and do so sincerely.|`|08aBWZJHaa	Show up on his doorstep with a<br>   big card sayin sorry & his fave chocolate ;)|`|DvfCdaouaa	Yes, in a heartfelt confession, record your voice telling him your sorry, tell him your side of the story...<br>  And tell him what he means to you, how you feel since he has been gone...<br>  Put it in a cute box along with a self made card with  a "free do what you want to me coupon..."  Make it cute and fun, but let it be obvious you miss him and are sorry...<br>  Gifts from the heart matter more than anything else...<br>  You can't buy love, it is just there... ?|`|H8i73fnEaa	My advice is don't, if he care's about you he'll forgive you, no need to present a guy with anything.|`|7a5e2e40ff0560b625436a125ff3fe4aaa	yeah i think a present would be a cute idea..maybe with a little note attached explaining ur feelings for him too. Telling him u miss him and stuff...dont beg to much..if he dont give u another chance he is not worth ur time or love. maybe wait for someone better.
H8i73fnEaa	Put him on a leash and tell him to get a damm cellphone|`|zydpKBq1aa	He has probably found someone else now, I would give up and find someone closer to you. Tell yourself you deserve better. Many guys out there don't hold all your hopes for just one guy.|`|rRlmwvhMaa	Just go on with life. If he really likes you that much he'll find a way to get in touch with you more.

The feelings/urges you have having are not natural or healthy.|`|df5a4ed690e528ce8a55e1fc185fd056aa	Be careful that this affection you have for boys does not hurt them emotionally, spiritually and otherwise. Be careful that is does not cause you to do things with them that may eventually hurt you in the long run. Perhaps you may want to become a therapist and really help them. But don't use them to gratify your own lust. That will only hinder them from becoming the men they all desperately need and want to become.
H8i73fnEaa	All it boils down to is whether you two like one another enough, no spark, no attraction.|`|JtZs7fAtaa	And why would you want to have a staring contest?  How old are you?  I don't get it.|`|ZRTL3RJfaa	I too am wondering who's going to win the 3:30 at Chepstow|`|Sv8eVhp7aa	I think you should do as much as possible to make it work... I mean you never know...

And if your completely over the fact that ya'll don't have anything in common then let him down easy... No one like's to be hurt... So always imagine yourself in the persons shoe before doing something like that... Right?
H8i73fnEaa	If you have no feelings for him, then let him do whatevers...he maybe stalking you now though. ^-^|`|1a2aa6e6b8f4264c1db99935864776a4aa	U seem like a nice person he probably just moved for his own purpose dont feel bad|`|9A1gXrlaaa	I have been in that situation.

GO GO GO !!!  QUICK!!!|`|aevgUmLFaa	Ask her to go out sometime. Don't make it a date, just invite a bunch of friends to go out, and then ask her to come along.

X9uJahxtaa	Didn't  come off as gay. Play dumb until she gets the picture. Act like you have no idea she likes you, be really nice to her, but in a friendly way, no checking her out or flirting. She will wonder why you don't seem attracted and probably come after you hard if she likes you. Talk about other girls with her like a friend, and even describe an imaginary situation  in which you just told a girl that you're not interested in a relationship right now. She'll get the picture, if not, she's completely dumb, and tell her so. Your friends will be happier once they know you have no interest in her and probably stop being jerks. If not, confront them about it and tell them to grow up<br>  <br>  bros before hoes, never forget it|`|AA11859732	well, i think if they were really ur friends they would be happy for you that you have this going with someone.<br>  <br>  and i bet this girl would be very sad if you told her you didn't want 2 go out with her.<br>  like she'd think that there was something wrong with her or something.|`|AA10111347	Just don't do anything. If you don't do anything, the girl will get it that you are not interested, and will not approach you.|`|JYcYLJD0aa	sounds pretty gay. well friends should come first right now. talk to her. let her know how you feel and what you want. but ask her what she wants. and compromise

So you got to decide this time if its the real thing and your going to be with him or if its just a casual thing till something better comes along, cause it sounds like he doesnt want to let his guard down and get burned again. Maybe hes still made from the previous break up, time will tell but so will your choices also.

AA12326796	After having him tied up in a way that give you easy access, don't forget to blindfold him. That already makes a lot of difference.<br>  <br>  For what follows the keywords are "variation", "surprise" and "slow". Use your two hands and mouth simultaneously to caress, scratch, bite. Use objects with different textures. A feather or a duster is great toy too. Take your time for every surface you visit. Explore everywhere, from hair to toe, but avoid AT ALL COST you know what. Vary your position, besides him, between his legs, sitting on him.|`|c0fe6d7cbea251aa5fff743e685bafc9aa	youre just trying to get off to the answers you get huh|`|4bgruMcdaa	The key is to tease. I love being tied and blindfolded. The soft teasing touches drive me wild. A kiss here or there, whisper some dirty thoughts into my ear. Keep me on edge, do not let me get off. You want to make me beg for it, tease me till I am pleading for you. Of course that's just me..... Sue and Diamond both make excellent points. I'd love to be tied up and get to watch a strip tease.|`|7Q91bs40aa	my best suggestion is to do everything slower. if he wants to be tied he is either into the anticipation or some type of humiliation or abuse. try being very slow and changing things up (like start down his stomach and stop as he gets aroused ) pay attention to areas that are different like feet or hands or lower back. i would stick with the anticipation part unless you know different but you can sneak in a little smack on the tush when hes really into it to test for the rest|`|AA10213648	Well if your not shy a strip tease and lap dance is great.|`|LUIdQRgdaa	I would suggest sliding a lubed up finger in his a** as you are going down on him.  You can tell if he likes it by how hard he gets.  He may protest, but my guess is that he will love it and it will show by how hard he shots in your mouth!
BJF1Ip4Eaa	I'm know the feeling.<br>  If I were you, I would probably just get to know him more.<br>  After this he might either:<br>  See that you're a good friend and want to leave it at that.<br>  Or start to like you even more.<br>  But after you guys have become friends you will be comfortable talking and you can just tell him that you'd rather be friends.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ATrhSEF9aa	damn hun, i really wish i could help, i have the same problem myself...|`|a0YEcjv7aa	Ask someone like your friend to tell him that your not interested or you can just ignore him and i think he'll get the idea that your not interested...<br>  Hope this helps!|`|fb1ed3167a523260716234177b7983d1aa	tell him your gay, or say you have a boyfriend, or your saving yourself for marriage or just tell him to go away. You[ll break his heart no matter what you say, trust me on that|`|YyYBv5bzaa	If he's really likes you, then there will be no way of breaking it to him that you dont like him without hurting his feelings. But you can always be as nice as possible. Like tell him that hes nice and everything but you just dont find him to be your type.
YyYBv5bzaa	I would say to keep in touch with him. Either call him or email him. emailing him could be easier for you if your shy. dont let the friendship go because hes moving.|`|E3tG4eh1aa	Call him. Dont be pressured by the thought that u like him. Be friendly dont approach the problem thinking that hes ur boyfriend.|`|OgpqTthraa	You already know the answer to that.  <br>  <br>  Follow your heart.<br>  <br>  No matter how painful it is in the beginning, you'll look back and remember why you were so brave.|`|vTKjlENDaa	call him e-mail him any thing you can i was in the same place i was move away but i came back b/c i9 love her to

Maybe she does not trust you....maybe she also likes someone else.  If it's any of those 2 things then no amount of flowers & material things are going to change that.  Maybe she just wants to stay single and not be bothered with a relationship.|`|AA11375286	prove it on your end that you love and care for her,actions speak louder than words, tell her its okay to trust again..that you wont hurt her (AND MEAN IT)!|`|YyYBv5bzaa	talk to her about getting back together. see what she says.|`|c64740c814eeb52abef0f0a28bef454aaa	Sit her down, tell her how you feel, and see how she answers.

You say "faithful" lover.  Who can tell?  She may reunite with you, if the break up was due to your error, she may not ever fully trust you again, and all the flowers in the world won't fix that.  Only time can mend that old wound.
YyYBv5bzaa	emotionally dependent means that you get totally preoccupied with someone (bf or gf) and feel like you always have to be near them and you get lonely when you cant be with them. You have to be their only love and companion and you get jealous of the persons other relationships with other people like friends and stuff. And you feel like you have to have that persons approval before you do anything for yourself. You can avoid becoming emotionally dependent in a relationship by thinking for yourself and recognizing that you dont necessarily need the other person in order to be happy. Have your own opinions and respect that they have other relationships (friends and family) and stuff.

YyYBv5bzaa	i would end the relationship you have. you obviously dont have feelings for him anymore and that can be worse than breaking up with him. if he finds out that you dont like him anymore, but just stayed with him to keep from hurting his feelings, he would probably feel worse than if you just broke up with him.|`|fff4b1fd632620a47a1258ee50863ca5aa	have a threesome ---youll know which one you want then|`|BAKVpDT8aa	choose the one that you love, not the onther way round|`|5D1aUcq8aa	go for your soulmate. thats what i did and everything worked out fine. its important that you are happy and not miserable in a relationship|`|swHQMQf1aa	well maybe you could talk to your "true love" and try to get an idea about how he feels about you, maybe get a friend to help, if you think you have a good shot, then i'd suggest you follow your heart, its good to think of your current boyfriend's feelings, but what's the point if your neglecting your own...

NU6tPjLTaa	I have been in a situation (minus divorce) similar to yours: moving from a girl who i was not supposed to be with to another one who had witnessed the situation with many doubts.  My greatest recommendation to you is to only say as much as could serve her.  Don't feel like you should get your emotions all out there: that is a human instinct that is devoid of wisdom, and will only result in her being overly drawn in and you (possibly) dissapointing her or her being repelled.  Remember that you don't need anything else juggling on your plate right now... Stay friends until you have cleared and healed your marriage situation and the wounds that carries and then prepare to engage in a deeper friendship with her before you begin to get serious.  There are too many risks otherwise for her and yourself.  I was very sparing with expressing my emotions when I came to the second girl (who I am with now) and it paid off handsomely... It only allowed to emotions to grow intense and allowed her to make the decision about liking me totally on her own without a rush of good feelings.<br>  <br>  The best I can offer is this:<br>  Get out of the emotions and veiw the situation how you would if you were looking in on someone else not knowing how they felt.  That way you can make wise decisions without endangering the friendship you guys have (which is the base of any successful romantic one)<br>  <br>  I hope this may help you.<br>  Loche|`|ffARlPb2aa	I just like the fact that your not starting anything with her till you end your marriage that your currently in... I hope all works out for you|`|zyhQ713Uaa	Keep in mind that divorce is a very emotional time for all involved even if the relationship has been "over" for a while. First, you must make sure that it is really over. Depending on the number of years you have been together and other factors such as children born of the marriage, you may want to try to work things out first. If you decide that you really want out of the relationship, you then have other things to deal with like seperation of marital assets, spousal support, etc. Hopefully, you and your spouse will be able to come into an agreement as to all the issues involved because if you don't, it will cost you much more time and money than you ever anticipated. Now, as far as the woman you are interested in, I do feel that allowing yourself some time before enetering into another (serious) relationship is a good idea. The best thing to do is to be honest with this woman. For example, telling her that you hope to be more than friendly with her once you heal from the whole divorce process may be the best thing for both of you. You will know how she feels about you and whether she is interested in that way, which may save you a trip to a foreign country, and she will know how you really feel as she may be confused up to this point. The old cliche, "honesty is the best policy," is the one that applies to this situation my friend. Good Luck!|`|0YxaGsLfaa	I think you are thinking with the right mindset!|`|500f5cf207b839911cca33c8c0eaee7caa	Yeah you do need your space. And I think you need to let your friend know straight up so that you are not misleading her. If I were her and I liked you (more than in a friendly way) and if you told me those same things. I would probably assume that there was a chance with us.. <br>  <br>  Just be straight to the point with her and let her know that you are not ready for relationship. This way she doesnt feel misleaded in the end..

TH7f1AxQaa	When growing up I had a step dad, and he would tell my mom that he loved us, but we could tell that he didn't, he saw us as more of a burden then a benefit.

It takes two to tango and I'm sure she doesn't start ALL the arguments.|`|CH7v2jB5aa	You don't need an opinion specifically from women, but what you do need is conflict resolution skills.<br>  Read up on the topic. Buy a few books. Conflict resolution is indeed a SKILL, and both of you could use to improve your ability to discuss, debate, and disagree without the fights. Isn't it good to find out that there are things you can learn to help this situation? It takes the personal anger right out of the equation, and makes finding a solution a solvable process instead of hopeless and endless arguments. <br>  <br>  Read the books together. Discuss them just as you would in a classroom, (but more on your personal level of course). Reading these together and coming to understandings is a fine opportunity to bring you closer together instead of farther apart.<br>  For the immediate time, such as today when you get home: <br>  If your wife attacks you with a complaint as soon as you walk in the door: <br>  Listen quietly until she appears ready to listen to something you have to say. The first thing you should say is: I don't want to argue with you, our love is more important, let's see if we can find a way to fix this.<br>  Everytime you say that to a woman, she will pause and begin to listen to you. EVERYTIME! And it works both ways, and both men and women fail to use this simple approach.<br>  <br>  Next, don't get angry no matter what she says, understand that people say hurtful things when they feel hurt, that they are in fight mode, and that they are trying to rile you up to force you to join in a fight. Don't take the bait. If she's crying or hysterically yelling, do just the opposite, tell her that you love her and that you want to work this out.<br>  If you agree that you did something wrong, immediately say that you are sorry. Then begin a calm discussion with her, and never raise your voice. <br>  A lot of interrupting goes on with arguments. Try to break that habit entirely when arguing. If you are interrupted, let her, and wait until there is a long enough pause, and then ask her if you may speak now. <br>  These are just a few of the things that you can learn from books on the subject.<br>  You can together fix your methods and there is no reason to feel helpless here.<br>  I hope you follow up on the reading.<br>  I'd say good luck...but guess what? Luck isn't needed nor a  part of the skills of conflict resolution!|`|ILQ0fFjYaa	From a woman's perspective, I would like to know if the relationship still has love and affection left in it. If yes, then take your wife out for a dinner, surprise her with flowers...a sort of role play of a first date. If the sparks are still there, then try talking to some common & mature family/friend, or counseling. I understand you want to be a good father,but your son will always be your son, no one can ever change that. So, only you could be the best judge as to realise if your marriage is worth saving, is it just a phase or a repetitive cyclic occurence.|`|z2r1lW9saa	Stop fighting!  Fighting requires two people. If she starts up a fight, either walk away or just look at her, but don't fire back.<br>  You'll find that you'll fight alot less.  But, If you're incapable of controlling yourself, then maybe you should end it.
d3417e8466088cd5fdcb651298f5c735aa	It sounds like you may be jumping to conclusions here. Talk to him ask him about his concerns. Try to remain calm and just listen to him.  About you being sad, you should never define yourself through a relationship. Meaning you need to be your own person confident and secure. Never let another person sweat you like that. If thing do not work out be ready to charge him to the game and move on.|`|AA10883614	it is okay to be sad. then get over it and know this isnt the dude for you. it may not seem like you will have happier days without this dude but trust me, once your done grieving you will see the sunshine.|`|3d7d05b6fbc15669e82047e9094ee8deaa	OK, you need to ask yourself about what is going on right now. Ask yourself why he would say something like that. Start off by talking to him. Communication is key to a good working relationship. And just for the record, i dont' think he is giving up. If he was, he would've told you right then and there. If he would be trying to end it, he could be delaying it cause he thinks there is still hope. Quick, dont waste time, do what you can talk to him and ask him why he would say something like that, do it asap if you care about your relationship before he changes his mind. good luck :)|`|Ll8SQPkGaa	This is boy talk for "I need a break to clear my head"..<br>  I know it's scary, but alot of times (guys especially) don't realize what they have till it's gone.....If he doesn't treat you like crap, then give him his space.... go about your daily do's and if he returns in good manners, and you haven't moved on... then go from there.....<br>  Just don't beg, honey......

Live and let live.|`|tYrAQYgyaa	Taking advantage of a friends boyfriend even when shes cheating on him still does make you like her-A CHEAT.<br>  Are you sure you love this boy?<br>  Your friend yes did do wrong,you must realise though that the best way out of this is to be honest with your self.Ok ,do this-forgive yourself,forgive your friend back out on your new found relationship for a while until the matter is settled.<br>  Do you realise that if your relationship in future is on the rocks this guy can actually turn to another friend if yours?<br>  Friendship is precious,whom would you rather lose?<br>  Be the ultimate best of who you can be.Theres always a higher level.Don't judge yourself goodness through others mistakes youll never reach the higher heights of goodness.|`|vL3MxpNVaa	you should write a soap opera. wow i don't miss jr. sr. HS lol! people should refrain from "dating" until you're a sophmore at least, and more mentally mature, so this nonsense doesn't happen!  these people won't even be in your lives in a few years, don't put so much thought into stupid, nonsense.....sorry to be so blunt!
CSRtcXmHaa	i dont think you will look desperate at all.  if you have been together for that long and nothing has happend, why are you waiting...go for it, dont hold back. and yes, he could just be respecting you or he could be very shy or it could be for other reasons like he might be gay and just wants you there by his side as a cover.  who knows, but good luck|`|3xTFAamjaa	True|`|b985e1bb4dd7c02708ee4d73e11f0946aa	I would advise you against "forcing the pace" with him by making the first move. However, there's no harm in making it blatantly obvious that you want him to kiss you. In answer to your first question, yes, a long, non-sexual relationship is a good indicator that he is interested in you rather than your body.|`|5debee918420491ae93ce443dfcac6d1aa	make the first move|`|5paPd4qlaa	it's pretty true. if he wants your body only, he isn't waiting that long. no chance.<br>  <br>  you making the first move is hot.|`|b960a0531d7c6c1dd7dfe7d5d6c8b4eaaa	If he isn't trying to bed you, then there is a chance he is trying to gain your respect. He is trying to learn what you are like. Let sex come later. Enjoy your time together.<br>  <br>  Oh and if he is shy, don't force stuff onto him. Give him clear but not wholly obvious signs that you want to kiss. Do lean into him, to get his attention. He might be scared at first, but guide him into it and if you are successful, you may just have a very passionate and healthy kiss.|`|d5bd64efb7682148a6c0f51b553f4a48aa	No..... and yes. and no.|`|0t8C4d3Saa	I would assume so, I waited 2 years before I actually had sex with my gf. She opened up to me. I didn't want to force anything onto her you know? We've been together 4 years now.|`|24c288025fc8fb924072b321e01f0a6baa	It depends on what kind of society your lives are in. conservative religious, I might take him at his word... or even assume he's gay & looking for a beard. (cover wife)<br>  <br>  It's ok to make the first move. But not all guys are as excited about having sex as those American Pie kids are. respect his boundaries as you push forward with your wishes & desires to be closer to him physically.<br>  <br>   (And not all guys say that, I slept with my husband on our first date)|`|2634a6d9db3d0c9861c7e999767ea7ebaa	I can't stand shy people, and when it comes to sex, if he hasnt made ANY attempt in 4 months he must have low self esteem.  As for you making the first move, I don't know a single guy who doesnt think thats hot. Go for it|`|2jiBqNpuaa	I think that he loves you and not mind have sex with you. If he didn't want you he didn't to be with you for such a long time. Maybe he is very shy to do this things, or his duck not works, who knows. Try this if you love him! It will be great when in love with each other!!|`|eF9T1t5Paa	What is sex anyway? a man who respect you will not take you to bed  if you don't agree with him. there as still some guys out there who are still virgin and want to do it at the right time, right place and with the right person. love is not all about sex girl. cool down down and wait for the right time. don't push him. other guys if you push them they will think you are very desperate and you will sound so cheap and disorganized.<br>  forget about sex now!!!!! don't you fear of HIV/AIDS and STI'S??????|`|eo9MBNUpaa	You won't look desperate. He probably wants you to.
3f0f30290df1d9b27952ae1e68559da5aa	Well first how about try to think if you like her back and if you do act on that.|`|4baf34cf11544a1fbc151ce7cfc1572baa	1. if she flirts with you<br>  2. if she seems to be enjoying talking to you<br>  3. if she looks at you and you ask what and she says nothing and turns away.. that means she wants to kiss you.<br>  4. if you ask her out and she immediately says yes or sounds excited about it<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Do yourself the favor and eliminate any guessing. Just sit down with her and talk to her. Ask her about her feelings for you, and you tell her how you feel.<br>  There are many times as you get more into the dating scene that you will find that you may have read into a statement or gesture, and this will lead to a lot of confusion and misunderstandings.<br>  Avoid the heartache and headaches. Just ask.|`|SFEOOvadaa	she flirts|`|appgUonsaa	u should ask this girl? if she is really noice to u and not the other guys tat usually means someting or if she is super mean to u|`|gTwe8u8Daa	if she's different around you , but the same around everyone else, that's a big sign.  and if you ever look at her, and if she is turning her head away the second you see her, then she's probably being shy but likes you.|`|kzZLhnAVaa	by the way she acts or looks at you!!1
rV21NAavaa	I could write a book about how bad you getting ready to screw yourself over - literally pages and pages - but I'll stick to the question.<br>  <br>  1.  Nothing will be quick.  You're going to get a lot of heat from the INS and have to jump through a lot of hoops to prove that she's NOT just marrying you for US citizenship.  In your favor, Canada is one of the few countries where the citizens actually enjoy where they live.  I would recommend contacting the nearest branch of US Immigration and Naturalization services and asking them how to begin the process.<br>  <br>  2.  Be prepared to submit tax returns for, I'm guessing, the past three years.  Last time I checked, you need to make at least $25,000.00 a year in order to import a bride.  Once again, they want to make sure you can support her and she isn't here spounging off the system.<br>  <br>  3.  After you've jumped through all the INS hurdles - you would go down to your country clerk or Justice of the peace and get a traditional wedding license.<br>  <br>  But, once again, this will not be a quick process.  It will probably take about six months and cost a bit of dough.<br>  <br>  Also, the girl is completley playing you and you're making a terrible mistake but blah, blah, blah....you're not going to listen to me are you?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ae0a1812e3dac3f52269cc69f0e8a0f3aa	Please don't tell me you met her online and have never met her in person...<br>  <br>  If you want legal advice you need to speak to a lawyer. You know you can get people in trouble for giving you false legal advice if they aren't a lawyer?|`|fisHNMu4aa	first, make sure she's not using you for GREEN CARD issues.|`|j44s6mE3aa	Move to Canada...  It's a lot nicer than Arkansas, and you'll find it MUCH easier to emigrate there than to bring her here.<br>  <br>  More importantly, and regardless what you do, get yourself an English Grammar book, and study it.  And don't have any more kids.   Sheesh.

La distancia te hara mas bien, cierto es que los hijos ya forman un lazo, pero no te unen a ella, borra esa idea y daras otro paso hacia la recuperación. Te dare algunos consejos que yo segui, y que me ayudaron un poco, ojala pase lo mismo contigo.<br>  1.- Busca otro trabajo<br>  2.- Cada vez que la recuerdes, dite a ti mismo, alejate de mis pensamientos, yo merezco ser feliz.<br>  3.- Buscate un hobby, pintar por ejemplo, ve a un taller y relacionate con las personas que vayan, el tener gente que no tenga nada que ver con ella ni el trabajo es muy bueno pues al menos por un rato no la recordaras y nadie lo hara tampoco.<br>  4.- Reconoce que tu también tienes un poco de culpa, busca en el fondo de tu corazon que fue y perdonate por ello, si lo haces con conviccion poco a poco el rencor y la ira iran desapareciendo.<br>  5.- El rencor es fuerte pues sientes que tu hombria se da?o por que prefirio a otro, asi que cambia ese pensamiento y mejor piensa que no supo valorarte.<br>  6.- Trata de calmarte, ve las cosas como son, no eres el primero ni seras el unico. Se objetivo y piensa que no puedes seguir asi, la mujer de tu vida puede estar al lado y no la vas a ver si sigues con esa actitud de perdedor.<br>  7.- Toma de nuevo las riendas de tu vida, nada es para siempre, el tiempo calma el dolor, pero solo nosotros lo borramos de nuestro corazón. <br>  8.- No pierdas la fé, nunca, por ningun motivo, el amor llegará más pronto de lo que te imaginas en cuanto más pronto hagas lo posible por curarte.<br>  Te deseo la mejor de las suertes y te mando un abrazo.<br>  Por cierto bienvenido al club, luego te mando la membrecia.

jBslLP64aa	I would bet money that he is interested in you, but has a fear of rejection. The next time he tells you about an event that you want to go to, casually drop a hint like "call me and let me know when you're going, maybe we could go together. You're basically telling him that if he asks, you'll say yes. Hopefully that will help him get past the fear of rejection.|`|79k2MrBlaa	maybe he's not the "asking" out type.<br>  you never know that any guys are doing that front of you and behind your back, he does the same thing to other girls|`|94efaed19fa321c161b59283358028f9aa	he probably just doesn't want to get rejected by you or he is shy

I talked to a lawyer once who advised that the day you cease to live together you are legally separated.  <br>  <br>  Are you looking to formalize temporary visitation and support issues until you either reconcile or divorce?

pVnUhYLQaa	Oh never mind, I expected to see a pic of an impressive black guy.|`|NkHU8tEJaa	Of course it's legal. You live in his house and he's paying for your school, so he owns your sorry ***.<br>  <br>  If you don't like it, move out and work part-time while you're in school. Or  quit school, work for a bit, save up some money and then go back.|`|1xr6T6h0aa	Well, it IS legal.  He does not HAVE to pay for your schooling, he chooses to.  <br>  <br>  You have a choice to get a job, leave and not have your dad pay for schooling.  No one is FORCING you to take the money.|`|qJCgI0Paaa	If you get a job, he'll kick you out? That makes no sense at all. I agree he has authority over you, but I don't get why he would want so much for you to stay unemployed.

(drop her!)|`|eSDpEwhyaa	Well I'm a woman and would hate to have a bf with dogs in his bed when we are trying something out. I like dogs but they need a limit. If she doesnt get the point of the dogs let her know in a kind way. And if she is smart enough she will know its time for her dog/s to be away for that time. If not well find some one else or try telling her again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :-)|`|gekVXz9eaa	ugh thts sorta strange dosent ur bed stink?!?!|`|ooRxjLXcaa	weird question.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	LOL awweeee
3h8JmFBMaa	I think if he liked you he would initiate the idea of meeting up, i don't know if he has or not? or other hand maybe he is shy and nervous about meeting you as i expect you are towards meeting him. I wouldn't get too worried about it untill the 2 of you have actually met, as after all how can you tell if you've really fallen for him with out face to face interaction. If you're confident and fun when you do meet there's no reason why he won't suddenly (if currently not already) feal the same.<br>  good luck|`|ooRxjLXcaa	yeah, you should totally meet him and see how it works from there. <br>  <br>  he might like you too. <br>  <br>  don't give up just yet. :]<br>  <br>  -Missy.|`|brNSIT5baa	he will be completely different, i mean, on facebook, im a spontaneous, funny, confident girl. in real life im painfully shy. always remember, you can create who ever you wana be over the internet. i know thats not the answer you wanted lol|`|2iigkuUKaa	personally i dont think meeting up on the net is a good idea, but if you think you can trust this guy, then meet up and check out what hes really like and get it going from there|`|900c79d3b0d2f128c2a0a222200c9d73aa	Always take someone with you, if you plan to meet up with this dude. Never go alone.|`|3s2wmhhPaa	i wouldnt recommend meeting, but if you do, don't have too high expectations|`|QC9iSB2Faa	If you defiantly know he is not an old man =P , then meet up with him and see how it goes =) <br>  Follow your gut instinct, but don't let yourself be sucked in if you notice he is like it with loads of other girls often.<br>  <br>  Go out with him in a group first. Watch how he acts with others. <br>  =) Good Luck.|`|d64BwGdoaa	i think you already tknow the answer to this one.<br>  you said he talks to other girls the same way? well guess what, he's probably just playing you. there is a small chance he could be serious. but i highly doubt it. this is a typical male thing to do.|`|hieS3Toyaa	Yeah, it's pretty obvious he likes you and thinks your cute.<br>  All single guys flirt with girls casually, until he really gets to know one :)<br>  And if he turns out as a jerk - so what?<br>  As least you tried...you'll regret not meeting up with him if you don't do it.
pVnUhYLQaa	No dude, she's not interested at all. Let that one go.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't know where these people who are saying she's interested are from, but trust me, she's NOT INTERESTED. She turned you down because of "class" (Lame excuse, she has no social life? class 24/7?), then made no effort to give you an alternate time. Then when you tried to make an alternate time, she's just says "rain check". And now she's avoiding you like the plague. She's avoiding you becuse she doesn't no how many ways she can say "no".<br>  <br>  Even if she did want you to chase her (Which she doesn't). Like you said, you don't play games, and I agree with you on that. Screw that game sh!t. You asked her out, she didn't accept, the end. If she wants you, she knows you're interested, let her come get you. (But she doesn't want you)|`|zx8cVDqIaa	That good thing is she never said no, which means she never answered. Maybe you do have to run after her. You'll know if shes not interested or not.|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Maybe you need to ask if she has a boyfriend. Sounds to me like she likes you but obviously doesn't want to lead you on because that wouldn't be right!|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	No, i don't think she's interested in you on a boyfriend level.. Maybe she just wants to be friends.|`|FLPRFTccaa	when you are playing tag.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	when she lets you give her a dirty sanchez.....|`|b7yvPsiVaa	She dosn't want you to chase her. The only thing that gives that away is that she runs away after class. Anything else may have implied she wants you to keep trying, but not that. <br>  Trust me, I'm the kind of girl who likes guys to chace her once in a while. But her running away after class is a huge sign that it's not what she wants. Plus, it dosn't seem like she is the least bit flirty or that she ever teases you a bit. So no. Stay friends and maybe later, but not now. If you keep trying she WILL get really creeped out.|`|HtLpHUqqaa	when she starts to twirl her hair she likes you; )|`|NvQETTJKaa	she doesnt want you to chase her. trust me.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	she probably thinks its all awkward..<br>  i mean thats what i would do if i thought it was awkward.<br>  sorry|`|Nz9BU7iXaa	when girls do that they deff want u to chase after them
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	take a vacation, spend a few nights in a hotel. the change in location and environment might help. read up on erotica and techniques that might spark your imagination. (look up literotica). watch porn together. take supplements that increase libido<br>  <br>  the real solution of course is to communicate with him. tell him that you want to have better sex and you want to be more into it but youre not sure how, he will be more than enthusiated to do anything to make sure he's the best lover he can be. all you have to do is meet him half way and reward his efforts. it happens in marriage often, but stick it out and things will work out|`|kbz5S3waaa	It may be a hormonal imbalance. Have you talked to your doctor?|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You are probaly being weighed down by day to day life things. <br>  Try to take a weekend off, just the two of you. Go to a hotel somewhere not to far from home, get a room for the weekend and stay in with each other.

I just want to say "good for you" that you are addressing the problem.  I've heard that doctors can prescribe some type of hormone pills.  I told my SO that, but she doesn't see it as an issue.  She doesn't want sex...and we don't have any sex and that seems fine to her.  Thank goodness there are women like you who take an interest in sex and realize that something is missing and want to get it back !!  Rock On !!!|`|xQn3rR6Naa	that will carry you through the rest of your life. The honeymoon phase is over and it happens to everyone. That is why people cheat because they are looking for that rush that comes with new love and the fantasy that surrounds it all. Now you have to get about the Business of making the kind of memories|`|SHARt1k3aa	Make it about you.  Don't make it about your husband.  Make up fantasies in your head, watch a little porn... do something to make you sexual again.  It's so fun!  LOL.  No, really, maybe you need to learn what turns you on before you realize that you enjoy sex.|`|g71m3S9Naa	Do you not want to have sex period or is it that you don't want to have sex with your husband?<br>  <br>  These are two very different items to address.<br>  <br>  If you don't wnat to have sex period then something is going on with mentally or physically.  It could be a chemical imbalance such as harmones or something like that.<br>  <br>  If it is you husband then that is something that you will have to decide to either walk away or suffer through.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Some husbands really don't feel like going to a lot of trouble just to make their wives feel sexy.  They do the least they can get away with, just so long as they get satisfaction themselves. <br>  <br>  Some wives retaliate.  They say, "Oh, you're hurting me!" and make him stop in the middle of things.  Or they kick him overboard just when he's getting to the finish line.  These tactics seldom help. <br>  <br>  If you are in good health, not overweight, not overly burdened with work or worry, this is solvable.  My advice would be, don't criticize him.  Just show appreciation when he happens to do something that pleases you in bed.  Little by little he will begin to want that to occur more often.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Are you taking birth control? Or any meds? Sometimes that can affect your sex drive. Also, for some people you have to be stress free and not have anything weighing on your mind. Try doing something with your husband that is relaxing, like dinner, or a movie, or a night out. Sometimes getting away from the normal routine can help.<br>  Good luck!|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	The most possible reason for losing interest in sex is that you may not feel good yourself. You may find your husband attractive but do you look at yourself the same way? And it could also be your sex drive, try kegel exercises, proven to enhance your sex drive.|`|YMXdE0Vzaa	Try something new with him!<br>  Explore the act instead of just5 making getting it over with the goal.<br>  Extend the foreplay and make it more interesting.<br>  Or I guess you could try an (Oh I'm gonna spell this wrong) aphrodesiac.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	Good general health,and excercise are essential.Then make an effort to get back in motion.You will find you want it more.Trust me.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	oral contraceptions cld be a reason though sounds like may also be emotional.if thats th case then u need to find out what in ur life is getting u down|`|dpCsTIEIaa	If you're on birth control that can cause it.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	You are in the early stages of male manipulation.  You are just coming into terms.  Soon you will grow to enjoy this non-sexual feeling and the power it commands for you.  You can easily say "not tonight honey" and you don't feel bad about it.  <br>  <br>  Eventually you will build out your repertoire of manipulative games.  You will learn to vary your excuses, ask for things you want, make him do stuff, and otherwise just generally enjoy that he is frantically trying to "get you in the mood".<br>  <br>  It's normal for a woman to start hating sex.  It's all part of the tools you are equipped with.  He has a penis, you have... you know... other abilities.  Like a magic wand.|`|1g82Cbs2aa	Have you thought of talking to your husband and letting him know how you feel? That way both of you could start trying new things together to make you feel more in the mood. Try role playing or massage or just seduction/romantic things. Sometimes we also let our everyday life get in the way of our love lives so don't let stress ruin your sex life.|`|j7tu2hXIaa	I do agree with the other ansewers you have recieved, but, don't let this be another thing to stress you out.  There is a product out now that will give you a little jump start. It is called Love Motion #9, you can purchase it at Party Gals.com.  I know several people that have used it and are very glad they did.  Hope this is a help to you.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	Spice it up with toys or bring other people into the bed. What turns you on? Let him know. He might be bored also....|`|6iDjNKxHaa	Watch porn
JoX8D638aa	I think you should seriously consider leaving for good. This relationship is unhealthy, and may even result in you getting physically hurt if you stay.<br>  You are still young, but that means that you have time to find somebody better and make a fresh start, or to spend some time getting to know yourself again.<br>  Your husband is exhibiting very manipulative behaviour, and the best thing is just for you to leave and not deal with that anymore.<br>  Pushing, holding you down and threatening to kill himself are all his way of trying to be powerful over you, and make you feel guilty so that you don't leave. Personally, I think he is being very selfish and it is completely unfair to you.<br>  Ask yourself if you can imagine spending your entire life like this. I'm <br>  sure you can't, and you shouldn't have to.<br>  I think that if you stay, you'll only end up hating him and resenting yourself.<br>  Good luck.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	If you are asking "Is my marriage over", then you already know. You are just looking for someone to agree with you. You are young so you can start over. Let him have everything in your house that he wants. Move on and start fresh. Good luck.|`|rQ7dI88Maa	I suggest professional counseling. If your husband doesn't want to, then you do. But making a marriage work takes two. You could also separate for awhile to see how each of you feel. His violence would drive me away.|`|6iDjNKxHaa	try counseling|`|0de60a89e9f7e2a8a9c90ff78512aa34aa	You need Conselor for your marriage. He also has to go to some anger clases because it seems that he gets angry too easy. Your both very young and the first year its always hard. Your fighting probably for nothing. I want you to see the movie "Fireproof" with Kirk Cameron together and maybe he will see and try to make thing work. I don't believe in divorce but if its an abusive relationship and nothing else can be done. Maybe sometimes its best to seperate.|`|V2CYkJCCaa	I think it would be good for you to take time for yourself to reflect on what it is you really want.  If it doesn't include him or the things he is putting you through then I would move on without him.  He sounds pretty intense I was in an abusive relationship for over 2 years and it started out as minor but alarming stuff like your saying and got worse and worse until I was in the hospital and he was in jail.  Just ask yourself deep down if it is meant to be we all really know the answer deep down we just sometimes need a push or something to transition our mind from being so bummed over a break up.  I hope this helps! :)|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	Yes, your marriage is over. Get out while you are still young and don't have any children. All the physical abuse, (yes, it is abuse), will only get worse and if you have children together, he will abuse your children. He needs professional help. Cut your losses, learn from your mistakes, and don't pick another man just like him to get involved with. When you divorce, do something nice for yourself. You deserve it!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think you need to be kind to yourself and get out of this destructive marriage.  He threatens suicide, and one day may act upon it.  He also pushes you around and that will probably escalate one day and he might hurt you.  It sounds like he needs mental help, and that is not a cruel statement but a true one.  He is depressed, and abusive.  He is not supportive of you.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Honestly, it doesn't sound good. "Pushing" is a REALLY bad sign for the future too. For me it would be over, but everyone is different and really only you can answer this.|`|l85gvsEmaa	You are so far past over that it's not even funny.  There is no amount of counseling to chisel away the issues that you two are facing.  There's no kids involved, at least none indicated, so there's really nothing holding you back.  Get out before something terrible happens to either of you.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	Some things are hard to learn...one is how to argue constructively.  You need to both learn that.  There's nothing wrong with disagreeing, but you shouldn't ever have to scream or push.<br>  <br>  You need some "pre marital" counseling.  You need to identify what your goals are and what you want from marriage.  You need to learn how to argue constructively.  You need to decide you want to work together, and not be at odds.<br>  <br>  No one stays IN love forever.  That's when you're young, and not wore out trying to support yourself, and you have energy..then you feel IN love.  When you're tired, and things are rough..sometimes you don't even know if you LIKE them any more.  This is all perfectly normal.  Heck sometimes you won't know if you LIKE yourself.<br>  <br>  You need to unlearn the bad habits you've gotten into, come to some meeting of the minds, and learn new habits.  You can make the marriage work if you want to...it won't be easy and you'll have to work together...but you can.<br>  <br>  Up to you.|`|TPhIWWniaa	I would normally say to try not to divorce but when there's violence involved it is best to leave, you don't know when things will escalate.  You said that he used to hold you and scream in your face, that's a way to intimidate you; now he's threatening to kill himself, that's a manipulation tactic, he wants you control whether you leave him or not.  <br>  Please know that every person is in control of their own lives, take control of yours as you are young and you have your whole life ahead of you.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Guess where the next punch is going land, and its not going to be in the wall.   This guy has all the signs of an physical abuser.   Don't be another statistic.   Yes you were too young to catch the signs before you got married, but now you know better.   Get out of that relationship while you still can, without scars, emotional nor physical.    What is keeping you both together?  And do not let his intimidation about killing himself stop you.   That is the top excuse these abusers use to keep a hold on their prey.   He is with you because he feeds off you due to his ill character, but you should take action, unless you are so insecure that you need to stay with him.    Good luck
JhvqUvlsaa	LOL it would depend on which one; the one who is my bestie would get a swift kick in the backside and I'd tell him to knock it off.<br>  <br>  Seriously though ask him to please stop cuz it's really annoying. If he's your friend he'll be cool about it.|`|MyxJ3REhaa	Most whiners enjoy whining only when they have an audience.  Has this guy always been whiney around you, or has it increased as of late?  If it has increased, perhaps he is feeling that you are a "safe" person on which to unload all of his grief.  Beware, though: this is not usually true "grief" –?people like that really do derive some pleasure from putting on a whiney show.<br>  <br>  There are a few tactics that work: 1) try to change the subject, or turn the object of his whininess into something light and humorous.  Often being able to find humor in vexing situations can diffuse the urge to whine.  2) See if he really is trying to reach out for help.  If you feel that under the veil of whininess is a deep problem, see if you can make parents, coworkers, or mutual friends aware – whatever the case may be –?so as to help intervene.  3) You might need space.  When he lashes out at other things, he might not be satisfied with your friendship, but may not wish to tell you.  If your relationship is strained, sometimes taking a break can help.  It sounds like if you see him "every day of your life" you might also be looking for a chance to take a break for a bit as well.<br>  <br>  I have had friends that have fit in all three of these scenarios.  I myself can be a whiner when I choose to.  The best thing to do for a whiner is not to dismiss them, but do not let them rule you with their black cloud.  They do not want your sympathy –?they want power over you emotionally.  Do not give it to them.  Give them the support to see their problems and the strength to resolve them, but do not fix their issues for them.  They whine because they feel powerless; let them know they are powerful and they will stop whining.|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Can you act? Do the same thing one day and try not to laugh whilst doing it. See if he gets the resemblance. If not, at least you had fun With it. But, in all seriousness, if it bothers you, tell him and be gentle. He should be receptive.

But I know that's not what you're really looking for.  To me, every individual has their own personal boundaries of what they will & won't accept in a r'ship.  So, if the person they're dating constantly oversteps those boundaries, then perhaps it's time for that person to end the r'ship.  I'll give you an example:  one of my big boundaries is being honest - that's just a requirement for me.  I want to know that my guy is the same honest guy who has integrity whether i'm with him or not.  I'm married to a wonderful man but when I was single, if I had ever gone out with a guy who constantly lied or seemed shady, then I would not have stayed with him.  <br>  <br>  Every woman has to decide for herself what her boundaries are.

6p35nRLUaa	you can't do much..<br>  I hate my mums husband to.. she wants me to say he's my step-dad but it isn't gonna happen...<br>  <br>  I left as soon as I could..<br>  <br>  I mean I am 17,18 in Oct..<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are but I can tell what I did...<br>  <br>  First- my mum was single,but is a massive ***** so I moved out with my dad, only because I am old enough to decide who I live with...<br>  <br>  Second- I moved back in because my dad bounces form girl to girl<br>  <br>  Third- I moved out with my BF about 3 months ago and my mum said nothing.. she chose him over me..<br>  <br>  so my point is if you are 15, 16 or 17 you can emancipated.. it cost somewhat, but you become a legal adult..<br>  <br>  you have to have your own home (apartment will work fine)<br>  you have to be able to support yourself fully<br>  <br>  there are answers about Emancipation on here as well..<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  and believe me when I say I know EXACTLY how you feel<br>  <br>  Much luv<br>  Ally|`|0sWvgjuIaa	Hello i know what you mean i went thru the same thing my story was a bit different though and as i got older i started to understand why it will take time in the meantime try to get you and your mum alone outside of the house and tell her how you feel and your concerns if it falls on deaf ears start packin and move on your mum will realise eventually what she has done and it will be her loss not yours you deserve better|`|625c0240c0068a0dde538b692fba47c1aa	well i know how you feel i used to have a step-dad and he treated me different than my sister and it really made me mad sometimes to the point where i did want to go with my real dad too just like you but you should never wish death on someone but you should tell your mom how you feel and she should tell her husband that something needs to change because it is hurting you.......or maybe you should move with your dad for a while so you can figure things out and your mom will get the point that something needs to be done about the situation.|`|AA11539783	Looks like you have an a$$ hole for a step dad, sorry. I say put up with him for a little longer and be cool with your mom. She is the one you have to work out the deal of staying with your real dad permanently. So, ignore or just keep your relationship with the a$$ at a minimum and keep in touch with your real dad at a maximum and soon you will be happy. Who knows maybe I'll see you guys here in California sometime. Later duder!|`|mGnwKCHVaa	Because you aren't his real child. You should try to spend time with him and find hobby's together this way he won't see you as oh look it's not my child. <br>  <br>                                                 *~BOO~*|`|mJd0jpi1aa	wow lol well i sorta kno how u feel cuz i hav a step dad also nd we dont exactly get along all the time lol but try to talk 2 him or something... sometimes i feel like my dad favors my lil sis but i kno deep down that he really does love me. Its just that me nd him r both hard headed nd we dont always understand eachother..|`|wBf7DyH3aa	I'm so sorry about all this! I know what you mean, my friend has a step mom and she is just like your step dad. If my friend makes a mistake, she is called out on it but her step mom makes the same mistake later and doesn't apoligize for it and doesn't care. I think maybe you should talk to your mom and family about it. You say he doesn't say sorry for his mistakes, so maybe you can tell your mom specifically when he makes a mistake and doesn't apoligize. That may help her to realize what you are talking about. But sometimes your family doesn't listen, and if they don't, then do you have someone else you can live with...? Like your real dad, maybe? I would try to find some other place to live if this is a serious problem and it is really affecting you. Another thing that can help is maybe talking to your step dad about it. Maybe he will listen to what you have to say and you can spend time with him for a day and tell him how you feel. Sometimes adults will listen if they see what they are doing wrong, and maybe you step dad doesn't realize he is wrong yet. You can also talk to your friends about this, that may make you feel better. I always try to help my friend when her step mom is being mean. If it is really stressing you out, maybe you can pick up some new activites, like a sport or yoga, because they help you relax. I don't know if this answer helps but I hope it does and I hope everything works out 4 you! =)

jQgfcOa6aa	During your marriage, how was this guy? I mean has he talked to you about it? Did he have various relationships?None? It's important to know, because you will understand more about the way he reacts with women. Also, if you want to know really if he cares, just try and test him. Disappear from his life for a week or two and then sit back and wait to see if he calls you, if he is worried. If he doesn't, then he really is not interested in you dear. Even better, because you don't want another blue story in your love life, right? If though he does come back to search for you during the time you are not contacting him, then this tells you something. That he cares about you and he wants you in his life. And that probably with your divorce and the distance and the fact you were apart for all this time, he is probably trying to get used to this new situation and is taking his time, something I advise you try too. Don't rush too much. After a divorce and a marriage ending so badly, you need some time with yourself. To understand who you are, and what you want from your life. If you really like him and he likes you too, trust me, it IS going to happen!|`|9vpicx39aa	If he really likes you he would be the first to call you and would be at your side during this time. As soon as you met up again he would of made a move. I think you not waste your time. Try meeting other guys and dating, but if this guy really wanted to be with you he would of made the move already, by that I mean try to date you.|`|d17LiR8Aaa	2 things...<br>  you recently got divorced so he maybe giving you some distance so you can straighten out your life a bit.<br>  <br>  second, you live kinda far which means he;s unsure how it would work.<br>  <br>  my advice you talk to him and tell him how you feel.  you may learn he may want to be with you...maybe hes unavailable...or he may have realized that during the past four year you were with your husband he discovered that there are qualities in you that he doesnt like.  You will always be in his heart because he cares about you but he may not want to be with you.|`|xjfLwGRcaa	whaoh can't really say coz, he might be the uncourageous type or the timid guy, all u have 2 do is give this guy a double chance coz if he hits it, oh my u guys are really gonna be on fire, he might luv &care 4 u beyound expectation.|`|28e0c0f430bed21c8a227b061b9514a1aa	you are wasting your time peirod. hes using you and just keeping you around till he finds something he feels is better i hate men that do that but they do some women do it also. just get rid of him and leave and find someone who is honest.|`|uz0n8fRIaa	I'd say to forget about it.

It's a cold world out there referring to men rather.  If she's good at controlling her emotions and wants to live the moment to forget her past love, just be smart and think twice before you do anything.  A woman should always take her pride, dignity, and respect into consideration.  ALWAYS!!!

vUwFw1vQaa	You need to sit down and talk with her.  If you just want sex right now, maybe a relationship isn't the best thing.  If you end it good it leaves an opening to return in the future when you feel like commiting.  She may love you, but if you're having second thoughts you should tell before it goes further and could possibly hurt her more.|`|pcp1DnEwaa	Quit whining and go buy some porn.|`|uYRa8wczaa	Use your hand, im sure your girl already does.|`|3ysCgBuUaa	If I crack the hidden code in your question, I would say that she is probably picking up on your ambivalence about the relationship.  She has told you she thinks you only want her for sex and that you don't respect her.  It almost sounds like that one night stand that never went home syndrome. The "age difference" isn't significant, maybe you are just less mature than her and are wanting out of the relationship.  She is sensing that and holding out on what you want most because she isn't getting what she wants most.  Women tend to do that.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  You probably still don't want a serious relationship and she does.

By this I mean having kids, useing drugs, drinking.  Enjoy being young while ya can.  Don't grow up just yet.|`|I0aLYnveaa	why would u have sex w/ a 19 year old thats kinda stupid to me but life choices...stick with peeps ur age or a year older or younger!|`|LqUFFIATaa	no absolutely not, i thinks that is illegal in every other state for a reason!!!!  when she is 17, go for it!|`|teY4lDMCaa	NO SORRY AS HE IS A MAN AND SHE IS STILL A CHILD !!|`|UeNOqP1aaa	I faithfully believe in the ideal that age has nothing to do with feelings, affection and love, so I will say that it is perfectly okay. But again, make sure you know what you are doing. Going into a relationship for a bad reason isn't good at any age be it 12 or 20. If you really want to be in this kind of relationship, then go ahead. Also you mentioned about sex. If sex is what you want from this relationship, tread carefully. PA's are just itching to press charges against anyone they can for statuary rape.|`|ZqcJ9Qekaa	ok parents might disagree with this but it is ok as lond as they use a condom.lol.just make sure thire parents don't find out then everything will be ok.|`|clqo2sfQaa	The male is over 18 years of age, and the girl is a minor..

0257d63f2ad2a28173df5b7b66b6909aaa	Well, what was the reason for doing it?  Do you secretly like him?  Do you kiss EVERY guy friend on the cheek or was he the only one?<br>  <br>  It really depends on what your normal, every day behavior is.  If this is an isolated event, if I were your bf, I'd be wondering why he was so special and why you decided to kiss him (even if it IS just on the cheek).  I don't know if I would consider it cheating, but I definitely wouldn't trust you with that "friend" anymore and would probably become a lot more aware of what you are doing and who you are doing it with.  What if he kissed some "friend" of his on the cheek, yet didn't kiss people goodbye on a regular basis?  I have a feeling you'd be pissed.<br>  <br>  But if you kiss everyone on the cheek, no biggie.|`|9224e8b748564d6e1de3380f08bb6c43aa	Of course not, as long as it was innocent. I kiss my best guy friend on the cheek all the time... he kisses me back, and he has a gf. Some friends are just close enough for that... but it is certainly not cheating.|`|AA10384772	Nope, not at all. Don't worry =))|`|AA10926354	Nope...|`|jJc99nHcaa	No way, dont stress it|`|yDlEniF4aa	well reverse it say you walked in on your man getting a kiss on the cheek from a little hottie friend of his leaving town, it would only be cheating on something of that small of a scale if you or both of you meant something behind it. i would say no,|`|zCVnaqyAaa	No its not bad...

And just maybe someday you will meet. (:|`|V21e5lFtaa	Yes you will. <br>  Almost any girl can have lots of "boyfriends" if they are slutty about it, but that's not what you really want. <br>  Take your time.  Work on being friends with guys, and it's inevitable that at some point you will have the option to take it further, and it will be more natural.

It will come to you when you least expect it.. also it couldn't hurt to play a little more hard to get. I mean putting all your attention and energy into someone that isn't noticing is just a waste. High school boys are idiots anyway.|`|882f7UTKaa	Be patient and try not to let it bother you. Trust me, I've been in your shoes.  I didn't get my first real boyfriend until I was 19 (i'm 20 now) or my first kiss. (I wasn't going to kiss just ANYONE). I'm the girl who becomes best friends, with my best friend's boyfriend.  I'm the girl who all the guys see as just a friend.  Then, I met my boyfriend when I literally least expected it. And I think thats mainly because I wasn't even LOOKING for a guy. My friend's are the types who think that they can't live without a guy in there life.  And I'm quite the opposite. I met my boyfriend in the HOSPITAL. Who does that? But it happened, and I didn't expect it at all. <br>  <br>  Just be patient and remember, its the guys who are missing out on you.  Not you missing out on them. <br>  |`|25z17HCoaa	Sometimes things come at their own pace. The right guy will come along! Don't worry, don't constantly think you'll never get one!!

iOZrX59Jaa	Attendance at a wedding has nothing to do with sending a thank you for a gift.  It isn't necessarily tacky to mention the amount; however, you could state what you will be using the gift for -- helping the two or you purchase things for your home or if you used it to do something fun on your honeymoon, etc. or you could simply thank them for their generosity.  You can also take a look at Emily Post's website.  She is the leading (American) authority on proper etiquette.|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I didn't write the amounts of any cash gifts from my wedding.

We are saving it and plan to put the money towards a down payment on a house." or "We were able to upgrade this or that on our honeymoon."<br>  <br>  I think it's just nice to acknowledge their generosity.

Don't think you can change someone to make a relationship work.  You can't.<br>  <br>  3. Keep separate bank accounts. I will never do that again EVER!!|`|jNtkhOTVaa	I've been married, divorced, and remarried... so you get six answers from me!<br>  <br>  Advice from what used to be a bitter divorced person:<br>  <br>  1. Spend at least a year getting to know someone before you consider marriage.  That's usually the breaking point for them to show their true colors if they were acting like someone they weren't.<br>  <br>  2. Know that YOU are the main source of your happiness.  Don't expect others to make you happy.<br>  <br>  3. Don't bring kid's into a marriage that you know is unstable.  It is not fair to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  Advice from a now happily married lady:<br>  <br>  1. Communication is the key.  Talk about everything.  Turn off the TV, Sit down to dinner and just talk about your day or whatever is on your mind.<br>  <br>  2. Pick your battles.  Stand firm on the important things but don't waste your time fighting about the small things.  Life is too short.  Time is too precious.<br>  <br>  3. Don't go to bed angry - A bit over stated and yet still true.  |`|5rn4bgIoaa	i agree with brunette. communication, always be honest, respect , trust, being faithful is important. what my husband and i do, is we take each other on "dates" 1 day i will invite him, next time he invites me. we organise baby sitters, then spend time together, just the 2 of us, we always tell each other we love each other, that's important|`|Icr6IIyYaa	how about advice from an unhappy married person that wants a divorce?<br>  <br>  1: never rush into a relationship <br>  <br>  <br>  2: take time to know one another (longer than a year)<br>  <br>  <br>  3:don't give up on your dreams and goals for a man who seems to care<br>  <br>  <br>  hows that for advice?|`|7IPDyLoBaa	Always Communicate<br>  Always stay faithful<br>  Always be honest.|`|gMcsEiuuaa	I am a divorced lady I was 23 years old when i first got married and 28 when I divorced.I was not mature enough to handle the responsibilty of a marriage and ended up  hurting a very,very good man .So my advice to anyone that is thinking about getting married make sure you are responsible as well  mature  enough to handle ALL the responsibilities that comes along with being married.|`|sIL7H8RBaa	I'm happily married.<br>  <br>  1)  Talk about things WHEN they happen - don't let things bottle up so much that they all overflow at once.<br>  <br>  2)  When you get married, marry someone you can talk to.  Years from now, all of the other stuff won't matter because you will be laughing and talking together long after any beauty fades.<br>  <br>  3)  Learn to think outside yourself without losing yourself.  There are now two people to think of - a family - whereas before you were on your own.  Take care to take care of your spouse, but don't neglect yourself because it can foster resentment later on.

Maybe you should take a closer look at this guy friend.  Maybe your boyfriend is not such a jerk and the guy friend is a threat to him.  Just why are you such good friends with a guy that you would risk your relationship just to include him in a trip I am certain your boyfriend envisioned as including only two, with no third wheel guests.  I think you are going to have to make a choice  your guy friend or your boyfriend.|`|uqT178pWaa	you would be very smart not to bringyour other guy friend because your boyfriend shows that he is jealous of him and that might be a problem for the both of you
uBssj3Znaa	It is normal that you are feeling this way, whether you were aware of it or not, losing your virginity really messes everything up. Most people do it for the first time with someone they have been dating and are in love with, not just some random guy, or friend in your case. <br>  <br>  You gave him something you can never give back or share with anyone else, and he got what he wanted from you, as piece of ***. It sucks but take it as a learning experience and the next time you have sex, do it with someone you truely love and care about. |`|AA10024734	Well for a girl we always think of our first time as really special and no matter what we will always keep a soft spot for that first guy, so what you are feeling for him is normal even if you didn't expect to feel anything for him afterwords. <br>  <br>  The problem is that most guys don't feel the same way that we do, it could be that he slept with you because he thought you didn't want anything more than that and if you have given him some indication that you want more he is uncomfortable, or it could be that he is just a jerk and isn't worth your time or energy. <br>  <br>  I say if he is ignoring you and being a jerk you need to move on and find someone worth your time, and not someone who will sleep with you and then walk away.

Ab5S6bxaaa	by the way thy acted I wouldn't trust them. they acted immaturely like you said, for that reason, and with her not apologizing, I wouldn't trust them. If they are your friends, would they do that to you?? I don't think they should be your friends. I think you should try and make different friends, take  break from amana* and everyone...maybe you'll find a new best friend =]<br>  i don't think you should block her..just don't write back..like I said, take a break from them.

But don't completely ignore them - that just brings in more problems. What makes it worse is to stop people teasing you you have to cry, that doesn't seem to show they're good friends. Maybe you should not hang out with them as much as you usually do, give them some space and make them realise how much they value you as a great friend!<br>  Hope I helped and Good Luck!|`|7EcdsRCcaa	sounds like they were just in a funny mood and you weren't up for it. would you have found it funny if you didn't have problems? let it go for your friends birthday and if it still bothers you talk to her about it. If they continue to be silly about it just be straight with them. If they still wont respect what your saying go and have fun with people who will. Hope it works out xXx|`|7k4Vt7BBaa	i think they are basicaly immature and silly no they aint real friend. real friends are trustable.. i wouldnt tell them anything incase they say something to some one else then everyone will find out i would find new friends and stay away and show them you dont need them in your life and show them you can have a laugh and joke without them|`|DT0y4x0eaa	Okay first off, I understand that you are extremly upset, and it is always hard when people you think are your friends are makeing fun of you.  Its not easy to take.  I dont know how old you are but from the fact that you are in school and having this sort of argument I would imagine Grade 7 or 8?  Your going to have to deal with these kinds of situations all the time.  Amanda and Frankie were not very nice, however that doesnt mean they arent your friends.  Is this argument really so important that you would be willing to lose their friendship over?  Whats the point?  So they said you liked a teacher and tried to make you jellous, who cares if you do have an innocent crush on the teacher first off (if you do, i bet your not the only one)  and if you dont then dont let it get to you, just ignore them, they will get board and go find something else to do.  I know this seems like your whole world is crashing down on you but its not.  Take a huge deep breath.  You need to go to school tomorrow (or today, whenever)  and put your chin in the air and dont let them get to you. Even smile at Frankie and Amanda, give em a wave.  When you do that you are basically saying, what you said doesnt bother me (even if it does)  and that you have more important things to worry about then whether Amanda and Frankie are making fun of you.  Then you go on about your buisnsess...talking to your friends, doing your lessons, havign a good old time.  If you already got her a present for her birthday, give it to her.  Look her straight in the eye and say....Happy birthday!  SHe will be so confused with your actions she wont understand.  <br>  <br>  When you do these things you are taking the higher road.  You are being the more mature and sophisticated one.  And even though that doesnt seem like much now, it really will be an important lesson in your future.  <br>  <br>  You need to step back and evaluate your friendship with these two people.  Have you all been friends for a long time?  Is this someone you really care about and dont want to lose them? You need to know wheather this is an argument you are willing to lose two friendships over, or wheather you are willing to move on from this situation so you all can continue to be friends.  Hopefully eventually they will apologize to you and when they do you need to tell them, yes I accept your apology but i feel that you should know I do not appriciate being treated that way.  and in the future I would like it if you would not be so mean and rude.  Tell them you dont mind having a laugh at yourself but there is a line they need to stay behind.<br>  <br>  Its always okay to laugh at yourself.....you need to smile joke about things....they just need to understand when to stop.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so sporadic, I am at work and dont have time to proof read but I hope it helps and I hope you keep your chin up and a smile on....Good luck!|`|od63QBtYaa	Aww, they sound like crummy friends.<br>  No real friend would do something like that, and they clearly knew what they were doing from what you said.<br>  <br>  I would not blank them totally myself, but let them know you're upset with them and they hurt your feelings, and if they still don't realise then give up with them, you seem to have many other friends, so you'll be alright.<br>  <br>  They sound rather immature to me, not worth it in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|AA11015890	They sound as though they were being really unkind, and the fact that they ignored you on the walk home shows that they didn't take your distress very seriously.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't blank Amanda on MSN, because this might create further problems for you at school.  I would give her a card tomorrow, but keep my distance.  Focus on your other friends, but do it without ignoring the other girls.  Acknowledge them, speak to them, etc, but don't hang around with them.  They need to learn to treat you with a little more respect and, to be honest, they don't sound like particularly great friends.<br>  <br>  If this behaviour was a one-off, you might want to put it behind you eventually an d go back to being good friends.  But if it's a regular occurrence, you're definitely better off without them.<br>  <br>  Just be careful not to make things worse for yourself by being nasty, talking about them behind their backs, etc.   Show them what maturity actually means!|`|gGcmRQDzaa	ok so your friendship is going thru a rocky time at the moment, but are they really worth it as friends? if they are then for Amanda's birthday get her a card (preferably a big one =]) and write down everything that is upsetting you and how you are sorry if you have done anything wrong and ask if you can start over... hopefully she will spend some time to talk to you and then you can have a bit of time with her...<br>  write another letter to frankie saying the same and give it to them when they can have a bit of time to read it by themselves...<br>  <br>  if you do not think that it is worth it then don't do anything and if amanda says someting like where is my present tell her that you thought that she didn't deserve a present because of all the horrible thing she said yesterday (or something along those lines)<br>  this is the real test of friendship... if she says that she is sorry and will try to make up for it then she is a good friend but if she sulks off then... well you see what i mean...=]<br>  <br>  hope this helps and that the whole frind thing gets sorted out... =]
PgYCDFhjaa	No, it's not a fear of committment. Its smart of you to watch for yourself and not tell people things you don't feel. As for him saying this to you..maybe he's infatuated and am feeling the fun and chemistry..because personally, i feel that love is a deeper connection that grows with time. You need to let him know your feelings either way..because if you like him than you 2 need to communicate - you cant leave him in the dust about him saying i love you, which is pushing you away. And if you think you're not that into him, then he needs to know so both of you can stop wasting your times. 4 months to me is too soon to say that, but everyone's different. Let him know you're happy and am into him, but just am not ready to say or hear i love you yet (even though he may feel it on his end). If you find it difficult to find the words, then write him a note explaining you like him, but didnt want to hurt his feelings. He'll understand if you let him know..This will save a lot of mis-leading and confusion in the end. Good luck.|`|2Zgmo2Ohaa	love is a very strong, passionate word, why does it push you away do you care about him? you should talk to him you must know how deep his feeling are for you, but better yet you must find out how deep your feelings are for him.|`|TsRGKk98aa	just tell him that you don't like him and your sorry to hurt his feelings. you shouldn't date someone you don't like.
0BWISHOMaa	Being in love with a person does not mean that you have to be attached to them permanantly.<br>  It's healthy for every couple to have some alone time. Whether to hang out with friends, or stay at home and veg, everybody needs that time.<br>  I know it seems hard now, because it's something you're not used to, but once you get used to it, you'll start to enjoy your own time, and look forward to it|`|bOaaFumJaa	no its not since feelings will add in with trying to. sounds like he just wants alone time with his friends so detach from him sometimes and go hang out with his friends. doesnt mean youll be loving him any less youll just be spending a little less time with him
sff2abshaa	You may wish to contact a Private Investigator in your area. They have more resources at their disposal than you and I do. Thats probably your best bet in finding him. Good Luck!|`|GfNVcq7Naa	A private eye is expensive. Have you talked to your mom about wanting to see him. Perhaps there is somethings you shouldn't know about him. Bringing him into your life also means that you'll be bringing him back into your mothers life weather you mean to or not. Have you considered all the consequences? |`|AA10266064	i think it sounds like you want to meet your "Dad" but that person doesn't exist, he hasn't been a dad to you and it doesn't sound like he deserves you.  Sometimes it's better left to the imagination. I'm sorry, but i found out the hard way, i wish i could prevent someone else's heartache. God Bless You!!|`|ozOsDDWMaa	He might have died or have moved to another counry or is in jail.
yexMBe7Kaa	I was on Oprah.com and they have this relationship section, it just looked at it last night, and it was talking about why men cheat. And they said that it when guys cheat it wasn't always about sex, and most of the time the men didn't find the mistress to be more attractive than their partner. Most of the time guys cheated because the felt disliked/disconnected emotionally from their partner - and the "other woman" was there to give support and feel needed and wanted. Guys aren't all tough as the play off...they need attention physically and emotionally...|`|POtsZgh7aa	Well, maybe you should give him another chance, if and only if he promises never to cheat on you again, ever.<br>  Tell him you won't even think twice about leaving him if he does anything like that ever again.<br>  Hope this helps, good luck.|`|EuXGFDegaa	he told her we were together and how much he loves me but he was sleeping with her.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10774554	You should probably leave him.  He can't be a great influence on your kids if he is always resenting you for earning more income, and if he's confiding in another woman instead of you he's probably incapable of discussing anything meaningful with you.  Admittedly I don't have a lot of knowledge about prolonged relationships or financial disputes but I do know about love and trust and they need to go together.  And as I mentioned it's not only what's best for you but also your entire family.  Discuss what's most important for him and then if he disregards any of it than toss him away, keep your dignity and family intact.|`|5ojYbtzhaa	Hun i was in the same situation. The reason why he told this other girl that your mean to him is because he wants the sympathy vote, to be the victim. It makes him look more attractive to her then he'll be really nice to her, and that's that she's been had hook line and sinker. I phoned this girls number too and she'd told me that she'd been sleeping with him, and that i was treating him really bad and that we had a kid together and that he was just stopping with me till he'd found somewhere else to live. He'd also told this other girl that i was a rich turkish girl treating him bad, im white british girl. You get me! A man will tell a woman anything to get what he wants. He to also didn't have a job at the time which was making things hard for us. I kicked him out then he realized he didn't have it so bad with me after all. In fact i look after him too good. Luckily he did see where he'd gone wrong, he got a job, he moved back in. Now we have 2 beautiful kids together and we don't go nowhere without each other. I would also like to say that i think that his age was a major part in what went on he was really young when we got together. I hope your able to sort this out and i hope that he can see how much hes hurting you good luck. |`|AJIf03aOaa	I do not think you should give him a chance! A cheater is always a cheater. Since you said that he always hated that you made more money, I think that's the problem. He feels threatened or hurt that he is the guy but you are the one with a bigger salary. He was probably with her because he felt that she was subordinate to him. And to him he probably felt that you were more superior, especially after calling him a loser because he doesn't have a job. I dont think you should get back with him. Think about what is best for your children though and yourself. I think that would answer your question. I hope I helped. Good luck!|`|ac63Rsz9aa	Honey, there is an old saying for this... once a cheater, always a cheater.<br>  <br>  I was in this situation with a guy I dated once, We were together for about 2 months when he 'needed' to fly to perth (im an aussie!) because he promised this girl who was apparently an old mate of his, had asked him months before to be his formal date, I let him go. While he was gone I discovered I was pregnant - I was only 15 at the time. When he got back he was EXTREMELY annoyed that I had 'let myself get pregnant' and he even questioned whether he was the dad or not... I had lost my virginity to him, anyway back to the point, He started getting calls from this girl and texts all through the night. One day he had left his phone at home when he went to work, and because I started to get suss about the whole thing, i went through his phone ( i forgot to add that he had been going back and forth to perth over a period of 3 months) I found messages from her with names in them, just names that was all. When he got home from work I questioned him about it, It turns out he had knocked her up when he went to perth the first time and that she was keeping it, I was at the time around 5 months pregnant. We got into a massive fight which led to him kicking me several times in the stomach, which resulted to me having a still born (yes it is possible =(  ) about a week after the birth of OUR son, he begged me for forgiveness, so I took himback, then he started dissapearing, for weeks on end, guess where he was, in perth with his darling daughter and his slut. I left him after that, grew up a little and met the love of my life!!!! he is still in my life a little, when he comes back up to brisbane where i live to root his slut up here!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Please honey, dont go back|`|lJB9ab4Iaa	Maybe he was trying to support you guys by being a prostitute....<br>  Does it matter?

f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	create a budget you can live with and live within your means, build up a savings account for emergencies that has a minimum of 6 months pay (you can build this up while you are living on your own--take 5-10% of your take home pay each payday and deposit it in this account), have roommates, no pets until you can afford them--they cost lots of money (vet bills, food, vet bills, toys, vet bills, etc, did I mention vet bills?  fish tank is good but mammals or exotics not a good idea when you are just starting out), learn to shop smart.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend you move in with a SO right away--live on your for a while.<br>  <br>  here is a budget that worked for me even when I was making minimum wage.<br>  you live on 60% of your take home pay.<br>  <br>  the remaining 40% is broken up this way:<br>  1/4 to an entertainment fund--this is your party budget, eating out, dvd rental, etc<br>  1/4 to your emergency savings--you keep depositing to this savings until it has 6 months salary in it.  once you reach that goal you can use the money that was going into this account for a different type of savings--(car, retirement, extra fun, where ever you need savings)<br>  1/4 to a retirement fund--you aren't too young to start one.  and 46 to 51 years down the road you won't regret doing it.  If your employer offers something then take it (if you don't stay with them you get to take what you put in it with you and sometimes some to all of what they put in for you--depends on how long you worked) or go to your bank and talk to them about setting one up.  they'll explain them to you to help you pick one that is right for you. <br>  1/4 to a regular savings account or to save up for something you really want (vacation, tv, car, etc)<br>  <br>  your share of your rent should be no more than 30% of your monthly pay (this includes renter's insurance--it's very cheap and so worth it).  your car payment or upkeep on your car should be 15-20% of your monthly pay or less (this includes insurance).  that leaves 10-15% for food and misc bills.|`|o1yy6KABaa	It is great to live on your own..get a small place if you dont want room mates but perhaps get a 2 bdrm aptmt so if you get stuck you can always get someone in. try and get a furnished aptmnt with fridge, washing machine and dryer, so that you dont have to by those things yourself. If you have to buy furniture, get it second hand so you dont get into debt. <br>  Work out a budget...<br>  Take what you get in the hand each week and estimate cost of rent, power and phone/cable. add them up and  whats left over you have for food, petrol and spending. Theres not always alot of money left over for entertainment but remember that you can always have your friends over for drinks or a movie being in your own place, entertainment can become more cost effective. |`|IUw0f5u5aa	I had to live on my own when I was 18 years old,  all I can say that I was so lonely, the week ends were the worst,<br>  Then I met a bloke and married him, mainly because I was so lonely.<br>  As for how to live comfortably, make sure you pay your rent and any other bills you should, then see what you have left, and what you can spare for you clothes and entertainment. |`|JuNf9cnJaa	Well I'm 21 and I've been on my own since I was 18.  For starters, you might want to get a roommate instead of living by yourself.  This way cost of living is cut in half or more, and you don't have to juggle all the responsibilities on your own either. <br>  Also do consider other options such as.... renting a room in a house where other people live like university students and stuff, and you just share the common areas.  Also this is a great way to meet new people.  <br>  If you really want to just live on your own and have it affordable, then your only option would be either a bachelor, or a really small one bedroom.  <br>  I hope this helped you.<br>  Oh also, look for places that have everything included... ie: cable/internet/hydro/gas etc.  otherwise you could wind up paying $200 or more on the extras.|`|DA4u3R9Eaa	Living on your own is a privilege and a pleasure!  Once you get that taste of freedom, you'll never want to live with anyone(your parents)again!  However, you must prioritize!  Rent and bills come first, but that does not mean you can't enjoy the experience!  You will be so proud of yourself for being able to make it on your own, that it almost becomes surreal!  Make sure you save up a good stash before you move out though!  That way, you can work off a larger sum and not just live pay check to pay check!  Good luck!|`|c1YNsLv0aa	At age 19 I moved out into a little one bedroom cottage. It cost me $600 a month plus furniture costs and utilities. I wasn't going to school and was working full time as a waitress at a diner, making 500-800 a week depending on how well that week went. As long as you are financially smart (aka you have the willpower to pay bills first, shop later) you should be good. I still had a bit of $ to spend on clothes/entertainment but living on my own and getting through it financially was so distracting that I actually had no desire to shop. <br>  <br>  A few key things to consider:<br>  -monthly rent costs<br>  -the deposit you will likely need<br>  -saving up some cushion cash BEFORE making your move<br>  -possibly finding a roomate, you'll have less to spend on rent when you split a 2+ bedroom with others<br>  -don't room with a close friend, it will probably ruin your relationship!<br>  -think about transportation to and from work, how much it will cost you<br>  -dont forget about utilites!<br>  <br>  Once you consider all of the above, check out craigslist for places, I found mine there, and I always see lots of great ones! Good luck!|`|j0agHnuJaa	The honest truth is: you cannot live the way you want when you first get out on your own. (sorry!) The best thing you can do is SAVE! save as much as you can. I have found unexpected bills to be HUGE setbacks, especially on such a small income. If you could start with even a thousand dollars hidden away (not to use unless a real emergency) I think you'll find yourself a lot less stress when life throws the unexpected at you. <br>   I save by living with four roomates (I dont recomend that many)<br>   Buying things when they are on sale, if I know I will need them in the future<br>   Picking up a second job I can work at my leisure<br>   NOT EATING OUT saves me soo much money!! <br>   |`|AA11476807	If you need to ask how to live on your own and how to budget your money then you are not ready to move out on your own.  Stay at home a while longer and set up a budget for yourself along with a savings plan.  It's not as easy living on your own as you might think. By the way...to live comfortable and to still have money for entertainment...not too many people these days can do that because of the cost of living.  Got $4000.00 a month and little to no debt?  Good luck!!|`|a8ZaTg8Maa	Well living on your own is NOT always fun, most of the time I don't have money for anything but food and bills. It is pretty stress full at times! Just make sure you can afford everything before moving out....include power bill, water if you have to pay that, groceries, sewer, phone & rent....all that fun stuff!|`|uBssj3Znaa	live within your means, find a roommate and don't blow extra cash on frivolous sh*t. <br>  Living on your own is great but can be hard at times, especially with the economy the way it currently is.

GwVWqqL4aa	Hmmmm....maybe she is at a loss too.  I mean, if her son is acting up really badly she may feel it is her fault.  She may have depression or low self esteem.  It is unfortunate that this is happening.  You should talk to her about her drinking and the smoking.  It is endangering your daughters and your son.<br>  <br>  If she won't talk to you, seek help from a counselor (there are free counseling services-if you are not opposed to going to a church, they are free, generally speaking).<br>  <br>  You should get her family to talk to her too.  And get the boy some help, maybe even a school counselor.  You have many options.  I know it would be hard, but you could call his school very early in the morning (they are usually in the office by 7:30am at the high school my sister attends) and talk to a counselor, or at least leave a message.<br>  <br>  Being a parent is hard, and it is nice to see that you are making efforts to help your step son.<br>  <br>  Any man can make a baby, but you are stepping up and being a father to him even if you aren't biological.

I cant believe you'd let a 15 yr. kid push around your wife no matter the circumstances. Maybe he acts one way when your not there. If i had a 15 kid pushing me around everday and his father not man up and do something about it, id be getting drunk and smokin pot too! Maybe you let him get away with too much and she cant handle it. <br>   Maybe you need to step up and take control of your family before something really bad happens to someone. You cant expect her to control yall's son all by herself, and dont make excuses for him. Tell him like it is and tell her like it is, but for Godsake dont leave her! Poor woman!<br>  <br>  OMG! I cannot believe everyone here is saying ditch her! Do you know what a average size pissed off 15yr. almost man can do to  a woman.  Some people smoke pot, get over it. If she is a fine mother to the other kids but not to the one that beats up on her, HELLO!! WAKE UP! I feel sorry for her. He might hurt her one day, and you wont do anything about it!! I bet her pot smokin has nothing to do with this situation, thumbs down me yall go ahead! Dont care. Cant believe everyone is ok with him getting physical with her. Good thing she's smokin, it probably stopped her from beating the hell out of him!<br>  <br>  Also, Dont tell me that your wife drinks and smokes pot and YOU dont ever! That's unusaul. You might resent her because you have to work, and you MIGHT ASSUME she does that all day. There was another answer on here that pretty much nailed everything down. You need to take some time off to spend with your family. There is definitely more to this than you are saying. I personally think you need to roll up your sleeves and show your son how to be a real man. Boundaries need to be SET with him. Make no bargains! You and your wife might also need a little break together, alone, to reconnect. I honestly dont see where she sounds like she is a bad mother. So, she yells at the kid, what do you want her to do.|`|T6oCHWSAaa	Your alcoholic, drug using wife can't cope with the neglected and possibly abused teenager in her home and has him incarcerated so the system can parent him because she is not capable of being a mother while she is drunk and high.  And you are wondering if you should take your two young children and leave but are concerned that doing so might cause financial hardship. <br>  <br>  I know that sounds mean but I'm just rephrasing your question.  <br>  <br>  Here's a question for you.  When the stepson leaves, who do you think she is going to replace him with?  Which of your daughters will become the scapegoat for everything that is wrong in her life?  Maybe she treated her son pretty good when he was that age, too.  <br>  <br>  She needs addiction counseling and the whole family could probably use at least some family counseling.  Lay down the law.  It's not any more ok for her to treat her son that way than it would be for her to treat your daughters that way.  You recognize that she is terrible to your stepson but have you ever intervened?  Have you ever told her that this is not acceptable behavior or is it acceptable behavior as long as she doesn't treat your girls that way?  <br>  <br>  Start discreetly looking for promotions or changes in your job that would allow you to work a more reasonable schedule.  Talk to a family member who might be willing to babysit if it became necessary for a short time, at least.  If you move out with the girls, find a nanny who will be willing to move in for room, board and a small wage.  You have options if you are willing to do what you must to protect your girls.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope it works out.|`|bXCXvrOzaa	Wife is a lush and a pothead. <br>  <br>  - That would be deal breaker #1.

You can't do anything about him really. <br>  - If he's pushing his mom, your wife around, let him spend a few days in jail to learn you don't do that sort of thing. <br>  <br>  Honestly I would probably ask her and her kid to leave and separate. There's a lot of things going on, and to be honest you need to keep YOUR kids (your girls) away from the booze, and potential violence. <br>  <br>  Yes it will suck, and no one has to work 12 hours a day 6 days a week.

It seems like you are only guessing the reasons as to why she appears to resent her 15 year old son.  Is it resentment, or is it the fact that he is causing trouble in the home?  I really do understand how difficult it is for a 15 year old boy...especially from a broken home, but is your wife really reacting through resentment of how the 15 year old treats her.  Maybe she is totally frustrated and at a loss to know what to do about him.<br>  <br>  You would obviously know the history between your wife and her ex husband.  Was there violence......and is the son turning out like his father?  How bad is this boy?  You say he is often getting into trouble with the Law.  You said they had an arguement and he pushed her.  He should not be pushing his mother.  He should not be laying a hand on her.  I had an aggressive 18 year old son...he was a big boy too, but he would never have laid a hand on me.  And, if that situation ever did arise, I would call the Police too.   If your step son ends up in the cells, then it is obviously not the first time he has touched his mother.  You are rarely at home, so you only see a little bit.  She has to live with it 24/7.  She is the one trying to raise two little girls and having an aggressive 15 year old too must make it extremely hard for her.  Why dont you take some leave from work and help her out here.  Maybe if you were home more you would really see what is going on. <br>  <br>  Maybe your wife has had enough of the way her son treats her.  Maybe she doesnt want to be bullied and intimidated.  Obviously the son has no boundaries for him to think its ok to push his mother...what else has he done.  I think there is more to this than meets the eye.  Maybe she drinks and smokes as an escape from the problems her son creates.   She is also trying to protect the two girls and having a son around like that is certainly going to impact upon their lives too.  <br>  <br>  As parents, we can bend over backwards for our children...but gone are the days where parents were the authority figure.  Peer pressure and kids rights override a parents rights and responsibilities.  Kids can get away with murder these days.  Maybe you wife is showing your step son that there are consequences for everything.   Maybe she has tried everything else with him and calling the Law is her last resort.<br>  <br>  Maybe she has had enough of his violence.  There are always two sides to every story....maybe you dont know the real story because you are never there.|`|3mtkRbwIaa	Have you tried talking to her about her behaviour, maybe find out if theres something going on under the surface that is causing her to act in this way. Perhaps she is suffering from stress /depression if you work long hours she may feel that theres only her to deal with the 15 year old , she may feel at a loss at what to do about his behaviour, and at that age he probally isnt showing her too much respect .|`|AA10820792	COuld it be the other way around while your gone, the tables do turn when cat is away the mice will play.

JUST DUMP THE LOSER AND FIND ANOTHER GIRL|`|hhQAbo3Iaa	ditch the *****|`|FmCr6Hwjaa	First of all let me qualify the rest of my comments with: The drinking and smoking - ya that ain't good, but maybe she leaves because you don't support her--that kid sounds like a brat...You did say locked up AGAIN-hello?! He is obviously a troublemaker and he PUSHED YOUR WIFE!! HELLOOOOOO...anyone in there? You are no MAN if you let another man-and at 15 that's what he pretty much works out to be size wise at least compared to a woman---push your wife around--I don't get why you aren't outraged at that.  There is only one reason possible.  You don't love her because when a man loves a woman there ain't no way he would let ANYONE disrespect her--you know I am right.|`|MF8XiNxzaa	Try putting her in drug/alcohol and parenting classes... or maybe just confront her about it and tell her your problem with the situation. Either she will change for the greater good (her children) or she will be a selfish person and keep doing the same thing.  She can go to jail for in-dangering her children for doing drugs and drinking.. as can you because you have not reported it.  I'd be careful with this situation if I were you. |`|jNtkhOTVaa	     The best advice you will ever get is the advice you give yourself.  If you KNOW you need to leave her then no one else's opnion matters.  You need to do what is right for you and most importantly what is right for your children.<br>  <br>       Maybe she treats your girls better than your step-son.  But she is still causing them a lot of mental and emotional damage.  They witness how she treats their big brother.  And if they are witnessing her abusing alchohol and drugs then what kind of example is that?  Little girls idolize their mommys.  They want to grow up to be just like them.  And who knows, maybe they will see her and say, "I don't want to be like that".  But what if they turn out just like her?<br>  <br>       Finding child care can be very difficult but if shes drinking too much and doing God knows what else she really isn't fit to be watching them either.  <br>  <br>       Do you have a family member or a close friend that can help watch them?  If not you may need to re-evaluate this situation and even consider finding a new job and down-sizing your way of living.  I know, eaiser said than done when we are all swimming in debt.  But it sounds like you either need to pack up the kids and get the heck out of there or you need to give her a wake up call and say get it together or we're gone.  But you've probably already done that more than once and how many "one last chance"s does she get?<br>  <br>       Do whats right for your kids.  Put them first before all things.  They deserve that and it's obvious you're going to have to be the one to do that because she isn't.  |`|qjFebYItaa	You and your family despirately need counseling.  I have been in the same situation with my husband's children, so I feel that I can speak from experience.  I had rules in my home that my son had to follow, but my husband's sons ignored them.  They were constantly in trouble and the younger one has been in jail several times for drug possession.<br>  <br>  As a family, you all need to sit down and come to agreement on the rules. You all need to come to agreement on the "house rules" and also for the consiquences if they are broken.  Your son has no business being out at night past 10:00.  If you set a time that he had to be in and he is even one minute late, then there has to be consiquences and they have to be consistent.<br>  <br>  You have two beautiful daughters and they are small and need to be the focus of your family.  If your son disrupts your fmaily, then he has to go and this needs to be made clear.  Where will he go?  That will become his problem is he continues to misbehave.<br>  <br>  And this B.S. about picking the girls up and going but you can't afford daycare?  If you really think that your daughters would be better off FIGURE A WAY OUT TO DO IT!  What are you going to thell them if they get hurt by their drunk or stoned mother?  Well, honey, it was the economy?  <br>  <br>  Get some couseling and do the right thing for your family, man.  Apparently you are the only one with his head on straight!<br>  <br>  |`|uYCebvpLaa	1. either u get help for your wife <br>  2. divorce her<br>  3. get a new wife (kinda hard tho)<br>  4. talk to her .alone.<br>  5. all of u need some family counseling<br>  <br>  sorry im not trying to be rude but i feel really bad for you and your step son. i mean i would rebel too if i had a mother like that. its just to express frustration. ur wife is probably the center of all the trouble. Good luck =]|`|ugTHK1fUaa	You seem to be putting all the blame for your step son's behaviour on your wife. You are his step father and he needs a strong,  male role model in his life; especially since his real father has been absent in his life. You need to spend some time with him and talk to him about what is going on in his life. Maybe this will help your wife at the same time. Maybe she runs out of the house because she feels that she has to get away from the kids for awhile. Where the heck does she go to put that many miles on the car? Regardless, the children are both of your responsibilities and not just hers. Whether you work or not, you still have to be there for you family. <br>  <br>  Family counselling seems to be the best course of action here. Your step son needs help before he ends up in jail. Maybe your wife needs a part time job to get her out of the house for a few hours each week. Be a man, your family needs you. At least you will know that you tried. Your wife might also need to get help with her drinking, call Alcoholics Anonymous to get some advice.  |`|vzJiv9vDaa	Well, the question is, do you love her enough to know, see and feel that you could change her?.. <br>  <br>  Have you tried talking to her?.. Surely, she would be able to understand, respect and take on board what you say if she truly loved you..<br>  <br>  Though to be honest, it looks as though she's going through a lot too (your wife). I mean she smokes and drinks 24/7, maybe there's something on her mind but she just doesn't know how to express herself so turns towards drinks and cigz..<br>  <br>  And your the only one bringing in the money, so I mean you can't really do anything cause she aint got a job..<br>  From the looks of it, I think the ultimate question is.. <br>  Does she love you?.. and Do you love her?..<br>  <br>  Hope this helps..|`|4POGapREaa	You really need to talk to her about this.  If she won't listen then I would at least suggest getting your step son into some type of therapy.  Some parents think that getting the kid locked up will "teach him a lesson".  Not really.  They just become accustomed to it & no longer fear it.  That's exactly what happened to my husband & his twin brother.  Their mom threw them in juvi for anything.  They got used to it.  And what was right around the corner?  PRISON.  They got used to that too.  He's just going to meet more bad people when he's locked up than he ever would on the outside.  Talk to her.  Tell her she's sending him down the wrong path.  Sounds you're getting a bad deal here.  Working 12 hours per day & then she just takes off when you get there?  Doesn't sound like she's too happy with her life or herself.  Maybe it's time for an ultimatum.  |`|kEtYEmhqaa	Start dating|`|AA10959177	so as long as she can babysit the kids while you work to support her crappy habits you're satisfied.<br>  get real, get out and start living like a normal man.<br>  quit making excuses and cut off her income for the gas, booze, weed, etc. tough if she don't like it.<br>  get some legal help from someone.<br>  stand up and be a man for your kids if not for yourself.|`|AIjVOdkCaa	Maybe she needs counseling? |`|030dd82cb167c736f497afbef6fd62d2aa	your wife needs therapy, her son needs therapy especially if she hasn't come to terms with her son' father.  the most unfair thing she has done is to take her frustrations out on her son because in her eyes he is a reflection of his absent father.  unfortunately, it seems like young man is destined for trouble over and over but that doesn't have to be his fate.  as his step father, you may be able to fill in since you are the father figure in the house, although it may not be easy with a 14 year old.  you can't force your wife into therapy but maybe you can suggest it (strongly), or her behavior may just land her in a very unfortunate situation of she doesn't get some help. eventually you all may have to seek therapy because this isn't just her problem or her son's problem, it is a family problem because the girls are aware of the differences and the dynamics in the household.<br>  <br>  i wish the best for all of you.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	You can't control a wife with no clue on parenting a wild child. You can't control a wife period! What you can do is to start living the life you were meant to live. If she doesn't want to be a part of it or she wants to sabotage it then so be it. Keep on trucking the way you are supposed to go. Your focus and your actions are the only thing you can control. Now, I hate to sound religious, (I mean really, really, hate it) but, I was in your shoes but maybe not as severe, I went to a local church (brought up that way dude) and got involved. I let her kid tag along all the they wanted. Her kid saw the light and blew past me so fast it was embarrassing. I mean they are showing "me" the way to live. Mommy went the other way. BUT! She is way more mature, way more understanding, and I won't force my beliefs down anyones throat, not even my wifes. We've been married over 20 years and she is my best friend. I helped her kid more than she will ever know. All because I focused on my target. Not hers, not her kids.

DJeCWj2kaa	Sweetheart, I have asked myself, friends, and fam the same question! I have come to the conclusion that the answer is a resounding NO! You must answer that question for yourself and realize how amazing you are on your own. You don't need anyone to validate who you are!<br>  <br>  Don't view singleness as a bad thing. I'm sure you've heard the saying, "The grass is always greener on the other side..." A lot of people are in unhappy relationships because they lowered their standards. If you really want to be in a successful, loving relationship, use this time to focus on yourself! What are your passions or hobbies? Do them. If you don't have any, then learn something new. Learn how to enjoy life and your time alone.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, know what you want (especially what you don't want) in a potential mate. If it helps, make a list. This way you won't just fall for the first guy that comes around because you're lonely.<br>  <br>  I'm not giving you advice that I haven't followed. I've been single for 6 years now, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. I'm beautiful, educated, and talented! Occasionally, I have moments when I wonder if I'm doing something wrong, because all I seem to attract are men who are either unavailable, job-less, or twice (sometimes thrice!) my age. It's at these moments that I can choose to either dwell in self-pity or choose to be patient and believe that there is someone who is deserving of me and vice versa. I hope this helps!|`|170DwLM5aa	Give it time. <br>  <br>  Go out and have fun.  People with hobbies and a busy schedule usually meet the most people.

6e7898d5f2786d5d819edd5e8050845faa	You should not have to think about what to talk about. If there is a connection, the conversation should flow freely.

Also, even though you're not in school you obviously have access to the Internet.  The potential for knowledge is limitless.

fc0ac9684ff64b38e4f54b999f4fcee1aa	You get confidence by being comfortable with yourself in your own skin. Knowing yourself, your wants and desires. Feeling comfortable and confident when talking with others and getting to know them is key. Just remember, that when someone comes to talk to you, you give non verbal clues to whether your interested or really listening. Don't cross your arms or look around. You don't have to be bubbly and social to talk with others. Make sure you respond when someone is talking to you, whether it is shaking your head or by making a comment.

It's about getting into the right moment with the rithym, you know,.. 1-2-pull off,..1-2-pull off..you don't wanna get in too fast or she'll pull away or kick you in the bu##. Give her a look once in a while, let her know you care and see how she reacts; make her comfort with your presence, let the romance spread in the air and let her make her moves; take the chance, introduce yourself and see how the relation goes.

He proposed after one year and seven months.|`|HMvXkR6Faa	I guess that depends on the people.  If it's been 1 year but it doesn't seem like he'll ever commit to something real, then that could be too long.  But if he's just he type of guy that needs 3-5 years, than it's worth the wait to be with the right guy, right?<br>  <br>  It all depends on how you feel about the situation.  If you feel like he'll never really commit to what you want (marriage, settling down, etc) than any amount of time could be too long.  But if you think he will be ready one day, then maybe you two just need to talk about when that day might be.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think it depends on your situation.  If you are a couple that started dating in high school, then waiting 8 years may not be unreasonable.  If you are an older couple, are financially independent, and there are no other obstacles, then 4 years should probably be your limit if marriage is important to you.<br>  <br>  It also depends on how well you can talk about it.  My husband and I were together for 8 years before we got married, and were over 30 by the time we got married.  However, we were both agreeing to wait for certain things before we got married.  We were talking about marriage openly throughout that time and both in agreement that we very much wanted to get married once certain things advanced so it was never an issue.  As soon as those things happened, we were married in a fairly short time.   Waiting was not an issue for us since we both knew where the other one stood.  On the other hand, I've known couples who wait many years and can't give a good straight answer as to what they're waiting for.  Usually, these people are just trying to avoid marriage, and it ends up not working out.  You just need to know what is happening in your own situation.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	It really depends on you.  I have seen some people who have been together 10 years before getting married.  I have also seen people leave a relationship after 2 years because they weren't engaged yet.  To me, I'd be fine with waiting a long time to get married.  (I wouldn't always LIKE it, but I wouldn't dump someone I love because of it).  I live with my fiance (have for the past 4 years) and we already have a marriage, just without the paperwork and titles.  So to ME marriage isn't that big of an issue to whether we stay together or not.  To someone else it may be.|`|AA11603468	I dated my last guy for 5 years before I accepted the fact the he just didn't want to get married. |`|QaEZd14Vaa	I was with my husband for 6 years and engaged for 3 of those before we finally got married.  Been married for over 9 yrs now. <br>  <br>  I would say if after the first 3-6 years he is still unsure then say buddy figure it out soon. If marriage is something he really is unsure of or doesn't want and you do then you need a new man.  It is really simple when the heart isn't involved.  <br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself what you want in the relationship and find out what he wants if different: then you need to change your wants to match his or move on.  You are never going to change him and he will just resent you if you try.  You only have control over you.  Best wishes.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	My husband took 3 years to propose.  There was no percentage in rushing him to do it sooner.  A previous girlfriend made that mistake, and he was really sensitive to any kind of pressure.

After we had dated for 2 years, his mom and his sister, with no prompting from me, would ask him frequently, "SO.  Any big news to report?"  He got the hint, and the rest is history.|`|QLopvWKDaa	My rule is go through each season and holiday together= 1year. <br>  <br>   I think that soon after the first anniversary the "where are we going with this" talk should begin.

For myself, where I am in my life, I wouldn't give it much more than two years without clear direction.<br>  <br>  This, of course, depends on where you are in life, like in high school or college or when you are working on your own future.<br>  <br>  |`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	My husband and I dated 5 years before he proposed.  However, we did talk about it after we had been dating for 2 years.

A marriage is  a relationship for the entire duration of couple's life. It is not changeable after few years. Do you all have heart on your chest? What is in it? Is it salt water or blood running through it.  How can you think of parting with your partner who has sacrificed so much for you all through the past years. If you look from the stand point of the women, she has  given you the much valued virginity and other sufferings to please you and the children.  If you look from the stand point of man, he has given you his vigor and vitality to please you. He has managed your family very well and established a institution like situation. Your family is counted as a unit in your locality and you should maintain it for all time to come i.e. until your death. Your off springs can also lead a good life only if it parents set example tothem. If the parents are behaving like a rogue i.e. anxious to depart before getting into union, what would the children consummating from such relation will be like? A disintegrated family is like "rolling stone gathers no mouse". So Ladies and Gentlemen forget about the idea of frequent divorces and let us continue the family for ever. At least let us not predetermine the period for a divorce. The slogon is " One life and one family". Only this can make the life of each family member enjoyable. Otherwise you have your ex- wife and previous children living some where. Children will have step- father who will not care for them. So the life of children will become horrible. We are creating a generation which is not strong and stable and above all unethical. They will also follow the suit. The result is that our next generation will also be the same. So let us put a full stop this disintegration of society.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|aYVuItT7aa	I think it depends on where you are in your life and your current age.<br>  I met my husband the first day I moved to college. We dated off and on the first two years, and solid for the 2nd two. Since education was my main priority, I did not have the slightest thought in my head about marriage. <br>  After graduation in 2006, I moved to CA to live with him. Making that big of a commitment without knowing our future was slightly scary. I told everyone and myself that I would wait 3 years. At the time, I thought my husband was still against marriage as he had been throughout college. After a year and a half, one of his close friends got engaged, which paved the way for us talking about it. He told me he wanted to marry me, and that would have been enough for me to wait a few more years. That was July and he proposed by September. :) We were married this past August.<br>  <br>  If I would have met him when I was 27 or 30, I think I would have had a shorter time frame. I also would have waited longer because he is what matters to me (although I love my ring, he's more important!)|`|sd1zIuG4aa	It's never too late to get married, it's never too late to get divorced.

8XjJzj7Naa	NO I dont think you should go. He tried to drown you? What kind of cousin or any family would do that? If my family memeber attempted to something drastic like that, then there would definaltely be problems! Your parents shouldnt force you even though they are family that doesnt mean that you have to "like" them. If your uncomfortable with him then why attend a birthday party for them? Explain this to your parents, if they dont agree then they are not respecting your wishes. Its not like your making up excuses to just not want to go because of some other reason. You clearly dont want to go because you have negative history between yourself and your cousin. I know how you feel, I would especially be uncomfortable more than anything. You know that a fight will break out, so why put yourself through that situation. Good Luck.|`|AA11289758	Go, and be as sweet as pie.  You're doing this for your cousin, not for yourself. If a family member says something nasty to you, just smile and think of your favorite song in your head.  Take a deep breath and focus on your song.  Say only nice things no matter what (it will bug them that they can't upset you).  Offer to help cook or clean up after the meal, and take out your frustration on the dishes.  Take a good book along with you, and read to prevent yourself from having to interact too much if you don't want to.  Stay close to your parents to avoid being alone with anyone who makes you feel uneasy.<br>  <br>  Nasty family is tough, but you can hold yourself to a higher standard.  You can survive one night!  :-)|`|gWhPCjJaaa	Go to be courteous but give yourself a time limit for how long you will stay.  Maybe take someone neutral with you to back you up so you don't feel so vulnerable.

Make sure you have a way of making a sharp exit and don't rely on parents to travel there/back.  |`|hbMIoQLRaa	well, there was a writer who said<br>  <br>  'forgive your enemies, nothing annoys them so much'<br>  <br>  i understand your problem more than you might think. but i think the best thing to do is go, be cool and don't start a fight or get angry. if he picks a fight with you just look down at your plate and smile to yourself.

I definitely think there was some forced sex, and I'd say you've been abused.  Hmmm, I am feeling from what you said it doesn't seem like you've had any dates because you get physical fast, that's why that one answerER said s-s-s-slut, and that is a hurtful thing to say.<br>  <br>  So I'd have to say you were being sweet and letting yourself go thinking there'd be more loving after the physical which you gave freely and that should not be looked bad on, but the women would scorn you, yes,...<br>  <br>  OKAY, well go and sex (sin) no more how about?  Just withold the physical until you both can't stand it but really the guy has to like you beyond sex because the lust fades, ALWAYS, check with everyone you know, I mean the older ones.<br>  <br>  I always admired women that showed their physical side without withholding, but that goes against a woman's credo, and the women will ahte you, and the men may think you're too easy, but as a younger man I have stayed with ONE woman that was that way, never got tired of it.<br>  <br>  I|`|cTld68SWaa	You better know what you really want in life... to have just sex or to have a special relationship with the guy of your dreams...<br>  <br>  If you just want to have sex all you want, well, don'tt expect for a guy to take you seriously and not to let you go...Since such want implies that youdon'tt want to be committed.<br>  <br>  If you want to have a boyfriend, you must consider and think of the certain standard or description of someone you go for.

All you have to do is talk to her and tell her that right now she is letting her feelings take control. I feel that she is unhappy and is well aware of this pain she goes through. She is doing it because she is lonely though. She needs to fill that gap and he does it for her. She is scared to lose that and be depressed and lonely again like she was when you left... Now he is being this way. She needs someone to fill that space so you will have to show her that you can do that for her. Just be there for her and let her know all that I said she will see... That you care. Let her know in the long run he is going to hurt her.. You see and know that. <br>  I hope that helps...<br>  Sometimes you will need to seek someone who can see your imbalance better than you can.

He probably feels he failed you, that you wound up in that situation, and is still having a hard time coming to terms with it. Or he's reminded of the father of your child, and form what I gather form your question, he's not in the picture.<br>  You should talk to him, something like "I've noticed that you don't really talk to [daughter's name] much at all when we come to see you. I don't know if you're upset with me, but please don't take it out on her. She needs a grandfather. I want to make this family work, so please tell me what's bugging you." It's really hard to guess at someone's thoughts in such a complex situation, so it's really best to ask.

t5EE6WO8aa	"should i just accept him for the way he is even though it bothers me..." that's not an easy thing to accept. if he knows it bothers you, not only should he change for that reason but he should also just not be so flirty with other girls if he's in a relationship. it seems like he wants to have his cake and eat it too, personally, i think you deserve better, by staying with this man, it seems to me that you're settling more than anything considering how many broken promises there have already been and how much hurt he's already caused you, don't settle for less. i mean, if you really love this man and you think he'll change then put faith into your relationship but if it bothers you already, its not gonna go away and the thought is always gonna be on your mind and you'll always be looking over your shoulder, do you want that your whole life or do you want to be with a man that you trust more? |`|TQbhhRtQaa	sorry, but if you have problems like this already, he is not the right guy to SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH!<br>  it will hurt at 1st to break up, but remenber, the right guy who will always respect you with out being asked to, is out there! you deserve better. be smart, you have your life and future kid's lives to think about.|`|lByp6Fjkaa	plain and simple<br>  <br>  No man is worth your tears , and the one who is WONT make you cry|`|8tJPK69iaa	When my husband and I were dating, women flirted with him all the time.

0BWISHOMaa	Firstly, I want you to read your question back to yourself. <br>  In your attempt to sound cool and make as many shortcuts as possible, you've actually made the question difficult to read, which is the opposite of a shortcut.<br>  If you are more worried about your studies, this is a good thing, regardless of what people tell you. Peer pressure won't give you a decent chance in the future, your marks will. Stick to the studies if that's what you want
pRF5LLloaa	No.  <br>  <br>  Child support is FOR you, but not controlled by you. The life of you mother, your father, and you are controllde by the court and legal documents, until such time as you reach "legal age".  <br>  <br>  If you do NOT go to college, that age is usually 18.  If you DO go to college, that age may be increased to 21 or 22.<br>  <br>  The ONLY possibility is to have yourself declared emancipated. That means that although you are not of legal age, you are legally considered an adult, and on your own.<br>  <br>  To be declared emancipated, you must have your own house or apartment, have a job, your own transportation to and from work (including busses and cabs) and prove to the court that you can take care of yourself financially as well as physically. In other words, you have to have a good job, not just part-time at McDonalds.<br>  <br>  Getting married will do it, too, but you have to be of "legal age" in you state in order to get married without your parents consent.<br>  <br>  In any case, at any age, you must do what the court says.|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	If you live in the US...<br>  <br>  No.  The only thing that will stop child support before the age of 18 is if the child becomes emancipated in some manner such as marriage (requires parental consent) or court decree (which makes you a legal adult, meaning you're completely responsible for yourself, but it's rarely granted in any state).|`|9d11412f1dd6dc725405197299346cdeaa	Your custodial parent would have to request it.  I'm still not sure the court would agree.  (My ex wanted to sign away his parental rights just so he wouldn't have to pay anymore support.)  You can call the Attorney General's Child Support office and ask if it's possible.|`|XypWPDJ5aa	I suppose you are saying this because child support is the main issue causing your parents to have constant bad fights.... There is 1 parent saying they dont want to pay child support or not pay as much as is being requested and the other is fighting that saying they should pay blah blah blah... shouldn't you be angry at the parent refusing to pay and causing the arguments?? Rather than wanting to stop the issue that is causing the fights?? By refusing not to pay or refusing paying enough - This says they dont care about you......Aren't you concerned about that??<br>  <br>  If that is not the issue and it is just a genuine question than.... No, you personally cannot request a stop payment on child support being paid for you. As you are not yet legally an adult at 18 or 21 (depending what country you are from) the courts will not reconsider child support based solely on your request, it will need to go through the courts with both parents consent.... The parent you are living with may need that child support to keep your heads above water... have a good chat with them about the necessity of the child support (is it worth the hassles) then decide how to go from there... its not cheap to raise kids, put them through school and run a house at the same time, parents need all the support they can get....<br>  Good luck|`|4b789edb740675b78db7d47d268779f5aa	Yes, and if you want neither parent to care for you, there's a thing called emancipation. It's rarely granted, but can happen if you have a good reason and can prove you're able to care and provide for yourself.|`|bcApepRsaa	This is up to the courts, someone has to support you! Meaning your mother and father needs to pay for your support.
L1zP4BWDaa	It's not you.  The loss of the baby is what changed him.  Give him some time, and he will heal.  I can only imagine how hard that was for the both of you.|`|PdR0HkIHaa	God no... its because you lost your baby.. that has to be rough on anyone no matter what.. good luck!|`|96033d41ee32f73aab1ae18d8f97ced9aa	No, it's not you.  Lose tends to change people.  Just give him some time and don't push.  Ask him if he maybe needs to go talk to someone to help him deal your lose.<br>  Sorry and good luck to you.
744d79a18fc5bea1f836a801174e792aaa	You have to admit it is flattering and how can you not like someone who likes you enough to ask you out.  It doesn't make you gay.
zhdqkMuoaa	Sweetheart, he is trying so hard to let you know how he feels. Of course he has a huge crush on you. Make plans with him to see him outside of school. Make him your sweetie.

She only has a cell phone. Many people   owned just a cell.

qgx8WuuCaa	She is jealous that you had the nerve and self confidence to make your hair an insane color and that she is too insecure and worried what other people might think to do the same, so she is trying to make you feel how she is worried other people might make her feel if she did it, even if other people wouldn't think that way about her or talk bad about her and its just her doing it to herself subconsciously. Does that make sense? ha ha. |`|1KQbrAdbaa	I would confront her. |`|ciqYhoZRaa	she is jealous!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8QIshPigaa	Skrew with her say things behind her back burst her secrets oh wait that would be wrong.

Most likely, her parent's won't let her dye her hair, so she's jealous that you can.  This is how she shows it.|`|5Qsqpbgdaa	dont worry.maybe she didnt mean to hurt your feelings.she probably just doesnt want to ruin her hair. BUT SHE STILL SHUDNT SAY THAT!

She doesn't sound like much of a friend.|`|Vh48WbW8aa	she is fake.|`|DP7YC5BEaa	Sounds to me that your friend is pretty jealous.  Perhaps her parents would let her get them.  Or she was to chicken to get them.  Why else would she say that they were horrible behind you back when she hadn't even seen them?<br>  <br>  |`|MonXWCe6aa	Cause she is stupid, spread a rumor about her. When she walks by tell her she should keep her legs closed|`|wf5TZc21aa	IDK shes just being annoying|`|SgrjTkwdaa	Why is she your Best Friend....that's a better question!|`|tdFhxIgXaa	well. shes not  your friend then. your not ruining your hair. ruining your hair would be puting gum in your hair.leave her be. if you act like it doesn't matter to you she will back off. let her go off and *****. i bet you look nice.|`|UqWZY7AQaa	shes quite obviously jealous<br>  stop being her friend <br>  get a new one<br>  you deserve better than that<br>  and highlights might ruin your hair but at least they look good<br>  one day your friend will get them and you can have the satisfaction of knowing what she said..|`|bspRfskYaa	She's jealous.  Perhaps her parents won't let her get highlight.  Next time she says that just tell her you went to a decent hairdresser so it will not ruin your hair.|`|gLuDUbBlaa	because she really is not your friend. If she is talking crap behind your back she is not a real friend. |`|x3U2Pa24aa	Probably she is jealous test her to see if she is really your friend or likes to make fun of you.|`|SgnHQhZQaa	Don't sweat the small stuff.

JPCuujjMaa	Shopping (mall or city), trapeze flying, zoo, sleepover, indoor skydiving, or maybe a dance party with boys and girls!!! |`|JoHwVgsGaa	I just had my thirteenth birthday on October 30! It was a lot of fun!!!! I invited 3 friends. I had my party on a Saturday. First, we went downtown and went shopping. We shopped for about two hours. Next, we went for a late dessert at the Melting Pot. I don't know where you live, but the Melting Pot is a fondue place. We got chocolate fondue. You get to dip strawberries, marshmallows, brownies, etc. in a big pot of chocolate. After dessert, we went back to the hotel and watched a movie in the hotel room. We went to sleep at about 1:30 am. The next morning we woke up early to swim at the pool and hang out in the hot tub. We went to Starbucks for breakfast and then ended at Barnes n Noble's bookstore where we just relaxed. Everyone left at about 12:00 pm. That's just an idea if you want a relaxing Girl's Night Out!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another idea is to have a spa party. Everyone can come to your house and you can give each other facials, manicures, pedicures, etc. You can also make some tasty snacks and watch a movie or something.|`|Myt4vwTFaa	go to the mall and do a scavenger hunt. make teams. when your friends arrive at each destionation they can pick up gift bags (work with clerks or have a parent/older friend help) to open at the end. they can even pick up your presents from the "helpers" if your parents give them to the helpers. depending on the mall, at the end you can shop or eat at the food court or see a movie.<br>  <br>  good luck! let me know if you want a different idea cause i'll be happy to help. being a teenager girl i know that it's hard to find something different and fun. =]|`|GaJ0Mf6oaa	have a spa night at your house and go all out with decorations! its kind of original, but you can make it unique.

Maybe do specific projects at different times like: do clay making before you eat the cake (yum). And then you could paint it and play games with it such as: Guess who's clay object with is! or Hide-And-Seek with the clay objects (sigh, clay objects!).

I don't know of any.  And call back to back at that.  If I were you I would just call the number...and if someone doesn't answer it then try calling at 6am or 11pm.  I hope it is his guy friend but if it turns out to be his ex then it should be crystal clear that something is going on or he wouldn't have lied. |`|vJP6yTy3aa	if you know that the number belongs to his ex, and he's telling you that it's a friend of his, either his friend is screwing his ex (which i doubt would be okay with him), or he's lying.  <br>  <br>  OR, his male friend was coming over to have sex with your husband.  at any rate, SOMEONE is having sex with your husband.  and i doubt it's you.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Yeah sounds like he is lying. Why would his friend be with is ex. I wouldn't date my friends ex's. Thats not right.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Maybe you need to have him followed.

He is a liar.  |`|DxbaEPbUaa	yes ma'am. he is lying to your face! better keep an eye on him.|`|1M7XTZCyaa	Yes he is lying.  I would look carefully at the dates again & look at the times again.  At 6:30 am on whatever day, does he go to work or off?  How far away does she live?  So look and see if there are any calls in-between these times.  You know he wasn't with her at the time the calls were made.  I would pretend to go out of town again, just to see if the  calls come in again or sit back & wait, borrow someones car.  I could see a guy calling late at night but not early early morning.  Tell him you would like to meet his friend, get his name & check it out.  Guys are such dummies. (well not all but most)|`|zxObwGCuaa	why in the heck would you even need to come on here and ask us if he is lying we are not even there and you know with what you said we will say he is lying, . but here is a little common sense for you , why in the hell does he need to be at his ex's house and use her phone to call him , the friend comes in town and you are gone , why wasn't he at your house , they are friends right , no brainer , he is cheating on you|`|AA11367901	Maybe it's innocent on his part.

I think it's possible she is trying to get back with him. Why would she call so many times?|`|WKevrbCoaa	Six times in two days..... guys just don't talk that much. <br>  <br>  Did you ask him a lot of questions?

Maybe you should call the number (from an unidentified  phone number and see who answers).  Other than taking his word for it, there is not much else you can do.  Good luck|`|zBw8qrASaa	He's lying to u for real a women ws calling him and i know ur not stupid because u said it urself a women called him! he's a liar and i wouldn't trust him call the dam number and ask the women herself why the hell is she calling your husband.

Basically- you have the upperhand here as he wouldn't approach you most likely because of the whole possibility that you would be like "um, who are YOU?" and then tell all your friends. But if you start talking to HIM - he might develop an attraction. I'd say go for it, in this instance you really have nothing to loose. Just be sure that he doesn't view as some cheap thrill until the next girl comes along and that you let him know eventually that you like him and don't just think he's hot. <br>  <br>  Rocker types should be open-minded- so it cold go either way. Good luck! And if you he says no, don't take it too personally- just go after the next one!|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	Yes...of course.<br>  I'm a hard rocker myself. Try to ask him some questions about him and get to know him better on more closer level. Take it nice and slow, and don't rush things too fast. Good luck|`|583e5d537a6d410ad98990c6d6250044aa	Talk to him. There is no way you'll know unless you ask.  Everyone has different tastes in the opposite sex, and they often have little to do with their style or taste in music.|`|P8d93wDraa	heyz im a metalhead girl so if a nice guy came up to talk to me i wouldnt be impressed..so i think try to show him ur dark side..wear black..black nail polish..spikes accesories..t-shirts that include famous band names..learn abt metal history and open up a conversation with him abt it...and im sure u'll win his heart..what im trying to say is change a little ur style from sweet to metalhead or hardcore rocker..and plz tell me what happens if u want add me :akbar_souka666@hotmail.com...(  im lebanese so dnt be surprised about my email):P|`|QvTqU0jkaa	Go for it. Opposites attract.|`|eidXv5lOaa	Awww I think that is so cute!I'm a rocker chic and I honestly have to say that I think that it would make his day to ask him out just to get to know him.JUst  tell him"I know this is weird and all but I couldn;t help but notice that you cuaght my eye".|`|k7m59JDxaa	Yeah, there's a possible chance that he has a thing for girly girls.  If you're really like that.  Then he'll never talk to you first because he might think you'll blow him off in a second since girly girls can be like "Ew who are you?"  So it'd be best if you talked to him first.  Most likely, he'll say something.  Just go for it!  Don't think about what you're gonna say 'cause then you'll most likely stutter and make a fool of yourself.  Let it come out naturally.  Talk to him first.  He'll most likely respond.  Good luck.

T4ugfJooaa	Wow your that nervous? Ok just relax if he sees you like that he will probably think you are weird. Try to have a conversation about something his is interested in, like if he plays a sport. Eventually you will become not strangers anymore and then you can hang out.|`|eQMq5szpaa	idk i need help with the same question..|`|IUsKNjZVaa	just alk to him as he were your firend<br>  <br>  <br>  how to ask some out:<br>  <br>  Volumes have been written about dating and how to ask someone out, though asking someone out is really not difficult. It does take courage and it also takes having the right approach. Courage cannot be taught, but the right approach to asking someone out can be. Like other social skills, the right way to ask someone out is a learned skill. No situation will be the same, but there are rules about asking someone out that apply to most situations. These rules are written with men in mind--a man asking a woman out--but applies to anyone asking anyone out.
ivrFwpuUaa	maybe ask for help on an art thing and then talk about skating and stuff, plus smile and act happy|`|skt23tHJaa	well... . use the fact that hes in your art class to your advantage. if theres something you need help with or if you have a question ask him. or commenton whatever hes doing in art. say something like 'oh wow that looks way ebtter then mine!' even if it doesnt. it might be hard, i know. people say you should say how are you or discuss common interests. well dont! if thats the first step you use to get to know someone, then that classisfies you as a stalker. and i know it might make you nervous.... but you just might have to flirt. remember, take things easy at a young age. ^-^

FMEHpZZFaa	I can understand where you are coming from. When I was in college I had several long distance relationships... none worked. Why? Well to be honest you tend to grow emotionally as well as physically over time and if you don't get to see your other half for 6 months then you really just do not know each other when you see each other again.<br>  I met my wife when I stopped looking. We stated out as friends and things progressed naturally. I wasn't looking and I spent many lonely Friday nights. The point of all this is that if you try to make something happen it will always slip through your fingers.<br>  Just take some time away and figure out who you are before you do anything else. Find your confidence, set goals for yourself, and feel good about yourself. People are more drawn to those that  have a high confidence level. (Not cocky... confident) Once you have achieved that then everything else will fall into place.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|AONy9Dqjaa	Would they mean as much as they do if they were easy? :)<br>  But don't give up, babe. If I may quote a song,<br>  "When will love ever find me?<br>  All my life all I've craved is to be seen<br>  Who cares anyway...<br>  Cause when it's over,<br>  All that matters is the love you gave away"<br>  <br>  And it's true. Giving and accepting love - of any kind - sometimes seems like it isn't worth the heartache. But if you don't give love away, and if you don't accept it back, then you might as well not be living at all. <br>  <br>  C.S. Lewis once wrote,<br>  "There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket - safe, dark, motionless, airless - it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all dangers and perturbations of love is Hell."<br>  <br>  Don't give up. Love is a great and mighty and terrible thing, and the most powerful force for good in this world.|`|AA11235849	Of course giving up is a big no-no!! Maybe you just haven't found the right one. In case he/she is the one, then the time will come when you will be together. just wait. Even life is short, love is long. Love can longer your life. believe it. Remember, all roses has thorns. Remember that any day is not always sunny, sometimes its stormy. Remember that after rain there is storm, after storm there is FLOOD! But be sure to wait up patiently and choose the right one. follow your heart,.|`|3wzJlMyeaa	no dont give up and im sorry to hear what happened.<br>  but first of all long distance relationship end up sour after awhile.<br>  u both got to do ur part in the relationship...cause if not then it'll never work...|`|mIc4c9Gzaa	sounds like you need to take a breake from <br>  dating and sorting out your life<br>  take time off for just YOU<br>  do what you like <br>  then when your ready to date again<br>  start by making a list what you are looking for<br>  in a friendship relationship<br>  <br>  I agree with you long distance relationships<br>  are not a good thing<br>  <br>  start off with a simple friendship<br>  <br>  dont know your age<br>  <br>  dont know where you met<br>  <br>  things to consider

If someone is not married, yet has a network of friends who they can talk to, I think they would be as healthy as someone in a happy marriage.  Marriage isn't the answer so much as having a network of friends.|`|9Xkbfnfcaa	A good marriage gives you peace, safety and security. Less stress in your life means better health.

TQge2oBVaa	Get a grip, and take control over yourself. I will tell you now. IF YOU HAVE SEX WITH HIM YOU ARE AN IDIOT! You are not an idiot yet, because you know what IS right. Just get a grip, and forget about it. If it is that bad, then break up with him because that would be for the best. If you are going to do it, then please don't wear the ring anymore. If your parents notice that you don't wear the ring, and catch you, then deal with it, because that would be your mistake, but don't give the people who try to stay pure a bad name because you wear the ring but aren't pure.<br>  <br>  But if you don't do it, then keep it up and good for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck... and hope you make the right, not the easy discision.|`|AA10899794	Baby girl I wouldn't do anything against the purity ring because that would make it unpure if you know what I mean. Your purity ring must and I emphasize MUST stay pure at all times.|`|kJSEiQN3aa	Just keep fighting your urges. I know it can be hard but all you need is will power! If you have these feelings, you can change your masturbation methods or you can do it often. But you made a promise to your parent's religion, your boyfriend and more importantly, to yourself. Please keep it, you only get one virginity.|`|wGdKrmrRaa	Actually, the key words would be "your parents religion". If you want to do it, do it. You won't get 100 lashing if it happens. Just be sure to use protection.<br>  <br>  But I just read how old you are... you really should wait a few more years. You don't want to be 16 with a baby now, do you?|`|AkhsVt7daa	If you know that you are way too young then remember that and think of all the people who regret having sex too young. Lots of people regret it and wish that they had waited. Do you want that to be you too?|`|H9KKcYHuaa	Honestly, you're ... screwed.|`|3716fd291480da2319b081380c53c92faa	If you decide to give in to having sex, then you really might regret it. If you want to stay pure then you must not do it. You should try and no think about it, because if you going ahead and do it, then your purity ring will become unpure. I know it gets hard to wait as you get older, but I know you can make it through it. 
VYKwPycdaa	Be a man! go up to her and tell her straight up, "i think your beautiful, i really like you and tell me straight up" "do you want to be my girl?" or "go out with me?" or however you would prefer to say it. but dont sound too pushy or too desperate because you will sound weak. just calmly tell her and with a hint of sweetness say something nice about her, then straight to your point. dont talk too much.<br>  if the girl just giggles, or ignores you then shes not worth it, shes just too childish, no matter how much you like her trust me there is alot more gurls and when you find that special gurl, she will realize it and it will be too late.<br>  if she truly likes you she  will smile or blush or make an effort to let you know her answer is a yes.<br>  good luck finding her.|`|zD2NWrIzaa	it is time for you to go to bed and wake up in the morning and forget her and grow up|`|b6aace0d0ae37de2263d58c90db44b2aaa	hm tough one, sometimes girls can get very clicky when they are around someone that they've been talking about for a long time (your 6-8 months) then they start to make jokes about that person cuz its fun. so basically we become really immature about the situation.. <br>  <br>  so for a solution maybe you could be the bigger person and just approach her (once you get the courage, and when she's not around her friends) and you could talk to her about what happened and try to ask her to stop making fun of you. that way she'll start to think about the whole thing and how mean she's actually being towards you, and then feel sorry and maybe even re-light that little love again =]
pwyfrO12aa	I think it's awesome to be secure with yourself.  I am the only girl at poker night.  I'm the only one who likes to talk about action movies, politics or sports.  I don't like weddings, babies or tupperware.  <br>  <br>  All the guys I hang out with are always bitching about their wives.  They can't even watch TV together because their wives are so "girly".  My husband says he feels really lucky to be with a girl who actually likes the same things as he does.  We seem a lot happier than a lot of the couples we know.  <br>  <br>  I think you have a good shot at starting out as friends with a guy and ending up as more.  Really, it's a lot better than having nothing in common.  Besides, you could end up with a guy who likes art and music and loves to shop.  Wouldn't that be hysterical!|`|w0edm9y0aa	as long as she has reproductive organs its all good.|`|NF7dcAq4aa	well i mean i am a tomboy an all my guyfriends an they think more girls have to be like that so no not all guys an there all fine with me|`|dEse9KZjaa	If she looks attractive to me and has a great personality then she can be as much a tomboy as she wants and I wouldn't mind.
wGdKrmrRaa	It sounds like she thinks you're too good for her.<br>  <br>  You're telling her things you like and she's automatically going out and changing things for you.<br>  I would just assure her that she doesn't have to do these things. If you really love her, let her know that all these little things that she's doing doesn't matter and that you love her for who she is...|`|C93VvIlHaa	like they said, she thinks your too good for her. You need to tell her she's pretty. Or just compliment her every once in awhile. |`|bOjL8vfIaa	its obvious she thinks your too good for her and she wants to make you happy by looking the way you want her to look. she changes for you to keep impressing you and make you think shes attractive and what not. she uses that as a backup also when you guys fight. she doesnt like it when you guys fight because she wants to make you happy.
gflGkFyxaa	just leave her be, i think thats really strange she doesnt want to see you after all you guys have been through, guess that just shows you who youre true friends are......but if you dont want to let it go, call her one more time, see if shes willing to take 5 minutes of her time to get to the bottom of this, if shes not willing then you'll really know its not worth trying|`|mb8VVoLBaa	Show her no attention and she'll start wanting some back!!|`|Qz9LquScaa	if you have her email address, email her. It won't press her to respond but she'll know that you still care about her!

Someone said they love you, it's not like you house is on fire!|`|2YlQy8QRaa	well u dont need to feel anything , it was just exact a bit embarrassed if you are surprised , u have bf now and dont need to do anything , the person who is really worried was him not u , just keep distance if u dont love him , treat him as normal and politely as a friend . He will understand .|`|AA12258762	go to bed!!!!|`|a82cc6660e15c735dd98f25d0b838dccaa	Stop your meltdown.   <br>  <br>  Take it as a friendly message.   Conversations over text are easy to misread.  If he tells you again in person, he's for real.<br>  <br>  If you want to pursue a relationship, tell him in person.  If you are playing him, stop.  If you do not want to date him, tell him.<br>  <br>  Basically, this is in need of a realy face-to-face conversation.<br>  <br>  Get over the text.  Stop overreacting and gain a tiny bit of maturity on this one.  (I'm sorry-  I don't know how old you are, but you sound very, very, very immature).|`|e1dfad11f0effe40fb436063c327ed65aa	hahaha well that is quite a predicament.  I think you should wait on this relationship, at least untill you talk it through with your BOYFRIEND! yeah you may have to explain the whole thing to him so at least he feels included on your thoughts and feelings, so if/when you guys seperate, it won't feel like you totally don't like him anymore. It would show sensitivity to his feelings, and give you another good opinion to hear from about getting this whole thing straight. I can't see this turning out perfectly, because of the complications, but hopefully you can limit your losses.  Good luck God Bless

Maybe ask her if she wants to go to the school game with you.|`|YDD8RHbzaa	First off, I'm not sure why you NEED a girlfriend, but if you just want one thats fine.<br>  <br>  Obviously you need to strike up a conversation with her, find something interesting to say that she'll remember or get to know her through mutual friends. Via going up and just starting to talk to her, that probably wouldnt be too weird, but if you asked for her phone number right off the bat that could get creepy. Talk to her a few times before you ask and dont just ask for her number, ask if you can call her sometime to hangout. Always sounds nicer.|`|rgOnMTovaa	wow ur real cute...just go up to her and talk to her...get to know her a little, like the things she likes to do then join her when she does them..if she's in your classes, ask for some help

84bd3afe1dab0cb0a9e6ad36f3a6bcb6aa	The best way is to see how long he will wait until he asks or tries to lead you to sex.  If it's quick, then you'll know the answer.  If he is interested in knowing your mind, he is after something more.  If all he does is touch you then ya, you'll get what he wants.|`|LCbYye5Saa	I'm thinking he want to do one thing with u and that's u know what i mean if u have heard ppl say that about him um yea but then again he could like u make the right choose and be safe good luck|`|MU6JorCxaa	its hard to tell sometimes you just have to take a chance and if it starts going bad then stop. but he sounds like one of my friends. a good way to tell is to stop talking to him and if he only wants you for that he will go for another girl and stop wasting time but if he does like you. he might try hard to get you to open up|`|QThVujiFaa	both|`|i3wDs4Vlaa	I think that if he just wanted you for sex he would have tried something by now.

gyKHIMtwaa	Well. I could be either one of those answers. <br>  I'd typically vote before B. <br>  But since I'm not a guy, I can't exactly tell you fact, but here's what I think. <br>  I've heard, and learned from experience, that a lot of guys won't share personal problems. It's just not how they are, they prefer to keep them to themselves, because they'd prefer not to share their feelings [like girls do], or they don't really think of it as a problem. <br>  Most of the time they just don't know how to talk about their problems, don't know where to start. <br>  Probably doesn't want to worry you, or he might think that sharing his problems bothers others. <br>  <br>  The thing is it could be a multitude of different things. You could try asking him direct questions. <br>  Have you tried just asking him if there's anything wrong, or something he hasn't been sharing? <br>  [Though, the way you phrase it is key.]<br>  <br>  Point is. Most guys just don't like/know how to share their emotions/problems. [Based on my personal experience, if it's innaccurate to anyone who reads this-- Don't yell at me please? ^^;]<br>  <br>  Hope that helped-- In any way.|`|6b37126c4f3eb7f5fd695fe30c781375aa	Don't go looking for trouble.<br>  Guys don't like to talk a whole lot about their problems - they just want to either avoid them completely or fix them so that they will go away.|`|5MbGYHzXaa	guys who have been hurt in the past tend to just  shut out anyone from getting close.

Zszk87OVaa	He has the right to do what he wants and you have the right to decide if you want to be with him for doing those things.  I don't think getting mad is going to change his behavior.  Quitting is only going to work for him if he wants to do it.  If he's making an effort for you... then don't just jump on him for slipping up alittle bit unless you just plan on walking away from the relationship.  That isn't going to help... he'll just get pissed and smoke even more (I've seen it happen plenty of times) because it will probably hurt him that you're not accepting him.<br>  <br>  Leave him now if you can't deal with it.... but don't expect that you can "change" him.  Maybe you can, but that won't be by getting down on him if he's actually trying to quit and slips up.

dtasRE2taa	ok well personally... i think your thinking too much into it. ... all u do is look at each other. maybe he was looking at you because you were staring at him. at the dance, maybe he didnt want to look like a loser and sit all alone. if he really liked you as much as u think he does, he wouldve asked you to dance right? and myspace. just because he said hi back doesnt mean he's in love with u. he just wanted to be nice. personally, when a guy im not really intrested in comments me on myspace saying hi, i do the exact same thing he does and just leave one comment to be nice. just one<br>  <br>  if you really want to get him interested... actually TALK to him. looking at him will take you nowhere. and the next dance, dont just sit there. get on the dance floor and make him come to u!. well good luck and hope everything turns out all right

a1dd820fb4f7a967392d966f07fe8893aa	If love dies, it wasn't love in the first place.  Read in the Bible I Corinthians 13 "The Love Chapter" to find out what true love is and isn't where it says love is patient and kind and seeks not its own way at the expense of others.  It isn't boastful or proud and always believes in the positive.  This love is such that it will gladly give up its own life to save the life of another.  It says of faith, hope and love that the greatest is love.  My wife and I have been married for over 29 years.  We learned what true love was and it requires commitment and effort by both partners for it to succeed.  If one partner isn't willing to work to develop true love, the relationship is doomed to fail.  Not having true love is the reason why the divorce rate is so high.  If one partner isn't willing to work to develop true love, you need to find someone who will work at it.  I suggest that you find a Bible believing church and join the singles group there.  Most will be practicing the principles of true love.  You just might find the person of your dream there.  After all, I met my wife in church.|`|9d4a7b3f4b0978adf33f1fe9f027e49aaa	The best thing you could do is leave him be, because if you keep trying to hold on, the more he will slip away.

mSpXb51Waa	Death is always hard for the ones left behind to feel the pain and loss of someone they love. He is in a much better place and I promise you, if you just talk to him (in your mind or out loud) he will hear you. When people cross over there is not pain or any negative feelings of any kind. They are now surrounded by pure love. Death is a part of life but it is not the end. He had such a positive impact on your life and that is what you should remember. You will continue to lose people throughout your life and you need to learn to cope with it. Its never easy but you are still alive and still have a life to live. Be thankful for the time you did have with him. Remember the good times. *hugs* I know how hard this is but you can get through it.|`|W4whHKmxaa	Death is an enemy.  We are all heading toward it, we cannot<br>  escape it.

Go forward honoring your uncle and father, but do not dilude yourself that death does not happen, because it does. Realize that we are never promised tomorrow, and love and cherish those around you as if it were the last day. But take solace in knowing your dead family is with you and sees you, and wants you to grow and become a wonderful man. Dont be afraid to embrace others in fear that they will die, because they most certainly will die. Just be grateful for the time you had been given with them. I empathize with your grief..... it will never go away, but it will get better. My heart and soul goes out to you in this difficult time.|`|uxXZS1AFaa	Define death. Well that is a good one. Death is how you see it. Some see it as liberation, some see it as the end and some see it as a transit from one form to another. Whichever you choose to see it, see it as part of life. I think your uncle would like to see you be optimistic about his passing. If words can't comfort you. Let time and the memories of your uncle's love heal your moaning heart.

727e469d9ab03f49b27c3b50501e7e50aa	Just be homest and tell the guy that he needs to let you know the specifics next time, more in advance than the day of the event.  You had already made plans with a bunch of other friends and can't cancel.  Tell him you wanted to come, but he needs to let you know more in advance next time.  You don't have to explain who you hang out with.  If they hate each other, that's their problem.
xJCARQZWaa	You should start by being friends with a girl - being nice to them, talk and make them feel special. Do little things, such as seeing if one wants to go for a walk or maybe out for coffee. Find out what she likes - maybe a certain flower, buy one .. and give it to her "just because" .. Don't rush anything .. just take it nice and slow.
zxhf7of4aa	try to get yourself in a situation where she is close enough to you while you are playing with your guitar or whatever else you can play and casually play and look at her and give her a friendly smile or wave. ask her to come closer and help you(pretend you are writing a love ballad or something)out with the song. before you know it,you guys will be talking each others ears off.
NXw6VQKzaa	Honestly I think you should have a serious heart to heart and tell him how you feel. I think you should let him know that this hurts you. Give him a set amount of time (say 1 mon) and if he doesnt respond with some type of change in behavior you should move on. If you love someone you want to spend time with them even if you are lazy. That is a poor excuse. You should not let his behavior effect how you feel about yourself this is his issue not yours. It says something about the type of person he is and why do you want to waste time with someone who doesnt use his time to be with you.|`|AA10884035	how old are you?a teenager full of dreams of happily ever after? i was that teen long ago.<br>  i had the same problem..he loved me on the phone he loved me when we were alone...but when it was time to be with his friends..i didnt exist..<br>  it hurt a lot..i loved him..waited for him to call etc.<br>  i was 16..almost 17..<br>  some girls at this age do stupid things to keep their man..they have sex..and have babies hopin to keep him etc.<br>  dont wait by the phone..talk to him...tell him how you feel<br>  if he does love you he will let you know by not hiding you away or keeping you on a string.<br>  there's a saying "he's just not that into you". and it can hurt..<br>  so prepare yourself..try spending time with your family and friends. you need to love yourself first.
91865d06a5327a0ec60ef5affe52180faa	you like the guy. hes keeping your attention despite not being around him. you talk as if you've seen better catches and have not felt the same way about them as you do about your guy. this indicates that you probably do love him like him rather then infatuation.|`|AA11476807	If you think you are in love, and there's a doubt about it, there's no doubt about it, you're not!!  I learned that when I was young.  You are not in love if you have to ask.  When you really fall in love, you'll know!!   No one should confirm your feelings for you...only you know how you feel.  From what I read, I think you already know that it's infatuation.  Let him know you like him.  Maybe he likes you too and you'll have the opportunity to get to know each other better.  You will have to accept it though if he doesn't feel the same way about you.  It's a chance that everyone takes when it comes to life.  Good luck!

5FUpwvi4aa	The reason she has nothing is because of her attitude.  FIRE HER especially if it inter fears with business and other employees.

The choice is up to you."  This way you are letting her decide her own fate.<br>  <br>  The bottom line here is if you let her treat you like that, then all the employees will treat you like that.|`|SX9W7BJbaa	From what you are stating you may need to have a one on one with your employee and may want HR to be the facilitators in that conversation. Explain what guidelines, policies or procedures she is violating and start disciplinary action. As a manager, you set an example for the rest of your employees and you do not want them to think they can disrespect you and get away with it.  Remember, you don't fire your employees, they fire themselves. They are given the policies and guidelines when they start the job, if they break them, there are consequences that follow.    Good Luck!|`|WfsMcb0Saa	You need to follow the policies that your workplace has, with her just like with any other employee.  If your workplace discipline policy would require verbal warnings, written warnings, or termination, that is what you must do, just as you would with any other staff member.  The policies can both guide you and protect you.|`|Yhjttxotaa	Wow, You need to get a back bone.  First off she should never speak to anyone like that.  If you let this go on and she gets way out of line you could lose your job.  You need to write her up and let her know that she is now on probation and if she is out 0f line again she will be fired.  Make sure that when you write her up it is clear what she is doing wrong.  Also have her sign the letter that  acknowledges that she understands what she did wrong and that she will be fired if she is out of line again.|`|lB0Fd93Naa	SHe's not helping you at all.

AA11089199	A nice button down shirt layered over a T-shirt (clean, non wrinkled, somewhat fitted) with jeans is always a nice look.  If you aren't really good with color, stick to T's and button downs that are blue or white background, then you can pair them with any shade of jeans.  With the jeans, the shade doesn't really matter, but if you're a bigger guy, if you will want to go darker because it will make you look slimmer.  DON'T do black jeans, they always fade out wierd.  Also, carpenter jeans and anything pleated is bbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaddddddd!

AA10694596	if you find it uncomfy then go to him and tell him straight that you and him could be just friends with each other and if he has a problem with that too then leave this matter and concentrate on your work.|`|8mcWn18Baa	are yaar wo dar gaya ke suhagrat me bhi agar tumne indirectly hee kuch kiya to?|`|EctgWvTRaa	Most guys (as being a guy I know) would deny liking a girl due to the fact that he is being asked directly. Most guys hate that awkward situation where a girl asks "Do you like me?" what would you say? "um....No i don't like you." "Kind of." or other weird things like that. What you should do is that you should go and ask him out or something like that. Unless you're already going out with someone. Then you should just keep on asking him if he likes you until he either says "Alright i like you" or "leave me alone".
POFdWpUzaa	If a mom doesn't like you there isn't much you can do short-term that would change that and it wouldn't be sincere which she will see right through causing her to like you even less. Get my drift? If you are really concerned and really want the mom to like you, start changing your ways and prove that you are worthy ALL THE TIME, not just to get invited to a party. That's really shallow thinking.
0BWISHOMaa	While I do agree with Smilez that this may be a plea for attention, I also feel that you can't treat this lightly.<br>  She's only 17, she's still a kid, and if she can't learn to follow rules and live responsibly now, how is she going to manage later in life.<br>  I think your best approach is to tell her that while you love her very mcuh, you also want what's best for her. If she doesn't want to come home at curfew, then you need to start taking action. Grounding, taking away cellphone, that sort of thing.<br>  I know you feel mean doing this, but you're her parent and you need to live up to that responsibility.<br>  Best of Luck|`|TkVIsxczaa	have you tried talking to her about it?? if not try it and see what the problem is. maybe all she needs is some attention and this could her way of getting it.
cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa	The Lesbian loves me and gives great sex, but.<br>  the straight guy loves me too and will give me stability.<br>  <br>  This is the problem with being, , Bisexual.<br>  <br>  So he asked the Lesbian to the prom and she accepted? You better speak up. Because this is a real mess and it is not going to get any better for you by being quiet.<br>  Sounds like to me the Lesbian accepted to keep you from going out with him. He may have asked her in order to get to you because he knows your her property. Maybe he just wants a three some.<br>  There are many possible scenarios here.<br>  <br>  You have to get it clear. Speak up.<br>  <br>  Glad you asked|`|obOxQxDqaa	Tell him.
0BWISHOMaa	Ok, I battled to understand you a little, but I think I got the gist of it. <br>  Here's the thing, you can never know how you're going to deal with something until you give it a chance.<br>  I'm guessing you're still young and therefore have all the time to get to know someone and hopefully learn a little more about yourself along the way.<br>  If it doesn't work out, just move on.<br>  Good luck
0BWISHOMaa	When I first graduated college, I took the only job I could find. Nanny to an incredibly rich family with three kids, who were at the time, 11, 7 and 3 weeks.<br>  This was not a job I wanted as I've never really liked kids and I figured these would be spoilt brats.<br>  Anyway, the parents went away a lot, sometimes they would be gone for a while, and the kids were my responsibility completely, school, bathes, homework, everything.<br>  The kids and I grew incredibly close, I loved them as my own. I was the one that kissed them when they fell, I was the one helped with their homework, I was the one that gave them a hug every morning at the school gates.<br>  I started to worry after a year and a half that I wouldn't be able to leave them, even when a position opened up in a company that I trained for, I ignored it and made excuses.<br>  Eventually though, I met and fell in love with my hubby and he wanted me to move in with him. I couldn't give up my whole future for these kids, so I resigned.<br>  It was hard at first, but I still visit them once a month and occasionally babysit over a weekend, and I adapted. <br>  You will too, once things go back to normal, you will adapt back to where you were. You'll always have a special place in you heart for this little one, but you'll learn to let go.<br>  Just know that they'll be fine in the world without you and that you can still visit anytime you want and you'll be fine.
o4li2xjvaa	meki, i hate to burst your bubble, but it really sounds like she is just looking for money or someone to take care of her child. deeply examine your feelings and see if you truly love her or if you're lusting after her. she was there with her ex?! that should be setting off some flashin lights, hon. it sounds like she hasn't gotten her life together yet. i really think you're better off finding someone else with no strings attached. and it might be just a little bit awkward raising someone else's child.<br>  hope i helped :)|`|fmVS6jQNaa	I think whether you still want to talk to her is your decision. I do think you should let her know that you didn't appreciate how long she made you wait and that she totally disregarded you once her ex came around. Be careful that she isn't trying to use you by coming with you, cause if she really cared about you she wouldn't have ignored you the way she did.|`|AA11476807	She's a user, immature and totally into what she wants with no consideration for you, her child, and her childs daddy.  Move as planned and start a new, successful and exciting life for yourself.|`|au8MetwCaa	Forget about it.  I am a single mom with two children...when you are a single mom some how other single moms kind of gravatate towards you.  Anyway the girl you are describing is the kind i avoid.  She is the one that wants attention, pity, and someone to do everything for her.  She was obviously using you for companionship and whatever else you offer, but for appearances sake in front of her ex you were dog meat.<br>  <br>  Oh and think on this...what will the daddy say about her moving away with you and taking his son?<br>  <br>  sorry if that is not what you were looking for.|`|va0BUT1Jaa	Break up with him.

You, in your condition, are like that old apple, that have been lying on one place and nobody takes it. <br>  You are 22 years old, whole life is still in front of you, you still should do so many things.<br>  You should be strong, you should be able to cope with the problems as a man, you should have enough of power to do things. Who are you? - You are, first of all, yourself, who is living his own life, with his own emotions. <br>  Now, i don't tell you to forget your love. No way! Don't! But you do all the things to make yourself new, fresh and nice for othet people and especially for her, for your love! Prove her that you are a strong man and you are the one who rules his own life. Show that to her!<br>  <br>  Females are looking for a potentional husband and father for her future kids. She wants you to become of her standarts. Money, wealth and popularity gives the mask to the person, you may be rich and wealthy, but inside, under the mask you will be dull and shrunken. <br>  <br>  If you have posted this question, you want help, you want support and understanding from people, you want energy to push your forward. So be wise, make your life fresh. Simply sitting and crying, waiting for her to come - will not be finished the way you want, you will simply gain more problems that it will be even harder to cope with the situation.<br>  <br>  Take control over your life, as you are a man and you are a strong man, just make yourself better, make yourself fresh and you will see her reaction, you will see the changes in your life for good! <br>  <br>  I wish you to stop being dependent on the current situation and collect all your left energy and put it into improving your life and yourself. Free your mind from all the thoughts and concentrate on being someone. Do something to make her love you the way you do. Because you love her FOR SOMETHING. Something makes you smile when you see her, something makes you feel better when she is near. So make her feel the same, by improving yourself, let her see in you that something that will make her smile and feel comfortable with you. <br>  <br>  Become a man of her dreams!<br>  *|`|6c83086ac56b1873cb365b6abd1892a0aa	Man, you need help, please talk to a pshychologist, and get on anti-depressants, it sounds like you are sooo depressed!!!<br>  <br>  You need to climb out of your hole!!!!!<br>  <br>  Get over her, and find someone new, and get help and get a psychologist!!!! and anti-depressants!!!|`|AA11745497	It indeed looks like you truly love her, but she doesnt love you back and hurt you for many times, you know it clearly well that this relationship isnt healthy and she isnt at least being thankful for all that you have done.

Maybe your love of life is just waiting somewhere near you, I understand it must be impossible for you to just stop and move on, it takes time, probably longer than you expect.

Whenever he tries to mention to you that he likes you, act uninterested and if you have to, change the subject. He will get the gist.

1gOMq531aa	It is one thing to say something, it is another to do something. Action is always something that can "show" someone that you mean business. Have that conversation with her...tell her honestly what you have done. She may not want to stay with you...but she also might want to work on things if you both feel you are so right for eachother. So once she has agreed to work things out you do the best you can and be honest and trustworthy and keep your promises and over time she will see you really mean what you say. When you lie during multiple situations it is very hard for someone to trust you again...even when you have said you are sorry and you know you did something wrong.. it just takes time to build that trust up again.
Z72qPcraaa	As soon as the cops are called on a domestic distrubance someone is going to jail period.  I don't think you should pay for the attorney.

WD2WtX9raa	You shouldn't feel this way because what happened is nothing but coincidences. I doubt that every single time he's expected at a wedding he'll suddenly come down with something. It's purely coincidence so don't think that it's some sort of sign.<br>  <br>  As for the promise ring just wait for, don't be in such a hurry to get it.

It'll come, you just have to be patient.|`|6Y6BRwDnaa	My LORD woman the man is sick. He even went to the doctor. Men don't go to the doctor unless they are really sick. Give him a break.

5jyoVVSeaa	Ok, let me tell you this. I re-met someone after 10 years on myspace, and after  week of talking we decided to meet up since I was going to be visiting my hometown. We went to a local club that had like 5 different areas to play games, drink, dance or whatever. In retrospect I think that we were both  thinking that we could use it in case the conversation went numb. HOWEVER, we spent the whole evening talking and enjoying the company we had with each other. Just recently we became engaged! <br>  <br>  Most guys are a little intimidated by the dance floor! LOL! What about meeting at a coffee shop?<br>  <br>  What about each of you making a list of three items you would like to do, and then matching up your list? That way both of you are making a decision?<br>  <br>  OR you pick an activity and he picks the second activity for the evening... like you pick dinner and he picks the after dinner activity?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|399S56JFaa	hmmm...seems to b the guy wants to go ahead with you for a physically relationship rather than a normal friendship....Now u need to decide what do u want...If u want some fun & ready for some casual sex then u can go ahead with him...If not then try to avoid him.....Don't even go for a coeffe( forget about going to disc.)...u can make one or the other excuse to avoid him.....whatever he is doing..doing for casual sex only .....Now It's upto u to decide what do u want....

If you really like the guy just tell him how you feel. Because even if he doesnt feel the same way you would regret it more if you never tell him and he ends up dating someone else. Im certain you are a brave courageous human being. this guy sounds great and you sound great for him. cant exactly tell you why but take this as a sign. tell him. trust me!|`|VtMlDUpbaa	Here it is:  ask him if he would like to sty togetrher... go from their... so many other opportunities.
yo97gApHaa	You're not addicted to sex. You're just like any normal young teenager and talk about it and make jokes about it frequently. I remember being that way when I was a freshman in high school. So no there is nothing wrong with you!|`|nPW33ZDhaa	No, there is nothing wrong with you, alot of people talk and joke about sex with the people around them. This is how you communicate. You are not addicted to sex or sexual verbalization. You should maybe take it down a notch. It may offend some people. It is fun to talk to your friends and family about this and to joke about it, but you may want to be very careful about this with other adults,  you could get into trouble. I wish you the very best.|`|AA11972404	No, it's normal. I think I'm kinda like you. I always joke around and end up saying something really gross about sex and stuff...I think it's just this age because I'm 15. Or maybe it's just how we are....we like to joke around.|`|6T8pbWa1aa	well, I can understand why I would make you think about sex...just play your cards right, and maybe someday...when you're a few years older....|`|AA11779376	there is nothing wrong with you people just aren't use to a 14 year old talking about sex so much. if I were you I would just joke with my friends and not the adults. at your age it's not something that sounds good coming from your mouth. they probably think that you're not a virgin. I know what it's like thats what I usually joke about to but I didn't start joking like that in front of adults till I was at least 17.|`|J2g3iPyqaa	No, you just have a sense of humor. There are a lot of people like that. It's pretty much impossible to be addicted to sex if you're a virgin... Unless of course, you were addicted to thinking and looking at it. <br>  :||`|gh0YJaOqaa	no, not at all. a little imature, sure. I'm 13 and i sometimes joke around like that. Who cares what people think of u? i don't.|`|pfWaYwYsaa	We are creatures of habit, it sounds like you picked up the jokes someplace and are just confortable talking about sex. That doesnt make you an addict by any means. The truth is that many people are shy about sex, so when they hear other speak of it casually its a rare and big deal to them. <br>  There is nothing wrong with you. If anything, it is them that are being prudes. I would recommend you tone it down around certain audiences (like teachers) and be aware that some people WILL think you are really sexual and expect you to be that kind of person.<br>  <br>  I think its great that you are comfortable talking about it and can joke about it. You are years ahead of your peers, but dont feel preasured to actually do anything you joke about. <br>  <br>  To some up, you are just more comfortable talking about sex (which is a good thing), but be careful who you joke around because both guys and girls might make assumptions about the person you are based on your jokes.|`|wQ7VfzStaa	you cant really be addicted to sex if your a virgin!!
D2M8DvcLaa	Sadie Hawkins Day was first mentioned in the November 13, 1937 Li'l Abner strip with the race actually taking place between the November 19th and November 30th strips. It would prove to be an annual event in the strip.<br>  <br>  Sadie Hawkins was the daughter of one of Dogpatch's earliest settlers, Hekzebiah Hawkins. When she reached the age of 35, still a spinster, her father in desperation called together the eligible bachelors of Dogpatch and declared that day to be Sadie Hawkins Day and that "when ah fires [my gun] all o' yo' kin start a-runnin! When ah fires agin - after givin' yo' a fair start - Sadie starts a runnin'. Th' one she ketches'll be her husband."<br>  <br>  The town spinsters decided that this was such a good idea, they made Sadie Hawkins Day an annual event, much to the chagrin of Dogpatch bachelors everywhere. (See leap year  discussion of a similar tradition of "allowing" women to propose marriage on February 29.)<br>  <br>  Sadie Hawkins Day captured the imagination of many young people, particularly on campuses. A Life magazine headline reported, in 1939, that "On Sadie Hawkins Day, Girls Chase Boys in 201 Colleges" and printed pictures from Texas Wesleyan.<br>  <br>  Many US high schools, especially in the Midwest and South, hold Sadie Hawkins day dances. Even some Canadian high schools have these dances once a year. These dances are characterized by girls asking boys for dates, and matching farmer clothes being worn to the dance. This dance is also occasionally called "WPA" (Women Pay All), in which girls ask boys, pay for dinner, dance tickets, etc. The Ohio-based band Relient K has a song called 'Sadie Hawkins Dance'. in which they discuss the anxiety of waiting to be asked to the dance by a girl.<br>  <br>  Here is the link to what Sadie Hawkins Day is and some history with facts…<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Hawkins_Day" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Hawki...</a><br>  <br>  Personally, if I were you and believed in these things, I would be careful with Leap Year Day approaching, there is a tradition, said to go back to Saint Patrick and Brigid of Kidare of Ireland but apparently not attested before the 19th century, whereby women may make marriage proposals only in leap years.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year</a><br>   <br>  Good luck.

Nem sempre é necessária. <br>  <br>  MUITO APOIO da familia, dos amigos, do namorado... <br>  <br>  E eu sei muito bem como é difícil para uma pessoa deprimida manter uma atitude positiva, mas tentar todas as manhas acreditar que este dia vai ser melhor que os anteriores, ajuda.

There seems to be some kind of signature "move" that he genuinely likes.  It is important, however, for you to take on a "persona" to a certain degree.  Try to create a character, take on that character, and then, AS that character, do some of the things that you have done in the past.  He genuinely liked them.  Practice a little.  There isn't a strict formula here, but if you put some energy into it and use it as a way to give him a different kind of experience, he's going to respond well.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Website: www.jeritarot.com<br>  Email: jeri@jeritarot.com|`|xNsX9GWIaa	Put on some dance music then slowly start to take off your clothes.

I know that may be funny to hear. Before I had started making out i was always the person asking questions just like these. Everyone always told me, "you just.. do it" haha. It never helped me until I actually started making out and you get better and better the more you do it.<br>  <br>  If you want super specific things here are some things i suggest.<br>  <br>  1) Tilt your heads to the side, its easier to breath which helps with longer makeout sessions.<br>  <br>  2) Play with his hair and touch his neck.<br>  <br>  3) While kissing with every kiss close your mouth more and more and when its a kiss without tounge pull your heade away (only slightly.. not too much or he may think your done kissing!) and tild your head the other way. They will know to pivit their head also.<br>  <br>  4)Delicatly pull away kissing and suck on his neck<br>  <br>  When making out while moving your heads you still use your tounge. It just has to be more controlled so you dont slobber anywhere. It all definatly gets better with practice. And the only way to understand, is to try it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped [:|`|8b97275f113235793bc21bdf9c56d0ebaa	u can makeout and still move.. u 2 dont have to be statues the whole time hahah|`|OtJgvbIvaa	Make out and lick his nipples concurrently.|`|ee7ft1Gmaa	Like this.<br>  <br>  Bleh, bleh, bleh.

AAF7WvFeaa	It seems to me that your mother is trying to blame you for her own isues with your father. What goes on in their relationship is in no way your fault. I think you should look up some local listings of free counseling services offered to families and teens. As for your suicidal thoughts, this might sound generic but it isn't worth it. When I was younger I attempted suicide twice within a 6 month span and ended up mildly damaging my heart, liver and kidneys. I can honestly say that it made my situation worse. At the same time though...ever since then whenever I have a really good day or I meet amazing people I feel sooo greatful because my attempt was unsucessful and i'm alive today. Try to work things out with your family and get yourself some counseling. Every human life is important and special. Hang in there and i'm sure you'll start to appreciate how beautiful life can really be.|`|8bc1419f3268344a5964f48cc6672e36aa	God knew your name before He laid down the foundations of the Earth.

Your life is worth more than you know. You have a life purpose. You are a worthy person in God's eyes, you are perfect in every way, you are beautiful and loving. Validate this over and over. Do not let the chaos and poor choices that your Mother or Father have made affect your just blossoming life. Learn from this and detach from their problems. Turn your anger into power, look into yourself and see that this is only a temporary part of your life, and you will move forward and grow. You are in control of your feelings so fill yourself with positive things and positive people, don't allow the negativity to touch you. When you hear the "I'm too fat or You don't study enough" let them know that you are a person with feelings and you don't accept or own the labels they are placing on you. You are worthy, you have angels watching over you at this very minute.|`|QTeVpbiFaa	Suicide is the cowards route, I think it's best you explain to your Mom how you feel and she might back off a bit. All parents tend to be on the nagging side, but once they see their child is in need of help they'll pull their share of the weight. Do you have a good friend you could confide in ? Friends can help you through the day, try keep yourself occupied with things you enjoy. :]|`|dLPqsBkhaa	Don't do it.

pS8YowBOaa	I am also curious as to why your avatar is woman, but putting that aside I certainly feel for you. If she was that cold to you, and you are that good of a man then you will find someone much better to love. I'm actually pretty nice myself...unfortunately that means I get walked all over too. Everything will work out for you.<br>  I think people are bad because it's easier.|`|AA11019300	If you are a decent man, why is your avatar a woman?|`|AA10217500	You pull yourself up by doing just that.  Grow from it, take it as a life lesson.  Life isn't perfect nor are human beings.  Not because you  feel fondly for someone means that those feeling will be recipcrocated.  We don't choose who we fall in love with but at the same time we need to be smart about it, don't put all your eggs in one basket., don't be quick to wear your feelings on your sleeve.  Take your time to know someone, there is no rush!  Take time to know what is in the inside of the person, there morals, values, character  and at the end of it all, if it is meant to be it will. <br>  Time heals all wounds, tomorrow is a new day and everyday  there is something to learn that will ultimately make us stronger.  When you fall, you dust yourself off and keep it moving.|`|4llz4OQCaa	naw man you messed up when you layed it all out on the table. shell be back now that she knows ur hooked.u dont want that. move on|`|9b8674847aebc30cf3ef54007ea59ac6aa	Mabey because you look like a woman. <br>  <br>  Dont kno. Sounds like there should have been some red flags if she was living with her bf. You really didnt kno? If you did you set urself up for failure|`|DeiIgc1haa	its cause girls say they want a good guy, and EVERY good guy gets walked all over.|`|KG2YdaIzaa	girls put up walls because all you ever hear about is the jerk that left his girl on the side of the road|`|Ywwk1GgFaa	because they are so sissy? IDK???|`|f333de5df207a552f662dbb1b45dc31baa	You pray about it and let it go....next time check the person out before you go all willy nilly and fall head over heels inlove....some folks will take advantage of your kindness....<br>  <br>  REAL LOVE DONT HURT!!
ktqfgvTmaa	well i think you need to just be yourself and not worry about it. you're not shy you just get flustered and nervous, when really you just need to treat guys like you treat your family. talking to guys is no different then talking to your girlfriends, so i say relax and it will all work out|`|WkA8UPflaa	Im the same way!!
g1GnDfR2aa	She is playing you man, give it up, there are plenty of other chicks out there that are a lot better. Good job for not answering the phone, just avoid her, or you will fall into her trap.|`|NWx4vZiJaa	You need to tell your ex how you feel, iot doesnt help that shes throwing and mixing up your feelings, talk to her, and if you really love her, you need to tell her that. But if you don't want to get sucked up in her web, move on, she seems that shes just taking you for granted. explain everything to her, and work from there.|`|TRRIUBPbaa	im going through the process now of getting over a girl. i was with her for 4 years we were engaged the works. out the blue she tells she needs space and leaves me for somebody else.same thing as you. i went over her house called and called. she only talked to me when she felt like it.so i know how u feel.To be honest everybody is different. U have to do whats right for you. But remember your not a yoyo. You got feelings your not a toy to be played with whenever she feels like playing with you|`|aURldHTtaa	Every girl wants what they can't have and once they have it they dont want it anymore.<br>  <br>  I guess she still likes you but she might still want her space. She probably just likes the fact that you'll always be around for her and once you're not, she freaks out and wants you back. You're like the wall she has to lean on. <br>  <br>  If you really like her, tell her about how you're feeling. You dont deserve to be treated this way especially if you've been nothing but nice. I personally think you deserve better if she constantly acts like that.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped a bit =]
uJupS3pjaa	something that can't be explained, but only felt between two people =)|`|AA10962956	The best and the worst life has to offer but sooooooo very worth it!!!!
hSa9iOfCaa	Well honestly, you should grow up first, it sounds like you're waaay under 18.<br>  <br>  If you're happy with your boyfriend stay with him, if not then just let him go, it's that simple.|`|zJVQwn66aa	reread what you wrote.<br>  "i dont want to break up with my boyfriend"..|`|HhiKALHVaa	ok. you've probably heard this b4 but choose with your heart not your mind.
NwiMvY6Eaa	Right.... you said it your self SHE HAS A BF.<br>  <br>  Leave it alone.|`|7tPB39hDaa	Uh, stay away from her. Unless she shows serious interest.
pemQb7qoaa	maybe he wants 2 take it slow and so should u! give it time 2 see if he's really what u want|`|NwiMvY6Eaa	Careful...some people are pretty insecure about thier bodies.<br>  <br>  Who knows Maybe something happened when he was a child and touching is not allowed or he feels uncomfortable..<br>  <br>  Maybe he is not happy with his Nether regions and is afraid of what you might say.<br>  <br>  Maybe he is Gay.<br>  <br>  Maybe He is waiting for that special moment.<br>  <br>  Ultimately you can not make him Do anything that he does not want to do.  He has his reasons.  <br>  <br>  Find out that reason, and then you can work on making him more comfortable about that area of him and then HE will choose to open up.<br>  <br>  Good luck,
ba710b487ccfa1c08bca99dcd3575df5aa	to some extent, i'm like that too... so i get you...<br>  but believe it or not..most guys want you to be the one calling him...do you know how hard it is for guys to come up to girls and just talk to them....<br>  with you not calling him....for a MONTH....youre just sending the message that youre completely uninterested in him...i mean a month..come on..<br>  you shoudl give things a try next time...you just might like calling the guy first...try it..<br>  <br>  ps. call him asap....go to that partyt....you might be missing out on a good opportunity|`|2xveInVWaa	He's probably shy or something, even if he's a football player.|`|sCTU3VDOaa	Well you know he's interested, i say call him, and it is nice when a guy calls you, but maybe he's just shy,  I say switch it up for a change and call the guy.<br>  Good luck=]|`|F0Gb6hhcaa	Because he's made it clear he likes you and has put the (foot) ball in your court.  He's waiting for your next move.|`|sHL4wRMNaa	don't call him. if he wants u he will persue you. and he would call if he was interested.|`|NtyOWmaHaa	Ask him not us.|`|iQUDvmOAaa	because boys are dumb(not all) but they want the girl to call becaus ewhen someone calls you your like oh what did you want so if hes quiet he doesnt have to feel stupid when hes quiet because you called him!!!! im sorry you have to figure out that dizzying concept but its true i finally just called the guy i like and we ended up talking for like 5 hrs and then he called me a whole bunch of times after that !!! good luck|`|zvC0W342aa	Your Friend could be shy or trying to see how interested you are in him.  I had a girl ask me out and now we are married.  So in today's society if you like don't be afraid to call him.|`|AQ9cE4fOaa	guys dont take rejection well, so if you call him its for sure, and if not well he didnt get formaly rejected!   boys are alot more sensitve and shy then we think they are!|`|O9DH5N1Zaa	I don't like calling girls houses, If they have a cell its not a problem but I hate talking to parents.|`|65593b11db470aee78a78bab36e9868eaa	He might be shy or busy
b6aace0d0ae37de2263d58c90db44b2aaa	when the girl acts differently toward you, like if you've been friends for al ong time and you are starting to notice more texts, conversations, touches, awkard moments.. <br>  <br>  the awkward moments are key, if you've been friends for a long time and all of the sudden its kinda hard to talk to eachother without weird moments thats a good sign =]|`|b355351f5d15db4a1ff67eada6f52638aa	It can vary from female to female, as not all wear their hearts out for the world to see.<br>  <br>  EXAMPLE: When I was around 16, I liked this one girl very much, brought her fresh flowers everyday, would stop and and chat with her, joke around, stuff like that, but it never went any farther.<br>  <br>  Years later, we happened to meet by chance and she told me that she had liked me romantically back when we was teens, but would not say why she never let on about her feelings.<br>  <br>  Other females I have met would just walk up and plant a big kiss on me like there was no tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Two extremes as examples, and you can bet there are females that exist within these two extremes.<br>  <br>  You want this girl ?<br>  <br>  Then you have to take a chance, or risk never knowing.
nOo5zywSaa	ITS NORMAL. Shes bringing that guy with her roommate. And her mom is going to be there. Who would have sex with their mom home?|`|pwyfrO12aa	It is totally normal.  No one is stepping over the line.  Have you met this guy?  Maybe he's gay.  Maybe he's seeing someone.  Have you talked to him or asked your girlfriend about him?  Chances are, they're just friends.  I'm friends with a lot of guys, but I'm not attracted to any of them.  They're just my friends.  If you feel nervous about this guy, just ask your girlfriend about him.  Don't do it in a jealous way, though.|`|67txJ0qgaa	Well in long distance relationship it get complicated butit can work. You gotta play it by ear. If the roles were turned do you think she should feel uneasy?|`|nDcOTTL5aa	You just need to calm down and be the nicest u can be to her. Don't even think about that other guy other wise u could of something bad. Focus on ur girl and be nice.
adL8Qm7yaa	How can you like a guy without first getting to know him?<br>  If you're like the other girls, how do you get him?|`|rywgn8HLaa	Does he have a my space page? Maybe you could contact him via my space and send him a message. You could say, "Hey, I know you have only met me a few times, but I know you are new to the school/area so I just wanted to let you know that you have a friend if you ever want to talk or hang out sometime. I'll see you at school!"|`|q9HOqUkSaa	Don't come on too strong, that definitely turns guys off... then all he'll be interested in is boning you and moving on to the next hoe. If he's new to your school, he's probably very uncomfortable and shy; keep inviting him to sit at your lunch table and try to make him feel accepted.|`|4DpgomiPaa	Show interest.<br>  Talk to the guy.  <br>  If he's not talkative...talking to him might be just what you need to do...it'll be easier to figure out whether or not you actually like him...or if you just think he's attractive.<br>  If it's just attraction, I say sleep with him.  Why not, sounds like a little hottie alert for sure...and if no one else is gettin' into his pants, why not you?<br>  Nothing slutty about sex...it's the way you carry yourself.|`|olJoqvJeaa	ask him out or get a friend to subtly 'play cupid' and subtly tell him that you are interested<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <br>  Throw a party and make sure he is invited - as you will be the hostess it gives you the perfect opportunity to greet him when he arrives and start up a flirtation|`|uCCyOYZ8aa	you dont need him if your gonna go through that much troublw to find him<br>  go find some more fishes|`|UOs9JQzBaa	Wow, you seem screwed. Talk to him as much as possible and flirt (but don't overflirt) and just use every opportunity you've got.|`|LitPrfsGaa	Walk up behind and grab his azs. That will get his attention
GdTysnqtaa	Sounds like your still attached and hes trying to get out nicely. Let the relationship fade there's always another around the corner.
574twCd3aa	well, when a gemeni says it, it means a fling - and aquarius means you better run cause he wants to kill you, a taurus means hes hungry and a libra means hes sleepy. star signs have that much effect, seriously.......|`|AA12226831	its not real. stop reading the horoscope.|`|Bg7S2I6yaa	i have another question how old are you ?
yyGmLTslaa	Librans have a hard time making up their minds. The process of deciding interests them much more. Librans are the most social of the signs and as a result, they are usually very flirty. However, it is not just people they are flirting with, it is ideas and concepts. They are air signs and so they flitter.. in a charming sort of way.<br>  <br>  This said, 3 dates is not enough for two people to know they want to be together exclusively. At least not for the fussy yet wise Libra male. It is a decision that must be postponed and pondered on from all angles and balanced up to the last minute at which time there should not be a conflict if friendly debate can bypass the process. It is the most diplomatic way after all.<br>  <br>  I can only presume the "then sign contract" meant one or both of two things. <br>  1. That it was a joke at your expense for even thinking he should be exclusive when he could never bare being tied into a relationship with no other choices to weigh up. It is Libran nature to be reasonable but he would never want to appear undiplomatic. He is aware that we all suffer for things that we want but will not get up on his high horse and spell it out. He might like to have a joke around but he will always keep his cool and of course maintain the charm.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  2. Because he is a lover of tradition and is quite passionate about the concept of love (Librans are usually hopeless romantics) they usually look for a reasonable contract of commitment when the balance and time is right. In the meantime you will have to put up with his flittering and fussiness. Perhaps leave him to weigh things up and enjoy his happy-go-lucky attitude while good memories are made for you both.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|51b305981c0d48a97e9fa4c96bfd5b5faa	It really depends on whether the Libran guy is a bean or not.|`|gl33UQVSaa	He means that you are being too analytical and inquisitive; you want the relationship to follow certain guidelines and you want the terms defined like it's a business deal.<br>  <br>  Relax!  You're going to scare him away if you don't stop that.  It makes you appear anxious, pushy and calculating.  That's cold.  Brrrrr  <br>  <br>  Instead of trying to make things happen, just enjoy his company and let things happen at a natural pace.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8F9xsQYnaa	Because you thought his star sign was significant in his decision making process... you are an idiot and don't deserve to date this guy until you become normal.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Only you can answer this.  If you feel like you are being played then you probably are.
w4GfzVN5aa	Probably bcuz he is not used to being in a relationship and isn't ready for one! U need to ask him if he is going to take u seriously!|`|ZNMRYTq6aa	if you think hes acting weird you should ask him if hes cheating on you and if he is dump him inmeadiately i know i sound a little imature but you need to get rid of him

uaYaEVikaa	I think you should talk to him about it, or if it is easy to make a move then do that, but it shouldn't really destroy your friendship it might make things a little more awkwad sometimes but thats about it|`|657b90e00a5d49e90ed17f8b99fc0fd3aa	He likes you. Ask him if he wants to do the boyfriend / girlfriend thing. Be casual. No biggie.|`|L4HBG4pWaa	maddy stop dreaming bout tristin <br>  if u r not maddy and u r not dreaming bout tristian forget i said this|`|8QIshPigaa	Well that happened to me. I loved my best friend. He found out and nothing changed. Everyone thought he liked me. he always tried to hurt me phisically. And would play footsies with me and would always flirt with me. This might not be the same with you but........ it may be something lke it. But I asked him out but he was moving.  Make a move because if you dont right now his feeling may change and things will be ruined becasue he liked you and doesnt now. Dont tell your friends they may blurb out things about it.|`|AA12265689	same here my friend told me that a friend that's a girl likes me later on she found out to and admitted it we're still friends so it'll work out just say it.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	He  should  be  the  one  to  make  the  first  move;  if  he  likes  you  enough,  then  he  will  eventually.  If  not,  then  life  goes  on.  If  you  make  the  first  move,  it  will  kill  his  motivation  for  you  and  yes,  it  could  possibly  ruin  the  friendship.  Let  him  be  the  one  to  initiate  any  changes,  not  you.  What  you  should  do  is  find  a  really  trustworthy  friend  or  relative  who  can  keep  a  secret  and  have  a  heart  to  heart  talk  with  them  about  this  guy.  The  only  thing  is...  they  might  give  you  some  politically  correct  advice.   Just  say  you'll  think  about  it,  .....but  don't  "act  on  it."|`|Jc0djrHAaa	yea man, you gotta have sex with him too
l27zURMnaa	because that sht is awesome lol, I know I do I mean not the whole time but a glance every now and again.

It is cool to watch it go in and out of your hot parts. It is just really hot. It makes me hot just thinking about it.|`|FOkmTvgJaa	Its a turn on and some women do it to. They like to see that stuff and how it digs in and out of them .|`|IoFC3K1haa	Because we are very visual creatures.  We like to see the action happen.<br>  <br>  Plus I love to look at my sexy self when I'm having sex|`|UofOE74Laa	some of both...its a great turn on to watch how we do it...mostly if she is enjoying it good...and maybe some habit just for watch our buddy|`|UOQgHlfxaa	men are visualist. they like to see ****. thats why strip clubs get them off and for women its just like whatever.|`|rYvPRfTZaa	its a turn on and they just like to see it go in and out|`|630ewgpnaa	its a turn on, and we like to see our selves|`|ecDOHHV2aa	make sure its not going in the wrong hole =D|`|huQm20Nsaa	i think it make them horny|`|HequxvSsaa	I don't really remember ever looking at my junk in action.  Uh...  Maybe he's making sure it's going in right?|`|slHUNl58aa	You are a young one huh?<br>  They like to watch.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	I think it makes them feel more into it!  My hubby does the same thing|`|6a35d55ab76d9924fa0c51c3608ce675aa	omg ur right.. during sex, i was gonna ask my boyfriend why he kept looking at himself.. but by the time the sex was over, i forgot to ask him.. oh well since ur question reminded me of that, its really was a turn on for me to see when a guy looks at himself during sex..idk much.. if i were a guy i would've probably known more.. :)|`|0DTEQLh8aa	lol i know ive wondered that too.<br>  i think it turns them on to watch it like yeah lol.<br>  and also it helps them focus on the sex|`|AA11537569	I agree with the first answer.  Men just like to see that thing go in and out.  And also making sure they have it in.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	not me!, i look straight into your eyes.
qqju1IOBaa	Sounds like me. I've been with my boyfriend for 8 months now. At one point, I felt like he was the reason for me to lose all my friends. He just left to Atlanta 2 days ago, I miss him like crazy. When he's not with me, I feel so alone and I have nobody to hang out with. I've never had many friends, we all drifted away. I only have one best friend now, I've known her for 3 years now and we talk about anything together.<br>   <br>  If your friends from the past aren't connecting with you anymore, its time to find new friends! Go out and meet new people, and be yourself. Wish you luck!|`|afZKsnqKaa	hang on,4 weeks isn't long.<br>  but when she comes back,make sure u re-evaluate your relationship with other people.its like she's the bond between u and your friends.<br>  stay intouch with her,call her on phone very often.<br>  i believe u can wait for 4 weeks.<br>  good luck.|`|B4YoqRJtaa	You can connect with your friends again, I hope they will forgive you because of not hanging out when you havea girl friend.<br>  <br>  Your girl friend is important but friends are important too...Do not build your life on to only one person.People need have friends.|`|hYBU84Kqaa	been there done that....my ex boyfriend did not like my friends and so i dropped them....BIG mistake.  Anyway the only advice I can offer is never lose yourself in a relationship.  The person fell in love with who you were not who you could be.  And friendships fall apart.  Maybe you have just taken different interests in the past 8 months that aren't the same as theirs.  Now is a good time to focus on yourself and find out who you really are.  The friends will always come along.|`|7fezED9jaa	Find some new friends....and when your girlfriend comes back try to find a way to maintain balance so you don't lose them again...if you can't find new ones, find a new hobby and you are sure to meet new people..the four weeks will be over before you know it...|`|f11138bf7d392acc1c014a89672fcbe5aa	Yes, you dumped them when you're with your girlfriend. They dumped you when you need them - fair. Make new friends for if old friends does not connect, they're not true friends. Goodluck!|`|zABjC4Zlaa	im in the same prob. jus call up the freinds you lost and say whats up and talk trust me u didnt really lose them. it may seem it but u didnt
tFbdkxyIaa	i'm not sure how you can drive 3000 miles in 15hours, but wow your car is fast!(200 miles an hour!)  and a one day drive and a 3 day drive really DOES make a difference, but this said.   distance relations are hard to maintain and not very satisfying.  we don't know how old you and girlfriend are, if you have good jobs, etc.  if she would be giving up a good job/apartment to live with you, how big your commitment is, if you make enough to support her, if she could find work easily where you are? if she would be happy in this new area?  all this you could discuss with your girlfriend and make the right decisions.  best might be to do a trial year.  she sublets her apartment gets a year's leave of absense if she has a good job and then if it works out, you make it permanent, if not, she can go back.  long distance relationships are the pits. i'm against it, unless VERY short term.  one year at the very most.|`|EGTNlfQRaa	i have a friend who loves her boyfriend, they dated nearly a month and he's gone back to korea. She definately wont cheat because she loves him so much. To keep it going they talk every day by phone or emails or msn. An idea is also to get a webcam so you can see each other etc. yeh it sucks but if your really in love and the same for her itll work. Its a big test. But if you guys dont plan on living together in the future maybe its best to cut it now? long distance shouldnt last a life time cuz its a lot of hard work to keep it|`|RGJd9jyZaa	We all experiencied it that in one way or another, but if it is true love, it will survive. <br>  If not, does not matter how close or far away both of you are...but i can see there is already a TRUST issue from what u write....read your writing really careful, you understand....|`|qmnepywwaa	i think you have to wait,and see what will happen...you cannot force anything.just ask her may be she will accept  to come and live with you.my be she will be glad to hear about that.real love is really worth to wait for.|`|0XbFBbqjaa	I think that it could work out if both of you are willing to make it work out, but most likely, there will be more and more doubts coming in between your love.|`|FI2BvQiRaa	If you've moved away for good, and she's not going to move across the country, then it's pretty much a dead end.  If you plan to move back, or if she DEFINITELY wants to relocate, then just have a long distance relationship for that time.  You can talk every day.  You have the right idea about it - she has to WANT to come on her own.<br>  <br>  I moved across the country not long after I met my boyfriend.  We BOTH wanted to keep in touch, and after 4 months I moved back to be with him.  The long distance worked well because we talked every day, and we learned a lot about each other very quickly, and he visited once during that time.  The big thing is - how LONG is the distance going to last?<br>  <br>  If it's only a short time, keep talking about the next time you can see each other, and make sure you talk often.  Ask her what she thinks, and let her know how you feel.
3AKuxMM8aa	When my girl was giving me head I treated her like a queen. I did any thing she wanted me to do.

AA11787577	I think the problem was that this girl didn't know how to handle the situation. She might have, not necessarily pitied you, but played tennis with you to say sorry that she doesn't feel that way about you and that she wanted to just be friends. The fact that she claimed you asked her might be because she didn't want to tell your friend she asked you because it could have seemed that she liked you by asking you when all she wanted to do was something "nice". I hope that helps you out. Good luck with your love life!! :)
VvbOSbRnaa	It's only 1 day. I would give him a little time to cool off. Some people just need more time to cool off.

He may need time to think, but you cant wait around forever. By wednesday, he will have had three days to think. If he cant be civil enough to contact you, then text or call and raise the white flag. if you get no response, time to move on. |`|NPamPtSgaa	Just remind him of how you feel about him in a text and leave him be.

4257d7ecdf456a73da7bc30665a2d0cbaa	Sure...there are several reasons. One is to dominate the other males. Taking what is someone else's. Another is the old "forbidden fruit" aspect. You want it more because you can't have it and it will drive you crazy until you get it. Also, sometimes people just aren't aware of others until someone else decides to go out with them. Then they open their eyes and realize that the person is in fact desirable. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  k|`|knXlpvncaa	Totally agree.<br>  <br>  It seems like as soon as a girl finds out my boyfriend is taken, they want him even more.<br>  <br>  Right after it got around school that I had started dating him, my guy friends started flirting with me and telling me how their friends liked me and blah blah.<br>  <br>  Its pretty annoying actually.|`|XIrwcr5Raa	I completely agree.  It makes me a little aggravated at the whole system, but its absolutely true.  Men were nice and cordial with me when I was single (in the work place) but now that I'm married, I find them flirting much more.  Must be an ego thing - wanting to win you over from another man or proving to themselves they could get you away from any guy.  Don't get it!  LOL|`|YpflIi1Yaa	its kinda like they feel that they can tell you with out hard feelings on them...like you cannot do anything about it because you are taken...its free chance to say what they feel...|`|pB0iuhARaa	your right, to a degree.<br>  The grass is greener on the other side.<br>  We want what we cant have, ect....<br>  HOWEVER when we are in a new relationship we seem to be happy, or even glow as they say.

That he has another woman pregnant. <br>  <br>  Although it could be some sort of perverse twist to see if she has a problem with dating a man with children. he could already have children and wants to see how she reacts to children in general. I would say that this conclusion is a bit extreme, but hey people are extreme.|`|Rq43axYGaa	I would think if a guy asked me that then he might have one on the way or maybe the girl he was with before thinks she might be or is pregnant.  that would totally be up to your friend if she dates him or not, i mean it doesn't make him a bad person even if he does have a kid.  it was just and oopsy!  happens all the time.|`|AA11052281	i think he has a kid on the way, and wants her to know!|`|ZLlGv06Aaa	That he has a kid on the way..|`|EWWr9MUdaa	that there is a kid on the way|`|dVraPVrVaa	that he has a baby on the way!!!  or maybe he's just trying to see where her head is.
qaHC0nzbaa	Well. That whole situation sucks. To tell you the truth I would have to think about if the relationship/he is really worth it. If a person leaves him they will get over him and find new loves. It would be hard, but in time a person will always be ok. If she stays with him, she won't trust him. It will take a while and a lot of work to get over it. Also the girl has to repair the damage that had been done to her emotionally. If she stays with him he needs to help her. It depends what a person will find better for her. Trust is very important in a relationship and that guy broke it. The girl may always wonder if he is still doing it too. Look at all the bad and the good. Which is more worth it? Sometimes a person has to go with the gut and not the heart. Do what feels right.

Once you know who you are, you have no reason to second guess yourself.<br>  <br>  |`|tSKleljKaa	the way to confidence is not easy:<br>  1)groom yourself properly: it is when you are clean that cleanliness within starts and you'd feel better about yourself.people would also approach you easier with the way you look because clean people always look responsible. no one is ugly, unless they are physically deformed, even if they were they'd have some good qualities too, some people just don't really know how to make themselves over. take a nice scrubbing bath, comb your hair, brush your teeth, wear perfume and deodorant. pluck out unnecessary hair, buy a good moisturizer to hydrate your skin, powder, use a little bit of blush or Chap Stick, and wear well ironed and fixed clothes.<br>  2)do something nice to others: don't be snob..for one way or another, snob girls no matter how pretty they are will suddenly look ugly in the eyes of people they were mean to. and it won't make you feel good about yourself<br>  3)study hard: the reason why there is such a term as "dumb blondes" because usually people take too much time making themselves look pretty and attractive that they forget their most attractive asset if taken cared of diligently, their minds. you are what you speak, and what you think is what you speak. if all you think about is the latest fashion trends, the cutest make up, the hottest boys, then you will never be confident because in the real world, people will shun you if you are that lop-sided. but be pretty, as well as smart, you can rule the world.;P read a good book, learn new words, know a bit of history, physics, math, English, etc. try to excel in a least most of them. maybe not against the whole room but the excellence you yourself is able to achieve. another, thing would be to stop comparing yourself to others. you have your own light.<br>  4)look for friends: the best way to improve your confidence is to be with people, whom you can be yourself with, who know who you are and appreciate you. of course, don't just be friends with people because of who they are, they they are popular in school etc., to improve your social status, be friends with them because they are good people and because they appreciate you though you are the shyest person in the world. if you meet people like that, appreciate them back for they will be your friends for life.<br>  <br>  there is not really an easy way to be confident about yourself, it start with what you think about yourself. Do you know you are smart? pretty? nice? a good friend? If all are yes, then what are you waiting for? the road to confidence start today.|`|sJ5XtzMOaa	<br>  (this is the best site ever.. any questions on anything go here)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Make a list of special talents you have, or things you do that are good—morally or otherwise. Focusing on your attributes helps distract you from those parts of yourself that you think are flawed. It doesn't have to be a specific skill or activity either; it can be an approach or an attitude that you champion through life. Do you always stay calm, cool and collected, even in harried situations? Are you very patient with people? Do you always see the humorous side of things? Are you always there for your friends?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find your passion. Whether it's baton twirling, martial arts, classic cars, or basket weaving, you will feel confident pursuing that endeavor by recognizing what you enjoy doing the most. More importantly, you'll be enjoying your progress.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Choose a role model, whether someone close to you, or someone famous. Think of the qualities that the role model displays, whether physical, emotional, moral, and/or spiritual. Work towards acquiring those. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think about yourself too much. Try not to focus negatively on how you come across or how others may perceive you. Instead, focus more on making other people happy, and that will build your confidence as other people start enjoying your company. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Accept compliments gracefully. Don't roll your eyes and say, "Yeah, right," or shrug it off. Take it to heart and respond positively ("Thank you" and a smile works well). <br>  <br>  <br>  Know that you have important things to say and do. When you feel strongly about something, speak loudly and clearly and make eye contact with people. Be yourself. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise. Don't abuse your body, don't overload it, and don't deny it any of the things it needs. At the same time, don't obsess. Buying all the moisturizers, creams and conditioners will not bring you closer to who you want to be. Those things are only band-aids and make up. Confidence comes from within. Take the time to reflect on your life and do some emotional maintenance. In order to be confident, you must value yourself and understand that your well-being is important. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Stick up for yourself. If people put you down (and not in a good-natured, joking way), then let them know that their opinion of you is not held by everyone--most of all yourself. This may, at first, be hard to do. But once you stick up for yourself a few times, your confidence builds and you get more adept at it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Celebrate your individuality. If you know you've got something special or different, then embrace it—don't hide it! That's diversity! You may wish that you were taller, or shorter, skinnier, stronger, whatever the case may be. But you need to realize that, if you were like everyone else, then you wouldn't be who you are. "What am I?" you ask; the answer's easy: You're a unique individual who is capable of growing and learning. <br>  <br>  <br>  Take action. It is surprising how powerful the simple step of taking an action can be. And the action you take need not be something extravagant or grand. It could be something as simple as tackling a task that you have been procrastinating, such as writing a letter or tidying up that corner of the garage that has been out of control for the last several months. It could also be something as interesting as taking a class in yoga, art, interior design, anything that interests you that you haven't done yet. Whether large or small, action brings with it exhilaration, enthusiasm, and the confidence that other things can be done as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a song that you love! Such as Drive My Car by The Beatles or So Much Love by The Rocket Summer, and walk to the beat. Sing it in your head if you're feeling insecure. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Make a blog. Blogs are a great way to publish your thoughts and opinions on the Internet. Make it anonymous if you would like. It's completely your choice. But have fun with your topics and just be confident with what you write. Be careful though, and don't write anything about others that you wouldn't want them to find! Happy blogging. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Forget that someone is watching you. Think of something else! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't compare yourself with other people. It is a wasteful pursuit, and you could be doing something better with your time and energy. Know what you, personally, want and expect from yourself, and focus on attaining those things. The things that you want and expect from yourself don't have anything to do with how you measure up to others. <br>  <br>  Consider attending leadership classes. Learn to take control of things. If you are in school, then consider running for a social position, such as a president of a club. The ability to lead others and respond to others' behavior under your leadership will help to bring you self confidence<br>  <br>  Listen to your inner monologue—your inner voice. In situations where you believe you lack confidence, realize that your inner voice is |`|fpepCicKaa	just keep thinking how they cant like you for you till you show them who you are<br>  <br>  be sure of yourself<br>  <br>  smile! it only gets better from there<br>  <br>  think about how, everything you earn in life is from the risks you were willing to take (im not saying go do somethign crazy, but im saying you cant get a date if you just sit around, put yourself out there)<br>  <br>  be nice, boys wont ask you out at the first sign of rejection<br>  <br>  <br>  Gl! and pls vote as best answer|`|nFiULdtIaa	tell your self the things you like about your self every day!!! thats what i do i mean i am a little chunky but i love my but, so it sounds dorky but i say look at that sexy *** in the mirror everyday lol!! and i love my hair so i focus on what i like and that exudes confidence. <br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|0QtkC5nwaa	i was told to look into the mirror and every day say something that you like about your self. after a while you will feel more confident. some of us aren't born with it some have to learn to like what we see in our selves. hope this helps you it helped me.|`|ea6c6aa8993676def32cb5376faba0e2aa	Take Karate lessons and start bullying everyone.|`|AA11052281	sumthing you are born with! |`|fXMeHemXaa	you have to like yourself to have confience .. <br>  just relax and be calm .. talk to people and be yourself .. <br>  Im sure if you just be yourself and relax.. you can build your confidence up by talking to more guys too :)|`|G0LqFjaSaa	I dont have any confidence either, but I deal with it by accepting it and still loving myself.

Una mujer sexy es la que se respeta a si misma y es segura en sus desiciones. Segundo. Ropa atractiva. Escotes sensuales, faldas, medias, blusas con abertura en la espalda. No dejes ver demasiado o una cosa u otra. Tercero. Improvisa. Juguetes sexuales, aceites, juegos, disfraces, velas, posturas, musica. Utiliza un elemento diferente para cada sentido (vista, tacto, oido, olfato, tacto), se dulce si lo deseas o ruda si te satisface, ten iniciativa y crea el espacio tu, como si decoraras el salon para una fiesta, utiliza si puedes la ducha, el jacuzzi, la sala, el suelo, el comedor, el tocador, todo sirve!

I'm sure he enjoyed your relationship while it lasted, but its so obvious that he's not in it seriously anymore. If he's texting someone else or interested in anyone else at all that's a sign that he has moved on. Don't let him take adavantage of you, especially since you know about this. Give him some space and take some for yourself to figure out what you really want.
nNcEe6dLaa	thats horrible.... why dont you get off that pedestal..... if the guy is unattractive then let him down easy and tell him that you are simply not interested and leave it at that.... but dont have him hurt because the dude is interested... by the way its that kind of attitude that will end up making you a lonely person and also a target for guys to defile |`|a0d242a17a0afe590645ace266b2da14aa	The hypothalamus is one of the most important parts of the brain, involved in many kinds of motivation, among other functions.

tOzmozQtaa	you should definitely talk to to Steve because if you do not, there will always be unspoken tension between the two of you.  And if you are all planning on remaining friends that could get tough.  Also you need to have a serious conversation with you girlfriend about why she would even put herself in the situation of being kissed by another man.  And why she would allow it to happen...how are you supposed to trust her?  I agree that allison should not be told, its not worth ruining their friendship, and their is a child involved.

Forget the other couple let his girlfriend deal with him.  It was not a mistake he saw something in her that let him know that he could get a kiss out of her, she probably talks to him alot, stare or something.  If its you house and you can afford it put her out, God is giving you a sign, don't listen and I guarantee she will sleep with the mailman or anybody that comes to the house when you're not around. Read this to her why is she so concerned about Steve and his feeling, read between the lines she has feelings for that man.  Where were her thoughts about the baby when she was kissing Steve?  You don't fight about women you fight over whores, real women represent their man if they are around or not.  I can tell you want to be with her but she's not worthy of your love, get cheaters to follow her around, she might have a girlfriend. If you knock him out you need to put her out, you are not in a relationship Steve she disrespected you and if you fall for it she will do it again.  How can she repect you and her God baby and she don't respect herself, she's only worried that Steve wife is going to knock her out. You should leave her, steve girl should leave him, and you two get together and let them two losers get together, they are made for each other.  Be the man that your parent raise you to be and not the fool your girlfriend is hoping you are.  Good luck and good riddance of that trailor park trash|`|nYlRmwUmaa	yeah uhg.. i only read the tittle i would dump the girlfriend cuz obv theres no trust there then i would kick your friends ***cuz a real friend wouldnt do that|`|HVApuswvaa	...

I don't understand why you would rather live a lie and not know that someone is completely deceiving you then to know and take steps to rectify it (leaving her or deciding to stick with her).  In my opinion lying to someone can be worse than what you are lying about in the first place. |`|zfDODwiAaa	this guy really isnt your friend.. but he isnt worth your energy... talk it out. if it gets heated, walk away.. if your girl is telling the truth and she DID pull away, then you should forgive her.. lust is really common with people who spend alot of time together, or have a close relationship with someone familiar to both of them.. 3 years is alot of time to have wasted over one kiss... but def dont hit him.. save your testosterone for the makeup =).. hope it helps..|`|saSnwtKtaa	I would go tell her myself, then I would tell him that he is no longer my friend and is no longer welcome near me.<br>  <br>  Then the girlfriend and I would have to sort it out however we decided to.|`|aC5yIcvqaa	1st man:  I came home and found my wife kissin' another man.<br>  2nd man: You bitter?<br>  1st man: Yep.  Bit him to.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry to make light of your situation.  Since you asked my opinion I will tell you what it is.  I think your girlfriend did the right thing by telling, rather than trying to hide it.  It was not selfish of her but the right thing to do.  I think you should talk to your gf and be sure you understand if she welcomes these advances or not.  If not, you should talk to the other guy and tell him you know about it and that it must stop.  Then you should marry your girlfriend.|`|XxHVjB3Naa	hmmm, i would punch him and talk to him without letting Alison know.  Then he can decide what he wants to do. |`|9aEjKzKCaa	I'd talk to her about it...<br>  Maybe she was just being friendly(maybe to friendly)|`|TMbfzg8Faa	kick his ****, dump the girl|`|2rDCIIHeaa	You are buying a house with a girl you have been dating for three years?!<br>  <br>  Maybe she wants you to marry her??  Three years is a long time to string a girl along & personally, I would never buy a house with someone I wasn't legally bound to.<br>  <br>  That being said, I would go talk to your friend and find out what happened.  Don't react until you get the facts.
CAlmLvHWaa	It can be for a million different reasons.  First of all most teenagers don't want there friends to see that they are with their parents.

1YSJHEDBaa	hmm hard to say, but it sounds like they are both conspiring something, perhaps you should just be open with them both. Tell the one who keeps interrupting that she is doing this and it is making you feel under appreciated, and that it would be great if she could be a little more aware of who is talkin before cuttin in, and ask them both what all the secret whispers about, it makes you feel like they are up to something or just left out, however it makes you feel you should be up front to them both, and if it keeps happening or they dont make an effort or laugh then they are not your real friends and your better off finding new ones. Friends give a damn about your feelings so if they dont ditch them your better than them. good luck hope it works out fine for you
bca7Yds1aa	Well everyone is different when it comes to flirting techniques, but it is a very immature way of flirting and most men still do it when they are in there 20's. He may just be saying all that stuff because he was jealous of how close you and your friend were and picked up on it. He may indeed like you as when you asked him nicely and explained to him all about the situation they have stopped. So there's a good chance he does like you. Look out for some more hints i.e. body language when he's around you... Good luck x|`|hiN1TWELaa	He's sitting with the pretty girl yet he's talking with you and making eyes at you?!? I think he likes you more than her. <br>  <br>  Plus he stopped saying 'Smith' when you told him it was immature and he made his friends stop it to. He definitely likes you :)<br>  <br>  Make your move!

Yes I did say mini pringles|`|IYkis9tgaa	He likes you hun....this is exactly how my first boyfriend was with me at school, just play it cool, only talk to him if he talks to you, but if you do catch his eye in class give him a cheeky smile or stick your tongue out at him, that will give him a hint that you like him too and it's not too over the top to save you embarrassing yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun xx|`|X9egmV9daa	I think he likes you he wants to get attention from you, don't be scared to start a conversation, try talking to him and cheering him up if he's miserable, when you catch his eye give him a quick smile and see his reaction if he smiles back he probably likes you.<br>  |`|hBBPmbajaa	if u like him, just chat<br>  <br>  seriously if he teases u its a classic sign he likes you.

He teases you. he is giving you lots of attention so you give it back to him. He wants you to notice him more. Go get him and ask him out. It doesnt matter who is prettier.

7fa275a0b219d341645d003c4f5add6baa	You need to sit down with your partner and discuss which role you should play in this situation.<br>  You need to work together on this or maybe you would be better taking a back seat and leave it all to him.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Pippa I really feel for you. You have given up so much and are trying so hard to do the right thing, and look what you're getting in return. <br>  Your partner needs to take a good long look at this situation and show you the respect and appreciation you deserve. A lot of women would run. You are a shiny star and he just doesn't seem to recognise it. <br>  <br>  It is incredibly difficult taking on other people's children, particularly when your partner has not been clear about where the boundaries are in respect of your role and his kids. <br>  <br>  Try to pick a time when the kids are out, and sit down and have a talk with your partner. Set out his expectations of you, and also your expectations of him. Point out how much you have given up and let him know how little appreciated you feel. You are human for goodness sake!  <br>  <br>  One 'snappy' remark (although I don't think it was and agree with your side) has escalated, but the real truth behind it, is that it's been the final staw and it's brought to the surface the previous undercurrent of emotions that have been madly bubbling away.This was all going to come to a head at some point, so in a way it's a good thing it was something trivial that sparked it. <br>  <br>  Have that conversation, and hopefully things will be easier from there on. Good luck honey x <br>       |`|acj9mB9Paa	All y'all need to get into family counseling PDQ!  I know being a step mom is hard (I have a 14 YO step daughter), but you can do this and make it work.  You just need help.  I agree that he should have taken you aside privately instead of berating you in front of the child.  Now the child knows he can manipulate his dad into getting upset with you.  He knows he can divide and conquer you two!  Not a good position for you to be in!  Ask your hubby to try counseling because you think the children are handling the death of their sibling badly still, then go on from there once you get in counseling!  Good luck and G-d bless!|`|AA10757358	Yo are right in that he should not have spoken to you harshly in front of the children.  You should discuss with you partner what your  responsibilities are toward them and how you should punish them if the need arises.|`|890d8e6Gaa	It's always difficult being a step mother to grown children. You haven't been eased into the situation by bringing them up, developing a relationship where boundaries are set.<br>  <br>  I have three grown step children, first and foremost, I am their friend not a parent. I have had similar issues with their father and asked him just the one question, Did he think I was deliberately unfair to his children? His answer was no and the end of the issue. I also told him and the children, if I was good enough to spoil them, I was good enough to tell them off and it worked.
ZlxXUTmTaa	Well, to start off with, why have you been looking at his texts? Obviously you have trust issues, however slight they may be... they ARE there. Obviously he trusts you, because he is letting you look after his kids.<br>  Ask yourself: "why don't I trust him?" Is he flirtatious with other females? Has he ever cheated on you? Is this the first concern that you have had? <br>  Its very very common for men and women to have friends of the opposite sex. Don't you? Does he know about every other man in your life? Every friend?<br>  He might not feel it important for you to know about every woman that he is friends with or works with. <br>  Personally, I don't think the text is flirtatious or bad, especially not if he usually refers to women as 'babe' etc.<br>  And the fact that you have invaded his privacy to see this text hasn't really put you in an ideal position to confront him about it. If my boyfriend had been on my phone looking through my texts I'd be pretty pissed. Wouldn't you?<br>  If I were you, I'd leave it, see what happens, and I wouldn't worry myself so much about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck though (:<br>  I hope it all works out fine.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I WOULD CONFRONT HIM. HE SHOULDN'T KEEP THINGS LIKE THAT FROM YOU!

You have to weigh up the pros and cons.  To me, it looks perfectly innocent.  Certainly not enough to confront him about seeing this girl.  Is he acting suspiciously?  Disappearing?  If not then try and forget about it|`|117d78fffc0d4a818e49820e1513275baa	Well, I don't see why it couldn't be a work-related message. If the customer asked her to contact him wanting something but, say, couldn't remember whether he'd said he was on holiday, so texted him to check. And if he calls everyone babe anyway, and it's someone he deals with a lot - I think you could be jumping to conclusions. The x at the end is a bit pally, but maybe that's how he ends his messages.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any other evidence that he's cheating on you, then I'd assume your assumption is wrong. If there are other things niggling at you then I guess you'll have to ask him. Tricky one.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	If I caught you searching through my phone, I would be very angry. I find it unbelievable that folk get so upset by innocent stuff that they find whilst rummaging through other folk's private stuff. It shows a big lack of trust. How would you feel if you knew that your boyfriend had trawled through your diary or phone?? I have many things in my "private" diary that could be taken the wrong way, depending on who was reading it. Leave it alone and get on with your relationship...|`|3m9DQuDRaa	If he calls every girl "babe" maybe this woman is the same way?  Really, being sneaky like that just wasn't a good decision on your part, because you're going to start making up stories for yourself.  Maybe he never mentioned her because she's not someone super important to him?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that I'm 100% sure nothing is happening, but don't jump the gun, and please try not to be suspicious.  Trust issues are hard to repair.  VERY hard.|`|546dd79225d467d1d201310a4cb457e4aa	Thats a big no no in a relationship, its all probably harmless, you have to say to yourself do you trust him,  Reading someone elses texts you can easily get the 'wrong end of the stick'  thats why no matter how tempting it is never read them.|`|9X1XHiUpaa	You need to talk to him about it. Dont sound like you are making assumptions, but you need to talk to him about it before it gets any worse or because you get those thoughts in your head. Just ask him tell him she called while he was in the shower && you answered. |`|r8WkkpgFaa	I would just ask him straight out, don't worry about him knowing you went through his phone. So what? I would be suspicious.|`|ad4fb3fdecf85048c9dfda18c49e68f3aa	you obviously dont trust him if you are checking his phone!<br>  <br>  the fact that he calls everyone babe sounds like nothing to worry about!<br>  <br>  |`|TqxFMcbaaa	He is cheating on you. |`|W9YFgK6gaa	get rid of<br>  |`|qxfK8cRQaa	you should have a talk with him and tell him how yu are feeling. and yall should be able to work it out|`|1Bzw99SDaa	hi<br>  it doesnt sound like a flirty message at all. <br>  Maybe he does chat with her occasioanly or even flirt with her sometimes, but as long as hes not meeting up with her or cheating on you then u have nothing to worry about.<br>  EVERY guy flirts and looks at other women. My boyfriend is great and i know he really loves me. I also know that he has female friends that he texts and things but i dont let it get to me because hes with me and not them.<br>  <br>  Im sure he really loves u and it was just a harmless text.<br>  <br>  you could write him a letter or email and say u looked through his old phone and ur really sorry u did and u dont know why u did because u trust him. Tell him you found a text which you thought was a bit strange and ask him if he would mind reassuring you about it. <br>  <br>  You will also need to reassure him that you wont ever look through his phone again.<br>  <br>  |`|fs1X4YiRaa	tough one.<br>  it sounds as though he is probably innocent  in the way that he won't have been with her (if you know what i mean) but it sounds as though there is definatly some kind of flirting going on between them... you never know.. she could have asked to meet up with him when you were on holiday. i dont know.. just like you dont. just ask him about it... if you want give him the phone with the msg on the screen and say 'what's this?' that way your not accusing him of anything but it gives him a chance to explain himself. my advice... dont get too angry / upset before you know the full story. hope everything works out for you
zka26204aa	Tell him that if you decide to do it, you are mature enough to suffer the consequences.  Stop him in his tracks before he gets any worse.  That is a serious sign of control, and it gets worse, the more they think they can get by with it.  Next thing you know, you will lose your self esteem.  Don't let anyone TELL you what to do.  They can suggest, but not threaten you.  Make that clear to him before you end up living a miserable life with him.|`|ejbSFv0caa	Sometimes the way we relate to our partner is based upon the 'pecking order' we got used to as children.  As adults we accept treatment like that only for a time then we tend to react.<br>  <br>  I guess perhaps that your bf is an older brother if not THE oldest in his family?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you are the youngest or certainly not the oldest from yours?<br>  <br>  Eldest brothers like myself tend toward being quite teacherly and when the person we talk to is already feeling the are being undervalued or disrespected that teacherly attitude can be  mistaken for controlling.<br>  <br>  If I advise my sister having a relationship problem, I will tend toward saying 'do this' or 'that'.  Yet I am more than happy for her to make up her own mind and maybe just use me to vent her feelings or maybe just hear the possible consequences and decide for herself what is relevant.<br>  <br>  Now I'm older I sometimes hear the signs of rejection in her voice and quickly adapt what I am saying to avoid her feeling 'talked down to' It's not easy and it only came as I got older.<br>  <br>  Does this help?

It's the bubbly feeling you get when you are with them.

That I am his compliment.  |`|AA10241082	ummm would have to be.... that theres just somthing about you that i can't let go of and never will i want you in my life forever.|`|gbaTYv4xaa	 "How comes you look more beautiful everyday im not listening to what you are saying but im staring at you"<br>  |`|9HrA1R4gaa	The truth and the honesty becaue every girl seeks honesty and trust in the one she loves...<br>  <br>  scarfed girls taught me that .. despite that i still don't have GF|`|pW0jU9gUaa	that I was smart and funny and pretty and didn't say "eeeew" when he said he loved me.|`|z7fHiAhzaa	"Honestly, you're the only person who can make me this happy.

It said:<br>  <br>  "I love you so much. You are the most beautiful person in the world. I don't know how I would live without you--I wouldn't. You are seriously the only person I know I can trust, love, and want to hold in my arms for the rest of my life. I never want to let go of you. We will always be together, and i don't care what anyone else says. All that matters is you, the person that I know will love me unconditionally. I'll see you soon, I can't wait until then. I love you babe."<br>  <br>  Isn't he such a romantic? *Sigh* I love him so much. I can't wait until we get married. But, believe it or not, we're only 15, so we won't be marrying until we are at least 20. That doesn't matter to me though, I love him.|`|Iqx4xPO9aa	Your the best thing that's ever happened to me, I want you to be mine forever. I'll always be here for you, and I won't ever hurt you. I love you more than anything & I always will. <br>  <br>  It went sumthin along those lines.. I just don't member the exact words! |`|kRie4cuhaa	I like your life.......  or that I was a beautiful person.... it made me feel special I guess.

fIIy13p0aa	Buy two books:<br>  <br>  1.  She Comes First<br>  2.  He Comes Next<br>  <br>  You can find them on Amazon.  Go read the reviews. <br>  <br>  Read them together and talk about what you read.  It sounds like he needs a new hobby.|`|XzSsclTbaa	maybe he has different interests now..not as before..if u know what i mean..b careful so u dont get hurt|`|273e527afee76a6be1d3b1e5404fa9aaaa	i'm a guy so i'll be straight with you.<br>  <br>  If he loves you he shouldn't act like that.<br>  He might have another woman, and a new woman it's far more interesting. <br>  <br>  And don't do things he does like and you don't. Than he will not respect you.<br>  <br>  Hope i'm wrong!
25lWVnPYaa	You should be happy as a clam. BANG, BANG, BANG that thang! I would suggest you tell the UPS guy to leave all packages in the future at the depot.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	SHE IS HORNY .. GO SCREW YOUR WIFE..DONT YOU GET IT ? |`|AA11945637	seems like cause for concern, that is a change!|`|HHB9LUqiaa	What do you do when she walks around naked??  Sit there and look at her or give her what she is probably silently asking for??  As for the UPS man, if you are just sitting there and not doing anything i would think maybe she was trying to say well if you wont look at me like you want me maybe ill get another man to.. give it to her before she goes out and gets it somewhere else!|`|3wjoT0W6aa	sorry that doesn't sound kinky.  it sounds like she has no respect for herself, her husband and strangers.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	<br>  DUDE, your wife is peeking.<br>  Women peek in there 30s or 40's <br>  Live it up !<br>  Enjoy|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I don't think her behaviour is normal at all. I would honestly be considering psyche eval. I'm pretty kinky and not nearly as modest as your wife was....and I'd never do that. Something might be wrong with her. Sure, there might not have been a need to cover up since he already saw her but any normal person would have turned around and gone back in the bathroom until he was gone. If this is just a one time thing, let it go, if she starts traipsing around the neighborhood naked....get her to a doctor...|`|7a9908c7c0672028e9909277215f94ebaa	There is such a thing called "The 7 year Itch" maybe she just wanted to rattle you a bit, To have YOU  notice her, and be turned on. Have you been paying enough attention to her lately? maybe she did it for shock value.<br>  I would definitely be concerned about it. Especially acting like this in front of strangers, and just disregarding it as no big deal. It is a big deal!|`|4lEWhkVEaa	Did she show her naked body to the UPS guy on purpose or was it really an accident? That's the question. She definitely shouldn't be baring it all to other men, but if it was an accident she couldn't help it. I would talk to her and find out where this new attitude came from. Maybe she is just more comfortable with her body than before.|`|yj4lTnxuaa	i would be pretty upset about the nude experience with the UPS guy. I don't mind if the windows open and i'm walking out of the shower naked - but i would NEVER do it infront of some strange men. I would have a nice sit down chat about that one. It's just not right. |`|AA10419793	You should see that she gets in for a medical checkup; complete.  Something is definitely not right here; my wife of 39 years has never been seen nude. If what you described happened with her I would be on the way to the doctor within the hour.  |`|KeEe7iWlaa	maybe your not giving her enough sex|`|wOTecO5faa	^<br>  ^<br>  ^<br>  NO SH!T, RITE!!!<br>  <br>  no...u should be jumpin her bones and thanking god!!!|`|wH1wDnDiaa	I don't think you necessarily have anything to be worried about. Maybe she just stopped caring. Did you try talking to her about it? There may be a reason behind the recent change in behavior, like maybe she lost weight, she feels you're losing interest, it could be any number of things.<br>  <br>  As for the UPS guy, that seems like a good explanation, especially if she's found some new pride in her naked body. <br>  <br>  But if she cannot come up with a decent explanation, or gives you something that makes no sense or is incoherent, probe a little further or maybe start to take note of all her behavior to rule out mental illness.<br>  <br>  Certainly don't be upset with her, if this turns out to be just some normal change, live with it. You're lucky to have a wife who likes to be nude!
5QT7UHaTaa	Age has nothing to do with happiness in marriage. If you truly love her, marry her. Do not let the age difference get in the way. That's my opinion:) I'm actually in love with a guy younger than me by 2 years and we're planning on getting married, and I just know we will be happy together:D<br>  best of luck for both of you.|`|NuvKPl3naa	as long as you love each other why not. however at her age she may want children etc.. are you ready, there are different stages in life, believe it or not 20's and 30's are so different, you will see when you get there. but if you both are on the same page in life. go for it. good luck |`|AA12272885	I'm not exactly in that situation but I can tell you this.  I fell in love with a guy 10 years younger many years ago.  We were together 4 years, and he out of an idealistic belief that he should be with someone closer to his age, left me and married someone his age.  He has now been married 6 times.  He was never happy with anyone else, and neither was I.   We both know that we should have been together, but I don't think he can admit his mistake.  We recently dated again, and it didn't work out.  But honestly at this point we ARE the same age.  The older you get the less an age difference seems to make. <br>  Go where your heart takes you, it could make the difference between  happiness and misery.  |`|abyHvk07aa	6 years is not that big of a difference, although 24 and 30 are two different stages of life. If you don't mind being married to a 50 year old when you're 44...who cares. Do you love her? Have you been together for a while? Do you have the same life plans? Follow your heart.|`|9Xkbfnfcaa	I married a woman 8 yrs older. It owrked out great, age did not matter at all. We did just get divorced, but she had a mental illness and stopped taking her meds. Age wasn't a factor and won;t be for you, GO FOR IT!|`|XrtmT2kUaa	My husband and I are 31 and 37. Me being 6 years older then him. We have been married for 13 years. It has had it's ups and downs but never because of the age difference.

I'm 17 and I've had boyfriends (although way back in middle school so they dont' count) and I've never kissed a guy.<br>  In a way, it bothers me because it doesn't seem natural. I mean, by this age I had planned on having a steady boyfriend and at least kissed a guy. (although not sleep with) But just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it's a bad thing. It's bound to happen eventually for you, especially if there is college in your future.<br>  <br>  Just give more guys a chance (that you know aren't pervs) and it could go okay. Trust your instincts and you'll know- everything comes in time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! |`|dtRkn4Jlaa	Why would it be weird? I think now a days so much pressure is put on having a bf, and being in a relationship. That is not the only purpose of life. There are countries in this world, where people don't even date until they are done with studies and have a stable life and can and think they are fit to be in a relationship. If you want to be in a meaningful relationship and not just some game, than wait. Its not wrong, and there is REALLY MORE TO LIFE THAN HAVING BOYFRIENDS/GIRLFRIENDS. |`|hrXjoSmSaa	ok. it is absolutely normal to be disgusted by sex and stuff like that. it WOULD be weird if you never thought of a guy cute. |`|Sb0pBQrHaa	well theres nothing rong with it, but i mean, u mite be missing out on having like a "teenage bf or w/e"<br>  im 12 and ive had like 6-7 bfs-- its a little different tho, cuz u dont really do anything in ms... so ya|`|LHCljGrDaa	no way its not weird at all u should not have 2 be with guys who u don't like or want 2 be with its ur choice i am going 2 be 17 in like 4 moths and i have yet 2 find a guy good enough that actually likes me |`|EpLhDfHhaa	well... its not weird that you havnt had a Bf yet. just spred yourself around, not like, go do crazy stuff like that o.o but you know... look for sumone nice. & NOT GROSS! :P good luck.|`|AA10516596	no i'm 19 and never had a boyfriend and never got asked out |`|PLATNQLXaa	It's not bad. I have advice: Never date in high school! From what I've heard, in high school the boys have a hormone rush or something, they only think about sex. They mature later than girls. So I would say getting a high school boyfriend, the boy is probably a bit unstrustworthy in terms of having a long relationship. Wait until college, or even when you are working, but get to know them very well before thinking about dating them and stuff. That prevents you from being hurt later on, in case they are one of the people out there who are unstrustworthy cheaters. I'm not saying you have to wait or that all the boys are bad, but I suggest that you wait a little while before getting one. Good luck!!!|`|6A7HWHjJaa	Some people are very cautious when they go into relationships like that, or they just may be very shy. Either way, you'll find someone eventually. Most of the relationships that occur between the younger teens never go anywhere, while something that starts when you are 18 or 19 has greater potential. <br>  <br>  Hang in there.|`|0FSSRjEnaa	well kinda . im 14 and had many relationships most of them went on well until the breakup please don't call me a $lut ive been called that to many times and im not! just because ive had a fair ammount of boyfriends doesnt mean ima $lut i didnt do anything with them! but still it is kind of weird|`|SEtXvidAaa	naw well 2 me it aint nothin wrong with that maybe u jus wanna be single gurl u got plenty life to live live it upp...im 14 by the way got a baby and a guud boyfriend im jus fine gurl i kno i made a big mistake but i learned my lesson the baby 11 days oday...so hope i helped good luck u can|`|43bTcAQ4aa	This is totally okay!<br>  You should be proud of yourself for not saying yes to those pervs, and because you have waited the guy that you say yes to will be amazing, and you will not regret the years of waiting for the right guy.<br>  <br>  |`|06f596b4d1e2ad24a4b330e0272c07faaa	nopee im 16 and ive never had a bf. and its cause i just havent found a guy that i really like. just wait and the perfect guy will come.

And you well fine someone that is good for you when the time is rigth <br>  |`|618a06510787052a1d5cbc929205cf1caa	Thats not wierd. It probably just means you have high standards, which is most likely a good thing. I mean, you have to accept some guys even in a small amount of fear if you aren't 100 percent sure, but if you been getting only the pervs then the only thing that is weird is that not one has the guts to ask you out. <br>  <br>  You must really be someting. ^_^|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	nope. that's fine.<br>  <br>  stops you from doing things you'd probably later regret.|`|S1SHawKwaa	where im from its not but if ur mormon then ya|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	same here, i'm 16 and never had a bf... :/ hopefully i'll have one though ^^

We get nervous, not because we think we will say something stupid, but because we think she'll say no. Look at it this way, if she says no that is no big deal, you don't have her now, so nothing would change. If she says yes, then you should be nervous because now you have to impress her. Don't you'll be back for advice on how to do that, and we will all be right here to help you through that one too. Do you have the same brake schedule? Ask her just to grab a bite with you on break, that's not too bad. Other than that, your going to have to just ask her out. You could tell her your going to grab something to eat after work, would she like to join you? Tell her you made reservations and your grandma canceled would she like to go? (make sure you make reservations:) ) Or you could go with the simple, Would you like to go out with me? Good Luck let us know how it turns out. Good Luck sweetie!|`|TFnE3qisaa	If you like her go up to her and ask her if you can call her sometime. Get her number, DON'T give her yours! It is hard when you are shy, I know, but they only way you are going to get over this is if you take the plunge. <br>  <br>  If you get her number , call her and then ask her if she would like to go out with you sometime. It is probably easier over the phone. I would meet a guy give him my number and when I could tell they were too nervous to ask me, I would tell them that we needed to go somewhere and hang out (you really need to be the one to ask this though if she is not going to). We usually ended up having a great time, other times it can be stale. If that happens just let it go, it might be embarrassing at the moment but you'll get over it. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you will get a yes on a date and you all will go out and have a blast. If she shoots you down, don't worry about it too much and move on. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|cTD1TAdAaa	Aww pet!<br>  <br>  Firstly...girls can sense when a guy's nervous and can start to feel nervous themselves.<br>  <br>  Not a good move.<br>  <br>  Because of this, you HAVE to have more self confidence. Just have faith in yourself. <br>  <br>  Girls are attracted to confident guys, so even though you might not feel it, just ACT more confident.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to ask her out when you barely know her, why don't you just get to know her first?<br>  <br>  Try going for lunch together, arrange work nights out so you can mingle.<br>  <br>  You might find that she is interested, you may get her phone number and get on well as a friend and feel more comfortable to take it from there.<br>  <br>  Just try and make her laugh, crack some jokes, find out what her interests are and listen to what she says.<br>  <br>  XXXX|`|9HkLq8Ogaa	Go up to her and say, " Bom Chicka Wah Wah" and make pelvic thrusts toward her, and twist your face in a way that will make her say, " Oh yeah, baby", she'll be yours forever.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	Well don't go directly into asking her out, just talk to her and be friends first, make a comment of something that's going on at work and make conversation... it will just go from there.|`|iRBVPD3raa	In my own experience girls like guys who aren't afraid to talk and have a bit of confidence over them, you don't need to be someone else just a braver version of yourself. I know it seems really scary but it can be really worth it, true if she lets you down you feel like s***, but at least you tried and you'll feel even worse if you never try. Just don't make it a big deal, think of it as you’re just chatting as friends over some coffee or lunch. Make her feel comfortable. If you haven't talked to her before you first introduce yourself and then you guys can talk a bit. Just ask her some normal questions and then you wait for a while and ask her out another day. If you are some random guy just randomly coming up to her and asking her out she’s gonna get freaked out. If you already have talked and you seem to have a good tone, its nothing wrong with just asking "hey, I was jut wondering if u might wanna join me fore lunch one day?/hey wanna catch some coffee after work?"<br>  Good luck stud! go get her ;)|`|X0EqkaR9aa	Dont do anything - Just stare at her and imagine all these senarios of what might happen if you did go up and speak.  Imagine how it would be if u were hanging out together after work hours - feel how it'd feel!<br>  <br>  But no dont do anything - just miss out and in the next few months reflect on how you were a chicken.  How you let fear control you - how you choose to miss out.<br>  <br>  Its your choice man - whats the worse that can happen? Even if the worse does happen - is she worth it? are you worth it?<br>  <br>  I say dont do anything and miss out on the opportunity - so you damn well know next time not to let this happen again!!<br>  <br>  |`|gPY7XpTJaa	Do what you want, I'll give you my opinion.<br>  <br>  I think of the future, if I was to ask her out and she says "no", then I have to deal with the weird moments all the time because we work together. If she didn't work with you and said "no" you never have to see her again, but sense you work with this girl you will see her 5 days a week. No thank you...|`|cojtDeWJaa	<br>  Just catch her at a good time for the both of you and intrduce yourself and ask her for a casual 'date'! " I've had my eye on you for a while and have wanted to ask you out " say that with a smile on your face and she's all yours! haha <br>  I mean your worried about saying something 'stupid", <br>  Who cares was my first reaction to this question. Nah, I wouldn't live in the moment and do it now, I'd wait.  ;) <br>  <br>  Thats my advice. :)<br>  |`|p6Pd08vCaa	Well, that is what will make this special. You may see it as a setback but it's not. If she likes you then she likes you. Ask her with your own personality not with someone elses. In reality it won't matter how they ask you out if they want to be with you. They are going to like you for who you are and not how smooth you can or cannot talk. Good luck!|`|GEz0iPgcaa	just be funny nd make her laugh! and hay, sometimes stupidity can be charming! i dropped the cash register drawer once when this 'cute new employee' approached me. .we laughed nd soon became good friends!  so don't get frustrated or embarassed if she doesn't respond to your flirty side, gurls think these things thru too... <br>  see if she likes to hang out at the same spots or watch same shows. soon an opportunity will open up nd you two could go together. <br>  or brave nd ask if she wants to sit together on break.. if not, someone else will! hurry up!!|`|f26620d9c3c52a69c24444200e8c4b7aaa	if you really like this girl I think you should ask her what s she doing the next weekend and if she wants to join you somewhere.

Worry about she might say no, not a big deal..Take as a practice.  |`|x5S2DL7Xaa	Just go to her without planning what you're going to say and talk to her. She has to like you the way you truly are, it's not right to act a role that's not yours.<br>  Even if you say somehting a little out of place, she'll understand your nervousness and maybe even think it's kinda cute.|`|bnPjnWB9aa	What do you think? Do you have a chance?  Do you picture yourself dating her?  If yes, go ahead and ask her out.  <br>  <br>  If no, then save yourself the embarrassment and the rejection.

That means next you will be allowed to go out into the world on you own. Scary.....I think you must be in 6th grade. Otherwise there is a reason guys are acting immature around you. They need to get to your level.|`|lGspH4aRaa	Because, a Guy is a simple creature. You just treat them like you would a girl, so you will make many wrong predictions. Same works for guys. Women are very simple creatures, just don't treat them like a guy.|`|icNIfFa0aa	they pretend they dont care and act tough around their friends. alone with u they will get softer but still act tough to impress u.|`|1R6O8ZXcaa	guys are kind of a mystery. they're hard to figure out and understand. but a person's eyes tell everything.|`|Ep0if0yuaa	guys are idiots. me included.|`|HEk68QWRaa	because mind reading doesn't exist.

zvAQf7hnaa	If you like him, ask him out. lol<br>  <br>  =D|`|F7ubafH1aa	Well, yes probably. And I think that every girl would love to think that she has a love interest. I think you would think it if you want to or not, if that makes any sense...Haha. (:|`|rqNb6FIraa	First i'd think of him as off-limits because i'd see him everyday and if he thought i liked him things would get awkward. Then i'd think of him as a friend, then a crush, and finally i'd wonder if he's boyfriend material. |`|63165a7177531b331692b8aa6cf0032aaa	not nessasarly, but for me, definately. if i see you everyday and your always nice to me, and youre cute and if we talk. i develope crushes on boys, just because they talk to me. im just so happy that we are having a meaningful convo that i could have a crush on my lab partner.|`|2gKA7uDkaa	yeah, proabably if he's cute and i knew him better than just in my science class, but most likely<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps!

ONe of u guys has to ask the other 1 out...|`|yX0a9BWXaa	Not necessarily.  <br>  <br>  Girls are around guys all of the time-we don't have time to think about every guy that we happen to see every day.  Then we'd be thinking about the mailman, the principal, the bus driver...|`|1ICpgDRQaa	yes most girls when they meet a guy picture them as their boyfriend or like kissing them or sumthing like that. i always picture a guy at the movies next to me. and if they just dont fit into that picture right , well then they are outta there!|`|Usz27AC9aa	Not definitely, it depends on the guy.<br>  <br>  If he was a total weirdo, no.<br>  If he was a mutual friend or something, yeah. |`|cni5BmReaa	Maybe. If he is cute and gets good grades. If not, maybe just as a friend, nothing special.|`|JOzY7dxNaa	No I wouldn't of thought that guy was a boyfriend, maybe a guy that is a boy and a friend but personally what I would do I would ask him if he wanted to hang out of school. Then you guys could get to know each other a little bit better and see if there is any connections between you two. Then you could judge if that dude bf material or just friends.|`|AMQJ5OcYaa	Maybe idk|`|B3fpwDasaa	Yep!|`|GyQ4w192aa	omg yeah you get a feeling where you just wanna grab them and snog them especially when they know what they're doing. Just dont act to desperate after a few weeks maybe 3 weeks on, make sure she's single and then ask one of her friends to ask her if she likes you thats the way my boyfriend got me and we've been together about 2 years now i hope i helped.|`|R8B9F8k1aa	YES!!!!|`|WgZn5OY7aa	Yeah...i do. Hehe, that is normal i guess.<br>  My friend keeps annoying me and plays hitting and stuff|`|GLXHA4Xuaa	ya, its happend to me before  :)|`|PpMWG96qaa	no not unless you know him real well|`|uM8l67G6aa	yeah i would have at least thought about dating him. as long as he was someone i can talk to and picture myself hanging out with (example: i wouldnt picture him as a bf if he was goth bc im a prep) and i did think of my chem partner as a bf and now he is my bf!|`|AA11398474	I assume that you like the girl and want her to think of you as her BF / potential BF...?<br>  <br>  If it were me I probably would have considered it.   But if i didn't like you then i'd likely be grateful that you were not my BF.  <br>  <br>  |`|mrIzJRAgaa	yes I would have the thought of the guy being my boyfriend.<br>  I mean if you get along great and always working together it would only be natural|`|e0d1e16cd50e80adacbd769d80ae3a2eaa	if you spend alot of time with someone its easy to become attracted to him.if u really like him go for it but remeber theres other boys out there as well.you wont be lab partners forever|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Not really. I would just consider him a mate. Unless there were a reason to see him as a boyfriend.|`|8c1f0faf3cfd3ea5332e16c457103692aa	Yes, that's very likely.<br>  But as easily as the thought would have crossed my head, it would have vanished.|`|YLMpo3Fzaa	Depended on how well we worked together and got on, if we did, then yes. :)|`|kFfMV0Tiaa	if he's cute nd nice,,then yeah.<br>  butt if he's just annoying nd not mah type then nopee. |`|yCoVzgIWaa	tbh most guys im friends with i think about what it would be like if they were my boyfriend lol like if it would be weird or funny or good lol<br>  <br>  answer mine please <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As4KpWTvTGDMAfxNU2OY7jXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081018134552AAlyeJz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  ty :)|`|yUghQsFfaa	um yeah pobably. even if briefly. but if i shes with someone maybe less so. but yeah i would say it would defintley be considered if your that close a quarters all the time. well as long as when your talking its all pleasant lol. |`|dLU0Fs24aa	Er no not necessarily.<br>  Plz answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai8bOHYRvdvJCeqKUr8iLzTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081018143101AAUAO5z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RsuYMfGwaa	only if i found the guy attractive. i wouldnt just think that just because we were working together and talking...it depends on chemistry|`|tGrSGqTDaa	I can't even figure out W T F you're trying to ask.<br>  <br>  The good thing is that your question doesn't really matter, because you'll never be able to get any girl with your atrocious grammar.|`|DmTr1hkkaa	yeah! definitely>>! iyou should completely take advantage of the time you guys spend together.!|`|f7bsWZ1Vaa	Probably if I spent that much time with him.

The only thing you can do now is just wait it out. Wait for her to call you. Don't try to contact her. If she doesn't call you, try not to let it bother you. You did all you could do.  Try to find someone else to do things with. I agree with Ish: you should talk to your mom. Friends come, and friends go; but she will be your mom for the rest of your life, even after she's passed on.|`|kgRKL5vyaa	There is no ego between friendship.

AA11838973	Some say Sex is one of the way of expressing love.......Bt love is something where u wan someone unconditionally...... Love is different from sex to me, ya its true that u wl become close to ur partner when u have sex and there wl be more love and caringness towards eachothrs..........Love is something u miss someone without reasons.........|`|HOPVMVLwaa	love n sex..r all together diff. things.....<br>  <br>  love is love...it's all abt caring..feeling....n sumthg without communication talking...lyk that.......|`|BZgS3WVgaa	 Ya.<br>   Love is not related with our bodies.<br>   Sex is concerned with bodies.<br>  <br>   Love may include sex but sex may not.<br>   We may consider it by mistake that love is a part of sex but if you've <br>   loved someone truely you'll be knowing it better that the reverse is<br>   true.|`|mF3jboqMaa	Sex is about body and mind. Love is about soul. Sex is about having, getting, and enjoying the moment by getting and giving pleasure.<br>  <br>  Love is about seeing the other person happy and selflessly willing to sacrifice your well being and happiness. Its selfless and sacrificial. Its not sexual in nature. Its what mother has for child, father has for son, you have for your husband or wife and you could even have for your doggy.<br>  <br>  Having sex with the person who love and who loves you is a divine feeling which cant be explained by words. That's why the only complete relationship in this world is a male female relationship. Because it can have all the emotions between it possible between two individuals.
G8MVMzWYaa	omg ur an angel. Your so beautiful i like ur hair by the way.

VTxhuetNaa	Just say no! Don't allow him, or anyone to manipulate you. Listen to your heart. If he doesn't respect your decision, then he doesn't respect you and cares more about his own needs then yours. The only one who can  honor and respect you is you! |`|xN5QDXMmaa	Tell him how you feel.|`|828ac86c4aed6b8aab5980e0aa7d0831aa	Just say no . . . he will appreciate it in the long run because no one wants to be in a relationship with someone who isn't just as committed as they are. Also you shouldnt let him manipulate you like that by making you feel bad...|`|bAMSRGInaa	Be completely honest with him and tell him what you're thinking and feeling.  I say this because I am currently in a situation like yours where the girl I like knows it, but strings me along for her mere amusement and brags about how she can, like with everyone else.  So, as a result, I relapsed a month ago back into my Clinical Depression and have contemplated killing myself because of it.  You honestly can't give him a chance if you feel awkward and bad about not liking him; that's not giving him a chance at all, you're just stringing a poor guy along.  How would you feel if a guy knowingly did that to you?|`|w6r4U7duaa	telk him how you feel. if he respects you at all, he will leave you alone! I wudnt give him a chance, you may miss out on the real thing! how do you feel when ur with him? do you feel as thiough you can be urself? or does he intimadate you? if its the later, you sboukdnt be with him. dnt let him control you, you are in control of ur own feelings.|`|wGdKrmrRaa	Well, you said you're giving him that one chance... go ahead and tell him "I'm giving you a chance... and if it doesn't feel right, I'm going to have to say goodbye". Stay to your words. If he still doesn't get the hint, you're just going to have to cut him off.|`|JPqLeKidaa	Do not, I repeat, Do NOT lead him on.<br>  It's just going to waste both of your time. Tell him you think he's really cool and want to be really close friends, but you don't see him as anything other than a friend. <br>  However, if you do actually want to give him a chance, just go for it, but make sure he knows that you're just trying it out, and don't want to be tied down after one date.<br>  <br>  Answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApmwqVTAUtZLKtEim3GRTy_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081020161605AA9510C">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

It won't last forever, anyways.<br>  Fun is fun.|`|UoZWkH8Daa	Well obviously not the one who says youre gay lol. Um I really dont think shes feelin you. Maybe you could give the other girl a shot.
QmG2v1quaa	So you're seriously telling me that you're old enough to sleep with your guy, but you're not old enough to understand what he meant by that. <br>  <br>  I think you need to probably stop sleeping with this guy until you understand a little more about sex!!|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Probably that your horny!!|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	when a girl is wet it means she is turned on and wants sex, almost the same as if a guy has a erection so he assumed you were turned on and wanted to make love.|`|ITNq8WU9aa	Wet umm....you're well lubricated? You're like ready for more?<br>  <br>  A tasty dish? Good for lapping?|`|KdR1iYdkaa	It means that he thinks you are horny. He can tell because your juices are flowing and he can feel them when he puts his hand on or near your opening. He wants to have sex.<br>  <br>  PLCG~|`|1aTgBu2Eaa	He said it because he wanted some nookie..and I think you know what WET means...you were horny!|`|hChy7BAPaa	haha well that happens...he was turned on b/c when girls get turned on we get wet..especially when our guys go down there. its not a bad thing..trust me haha|`|I9vZkww8aa	I'll begin by asking you, how old are you?<br>  <br>  Do you mean what does wet mean? Or what did he mean by saying it?<br>  <br>  Wet is when a girl is horny, and her body prepares herself for sex. It's a natural self lubricant.<br>  <br>  What he proabably meant by it, is that he thought you were horny, simply stating it out loud, maybe to hear a response back, so that you guys could have sex.<br>  Or just simply stated it because you were wet.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't look too much into it, I mean if my boyfriend has a woody in the morning, sometimes ill turn to him, and say, " look who woke up first".|`|yy0LqCP4aa	Everybody knows that when a girl gets wet is because she is turned on. So he was basically just telling you that he was aware that you were turned on. He probably said it because (I suppose) he is the one that turned you on and it makes him feel like he is good at turning you on.|`|wxpo5Cevaa	lmao... how do u not know wat tht means... he just horny... he wants u thts all... n thts good.. make ur man want u... he thinks ur wet because ur wit him... and thts fine.. lol.. he just loves u thts all.. dont worry to much bout it.. next time he says it just turn around n kiss him say somethin sweet n sexy... lol |`|FCZDasSBaa	lol , hess saying that your coucchee is wet , which means hes saying your horny .|`|bJFJ1l6daa	Lol your an idiot think about it.|`|UWaooG34aa	Are you about 11 or 12....?????|`|aad7c2d4f0086cb113df3c6f65d56743aa	well..u should hav known...u must b sweating the whole night while having sex...due to sexual arousal may be...or else u were in your periods..but y didn't u ask ur guy straight away?|`|AEI6TCafaa	when you get turned on your cooch gets wet. girl gizz just like guys sweety. my guy always says, when i get wet. you want it, lol. not a bad thing at all|`|S0S0ucHkaa	He probablysaid it as a turn on like he turned you on so much you came and he liked it. |`|mEdZUBS5aa	That's the same as you putting your hand down his pants and saying, "My aren't you hard", tit for tat!!|`|PbtTJCFsaa	IDK|`|1r2o8zsEaa	he just wants to have sex with u!!

In the midst of all the colorful little fishies floating past, he took out the velvet-y box and three friends held up a "Will you marry me?" sign. Now, they're happily married! :)<br>  <br>  -Go to a place that's special for you and your gf and propose there. <br>  <br>  -You could choose elaborate ways like having her solve a difficult puzzle that takes her around the city and back to you (wherever you're staying) and then you propose.<br>  <br>  -This one isn't quite unique but...Invite her over, bake a cake (with the ring in it) and when she eats the ring, spits it out and looks at it, propose! Just make sure she doesn't swallow the ring or you might have to propose to her in the hospital LOL<br>  <br>  -Be simple and just invite ALL her friends, her family, your friends and family to one big place and propose in front of all of them. The courage you possess to do it in front of your family and hers will make her reflect on what a great guy you are (the fact that you're willing to sacrifice your pride and stuff in case she says no which she probably won't) :D <br>  <br>  Best of luck! |`|cugwFyAUaa	spell out "marry me" in dominoes with rose petals around them, take her in the room after going out and tell her to close her eyes and push it over, then well tell her to open them, if you understand.<br>  <br>  or you could get a board game and have a games night, do a puzzle and on the puzzle write your proposal.|`|AA11289758	Take her for a helicopter or hot air balloon ride, and pop the question in the air.<br>  <br>  Go to the beach, and write it in the sand.<br>  <br>  Make signs, and take pictures of her different family members holding one word each.

bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	How old are all of you? You sound about 13.<br>  <br>  No-one is in "MAJOR TROUBLE" yet - although someone will be if your girlfriend ends up pregnant or with an STD - I'm guessing this wasn't necessarily safe sex.  *sigh*<br>  <br>  If it was unprotected sex, your girlfriend needs to go to the pharmacy and get the "morning after" pill NOW.  Secondly she needs to attend the STD clinic and get tested and she has a 3 month wait to determine her HIV status.<br>  <br>  As for the boy - well, is she dating him or not?  If he is her boyfriend, why can't she talk to him?  She made a mistake, if he is a real guy he will understand and not pressure her, if he does, he isn't the sot of guy she needs in her life.|`|7KRYTaReaa	There's no we, its just her, its her fault she its HER boyfriend and when he calls, tell her don't pick up, he'll stop calling eventually|`|WLawtQYGaa	Tell him no, just because you had sex once does not mean you owe him. Don't let someone manipulate you into doing something you don't want too. <br>  You can be strong and stick to you decision and it sounds like you are supportive of each other which is a big plus. <br>  <br>  Did they use protection? Remember to protect yourself because if you get pregnant you will be the one it affects more socially and medically. <br>  <br>  I was there in your position once, I thought I would lose him (because he said so if I did not have sex he would find it somewhere else). I ended up pregnant way too young and not ready for responsibility. <br>  <br>  Don't lose yourself and your dreams for a few minutes of pleasure.|`|ed8cdb7c58ed87b710366e12130b82a8aa	she should talk to him and explain she rushed into it and that she's not ready to do it again yet.

That  means  you  value  yourself  and  have  good  self-esteem.  Something  a  guy  prizes  in  a  girl.  Also  means  you  probably  have  good  judgment  and  maturity  above  that  of  other  girls  your  age.  So,  are  you  just  "venting"  or  do  you  really  need  advice?  Well,  here  goes...  I  don't  think  you're  picking  the  wrong  guys,  it's  just  that  young  boys  from  their  teens  on  up  into  their  20's  have  strong  sexual  urges  and  they  are  experimenting  with  their  newfound  sexual  skills.  Very  few  guys  at  this  age  take  a  r/s  seriously.  They  can  usually  get  the  sex  for  free  from  girls  these  days,  and  why  buy  a  cow  when  milk  is  cheaper?!  That's  how  teen  guys  think.  So,  be  aware....  a  guy  will  test  you  with  his  persuasive  talk  to  see  if  he  can  get  you  to  have  sex  with  him  and  a  lot  of  foolish  girls  will  give  sex  to  get  intimacy  with  a  boy.  He,  in  turn  gives  intimacy  and  sweet  talk  to   persuade  the  girl  to  give  him  sex.  The  good  news  is  that  eventually,  he  will  tire  of  the  casual  sex  and  begin  to  want  the  real  thing  with  a  virtious  girl,  not  the  girl  who  can  be  persuaded  to  give  him  free  sex  in  exchange  for  cheap  "sweet  talk."<br>  <br>  When  I  Lost  Him...<br>  <br>  When  I  met  him,   I  liked  him <br>  When  I  liked  him,  I  loved  him<br>  When  I  loved  him,  I  let  him<br>  When  I  let  him,  I  lost  him<br>  <br>  Be  wise  hon,  and  keep  your  virginity  intact  until  a  guy  proposes  marriage  and  then  after  the  wedding  ceremony,  you  can  let  him.  This  is  the  real  thing  and  he  loves   and  respects  you  enough  to  make  a  life long  commitment.<br>  BTW,  15  yrs.  old  is  too  young  to  be  dating,  IMO.  It's  too  much  pressure  to  have  to  deal  with.  Cut  back  on  dating  until  your  are  at  least  17,  18  or  19 yrs.  old,  then  your  dating  skills  will  be  more  fully  developed.|`|l4DpWVnBaa	don't give him sex and if he still wants to be with you then you're good<br>  <br>  Edit: i just looked at your myspace girl why you trying to dress all grown?|`|C4gmp1Zcaa	maby your confident (which is good) and dont notice the nice easy going guys <br>  <br>  are you to flirty?<br>  <br>  just think about the way you act and that but you sound cool! lol<br>  <br>  <br>  please help me :) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atc.lRaCMyW3qTncY5dSixbAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20081026190637AAJzgpV">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|zwdGBrUZaa	well its good that you haven't lost it to any of them<br>  it shows that you respect yourself and you aren't gulable<br>  keep it up<br>  hopefully you'll meet a guy that likes you for your personality more than your body|`|AA11518650	U SHOULD LET EM KNOE U R A VIRGIN IF DEY DONT KNOW BCUZ ONCE DEY KNOW U R DEY GON KNOE U AINT BOUTTA BE EASY TO BED SO ONCE DEY KNOW IF DEY KEEP TRYNA DEN DAS HOW U KNO FA SHO BUH IF DEY STOP TRYNA GET IN UR PANTSZ BUH YALL STILL KOO ND DASSZ A GOOD 1 |`|s7z0n41naa	Well going by your myspace pic I would say you are very hot which does explain why these guys want to have sex with you.  I would suggest you look for guys who are not all wanting to just jump you from the beginning you can tell a guy is serious about you if he's real with you meaning he tells you his honest opinons and doesn't try to give you tons of attention.  In other words the guys that seem hard to get.  You see if you meet a guy like this it means he doesn't think you are all that and would rather get to know you personally and see if he really likes you first.  Remember since you are attractive you could practically get any guy you want but he should be the one who is original, funny, and not overly obsessed with you.    |`|lGb2DqNFaa	ok how i tell if he just wants sex is if he's allll over you and really touchy feely. and when a guy that maybe wants a relationship with you will usually be sweet about things like holding hands instead of throwing his arm around your waist, or he'll do things like talk about things going on in his life besides other girls. He'll also asked more about what's going on with you.|`|QwYo4tWcaa	I feel you yes and most men are dogs but not all, and your way to young to be doing anything adult like missy :). To answer your question to know if a guy wants you for who you are or just for sex it's rather simple at least to me. A guy who wants you for who you are won't need sex AT ALLLLLLLL!!!!! They would be content and happy with just being with you.|`|98924136c94b588b0b1be4836218f58faa	There are ALOT of duds out there and its hard to find a genuine decent guy<br>  <br>  Just get to know them well - there true colours WILL come out - then you can choose to walk away if they disrespect you <br>  <br>  Good luck - just keep moving on till you find a guy who truly respects you - and women in general!!|`|kYuiWaR9aa	You will know it is the right guy when that guy is different from all the others.  That guy will not pressure you into sex if he cares about you if he does he prolly just want sex and only sex.

But you will find one your young you have better things to live for when the right guy comes along you will know it. <br>  By the way some of the pictures your taking that I saw on your myspace probally attract the wrong kind of guys .Its like if a guys sees most of your body in a picture before he even gets to know your personallity then he will most likely be more intrested in getting in your pants then getting to know you.<br>  Just a suggestion.<br>  by the way your a very pretty girl you dont need to show your body like that.|`|VQb9J4fDaa	It sounds like you are a nice person, someone interesting and lots of people would like to get to know you. Problem is too many people equate "nice" with "stupid" which is very far from the truth!<br>  <br>  They might also be picking up on the fact that you would like a relationship, and figure they might be able to manipulate you into doing something you really aren't ready to do!<br>  <br>  Make sure you are not talking about sex, or hinting at sex, or even joking about it...that also gives off a vibe that you are looking "only for that" and there will always be some guy willing to give it a go if you are!! Sad but true...<br>  <br>  Try to think about how you really come off to people, what you sound like and how you respond to them. You may pick up on something you didn't see before, something you don't like and you can fix it and get the people you want to become attracted to you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

I know it sounds cliche, but the simplest gestures can signal waves to a girl. Look after her best interests, keep up to date with her life, be sensitive, affectionate, but also give her the respect of being her own person. I'm sure you spend hours thinking about her, let that reciprocate in your actions. In due time, she'll be saying "I love you more". |`|PH32ZB4Haa	say " i love you as much as my pet monkey bilbo who pees on the floor everyday. you and bilbo are the most specialist things in the universe to me."<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOOOO BILBO!!!!! :D|`|Bngsrgpgaa	Look her in the eyes and say it confiently.

Then she might believe you|`|S1NxVTG2aa	She might being trying to not take you seriously for fear of being hurt.

WAgPWa7taa	Ok. The one big step that you need to take when trying to approach a girl is fear.<br>  Just think about it, what do you have to lose? Nothing is usually the answer.<br>  <br>  And how would you usually talk to friends? <br>  <br>  Just talk about anything. If she's wearing a nice shirt, just say nice shirt and comment on the brand name or something. Just take it easy as if you are talking to your friend.<br>  <br>  Or if she's in your class talk about something that you have a deadline to meet. Ask her if she did it or maybe make your self as if you have a question about it and take it from there.<br>  <br>  There are so many things to talk about. You just have to make sure that you don't think too hard on how to set up the question. That usually leads to people messing up. Just talk. Don't think. Talk!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS. She's only 1 girl, there are more than 3,301,112,087 females in the world. That's half the world population (but the majority is females). So if it doesn't work. you only lost... NOTHING. it just means that you eliminated 1 more out of your way to get to the right one :)<br>  <br>  |`|D5JCLssDaa	If you are smart and independent, get stupid and dependent real fast. Women love to help a helpless guy. Walk by her table act like you are deciding what to get for lunch and say "excuse me, I was not sure whether to get the spaghetti or the chicken soup and sandwich. What do you think I should get?" <br>  If she likes you she too will come up with an excuse to get and keep the conversation going.<br>  Trust me. Women love dumb guys. Look at Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. You can't get any dumber than Joe Black. He's an idiot, but he's smart enough to bag Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie in the same century.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	Talk about class.<br>  What shes doing after school.<br>  Parties coming up.<br>  The Weather.<br>  What time is it?|`|zCwq8q61aa	just walk up and say hey.<br>  thats SO cute on its own :D|`|0uutO87Uaa	say i like your penis|`|YMkWwEmWaa	look the best this to do is just walk up and say hey sorry but your cute and i have to say hi, then tell a joke ask her hows life, and find out about her don't forget the stuff she says you can use it to reference back at and laugh at. trust me i have been dating and sleeping around for quite some time. |`|9SC6J5Y2aa	just say hi how are you|`|YNX5J1fbaa	Try making light funny comments like " we should stop meeting like this" then laugh or smile and say hey, a few times let her know your confident and not full of yourself.

Now matter how many positive qualities you display, you must learn to approach women and engage them in a conversation. If you know great conversation starters, then you'll instantly create an engaging discussion.<br>  <br>  So if you're interested in attracting the women you see, then I recommend you use the following great conversation starters.<br>  <br>  1- Use normal approach techniques<br>  <br>  Let me emphasis ONE thing...<br>  <br>  Pick-up lines NEVER work!<br>  <br>  Instead of attempting to use a canned pick up line, it's important to use a more natural approach. In fact, it's often better to use a direct approach to start talking to women. This means if you're interested in a woman and want to talk to her, all you have to do is simply introduce yourself. Then you allow the discussion to unfold.<br>  <br>  What's funny is many guys are looking for the perfect conversation starter. However the simple truth is a great way to talk to a woman is to just use a natural approach. If you have confidence and avoid the pickup lines used by other guys, then you'll impress her with your straightforward manner.<br>  <br>  2- Use the cocky/funny approach <br>  <br>  Being humorous with a touch of arrogance is my personal favorite of these great conversation starters. Specifically this approach is often called "cocky/funny".<br>  <br>  Made famous by seduction guru David DeAngelo, the cocky/funny technique involves approaching a woman with a slightly arrogant manner while demonstrating a funny personality which gets her to laugh. The purpose behind this technique is to give yourself higher status and make HER work for YOUR attention.<br>  <br>  Cocky/funny is a fun way to approach a woman because you come in with high energy and instantly provide her with excitement. Then all you have to do is let the conversation evolve into sexual banter.<br>  <br>  3- Use a complimentary comment<br>  <br>  Great conversation starters can often be initiated by simply complimenting a woman. Unlike corny pickup lines, a nice comment is well-thought out and shows tact.<br>  <br>  Just remember one thing. When you compliment a woman, ALWAYS focus on something instead of her looks. The goal is to start a conversation by giving a genuine compliment on something she can control like the way she dresses or her personality. By doing this, you're demonstrating that you pay attention and you like her UNIQUE personality.<br>  <br>  4- Use a situational conversation starter<br>  <br>  The final way to initiate a conversation is to use a 'situational opener'. This technique involves using specific incident as a reason to start talking to a woman. It involves seeing something interesting around you and then casually using it to parlay into a conversation with a woman.<br>  <br>  For instance, say you witness a really drunk guy making a jerk of himself. You can use this incident to start talking to girls who are near this guy.<br>  <br>  All four of these great conversation starters provide a wonderful way to start talking to a woman. Since each provides a natural to approach a girl, you won't trigger her defense mechanisms like you would with a canned pick up line. Now all you have to is get out there and use them on women you're interested in.<br>  <br>  |`|BXR26DqWaa	Just go up to her and talk to her, if she likes you then the conversation will come naturally. Maybe you could complement her on her hair or clothing. |`|SXromrn5aa	(Italian accent)<br>  "Hey yo!, You wanna go inda batroom and bang it out, eh?"<br>  "I like ya shoods by da way"<br>  <br>  <br>  seriously just say hey.  <br>  |`|J2Qz7TMHaa	Tell her she looks nice.<br>  Ask her how she is doing.<br>  Don't sweet talk her immediately just become friends and see where that goes<br>  :]<br>  good luck|`|tLZU6A6qaa	Pay her a compliment on something she is wearing.|`|Q56cd8n0aa	ASK her for her and number|`|bjHgqxNlaa	ask for her name and that should get it started then you could ask for her screename|`|sRKO8s6jaa	Choose from two of the greatest words in the English language when it comes to conversation starting.<br>  <br>  Hello<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Hi|`|AT0e3xwAaa	Be completely Honest in your approach. Incincerity may get your foot in the door but when she finds out your a fake you'll get a boot in the @$$. Muster up all the courage you can find (tune out your friends at this time) walk up to her and tell her you have been noticing her for a while and you could not figure out how to approach her without seeming like a jerk and what advice would she give you. This will tell you <br>  A is she interested<br>  B Info on what impresses her<br>  C an idea which way to go.<br>  <br>  I have found in my 43 years of life that Honesty is best policy<br>  <br>  Good luck and dont worry if she turns you down. Just be yourself|`|a72031f1266da84a2e7ee90bb32ae02caa	Maybe try something really original that she's never heard before.  Like, "Hey (insert name) how's it going?" , then after she answers follow through with a, "I was wondering if you want to hang out sometime?",  if she says "yes" then set up a time and date.  If she says "NO" , then say "OK", and walk away smiling because she's not worth anymore of your time at this point.  |`|CoOd51qQaa	haha um yeah same thing happened with me and this guy. and one time after lunch he came up to me when i was on my way to class and was like i noticed you checkin me out at lunch. but make sure you do it in a jokey way so she doesnt think your really cocky. anyways i thought it was funny. haha try it|`|1hQrEsu7aa	If you two have the same teacher then go over and ask if she can help you.(even if you know, just play along)<br>  |`|LFJNP3Lkaa	fake an accident make her help then talk |`|ZODxj85Eaa	hi.|`|k16ZvPgzaa	so yeah i like you <br>  wanna go out|`|Ig90mcXwaa	be like hey i see you around  a lot<br>  my name is _________<br>  and yours?|`|LE7Corlkaa	be like hey whats up?|`|fqK8RG6vaa	small talk go up to her ask avout her day her life interests it will work i got a very shy girl to open up to me greatly usin that<br>  <br>  plz help<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An7IsLK95FKXyKXaPrwJRk7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081027172113AAYYiQZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|k5HRUkFiaa	simple as hey wazzup? lol see not so hard =).....help me ppl =) <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081027172622AAp3Q7V">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|fdp7c8Gzaa	Compliment her on something she's wearing.|`|lElncioqaa	"I'm not sure why you're staring at my back, but I've got a hunch."
UOXHVCpoaa	Yes things could work out but its mainly up to both of you guys because then if both of you guys have to have a connection like he said then things will work out with you two. See even if things work out then you will still have to communicate cause things aren't always gonna be sweet and caring like everyone thinks fyi I am going through that with my boyfriend!!!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	you look like you're having phone sex|`|JsIZ9F0Qaa	I say go out with him on sunday and see how things go. Who knows you might end up not liking him. Or maybe he will see the person you said you are. Just be prepared for either outcome because you don't want to get your hopes up just to have them crushed. Either way, I'm sure you can do better. He's obviously still getting over some issues from his past relationships and you don't want that brought into your relationship with him if he chooses that. |`|I6YPgPNeaa	omg. have some dignity and back off a little. you are basically crawling all over him, and its pathetic. he's basically saying he's gonna give you a chance if you behave well. <br>  <br>  back off and he'll come chasing you. trust me. he's not tough. stop telling him you want to be with him. just stop that all together. it'll be for your benefit. |`|NPmVwmxbaa	Since he is in college, not collage, and you are still in high school learning to spell, I would say you are worlds apart.  Besides since you aren't 18 yet, and if he gets you in trouble, since he is over 18, he can get in trouble with the law, and with your parents for child sex crimes. I would recommend seeing him as a friend with a parent or older relative as a chaperone, until you turn 18, and graduate from high school.<br>  <br>  When you are 18, and he is 21, the difference won't be as great. And he will be more comfortable <br>  <br>  |`|zRFvk96Eaa	In my opinion he has the right idea. You meet people, and date, but don't have any expectations ether way. Often I've known people who are looking for a relationship, they meet someone and try to squat that person into the roll they want. <br>   People often say they meet someone when they're not looking for a relationship. I think this is because they start out with no expectations. <br>  If your only 17 you have tons of time to meet alot of people and figure out what you want in a relationship. If it happens with this guy - hooray! if not, that's cool too. <br>   You seem really concerned with what he thinks of you, but remember it's just as possible that he wont suit you at all. <br>  <br>  Try to have fun and just let what ever happens happen!|`|zg6sgA3faa	I'm 17 and in college and I'm dating a 23 year old. Me and him are extremely compatible despite the odds of a 6 years age gap. Just take it slow and let everything be on your terms. People are going to say **** against y'all because they think age means everything but it doesn't.<br>  <br>  We are both living proof of that. Just don't'  act like a little kid and be mature and yourself. Don't get pressured into anything. I hope he is really into you.|`|nmiArrmxaa	try and stick to someone more your age because if hes away at college there might be a lot of temptation for him, so in the long run you r going to be the one getting hurt.|`|TsSv1PGZaa	That's only a three year difference. It's really not that weird.<br>  Also, if you are referring to school, its "college" not "collage"|`|ba60dd0df93da088e2288387c7eb0296aa	he is  mentally changing faster. if she can't keep up, the relationship might not work. |`|hGteO5Rfaa	Eh I think  you and him can find better. It doesn't seem like you're on the same wavelength. Your call though.|`|4NP3g2rdaa	"but he said that i will have to show it to him in time...."<br>  <br>  that sounds a little suss. lol  if he really wanted u he would make just as much effort.  he sounds like hes taking u for a little ride.  he knows u like hima nd u convincing him on everything.  ask urself, is he really keen too?  he makes excuses as to why hes keen but him saying he just wants to have fun is college term for i just want to mess around with a few girls whikle im in college which is what usually happens.  doesnt really seem credible that he wants to be with u.  dont crush urself.  perhaps find someone that is more interested? its not the age im worried about, its the fact that hes telling you that u have to show him.  relationships are about both sides of the fence making an effort.  donrt get sucked in. by the sounds ur smart so get away dude.  sex or anything physical is absolute rubbish and is no way showing him anything.  thats him saying im gonna waste ur time and hurt u.  get out be fore u get in.  and dont take life too seriously, ul  never get out alive.  u remember that\<br>  <br>  goodluck<br>  <br>  -Amz 19 Australia
1RzVIFJvaa	No just be with someone that you like and you chose your friends|`|koZLsY28aa	no|`|cTM6vQeBaa	Not at all! Those are the best kind of best friends.|`|eulkgK0Daa	i do not believe that there is a problem with having a best friend of the opposite sex. actually i think it is really a good idea. having someone of the opposite sex opens your mind to see things from the opposite sex prospective.  do not let your friendship turn into a intimate relationship unless that is what both of you are sure you want. it is hard to keep the relationship the same after intimacy. |`|flAR8qT5aa	Absolutely not!  Growing up, I always had a best friend of the same sex, but there's nothing wrong with having a best friend of the opposite sex.  My husband is actually my best friend...  I don't think I could marry someone who wasn't my best friend, but being best friends with the opposite sex doesn't have to mean romance; it can be strictly platonic.|`|AA10973373	No. Why would that be wrong? My best friend is a man and I think that's the best thing ever! Course, he is gay---so maybe that makes it even better. We are like Will and Grace. |`|OyByMfzTaa	I Really dont think so. I dont see why not if you guys are really cool with each other|`|CNIKIIq8aa	No there is nothing wrong with it at all. Some of my closest friends are males. It is nice to get opinions from a male perspective other than my husbands sometimes. It is made quite clear though that it is a friendship only and nothing more can happen to all parties since I am married.|`|DY5j73Nmaa	Definetly not. My best friend is female :)<br>  <br>  Sometimes its a great idea to have a friend of the opposite gender as they can also help you understand the opposite sex.|`|5KrK4JZzaa	Of course not!<br>  <br>  There are a lot of things that opposite genders might have in common.<br>  <br>  As long as you are friends, it doesn't matter who you are.|`|IonMKIP1aa	0_0 no because its ok to have a friend with ur opposite gender nothings wrong with that :]
00mE1I7Baa	When you reach puberty, your body starts producing more oil than it did in childhood.  This oil causes pimples.<br>  <br>  It has no connection to your emotional state; that myth might have started because teenagers always think they're in love.|`|mKCiofUFaa	It's puberty. I had pimples when I was a teenager, like tons of tiny little ones. 
Gs25ltjQaa	well idk if this is what youre looking for but my boyfriend just told me that this song makes him think of me and our relationship soo yea its "with me" by sum 41 its kinda well known-ish. lol.
rsYn5G01aa	YES it is normal. Guess what guys like boobs and ***. Big deal, I'm sure he loves lookin at yours even more so really come on. I once heard someone say if you have not found a guys porn stash that means you are not looking hard enough. This does not mean that he loves you any less or finds you any less attractive. Guys like looking at women and looking at naked women even better. that's it, let him have his magazines and you have your Chippendales calender and life goes on. I honestly think any girl who told a guy he could not have his silly girly magazines is controlling and insecure, just my 2 cents.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I don't like it, I don't think that they would want us drooling or even just looking at naked or scantily clothed guys. But somehow guys see it differently. I don't know if it's "normal" or not, but I know that a lot of guys do it. You should have a Playgirl magazine or something out the next time he comes over, and say "Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to put that up". Your response to whatever he says should be "Well, you gave me the idea".<br>  If it's okay for you, it's okay for me right" ????<br>  Oh So Sweetly!!!!<br>  |`|7025a6c6a18e110fc5a6cbaa84055a0baa	Well, I think its a tad disgusting too. However it's normal. If they are not watching porn on the internet then they look at nude mags. As long as his "dirty habit" doesn't interferre with your relationship with him, then I guess let it go, unless he wants you to look like them then I'd give him the boot. I always belive what I don't know won't hurt me but it sounds to me like he respects you by hidding them when your around, if he left them out for you to see then I'd think he's just being a jerk. Just remeber, you don't have to deal with anything that offends you, your worth more than that. He just better feel lucky that he has the real thing everyday when he is with you!|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	well of course, it's those times of emergencies when he feels lonely. perfectly normal for every guy.<br>  <br>  i can understand you'd be a tad disgusted but don't feel that way; he doesn't intend to hurt you and it just show's he has a good sex drive :] |`|lxOL2J3Xaa	its very disgusting and not normal. if he has you the last thing he needs is porn. and the fact that he showed you or has no problem you knowing means this kid needs help or a good slap. he's got his prorities all messed up. |`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	lol...it's normal, I don't see anything wrong with that.|`|tNAGQzNnaa	Don't listen to all these uptight prudes and stop being a prude yourself.<br>  <br>  It's not unusual at all for men to be interested in pornography even if attached - if you weren't so uptight you might find you enjoy it as well.  <br>  <br>  The naked human form is the most beautiful work of art nature has provided us and not appreciating it is criminal in my opinion.|`|gtyQdCaAaa	It's totally not normal. Your friend is living in the 1920's. Porn magazines are obsolete now that the Internet has everything and anything you could want in terms of porn. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is actually a Robot, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, sent back from the Future (2024) to protect you. <br>  <br>  |`|AA12159712	So what if you go out with this guy!? He has the right to have those magazines in his own house. You ought to know guys like to look at the female body, even if it isn't yours.  And if you try to make a big deal out of it with him, he'll just resent it anyway since you're not married and he could take that as a expected way you'd treat him if you were.|`|xjdaRMFtaa	That is pretty tasteful pornography. He could have magazines with a lot more disgusting content than that. Then again if you are a feminist you might have a problem with it. I'd say its pretty harmless though.|`|TyFBrelcaa	Normal|`|rCjpVXpLaa	Every man has a secret porn stash. It helps when we really need to relieve some stress if you know what i mean.|`|zR1aWoEyaa	it's gross and means he doesn't respect girls.|`|7618c00c72b2aaa9f4e173b5dfe3d0d6aa	if you were my girlfriend, i would burn my porn collection and drool over you. ...my offer still stands.|`|m43KM9mpaa	My first husband looked at Playboy all the time. I think he had a subscription.  It never bothered me. <br>  <br>  I've never seen a girly magazine in our house once in my second marriage. I have heard the guys he works with talk about Playboy and I am sure he has seen them but I never thought anything of it.  <br>  <br>  There is a Hooter's about 1/2 mile from where I live.  My husband , son and son in law have never been in it.  <br>  <br>  Maybe its because they are older and they just aren't into it anymore.   <br>  <br>  I would not consider Playboy or Hooter porn magazines.    Just girly magazines that show some skin.  You can see just as much on TV or walking down the streets these days.  <br>  <br>  As for drooling over the magazines , he probably does.  I have to admit to doing a little drooling myself when I see a good looking man .  We all after all human.  It's weather we react to it or not that makes us who we are.|`|Czm4UzNBaa	Unfortunately, it's normal (as in common).<br>  <br>  Is it right? Not at all.<br>  <br>  If it bothers you, you should tell him. He should not be thinking about those women in a lustful way, ever, but especially since he's in a relationship. It's a form of unfaithfulness, even if he doesn't think he'd ever do anything with those women.<br>  <br>  Make sure not to make it into a fight, however. It'll just push him to those magazines even more. Just calmly explain to him why you don't like him to look at them. If he really cares about you, he'll stop doing so and maybe even get rid of them. <br>  <br>  <br>  God bless :)|`|PGTM31Vdaa	Yeah its normal. Even though he's got you, he's still gonna wanna look into...er...he's still gonna want to enjoy that kind of stuff. He's probably had it even before you were around, so there's not much sense in stopping. Just know that there is a great distinction between you and those girls in that magazine. If he's smart, he'll know the difference too and those girls are just something to look at while you mean something. So don't worry too much. =]|`|FkEcgBA9aa	its a bit normal..<br>  that is a guy's nature my friend  ;)<br>  as i guy.. im experienced xP well.. but im not sure after a taken guy..<br>  like.. to be drooling at those stuff..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqB7HqMZ2kM7dpVN0VozdALty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081030185626AA6rIEw&show=7#profile-info-7o1MFMRvaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CDuZdpINaa	Why are girls always complaining about this.

If it's really annoying you, Tell him how you feel, and see how he reacts.|`|YOqGuF8aaa	Yes, it is normal, unless you notice a STRONG addiction to those types of things. |`|C3hAhLRZaa	Sadly it is normal, he's with you and likes/loves you, but all guys do this. It's disgusting I agree.|`|zVwur10raa	yes i'd say this is estremely normal haha and i think its disgusting also!|`|gPwG6CEGaa	it's normal.<br>  <br>  atleast you know he's not cheating on you |`|waFzMLgkaa	its normal but i would of thought if he was seeing action (with you) he wont need them :P if you want him to stop just take pics of your self naked and give them to him.|`|Z2t7cGo1aa	it is normal|`|SMZKijWeaa	yes it is normal, all guys are dogs.<br>  |`|kL5KY7hsaa	that is sick that he does that when he has you, very sick|`|Swae9sJ3aa	it is normal and not disgusting....it would be disgusting if he was drooling on other girls:))...just forget what you've seen;)|`|lclGYTakaa	yeahh it is. aha|`|EFeebu0Zaa	yea its normal cause my brother used to do it and i was like omg what is he doing but he has stopped now and trust me they soon get out of doin it! 
WIczM4URaa	no it doesnt mean divorce is coming, but it does mean your not getting any sex any time soon. |`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Leave her, its that simple<br>  <br>  Get somone better|`|AA11391968	There is a reason why your wife is not initiating sex.  Were you at anytime rejecting her, or was there any cheating at any time with the two of you?  I ask because it sounds like she wants to have sex with you, but she just doesn't want to initiate it.  Explain to her that when she rejects you, you are genuinely upset not only due to the loss of the lovemaking, but the intimacy as well.  Try and find out why she feels the way she does.  Maybe she will be willing to start over.|`|ed1645aa82e0d1160bf75fe75030f871aa	damn something is definitely wrong there, yes sex is not everything in a marriage but its something, try to talk it out with your wife and compromise, she might be looking for something in a relationship that you guys dont have yet or whatever, just in case yeah she might be les too, so figure it out, but talking to her and confronting her in this case is the best solution.goodluck|`|TWN3B13Yaa	just tell her how you feel<br>  <br>  i feel sorry for you, awwwwwww <br>  <br>  she should not be cold |`|jNtkhOTVaa	I don't know if this will help or not.  But I hope it might.<br>  <br>  I was once married to a man who was wrapped up in himself.  He had time to talk to me but he just didn't have the desire to invest time in me.  He could have opened up to me but for whatever reason he didn't.  He was all about the physical and not at all about the emotional and mental aspect of a relationship.  I didn't want to get physical with someone that didn't want to be emotional with me.  And so I stopped initiating the only thing that would get a response from him.  If that was all we had I didn't want it.<br>  <br>  You really need to talk to your wife and express your feelings and concerns.  Just because the two of you aren't as sexually active does not mean a divorce is in the works.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps her drive isn't as strong as yours.  Perhaps she has a lot going on.  Mentality plays a lot into the intimate details of women's lives.  If she is stressed or exhausted then that has nothing to do with you or a lack of desire for you.  <br>  <br>  Talk to her and tell her how you feel.  Point out without putting pressure on her that sex is an incredibly important part of a relationship and tell her honestly how it makes you feel when she denies you.  It is just beyond me why she would leave all of that up to you.  But you need to find out why and hopefully both of you can work on it together.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  |`|14b8bbe6d00ed9e88147deae8ace0802aa	First, it does not mean a divorce is coming.  If what you describe above is a recent change of behavior that you noticed in your wife, this could be due to various reasons.  Psychological arising from stress at work, not feeling the warmth of relationship from you, frustrations in life, or something about you that she is not able to discuss with you. Physically, there could be changes happening in her body - hormone changes and related mood changes related to periods, abnormalities like hyper or hypothyroid, fatigue, lack of energy, and the like.<br>  <br>  Basically, you two need to sit and talk.  You need to reassure her that you are not going to be judgmental of her behavior and that you will support her whatever the situation may be.  Then if needed, you might require a consult with a doctor to figure out what is wrong.  All the best.|`|8ud1ZbW9aa	I dont say this lightly but if you dont have kids, you might want to think about a separation.  Face it, she has already left you physically.  She has broken her part of the marriage contract - sex is a cornerstone of marriage and once severed, the rest is just hanging by a thread.  If you hold on and hope for the best and then have kids, it will become worse.  It is not uncommon at all for women to lose their libido after children and they will expect their husbands to "understand".  Youre in a tight spot but whatever you do, do not have children if you havent already.  Its not a good idea in your situation and its not fair to them.   Youre in a countdown mode whether you know it or like it. IMO.|`|Co1oUch0aa	No, it doesn't mean divorce. It like that with me and my husband. I always have to initiate it and he never does. It does feel like your getting rejected but, maybe you should talk to her about it. Maybe she feels unsatisfied with your sexual relationship. Just talk to her......That is all I can tell you because I'm going through the same thing.|`|wBEZPteLaa	aww =( <br>  <br>  i think you should talk 2 her <br>  <br>  or maybe try and wooooe her all over again <br>  maybe shes tired from work and kids? <br>  and you guys just need something to spice things up all over again ... <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|mWAMmHKzaa	Go see the movie Fireproof as quick as possible!

Don't you like her at all?  You cheat on her and now you want to tell her about it?  Why?  Do you think she is going to be happy?  I think you just want to hurt her.  Maybe you should tell her so that she can divorce you and find herself a nicer man to live with.  I think she'd be better off without you.  You are a cheat and also a weak person.|`|dab5007fd05df1ab6c33eff6d5b469e5aa	Telling your wife would only hurt her.

However, I do think you need to ask yourself some hard questions.  <br>  <br>  Would you be telling her to help your relationship or telling her just to make yourself feel better so you're not walking around with a guilty conscience?  <br>  <br>  Everyone thinks if you cheat once you'll do it again.  But thats not the case.  You have control over it.  You have a choice not to do it again.  But you have to make that choice and stick to it.  <br>  <br>  You need to take a good look at your wife and your children and know they deserve better than that.  You need to step up to the plate and give them your all.  If you can't find it in yourself to do that then you should tell your wife everything.  Put it all out on the table for her and let her do what she considers right for her and the children.<br>    |`|458e2053b2475f3fb11875ca5b75cb11aa	Your wife will be extremely sadden about the thought of having sex with another woman. She will be hurt if she knew that you had sex with another woman.Most women hearing that news react differently. Sometimes keeping it to yourself it better,but it happened once then it happened again, she will start thinking about u are cheating if you let the signs show.Even though they knew you were married the blame will still be on you It will be hard for her to trust you again and may cause arguments in the relationship. Be prepared make sure you have a back up plan like staying somewhere or make sure she has some where else to live if you two are living together. and most likely tel her in a public but not busy place. Just tell her you had an affair, then let her ask the questions, be honest why you did it, and sometimes its better but say it didn't mean anything.

You arranged these relationships when you were married, pointing out to those women and underlining to them that there had to be no ties.<br>  <br>  You are now wondering how to let your wife know.  from what you are saying does this mean you are now prepared to be faithful or do you still feel that you will stray again and have more relationships.<br>  <br>  Do you think the first lady who wanted you to marry her will come forward and tell your wife of the relationship?  if so is this your reason for wondering how to inform your wife of your infidelity?<br>  <br>  You have two main area's to think about.  <br>  The first being how hurt your wife and family will be when you tell them of your deceit.  How they will cope if they choose to tell you to leave or if they choose to leave you.  Also how scared your wife will be when she learns that you are having Sexual relationships then coming home to her.  Is her health at risk?  Have you been screened, is your wife a risk.<br>  <br>  The second, <br>  Do you want to be with your wife?  You have to ask yourself why are you having extra relationships in the first place.   what are you not getting from your marriage that makes you need Girlfriends...as you call them..........<br>  Once you honestly answer these questions in your own head then this is when you can say,  if you can inform your wife of all of what has been going on.  can your consions allow you to move forward if you don't tell her.  <br>  <br>  What ever you decide you will have massive fall out and hurt so be prepared to accept what you have done may have cost you, your wife and family........then ask your self was having extra Girlfriends worth all of what you have caused.<br>  <br>  There will never be an easy way of telling your wife what you have done.  You can write it down and sit with her when she reads your explanation, do not leave her to read it alone.  Do not just blurt it out then expect her to say yes that's ok dear.  You can live a lie and never tell her<br>  <br>  I can't wish you well as i think infidelity is so unforgiveable, and in your case it was well planned, not just a one off and one of these things that people say just happened.<br>  You had more than one person on the go at the same time so you thought this threw, you planned your lies behind your wifes back and made time to meet these ladies, this was time that could have been spent with your own family.. <br>  <br>   I do wish your wife well and hope in time she can start to forgive or move forward with her own life with the children.  Your family may need counciling to get back on track with or without you being in the picture<br>  <br>  |`|RC8Pxx8eaa	The only guidance I would give you would be to the divorce court, why would you be sleeping with two other women when you are married ?<br>  There are some very strange people around......|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Maybe letting your wife know would not be the wisest move you could make.

AA10774554	I would end it.  If he was unfaithful and deceitful in the first month it will just get worse.  You aren't in love you are enamored, which isn't  significant or rational.  I know you feel an intense bond and affinity but he didn't respect it enough to consider your feelings.  I mean would you rather have had four months of happiness before you learned the truth or another few years of pain and agony with him after he ultimately leaves you?  You deserve better and cheaters tend to be nothing but self involved misanthropic ****.  Just kick him in the nuts and say "honey you do not know who you fucked with."  Good luck in whatever your choice.  The truth is it's your heart you'll listen too no matter what anybody says and you will deny that anything is wrong.  But try to listen to people you know care about you because they also know what's best for you.  No matter how cute this guy is or how great he makes you feel, you don't want any more **** he can conceive.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	once a cheater always a cheater.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	If you really can't dump him, I would have a serious talk with him and tell him that you'll give him another chance, but if he does it again you're gone.

And this young man "cheated" on you the first month. Does that mean that he slept with his old girlfriend? And that you are sexually active with him and became so in the first month you were dating?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes, then I have another question? How well did you really know this boy before you started to really fall for him? You say your friends have been telling you to end the relationship. What do they know that you don't?<br>  <br>  I understand that you care for this boy. Almost every time someone gets cheated on, the other person "really cares" about the cheater. So what you are feeling is certainly not new.<br>  <br>  I think you answered your own question when you said that you feel like you have no backbone. If you look harder, I'll bet you do.<br>  <br>   I mean, really....do you want to be the girlfriend of a cheater? Or would you rather be the girlfriend of a boy who really, really cares about YOU and loves you? The choice is yours.|`|rjzVYKI2aa	Well it is my opinion that if it took you untill your 4th month of dating him to find out he cheated on you in the 1st month, it's probably not a promising thing. <br>  <br>  Although if it was within the first week or two maybe he didn't think it would get serious and now that it doesn't have that thought again.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's cheated on you another time since then.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can try to give is talking to him about it, but I learned a quote that was like, "If you love someone, let them go, if they come back to you they were yours, if they don't they never were." <br>  <br>  So if after your talk if you don't feel secure about him not cheating on you, try letting him go. If he comes back awesome, if not he wasn't worth it anyways. Believe me there are many other fish in the sea if this tuna isn't right for your can. hahaha <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  |`|VvogsBozaa	Ignorance truly IS bliss.<br>  <br>  If you had any inclination as to how many people cheat at one point or the other your jaw would fall off.<br>  <br>  Deal or pass.<br>  <br>  Deal, don't be shocked if it happens again.<br>  <br>  Pass, give up everything else with it.<br>  <br>  Never take a guy from someone else and expect him not to cheat.|`|JvDaSphZaa	give him  another chance and if it feels weird while being with him then break up with him|`|CwRrVD7Naa	Oh, babe.. I know how you feel, and I've seen this situation so many times around me.<br>  It's a weird, confusing thing, not knowing what to do.. I know. <br>  <br>  First off, if he means a lot to you, then you NEED to talk to him about it, and establish what exactly the situation was.<br>  Get information from him, such as: Did he have real feelings for her (as opposed to just lust)? Does he still have feelings for her? How much do you mean to him now? Would he ever cheat on you again?<br>  You basically just need to know whether or not he'll be a good boyfriend to you for the rest of your relationship.<br>  If he means this much to you, then it's really hard to walk away.. and it may sound crazy, but just because he cheated on you, doesn't mean it is the worst thing ever. I've seen relationships where the boy cheated, the girl found out, but everything all worked out in the end. They're still together in fact, and their relationship is amazing.<br>  Cheating doesn't always spell the end.<br>  <br>  Good luck! 
kHRK66Mwaa	Just ask her if she wants to do something on the weekend. Decide on an event where you are forced to interact,  like ice skating. You can pretend you don't know what you are doing and stumble on the ice. She may try to help you by lending and holding out her hand or you guys might slip and fall together. Anyways, if she is into you, you will know right away. If she doesn't like you, she will make the skating event short.|`|oLeRKVD9aa	hum its dificult to say he likes <br>  go and ask her once|`|D8FlvN4oaa	By the sounds of it she likes you dude make a move.

But to test her, ask her if she wants to hang out one day. If your birthday is coming up, tell her that it is and ask her if shes going to get you anything. <br>  <br>  While doing this though, I suggest you try not to test her. Sometimes girls will take it the wrong way. What I would do is just enjoy the fun time you have with her and smile back at her. Be yourself, its obvious she likes you for whatever your doing so dont change anything. Also dont think to much about what your doing. |`|cosMHWslaa	star flirting with her. dont lay it on too thick, but just let her know that your into her, and she will either flirt back, or pretend she doesnt know whats going on, and not respond.  if she doesnt, oh well. if she does, ask her out|`|VdJT7OCfaa	"test her out", i like that quote lmao<br>  but i would say look closely and find out if she is putting herself "out there" or making herself available<br>  like finding stupid excuses to get really close to you and such<br>  take advantage of those chances|`|nlFaI0Unaa	Yes it sounds like she likes you.<br>  Maybe ask her out on a date to a movie or something, if she says yes then you'll know for sure. |`|Ueq3rH3aaa	Sounds like she likes you, if you're interested you'd be an idiot not to go for it. |`|0Pg7ePQuaa	No need to test she likes you its proved.|`|DNhdC8eWaa	sms with her to test her mind. |`|AA10091485	she likes u, absolutely no question about it. <br>  just don't be an *** to her<br>  ever.<br>  im sure she deserves the very best|`|FyL3RuZUaa	Watch "Just Friends" You sound like you are headed to the friend zone dude unless you make a move...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|BpH1cQePaa	whoah <br>  ok i think u should talk to her or ask her out if you like her.<br>  if she says yes then thats fine but if she says no then say i was just wondering if you like me|`|dOcXTq2aaa	she likes you!! ^^

wG2AbAXEaa	A venue that handled everything, including food, linens,drinks-alcoholic and non, the set up and clean up, and coordinating with the DJ, baker, and florist. <br>  I really had to do absolutely nothing for my reception except give a list with the details of how I wanted stuff set up. I dropped my list off the week of the wedding with how I wanted my cake table to be set up ( I had my own idea I wanted), how I wanted favors set up on tables, and they helped with the other extras we had (sticks of gum and bar napkins we had personalized), I also dropped off anything we needed for the reception. Favors, cake topper (which they held for the baker), cake knife and server, champagne flutes, just everything.<br>  We did nothing but show up and have a good time. <br>  I wanted to enjoy our reception, not run around crazy on my wedding day or the day before trying to figure everything out. Our venue called our DJ, baker and florist to arrange times for set up and all that. <br>  I also wanted a nice place and it was. Decor wise.|`|AA11082914	My own vendors (we're doing food ourselves)<br>  <br>  How late we can stay<br>  <br>  Size (guest list is at 250 right now, and rising)<br>  <br>  HAS to have a playground nearby for the kiddies<br>  <br>  Cost <br>  <br>  As an explanation of the last one- My budget is 5K, which is very doable, but with my guest count thus far it can get tight very quickly. Most halls in my area charge 7-800 for 4 hours with an addl. 100 an hour, plus they also require that you use their food and their liquor. For the amount of people we're looking at, just the hall, food and liquor at one of these halls would take up my entire budget. Ended up finding a couple places where we can bring in our own food/booze. One is $475, the other is $250. Not sure which one we're going with for sure. I like the price of the $250 one, but it doesn't hold as many people as the $475 one (220 people versus 260 people).<br>  <br>  <br>  *ADD* Just out of total curiosity, didn't you used to have a pic on your avatar??|`|MG8MwZrIaa	We were drawn in by the beatiful landscaping, and the fact that the ceremony is held right by the water.  The pictures outside among all the trees is going to be great.  Plus it is a little on the outskirts of a large city, so the price was fantastic.  Finally, it's sort of like an all-inclusive place, where they have contracts with any kind of vendor you could need, and they contact the vendors for you.  We just had to meet them and make sure we liked them.
8e90baac08531fa1accb4b286f9180dbaa	This post sounds like I could have written in.  My husband finally confessed that he was depressed though could it be the same in your husbands case?  It can put them off sex (like in our case) and stop them wanting to have physical contact with you, like their depressed side is trying to push you away.<br>  Could it maybe be a medical reason like that?  Netmums.com do a realtionship course, go to their site and search for it.  It's dead easy and has a good Q&A sction which was what brought everything out into the open for us.<br>  If it's only the sexual side of things lacking in your marriage I'm sure you can save it.  You just need to find out whats lacking and trying to sort it.  Sounds like it's his problem though not yours.  Thought of maybe trying marriage councelling?|`|RDgyb7W8aa	My wife and I have been married 37 1/2 years.  I embarrassed to say I am not that affectionate. Don't get me wrong, there is an occasional hug and sex at times.  For me growing up my family was not that affectionate.  Of course seven years into my marriage I couldn't keep my hands off my wife for sex.  Could you both go to couples counseling? You might get professional help.  You could be right that he could be depressed.|`|ckr2be5daa	I think its normal, based on my many years of marriage, to have times where you just need to mix things up.  I think it's normal to have periods of time with just friendship and less sex.  My experience is that sex always comes back and the lack of sexual feelings can be caused by stress, depression, some form of worry...  There must be something troubling him on some level (even stress over the economy, change of hormones, who knows).  Whatever the reason, I think you should keep trying to communicate with him....he may not even realize it if he is depressed.<br>  <br>  I personally think its helpful to see a Pastor/Priest for communication issues.  I also think it's great if you can find a place where you can worship God together, and also take time for devotions together at night. There are many books for couples and devotions. If you don't worship together, that could be a missing piece to his (and your) happiness.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best and much happiness.|`|jZ1ES9DDaa	I agree with the other answers.  You need marriage counseling.  Every relationship goes through it's ups and downs.  Times when you are not as physically attracted to each other as you once were, or perhaps have other things going on...such as job stress, etc...that make you less sexually interested.  I would say, the pressure you are putting on him to be more physical is probably making the situation worse.  Instead of whining when he doesn't hug you back, try to make it a more natural thing.  He is probably very aware of the issue and likely making it more of an issue is making it a bigger problem than it really should be.  Just relax and see if he would be open to counseling.  You don't say how long you have been together, but this sounds more like you've hit a plateau than anything.|`|F0uLexezaa	marriage counseling may help. even if he doesn't want to go, then you go alone.<br>  <br>  you didn't mention if there are children involved.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Read the Five Love Languages - it really helped us regroup when we had similar rough patch.

It's actually better to know the people that are going than to just meet them for the first time, when it comes to a double date. But, meeting new people, isn't a bad thing either. Double dates are meant to be fun, and relaxing. But, if you expect it to be romantic, a date would be more suitable in that situation. At the end of the day, both couples will get their alone time. It's funny to watch the two pairs tease each other, etc. Just go and have fun ! Best of luck :)

OHfZFR31aa	Unfortunately in most Muslim countries, women cannot initiate divorce, even if her husband beats her. And a man can marry up to 4 wives in many Muslim countries so why does he need a divorce. He just marries another one when he gets sick of his first wife.<br>  <br>  A divorced woman is ostracized by her family and has no way to support herself. And in most cases it was an arranged marriage anyway so she has never had any rights of her own. She was probably married at 15 to an older uncle or cousin, didn't have much of an education, and doesn't even know she might have other options than staying in a bad relationship|`|SWxcuGlOaa	Provide me a source that Divorce rate in the United States is 60%, I find that hard to believe, just aswell not to bother with Marriage if that is the case.<br>  <br>  Muslim countries would have a very low Divorce rate|`|ObLMLZ74aa	It isn't even allowed in some Muslim countries unless the man initiates the proceedings.

The state of California ranks highest with a 37% rate of divorce and New York, Ontario, and Texas follow closely with a 30% rate.

9kfcLkyPaa	If you are truly friends with your roommate just talk to  him about it.  I have dealt with the same thing.  On one hand its rude but on the other hand there are not really many options for your roommate and his girlfriend.  It can definitely be an awkward situation, especially if you wake up and have to use the bathroom or something.  Your best bet is to talk to your roommate and tell him how you feel.  I also do not see why its so complicated to just throw the condoms in the trash.  Remember, 50% of that room is yours.  I would suggest switching rooms or moving out if your roommate does not care about how you feel.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	request another roommate or go back home and sleep.|`|B0VHifDtaa	ask to join in with them|`|sJNoTGQVaa	follow my stepts one by one<br>  <br>  go into his room. take 4 condoms out the jar. quadruple up. find one of her thongs. wear it (after taking off all other clothes). sloppily put some lipstick on. lay in bed in creepy seductive pose. wait for them to come home. after door opens, ask "how bout a threesome?". problem solved|`|qdsVS1dDaa	They need to understand that this is your room, too. I suggest that you talk to them about this.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You could post a sign "All naked women in this room are fair game for anyone, anytime."<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  When it is that time, invite several of your friends over for study.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|JZkCVHJAaa	tell him he needs to stop its not just his space its yours if he doesn't then complain to your floor manager or who ever and if it comes to it get a new room mate you payed all that money to stay there try to make it a little bearable for yourself|`|71qGan9Raa	I remember being in the same situation. it isn't fun is it!!! These 2 people have no problem with their bodies or their sexuality. It does put you in the awkward place but if they want to be naked and walk around, they want you to look at them. Therefore, I wouldn't say anything rude but you could mention that they put on a towel when around you. They could be giving you some courtesy and respect. Also, are you sure you really want this roomate as a friend? I'd be embarassed to bring her home, wouldn't you? Could you imagine the look on your parent's face when she walks out of her bedroom with no clothes on??? You just need to put up with this behavior for a few more months and then you'll be out of there!!!|`|egSPGgtpaa	dude you can't stop sex. Fact.

d8d4c0c058ca622d41a26e13b5a74b6daa	AWWW, you're first kiss together! So cute! I think that you should do it randomly... like when she's not going to expect it. Just be walking her home one day or something, and look her deep in the eyes. Tell her how beautiful she looks, tilt her chin up, and slowly lean in to kiss her. Go most of the way, and then let her come to you.

GbiFRG5eaa	A a very mature answer.<br>  This is not a trust issue, either one trusts one partner or one doesn't. Without trust the relationship is bound to fail sooner or later. What this issue is about is communication and consideration. <br>  Tell your man that while you trust him completely you do not trust her. In consideration of your feelings he must rebuff all attempts by this female to get "close" to him as she is showing disrespect to you and your relationship with him. <br>  You have no worries with your partner, she is the problem and what you must deal with. Wait for an opportunity where you can speak to her privately, tell her you can understand why she fancies your man but that she hasn't a hope in hell of taking him from you. Tell her you are wise to what she is up to and if you see any more attempts by her to get "close" to your man she will have you to deal with.<br>  No need for threats or nastiness, in fact use your sweetest tone of voice it works best.<br>  It's understandable why you feel insecure but that is due to your past and not your man, you have him so please don't waste your precious time together worrying about him leaving you. <br>  Maybe too if you received some counselling to deal with the unhappiness in your past it would help to make you more secure in your present.<br>  Good luck.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	You feel vulnerable and insecure, because you have lost so much in your life - and you are not stupid, you see that this girl is crushing on your guy and is "arranging" to get as close to him as possible.  We can't always control our feelings - so you are getting bothered, even though you know your guy is not interested in her.  She looks like a brat (and also looks like she just kissed a toilet seat...).  <br>  <br>  If you can talk to your BF when she is not around - just tell him how you feel, and let him know that she is really trying to put the squeeze on him - and tell him that you are not trying to be controlling or possessive, and that you love him and trust him, but that she of all people just really bothers you due to her obvious focus on "pursuing" him, and you'd really appreciate it if he could keep a distance from her out of consideration for your feelings. <br>  <br>  Really, if someone is crushing on you, and you know it, it seems kind of like playing with fire (rude to them *and* to your GF) to let them get all comfy with you and pose on your knee and all.  (even though he does look uncomfortable in the pic)  You keep your distance to avoid sending the wrong message!!!  To be fair to him, he may not want to be rude to her and may not know what to do, so he may just be reacting like a deer in the headlights (which could account for the way he looks in the photo...).  If you talk, it might give him more strength to tell her to back off!|`|g3l5f9iwaa	I think it's totally normal that this is bothering you, even though he assures you he's totally into you. It bothers you because it could be a potential threat. You probably feel like she's trying to move in on your territory. One of my boyfriends used to hang out with this one girl a lot, even out at bars until all hours. I tried not to make a big deal out of it, even though I didn't like it. I think I probably told him it made me uncomfortable, but then I let it go. I just tried to take care of myself the best I could, be there for him when I could, and I did not let myself worry. I think my confidence made me more attractive. At some point it helps to trust the universe....if he is the right guy for you, it will work out no matter. If he tells you you're the only girl he's into, really the only thing you can do is trust him unless something otherwise becomes apparent. Worrying about it will tend to wear you down.<br>  Besides...you are so pretty!!|`|okTecGZfaa	Your reaction sounds normal to me. She admitted that she's interested in your partner and put herself in a cozy spot (on his knee) that should be reserved for you. The great thing is that your partner only wants you and is not interested in anyone else. <br>  <br>  She can't take him away from you unless he wants her to, and he's already let you know that's not going to happen. It sounds to me as though your partner just needs to start keeping a certain amount of daylight between him and this other woman. It takes time for negative feelings to settle down and fade but it'll help when you see him start keeping more distance from her.|`|CJa85mSpaa	You are wayyyyy hotter for starters... he'd have to be crzy to dig another lady. And you love him, he loves you so just talk to him about it. Tell him you are not concerned about his faithfullness but rather her disrespect toward you.|`|jjd9nJS7aa	i am a bloke and looking at the pic of her and the pic of you he would have to be mad to want to fancy her . so my advice go and sit on anouther mans knee as i think you are stunning|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	your much hotter. dont worry!|`|3gljWitCaa	first of all<br>  that girl is not you<br>  second of all<br>  stop asking this question a bajillion times|`|RyYV3aXlaa	your much hotter then the other girl.....I don't think you have much to worry about.....|`|aWMKNefqaa	Well, <br>  I think that, from what you said, that your partner really is not into her at all. It seems like he wants to be with you and only you. I don't think you have anything to be worried about. I think that the fear of losing the person you love is what is getting you all worked up. From what I read you have nothing to worry about girl. Just forget about that other girl. she is obviously trying to get something that she can't have but, your partner isn't even paying any attention to her. Don't worry! you shouldn't be stressing about it all. :-) Stay strong girl. <br>  <br>  Caroline|`|h3NJO9dWaa	You are so much prettier than her! Not that looks are the only thing that matters, but she is fugly. I know it is hard not to let it bother you, but if he says nothing is going on and you beleive him then she is just being a tramp and hopefully will get that he loves you and give up on him. <br>  You can't punish him or not trust him because of how she is acting. Talk to your partner and he knows how you feel about her so he should understand if you don't want him to tattoo her.<br>  It's tough to get over, because unfortunatley there are skanky girls in the world who don't care if a man is taken and it is their game to flirt with them and more. As long as he does nothing to lead her on,  try to hang out with mutual friends without her there.|`|iDfRTLklaa	First thing I would do is take down your pics, there are some freaks on yahoo, and I wouldnt want people I dont know checking me out.  Your bf might not like the fact that you posted his pic either.<br>  <br>  I dont think you have anything to worry about, and I think this girl is trying to make to feel insecure so you will start to think that something might be happening.|`|9sSWlgeeaa	because you love him and that you don't want anyone to mess this love up... it's normal! <br>  <br>  may be you need to talk about your feelings and what bother you to your partner, and try to find why you're still bothered by it!<br>  <br>  Wish u many more years of happiness with your partner :)|`|La5D6jnRaa	yea you are WAY  hotter than that girl you have nothing to worry about.|`|3ZiyVWjaaa	ok here is the first thing. you are way prettier than her. in my opinion.and just look in the mirror and tell your self he chose you and you can see it.  you feel this way because of what has happened in the past and because you love him so much.  you don't want to lose him because you feel that he brings so much good in your life.  so just take a deep breath and always remind your self that he loves YOU not the other girl!|`|uRjXR0Jmaa	If he is not showing any interest, I don't think you have much to worry about. Especially since you said that you have been with him for 3 years. If you've lasted together that long, I think that you should trust him unless given reason not to. <br>  <br>  As for why it still bothers you, that's completely normal. Even though he is not interested in her, it can still feel like she is trying to steal him away from you. But if he truly loves you, then you just have to know that he would never do anything to hurt you.|`|nqINitkmaa	I did answer this question yesterday, but now you have the picture of your self, you are way better looking than that other girl, but still the way his hands are on her is extremely inappropriate, and you need to address this issue with him. I really hope that everything works out for you hun.|`|rywgn8HLaa	I think that it is just how we react when someone is going after the person that we love. In all honesty though when I look at that picture you partner looks very uncomfortable having her on his lap...your picture is adorable and I don't see any reason why he would be attracted to her when he has you. <br>  Trust is an important part of a relationship and it has to be earned. Since you have had previous experience with trust issues and people leaving it is only natural that you have this type of reaction. The important part to remember is not to let your reactions or assumptions effect your relationship. <br>  Girls can be catty sometimes - so the next time this girl tries to do this don't walk away...that is probably the reaction that she wants from you. Instead grab your partner and let her see that it doesn't bother you. <br>  Talk to your partner about the situation more. Ask him how he would feel if the next time she did this you took her to the side and told her that it made you a bit uncomfortable. Sometimes it helps to get things out in the open. This girl might not even realize the impact it's having on you. You also might want to talk with your partner about ways that he can help make you feel better in situations like this - for instance if this girl tries this again you would like him to get up and stand by you, etc. <br>  Try to relax and not worry about it so much - sometimes when we over think things it becomes a selffulfilliing prophecy. <br>  Good luck to you   :)
c1Jk4UqKaa	sounds like your dad favors your sister and that's not right.  Explain to your dad how you feel and you should also let your sister know how you feel maybe she doesn' t realize how this makes you feel.  You should all sit down as a family and talk about it.  If no one agrees then you'll have to stick it out on your own.|`|zvxJKdTAaa	you need to sit down and talk to dad and ask him why he is treading her better then you
jimNqqsyaa	i think they can but eventually just grow apart, they want different things, they're still exploring. They're not in a stable environment and that's why most teenage relationships don't last.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Yes they can,a few times.Problem is it takes maturity to sustain that love and even so called mature people can't sustain it.Being in love doesn't mean a teenager is ready for everything that goes with it.It isn't the "emotional aspect" of love that people protest against,it's the maturity level that should go with it.There is so much that is required to make a life together and teenagers are not ready for that commitment.|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Because true love stands the test of time and develops with maturity.|`|AA11447210	Because even the teens, when they look back in time (as adults), will realize what they felt is NOTHING like the mature, romantic love they feel as adults...it simply doesn't compare (and even that feeling for adults, changes and matures over time).|`|q2H9jgDSaa	i understand why people think that they can't,<br>  but i know that they can i think that anybody can love.<br>  age doesn't matter.<br>  i'm a teenager. :)|`|qy07K2k5aa	I agree to totally with what you say.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Teenagers do not KNOW what love is...<br>  <br>  ...and NEVER will.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	One girl I knew a while back said the same thing as you.

The picking on flirting thing means he likes you, but since he goes too far I'm guessing he's not too good at it yet. He likes you|`|fKk9Rto6aa	well flirting is the main word so if you know the right meaning of "flirting"<br>  and your right<br>  he does.|`|nFIXMvn1aa	just don't keep your hopes up. if he tells you he likes you then he does.|`|8iEfMytiaa	get to know him better.<br>  find out what interests he has n see if he opens up well with you. if that all goes good then start hanging out on a regular basis. see where things go from there. good luck|`|fACoVqGCaa	he wants you|`|Td1mzsmxaa	i think that he likes u but he is not sure how to tell you |`|AA11491069	Simple answer, honey.  He is very confused and immature. This is so juvenile. Kid likes a girl and the only thing he knows about is to ridicule her or make mean comments about her.<br>  <br>  Whether or not he "likes" you is not all that important. Take my word for it, he is very immature and does not yet know how to relate to females in his age group.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that you should not do anything further with this man. Go on in your life and you will eventually find young men who have it all together. Be aware that they too might be a little weird because they might be shy or too macho.  <br>  <br>  Remember, PLEASE!, women, especially when scouting around for an eventual mate, are much more intelligent about choices. With this guy.  your sixth sense is giving you confusing singles. He likes you and he does not want to talk to you.  Very difficult for you!<br>  <br>  You are young and you should go on and date more young men. Enjoy yourself. <br>  <br>  The only caveat is that once in awhile a truly shy guy will meet you and not even suggest an interest in you .  Well, I was that real shy guy and know that I missed many fantastic young women who were definitely marriage material.   I remember it to this day and regret the missed opportunities for a lifetime of love.<br>  <br>  If you have the guts, give the shy guy an opportunity, because he may be just the one you will find lasting love with, over the years.<br>  <br>  Consider me very opinionted for good reason.<br>  <br>  Regards,  Shy Guy
7YX789nraa	Yeah I totally would have done the same  thing if I were you. (Or at least I hope I would) I am not a goody two shoes but I'm not a rebel or anything either. Honestly I'd tell your best friends parents but ask them not to tell her that you told them. Maybe they could say that they found cigarette ashes or they smelled it on her? Dude those girls who called you immature do sound like be-otches. And later in life, when they end up old, unemployed and in jail. I think you'll be happy that you walked away. Just make sure that you look out for the people who are important in your life, because in the end of the day, you are the only one who has to live with your decisions.|`|oeYwTYKnaa	well if they cant accept that you didnt wanna be around it then they are the immature ones. you didnt wanna get in trouble and if i was in a situation like that and it made me uncomfortable i would have done the same thing. just blow it off and if they really are your friends they will realize why you sis that.|`|RKVoBGyZaa	YES! Way to go you! As for your best friend I think you should explain to her about how much you care). if this fails I think you should also tell her about how much damage smoking can do to a person. Just try not to say it in a teacher-ish way. Good Luck and super way to go for not sticking around there.|`|nVkMSRY5aa	you did the rite thing trust me and yes maybe u did ditch but u ditched for a good reason i would have done the same thing i think that if they rnt listening to u then they rnt true friends and maybe if they do stop smoking still u shouldn't b friends with them because if they r 15 and they smoke that's agents the law and they could do things that could get u in trouble i think u should stay away from them and just take it easy if u smoke with them they think they r cool and will keep doing it but if u r a good friend and u stop hanging out with them they will hopefully decide that u r better than stupid drugs wrapped in paper. If they don't choose u over the drugs though then they r crappy friends and u should be happy that they didn't want u because u shouldnt want them.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	tell your parents! dont care if they do something about it, because you dont want your friend to get in trouble, you want her to be helped. tell them calmly that she was smoking and you are worried about her. im sure they will do something to help. best of luck and remember not to smoke!!|`|cB2VGhLgaa	The kids who were smoking are trying very hard to be cool, so please don't worry about whatever they say about you. If you are worried about ur best friend, communicate w/ her. Tell her that she shouldn't be smoking, everyone knows it's bad for you and doing it to fit in is lame because no one thinks it's cool anymore. You can't force ur friend to do anything, but just tell her how stupid it is and that those kids she is hanging out w/ aren't making her cooler. Anyway, just talk to her. Vote me best answer! :) (if you like my answer of course)

v9Zv9aGzaa	I think the girl should say it first if it was the guy who approached or asked the girl out when they first met. If the guy went up to the girl then it would seem as if hes desperate because he would be making all the first moves and he would feel like you dont love him.<br>  <br>  Just to make it simple the girl should say i love you first cuz they are more emotional|`|h32OwXACaa	it doesn't really matter to be honest, just make sure that you mean it before you say it.|`|EdidZdtlaa	it dosent matter|`|pNqjsJn7aa	its nt a competition abt who sayz first...anybody can...but u hv  to b true to urself when u do..all d best!|`|AA11151794	In the traditional mores of the West, the man is the pursuer in most romantic relationships.  When the male makes his intentions toward the female clear in his words - usually, I love you or will you marry me? and in his actions with her, it is then, appropriate for the female to respond with such a statement of feelings.<br>  "I love you" is the most loosely used expression in the English language because it means different things to different people at various times and under various circumstances.|`|a355ad3b24d1c817cba77948c3de812caa	Thing is it just depends who asked out who. If the guy asked the girl out, and they're together, then the girl should say that she lives him first b/c if the guy did, wouldn't that seem like he's rushing things? Even if they had been going out for three months, the person that asked the other should wait until the other person says I love you, once it gets over six months, then I think that the person who made the first move in the relationship the could say I love you.<br>  <br>  Just depends on the situation!|`|Rc9SNllPaa	I would have thought it would be, whoever feels that way first.<br>  But real love is very difficult to find in this world,<br>  Take care and best wishes always<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|0klCX1Ogaa	Whoever feels the love first should say it immediately.|`|0ktcvglRaa	It shouldn't matter!|`|Xtkkfm4Jaa	whoever is in a hurry to commit a suicide should say it first..|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	There are no rule in the game of love!|`|2yIjhZHtaa	umm i think the man (:|`|XU1fftrMaa	It doesnt matter who says it first as long as you say it. In my relationship now I was the first to tell him that. But, in all of meh other realationship, the guy has said it. It doesnt matter, just as long as someone says it. But a guy usually says it first.|`|4P3CMim8aa	Traditionally, the honors go to the male, but in the 21st century, men and women are equals and it doesn't matter.|`|CX3QUgLtaa	i honestly don't think it matters, usually guys say it first.

kGp22HNOaa	ask her questions about herself, no girl likes a guy that is self-absorbed. if you guys like her the conversation should just flow and be natural. don't try too hard, girls don't like that either.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	Ask her how her day went and how was school and how she is doing and ask about her fave band or something cuz that can start a convo easy:)|`|f0GIqjSLaa	talk about your school and classes you take, the teachers, ummm idk|`|56ba25da115adfe2c7df170b693a1437aa	Since you don't go to the same school, just start by talking about how her school compares with yours, such as activities, etc.  Also, show some interest in whatever classes or activities she's into, and don't be afraid to tell her about what you're into either.  Just be interested in what she says, and hopefully she will be interested in things you tell her, and conversation will just come naturally.  Good luck.|`|hiU51BzSaa	I like hearing about my boyfriend's day, it makes me feel close to him, and then he'll ask how my day was.<br>  Usually I'll just bring up something funny that happened to me at school or work and we'll go off on a conversation from there.<br>  <br>  it's okay to not know what to say if you like her, Just try not to overthink it and psych yourself out.<br>  Good Luck!|`|66b3cc0bf850be73ec0db7c20c9eb47daa	if cant think of anything and theres like that big awkward silence. then normally say "so what are you thoughts on the economic crisis?" lol or anything about the problems of the world. its dumb i know but that can usually start a conversaion|`|TxDzchspaa	You can talk about anything like how your day was, ask about hers,what your doing over the weekend or any plans to go somewhere,maybe ask if she want to hang out or something or just something thats on your mind.Hope that helps and good luck|`|NKN5qmB7aa	Hello! <br>  I know sometimes it can be hard to initiate a conversation especially when its with someone you are attracted to due to the fact that you are afraid that you may something embarrassing. Usually all you have to do is ask her something simple like, "Where did you grow up", or "What kind of outside activities do you enjoy". The purpose to asking is to get as much information about her you can. This way you can know her likes , dislikes and not so much-es. This can also help you to know if you guys have the same interest and build from there. It usually only takes a little bit of curiosity for a girl to open up a bookful of information. Shes probably wants to know more about you and may not know how or what to talk to you about. Be brave and take a first step. It shows that you have a to want to know and aren't afraid to lead off. Hope this helps.|`|tJvTdijjaa	Well I assume that if your talking to her you know her so try to read up on something she's interested in (like if she likes a certain band or type of book) T.V. shows a pretty neutral ground and a safe bet conversation-wise. When on the phone ask her question that lend well to conversation so instead of the automatic 'what's up' or 'how goes it?' that get monosyllable answers try for a stronger questing such as ' How are your Summatives coming along' or 'How many or what exams do you have?' or even ' What are your classes for next semester?'|`|tF1880e7aa	if she doesnt go to your school then asker her about it and waht classes she has then respond with like what classes you have and ask a different question before you end that answer because if you are too *just to the point* it will get quiet and auwkwerd so you need to try and contribute and keep the conversation flowing|`|YPhLXVftaa	Talk about your ideals, your dreams, your aspirations.  Likes and dislikes, places you have been, interesting life experiences, etc.  Tell her about what attracts you from her.  Find out what her interest are, what she likes to do.  Very important: Be yourself, don't pretend.  BE REAL!!!  If you lie you lose.|`|ea85abeaee1c46c10cc532949042fc87aa	be random, witty, and funny.  you need to be inquisitive.

Even if you don't really care at all in what she's talking about.  hope that helps|`|ppa5FNhxaa	you need to know what interests her. what does she like? ask her questions about herself that could lead to hours long conversations.

And I am sure you text and talk everyday of the week.  If  he wants more attention then find a way to give him more attention but I doubt that will work.  I think he may want you to spice the relationship up like having sex a little more spontaneously or just text and emailing more sexy things.  And if that doesn't work he wants out of the relationship but he don't know how to tell you.  But you need to see if the problem really is attention problems first and if not then try to find the problem and if you can't find a problem then he wants to date other people.

KmC0K59taa	Oh, I've stayed in a couple unhealthy relationships.  I thought I could change him, but it was never going to happen. I think it's something everyone has to learn.   You are really just wasting your time though.  He is not the boyfriend you need, so it's time to cut the ties.  There are plenty of men out there who will be faithful to you and play these immature games.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Well, now that you know what kind of guy you don't want, you have the opportunity to become a single Mom and find a guy who will genuinely love you for who you are.<br>  <br>  It takes two to make a relationship work. No trust, No respect, there is no relationship to work on. Your guy seems intent on doing nothing more than providing a stud service and stroking his own ego. I'm sure he'll appreciate his freedom to continue such a tradition with as many females as will have him.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want his child support bill though.|`|OHfZFR31aa	There is nothing to fix. He doesn't love or respect you one bit. You've allowed yourself to be walked all over by keeping him around even after he's cheated on you. You know he has other girls on his phone, yet you don't make him get rid of them. Do you really want your child to grow up with him as a role model?|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	To overcome an unhealthy relationship, one must decide to leave it or put up with the other parties immature/irresponsible ways. If you don't have trust, mutual respect and commitment, there is no relationship|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Without mutual love, respect and honesy, you do not have a good relationship. <br>  <br>  From what you wrote, he seems to think you love him..and that you will always put up with his cheating and lying...because you have already. Chances are he will not change, BTW. So don't expect him to.<br>  <br>  He has already shown you his true colors. And his actions speak loudly....When a man cares for a woman, he tries to be a good partner and father. Sorry, but it sounds to me like you would be better off without him by your side.<br>  <br>  Good luck.Some people don't know they have something worthwhile until they lose it.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Fixing this will mean lots of arguments, and you have to be consistent.  Are you ready for that?  If so,<br>  <br>  1.  No more pictures of other women anywhere - not on the phone, the computer, anywhere. <br>  <br>  2.  He takes you out every weekend, and acts like your husband the whole time.  Like you're his beloved gf.  That means, if his friends rip on you, he immediately defends you and then you both leave and go hang somewhere else.  And it means that if other women walk up to him, he introduces you to them like a gentleman saying "This is my wife... (or gf or whatever).  We've been together 2 years.  Darling, this is ..., a friend of mine."<br>  <br>  3.  You and he forgive whatever lies have been in the past and start new.  No setting traps for each other, no whiny conversations that show you still don't trust him.  Just relax and pretend it didn't happen, and start over.  Next time he obviously stumbles, he should know he's out.  <br>  <br>  4.  You have to be willing to leave.  Or to kick him out (depends on whose home it is).  And to do it permanently.  Without a permanent, final breakup as a real, not just possible, threat, there is no reason for him to respect you.  <br>  <br>  You say you want to show him he can't do this to you.  Well, he can.  As long as you stay.  <br>  <br>  Modify this plan to suit you, and then present him with it when you're all set and ready to end it completely.  Until then, it has no teeth.
ghbaAWOCaa	im sorry..how old are you =/<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  despite the age, hun take the 'i love you' crap as a big pile of bs. Online relationships scarcely ever work out (inc. simple friendships). Forget loving you, the boy just sees you as someone to talk to since you two have become such good phone buddies. He sounds pathetic and desperately up for some time pass. Dont dedicate much of your time to anyone you meet online, esp guys =/..never worth it.<br>  <br>  So yeah NO, dont call him...dont worry, time heals all wounds, soon enough youll even forget his name =D|`|rdkCzDSyaa	This guys most definately a fake.It's hard after  break up but don't just tend to anyone for support.But someone you trust like your close friends.Best of luck and I would advise don't get in tough with him!|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	you tend to involve in the thing which you have not seen. Do not believe in such stories. Live in real life.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	I think you're investing a lot in someone you haven't even met in person, and you should go find someone you can get to know in person.
oUUMcNBkaa	Actually its true. There are so many young girls on here. It is so easy to tell that their young because they're so naive about the world..lol. I'm 23 and well its difficult to find a 23 year old woman who is still a virgin. I lost my virginity when I was 18 btw and I thought the same way, "that I will wait till marriage". In fact one person once told me, OMG your having sex with your bf that you've known that long. I instantly knew that  it was a teeny bopper who wrote the comment. And if you are older than 23 and still a virgin, I give you props because its difficult to go for that long in our society.|`|vAR22hz4aa	what's the question?|`|JuiZR23Paa	Actually, yes I have noticed it.  Many younger girls think if they try to "say they won't have sex until marriage", then they will.  But saying it to people on the internet, doesn't mean anything.<br>  <br>  I'm 14, and yes I am a virgin, and proud to be one.  I think waiting to have sex after marriage, is not a thing you announce to the internet.  It's more of a promise to yourself.  <br>  <br>  I totally agree with you|`|WkA8UPflaa	I guess, I mean I want to wait till marriage and I am 18. I have been in love before but I didnt feel the need to have sex to prove my love for him. To each there own. None of my friends are virgins, well hardly any are, its just a personal thing.

eO4y3m1maa	Is it really worth the threat of your marriage?<br>  <br>  you should really sit down and talk to him, let him understand this is something you really want to do..you might just have to bite the bullet and say no to this..and let go of this fantasy.|`|RUTQTgCyaa	I don't understand...you knew that your husband was "traditional" when you married him. I think that this is more of a fantasy on your part than anything else. Realize that if you do this then you are opening pandora's box and unleashing all kinds of issues into your marriage. Would you want him to do something like this without you? And to be honest this is just out and out cheating. Is it worth it? Because if he is as traditional as you say he is...then a traditional man will be seeing you in divorce court.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I don't think that's fair to him or your marriage. Get a sexy movie and watch it with him and see if that brightens him up some. If he wasn't in to it before marriage and you were, why did you get married? Let him know now that you need him to loosen up and try other things with you, and I don't mean a threesome.|`|X7i59NeIaa	If you want to stay married I would say forget that idea. There are very few couples who can pull that off. It ruins marriages. You sound like you got married before you were ready to.|`|AA11412999	Doing it without him is nothing short of stupid.  Don't go there.  Nothing good will come of that.  The short term buzz won't mean much when you have to face yourself in the mirror, or when you watch a part of him wither and die when he realizes what you've done.  <br>  <br>  Your other options are to a) communicate your dissatisfaction with the lukewarm temperature of your sex life, and tell him what you are thinking of doing so that he is given a fair opportunity as a partner in the marriage to choose what he wants to do about it, or b) choose to drop it entirely and try to suffer in silence, or c) think long and hard about the sense of being with someone whose values don't match your own.  It's a waste of your time AND his.|`|SEnL8GDgaa	Try setting up a threesome without his knowledge. Surprise him with it. The upside is it will be the best night of both your lives. The downside is he likes it a lot and continues to want more. They are not easy to come by. IM speaking from experience, there great it you can get them but there hard to come by.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Gee, do you really think it might ruin your relationship? That's too bad, these "traditional" types, how annoying. Get yourself a swing set you big baby.|`|y0jkVO2Aaa	Do it & you will end up in divorce court.  It may be fun for a while but it will cost you everything.|`|UUBZn0shaa	yuo could hook upwith me and my wife lol as we are also very interested in swinging.<br>  <br>  good luck with what eva you do.|`|QCkanmR9aa	Best idea do it you will love it.email me also.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Sounds like your husband has more respect for his vows and marriage then you do...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do either cause i have more respect for my husband,my vows and myself then you do apparently.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Uh, doing it without him isn't "swinging," it's just flat out cheating. Sorry, but you married him knowing he wasn't alright with these things. You made the commitment to marry him anyway. If he doesn't want to swing, you can't make him, so it's off the table. He's clearly not comfortable with it. Doing it without him is just cheating, and if you'd rather cheat on him, which would hurt him, then you should just get a divorce, rather than cheating behind his back.
s5y6SZhnaa	that's right sonny, it IS saturday. your avatar looks like this one asshole guy i know. haha, coinkadink? anywhore, just be nicer. you have to learn to accept your mistakes as a person. once you have done that, you can set out to redeem yourself. since you have acknowledged that you are a d!ck, you will have to wait until you see everybody again.<br>  <br>  you can't mend your reputation as a jerk over the weekend. it will take time, but you can do it!<br>  <br>  love marty!<br>  <br>  OMG BY THE WAY! PLEASE DONT SAY ''I WOULD NEVER WANT TO HURT YOU MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY!" THAT WILL SO SCREW YOU OVER, SHE'LL TAKE THE FLOWERS AND LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAY, THEN BE LIKE 'WTF'???? AND SLAM THE DOOR IN YOUR FACE. <br>  <br>  ok<br>  <br>  but please do apologize to her, thats a def.<br>  good luckies.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	Do you have her number??maybe try calling her.

I bet she still does like u and just explain to her that u were just pickin on her in fun and to flirt. Then let her know how much u care about her. As for the rest of the people, I wouldnt worry. They most likely dont hate u as much as u think or else u would of heard of how much of a jerk u are a lot sooner!|`|8WmMVyGOaa	Well all you need to do is positive. I mean think if it as you finally realized and have time to change it plus you are truly sorry and are going to change it. That is a great thing. Your not a bad person so ne happy.|`|iQfXPHOPaa	bring her some flowers(if u can!)then tell i was stupied thats not the real me i love you and id never want to hurt u mentally or physicly! tell me how it goes =]|`|7xBa7Pi8aa	Hang in there! <br>  While the time to start fixing this seems far away it will be here before you know it.<br>  <br>  While you wait this would be the perfect time to re-evaluate who you are, who people perceive you to be (other than a jerk), who you want to be and all the ways it will take to make those changes. <br>  It won't be easy or fun, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded.<br>  When you start apologize to everyone, ask them to be patient with you because it is a habit that may take time to correct and also ask them to correct you when you mess up. If they do help you by correcting you, don't get mad at them just remain humble and apologize again.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|c3zWdXUjaa	Well, I should just say I love your screen name haha. Anyways, I think you should call her if you have her phone number and apologize to her. DONT TEXT IT, because that's rude if you're trying to be serious about something. And with your friend thing, I believe you should either call them too, or wait until school or whenever the next time you see them and just be like, "Hey man, sorry about whatever I said that hurt your feelings. I was just joking, and I didn't want you to take it the wrong way, so sorry". Or something along those lines. If your friends refuse your apology, then it's time to make some new friends! Friends don't ignore you or refuse your apologies. Make some new friends and just try to watch what you say around them. Try to put yourself in their shoes and think if what you're saying would offend you if you were them. Get what I mean? Sorry this is soooo long, but I hope I helped with your problem!|`|s7G6aC9Caa	First of all, you might not have even been being a big jerk. Some people might take your jokes the wrong way. You just have to watch what you say to people, think before you speak.<br>  Second of all, do you have this girl's phone number? If not, the internet isn't a good place to talk about your problems but you can always try to talk to her on the internet. If there's no possible way you can contact her then you just have to wait until school or whenever you see her next. Doodle or something, haha. To get the problem off of your mind occupy it with something else. Just sitting down trying to get it off your mind will keep it on your mind.<br>  <br>  (:|`|5EfJu34taa	you are seriously a jerk|`|gqHy3821aa	Mate.... i feel you haha.<br>  <br>  Not about the jerk thing but the over-thinking. I constantly do it and it kills me. Best thing is to keep busy, put it out of your mind or focus on the good things. With me it's often over a girl i like and that, and i end up thinking about what i've done/said and realising i screwed up or did something wrong and i could've done something so much simpler and better<br>  <br>  See for yourself:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307104844AAoVCO4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  That's the worst thing you can do by the way (focusing on what could've happened if you'd done something different, don't do that it'll just get you down). Sorry to hear about it, but just try to focus on the good stuff and forget about it. Next time think about how you are going to sound when you say something. And i'm sure people know you're not trying to be mean and it's just your type of comedy.<br>  <br>  I've got a mate who's a right @sshole but it's his type of comedy and people get that, and he's not hated. In fact i can't think of anyone who hates him with a passion. :P<br>  <br>  Hope i helped. :)
WRcbYyroaa	Probably Facebook is your best bet since you're seeing real profiles and not fake ones like you see on MySpace (meaning it's a little safer). But you really should be careful.<br>  <br>  [EDIT: Updated based on your Additional Details, Facebook has Apps on it that you can add to your Profile to help you meet people your own age to chat with. After that you'll probably want to try Bebo, or Forums. Because outside of AIM/MSN/Yahoo Chat, there's very few safe options out there. Facebook (using the Apps), is probably your best bet.|`|Nsp2UAlIaa	yeeep ^^ myspace.com|`|1EoTIZl8aa	Go to school and make friends?<br>  <br>  Unless you're you home-schooled?<br>  Well, I don't think its likely you'll meet normal people online.<br>  But if you want to be entertained, talk with someone on myspace, crunchyroll, or chatango.com
KQVfC6N6aa	I think I'm understanding better why my husband cheated.There are alot of things I still don't understand still too.I know he loved the attention he was getting from this girl,someone who made him feel important and love?I guess.With the hussel and bussel of 2 children and running a business.I know now there were major communication issues along with other things.I am only 6 months into knowing about this and I fear my anger and broken heart will possibly dissolve what love is left and maybe he will seek out new prey?Sex is just part of the relationship right?|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I know for a fact my husband was still -and still is- attracted to me while he was cheating, while he was attempting to cheat, before, during, and after. That doesn't change the fact that he's a compulsive liar and cheater. I've never agreed with the belief that a man cheats only if he's not in love or attracted to his wife anymore. Many men who cheat adore their wives and still cheat on them every chance they get...like mine does.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Haven't cheated, but understand why in some cases it occurs.<br>  <br>  I don't think its that men don't feel attracted to their wives so much as they feel unattractive to their wives. I've seen countless times where women do not wish to have sex and forget about their mans wants and desires. They seem to forget that men like to have their egos torqued every once in a while to make them feel important or special.<br>  What happens is this: If your woman does not find you attractive, some women will and make this known. When the man gets this attention (which many long for), it is quite difficult to refuse.

Makeup could also enhance your looks also being your self when it comes down to meeting guys, if you go to church there maybe a youth group and you'll find plenty of guys your age. Wherever you go always try looking your best so if there is ever a FINE guy you can talk to him.Oh and one more tip of advice a cell phone might help you out.

Once they find that chump that will marry them, they cheat on them and then divorce them and take all their money.|`|YzObEmUqaa	They live their lives to the fullest and max out their mileage.  And have other dudes married to them suffer.  It's like you take a punishment for their other men when they fell for and love so much.  But, only in the end they only know they were conned from other men for their love and flesh......|`|gRmbGGMBaa	wat?!<br>  no way;;its just that with marrriage comes more than sex;;intimacy<br>  maybe this makes sex less wild and more romantic, but this doesnt make it closing the shop. |`|scMMpPciaa	Hell mine is wide open.. My husband is just a blind old fart!|`|AH9i63ydaa	Have a beer and go to bed.|`|Nbl7r9tFaa	Why buy the cow if the milk is free? |`|FeEU1IDOaa	Yeah, interesting "phenomenon". It's actually not a "game". It's called "maturing" and it happens to most of us. Notice I said "most".<br>  <br>  You see, girls turn into women. And women eventually get it through their heads that men aren't going to love them if they "hook up" with them. For every hook up a girl has ever had, she was most likely really disappointed that he didn't call her the next day...so she went out and tried again. Stupid, yes. Obviously! But it's unfortunately something that tends to take awhile to sink in. And when it finally does, she realizes that the only foolproof, surefure way to find a man that actually respects her is to NOT sleep with him until marriage. <br>  <br>  It's guys like you, apparently, who will be turned down for those radom hookups. Rotten luck for you, mate, that the girl is no longer the "chump" that falls for your flirting and attention that is meant to lead her into thinking you give a crap. Better luck next time :)|`|bc06bfa5e6e290d86d60dd98ef424b1faa	Mr. Georgio, i think you are generalizing. From particular to general, as logic would dictate, does not follow. Just because you are exposed to these kind of girls does not mean that most girls are like that. I still believe that a great percentage of women out there would want the guy who they are having a relationship would be their husbands, too.  Don't you think that it's because of the actions of these chauvinistic pigs led them to such a predicament?  :-)|`|FwYjfVnPaa	Most woman don't love sex the way men do honestly woman don't play games with sex nearly as much as men think they do.When woman are out dating they usually get spoiled with flowers and gifts when men stop sending flowers woman don't call it a game. It really is the same thing.<br>  both woman and men change once they get comfortable with each other|`|RlzkeY0gaa	K, what are you saying I wasn't sleeping with my husband before we decided to get married or before marriage? That's just silly. |`|NkPvExnHaa	They get older/wiser and figure out that some guy will buy the cow just to get the milk!!!|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	I sense that you are gritting your teeth this evening more than usual hon....

You're a bitter man.  |`|iOqmoIrcaa	Because men are dumb enough to fall for it.
Se8Qqmdbaa	no i think if you want to have sex u should forget waiting until married!~!~!|`|JvDpKjw8aa	I believe that you should wait until marriage. There is no way to have sex without creating an extreme emotional bond. That person will be part of you forever. The more you make that bond, the weaker it gets. Sex is supposed to create an extreme emotional bond between spouses. There is no need to create unnecessary emotional baggage by having sex with multiple people. |`|wXxAN7cgaa	I respect your opinions but I don't agree. For me I think it really shows that you love a person if you "save yourself" for them. It's more ... sacred and special in my opinion. I don't think it's a thing of the past...I know a lot of people who agree with me and who have abstained before marriage. The way I look at it marriage is special and the fact that the man and woman who get married have both stayed..."clean" for eachother makes it that much more significant.<br>  Anyway that's my opinion.<br>  Ochre|`|J3tt6qspaa	This question made me think of how Britney Spears publicly announced she was saving it for marriage...and we all know how that went. But any way I agree with you I think that if you're in love with someone, and I mean really love not some infatuation go for it. There is a difference between being in love and being a slut. That's just my opinion of course.<br>  <br>  |`|oN3Znbo7aa	no i dont because if you really care about someone and you are ready for sex but not for marraige than i think you should exsperiance sex i think it okay if you are in a comited relationship and you both no what you are doing|`|t8Qfdx9jaa	either or is fine with me.<br>  im still a virgin,[16] & im not waiting until marriage.<br>  im jst waiting for it to be right,yanno.?|`|uOPU1eZGaa	I actually have some friends who have done that. |`|836c8dbbbad5b8a8af9795da0f26767faa	Yes i do.|`|h77VALOjaa	Not at all!|`|AA11450203	Your views on safe sex are naive.  Even with safe sex practices there is a risk for pregnancy and disease.  Furthermore, those that practice abstinence until marriage find the true meanings of sex which is something to be shared with the person that you love.  Too many times people confuse love with lust.<br>  <br>  There is nothing more beautiful that two people presenting themselves as being pure during their wedding.  I know in our society that I am the one being naive.  However, my wife volunteers for a pregnancy center and there are too many stories of unplanned pregnancies.  Her volunteer group also helps young people understand that abstinence is the responsible thing to do and to not let others pressure them into sex.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that too many people rush sex and end up with too many regrets.|`|SgMZrz3eaa	I would say wait, but I'd be a hypocrite. My boyfriend and I lost our innocence to each other, after we had been together for 5 months. That made it more special, because neither one of us had been with anyone before. (I'm 22 and he's 21) I love him dearly and he loves me. This month will make it a year that we've been together.<br>  <br>  It wasn't just sex. It was more...love. There was emotion to it. We had talked about it before we did it. We talked about the outcomes of it, and whether or not it would tear us apart. But honestly, it brought us closer. <br>  <br>  So I say it just depends on the person. I don't believe that you can be 13 and having sex. Your mind & body are not mature enough for that. I think you should wait until you're mature and you KNOW you're ready for that. You don't want to do something that you would regret.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Me personally I don't really believe in waiting.I do believe that you should be positive you are ready though and you shouldn't be just hey lets try this with someone you don't know.I think you should be in love and know your positive your ready to do this and make this big step in life.It should be with someone you honestly care about cause in life you will only have one first time.|`|i48kxrbaaa	My views is whatever you're comfortable with. I am striving until marriage but I am also thinking realistically knowing that anything may happen and I might lose it before it. BUT im waiting because I feel like that's something GOOD and something to be PROUD of. I'm different from most chicks. I still have something that cannot be given back.<br>  <br>  But it's everyone's choice. What you do with ur body is up to you. What I do with mine is up to me. |`|coHctq7gaa	My friend believes in no sex before marriage and I fully support her decision, but I personally don't follow that. I believe that being that intimate with someone is something that can help bring you closer together. I'm not saying either is right or wrong I think it just depends on personal preference and as long as people are happy then sex shouldn't turn into such a massive deal. |`|EJZVgQyNaa	i used too until now being a horny  16yr male  24/7 is very hard to keep it till marriage but so far so good.<br>  <br>  <br>  help me???<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081111062551AA0kdJj&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|XwFGg5wPaa	no I had sex before I was married only because I wanted not because I was pestered for it. Well what happens if your not suited in the bedroom it can only lead in divorced. Not every-ones cup of tea just my opinion   |`|zzPniswPaa	meh, i just don't think with all the messed up kids in this world that we need any more at the moment. let's face it, were probably the most screwed generation to come, i highly doubt people will even think twice about safe sex. its just nothing that really comes to mind..<br>  that aside, i do believe in sex until marriage, but then again i don't want to really get married. <br>  <br>  and for the user sable the thing about britney spears...thats funny. you'd take the example of someone who's rich and famous and has everything going on and then pinning it to "oh look how screwed she got", first of all she never was a virgin, i read that she lost it at 13 so either way the whole no sex till marriage thing didn't apply to her..so you don't have much of a point lol.|`|7lU6S9G4aa	I think it's more about finding someone who you can trust and feel totally comfortable with. Its also really important that you love that person and they love you too. I am 20 and i  personally did not wait for marriage. I had plenty of chances but i wasn't going to give it away. Wait for somebody worth it. Sometimes, they may even end up being the one you marry !  :) |`|zVDQMVnHaa	No I don't think you should wait until marriage cause you need to try it before you buy it. I mean you could dine tune their skills to your liking but if they don't satisfy you, it's not gonna work out. Sex isn't the whole relationship but come on it is a big part of it.|`|FdxWeaI3aa	Do you believe in no sex until marriage?<br>  <br>  Well No. I believe in No Sex til Love.<br>  My first time with someone I was in Love.<br>  We have been together for 6 years now.<br>  We just got married this year.<br>  <br>  So I believe in sex before marriage so long as your in love.<br>  I don't believe in meaningless sex.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	well i didn't save it for marriage.... but every 1 is different i guess,but i do know a few people that are waiting for marriage and they seem ok with their choice. i think it depends on the individual so its hard to say its an old fashioned thing of the past.|`|ZckxI1M5aa	I wish I had saved it until marriage. I will always encourage it to my neices and nephews (although they won't listen and probably call my a hypocrite)<br>  <br>  But you can learn so much more about a person if you wait. |`|XsgP1O7gaa	Hi, <br>  I believe in no sex before marriage. I believe it should be between a married couple.. In my opinon. Alot, of people still believe in it. And i hope that continues.=-]|`|QhRO0kcMaa	I'm just willing to save my first sex for someone special. Don't have to be married to her :)|`|ufCO60Osaa	 Until joining Yahoo i didn't know anybody DID save until marriage.<br>   I have sex and as you stated i don't think that's a bad thing.I don't know any friends.friends of friends etc. that haven't had sex.<br>   I have a baby to my boyfriend of 4 years now and no plans thus far for marriage.It just isn't a big deal to us we trust and love each other and marriage costs too much to "prove" to others that we're serious.We had both had sex with people before.But not just for the heck of it or stupidly or one night stands or anything and i have no regrets about any of it and don't think it's that big of a deal. <br>  If you really want to save it til your married fair do's but i don't see anything wrong with Not waiting either.<br>  
H3WHxCgaaa	I'd start out with joint custody personally - better shot at getting it and being able to be closer in order to "monitor" the other parent...IMO.<br>  <br>  I would hash out health insurance, daycare, holidays, visitation (or shared custody 50/50), schooling (better to work it out now than pay to go back and change it later), shared medical costs (glasses, specialists, dental), extra activities (gymnastics, dance, etc.).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	only the court can strip him of his parental rights.  if your son cannot afford a lawyer,  I would suggest that he consult with legal aid and proceed accordingly. In most states, grandparents have no legal rights so long as there is a parent available.  Therefore he will have to do all the leg work.  If the baby is in a drug house as you have indicated, maybe local law enforcement can help in safely removing the child.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	When dealing with a custody issues, one must prove their side of the case, by how well they do in parenting the children..medical issues..child support, vistation issues..educational issues..what they have done for the child..how much time they spend with the child..how consistent they are with dealing with the child's wellbeing. Any solid documentations of the other parties' involvement that is bad for the child..neglect..abuses..refusing to other you to have the child..what they don't pay for..etc..|`|0KLu4hRaaa	I quote "I need to know what all do we need to ask from the judge if we do not get full custody. We don't want to leave anything out." <br>  <br>  First you will not get custody--your son might. Second seeing as you are a little nuts I would be willing to bet that mom will retain custody, and third since you sneak around doing things and encouraging your son to do things it is no wonder the mother thinks you are the ones who turned her into DHS. <br>  <br>  You might be telling the truth but the fact that you include yourself in getting custody to me just says "I will say or do anything to get myself custody."

r9nxFkGtaa	Good for you!  Holding out for something better than a casual relationship is the best thing you can do for yourself.  And 17 isn't that old for not having found anyone yet.  Once you're out of high school and going to college, there will be so many more opportunities to meet someone with similar standards as you.

I don't drink, and I strongly believe that sex is a maximum expression of love that should be experienced with someone you truly love, and not something that should be done with a random different person every weekend. I've been hit on by lots of girls before, but I also haven't liked one of them enough to date them. I feel so stressed, desperate, and hopeless at times. All I can do at times is remind myself that there is someone out there out there, especially made for me by God, that's going to come into my life when I least expect it. I've met lots of women that I would love to date, but they're all taken. Don't give up! You're so young! Concentrate on the things that matter more in life at your age, like school, friendships, and shaping yourself out to be the person that you're going to be for the rest of your life. We all despair, especially me. Don't give up, don't give in, keep your head high, and you will reap a treasure greater than you can imagine.|`|uAVX55Liaa	Don't worry about it.  If you are happy not having a bf than more power to you.  There are plenty of people older than you (namely me, I'm 27) that has never had a bf.  Give it time.  You have a whole life ahead of you.  Don't rush things.  He is out there; somewhere.  Some people go a whole lifetime being single and they love it.  Some of them can't be any happier.  Just enjoy being a kid.  Do your homework, chores, etc and go to parties.  If the boy comes along and you are not ready, don't worry about it.  If you are meant to be together, you will.  Do not settle for someone.  Play the field for a few years.  After high school and college; when you are settled down with a career job that you enjoy, than go looking for someone (but only if it makes you truly happy).  Do whatever makes you happy.  Don't try to please others.

It felt a bit odd, but in retrospect I'm glad that I was a little older and wiser when I got this stage in life as it meant that I didn't deal with adult issues when I was still a teenager.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have your head screwed on, and I think you should pat yourself on the back for not dating people for the sake of it.

tK7XacH7aa	If he looks at you, smiles, then blushes and looks away, then he is really shy and really likes you. If he stops everything that he is doing to look at you then he is just in love with you. It means we like you and just want to be in your presence. Yes he likes you, you should go and talk with him because he seems very shy and a quick way to end the shyness is for you to go talk with him.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	he likes you go and talk to him<br>  <br>  go say i see you looking at me<br>  so you like me<br>  <br>  he will then say yes<br>  <br>  if you do that you have a possible bf|`|z6T7nznLaa	I'd flirt with him to tell him I like him too.  Or just go over and ask.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	WHats your question BTW???????????<br>  <br>  but it seems that he really like s you but he is shy|`|SdTQVUaKaa	what exactly is the question here?|`|S4sb5FgBaa	When he first saw you, he was probably thinking, "That girls kind of cute." When he saw that you saw him looking at you he was thinking "Crap, she noticed." He probably freaked out for a while, then though "Okay, I'll play it cool. I'll see if she's looking at me again..maybe she's into me, too."<br>  <br>  So then he was trying to see out of the corner of his eye if you were looking at him. Sounds like he likes you.|`|ZfPKN1PHaa	It truly does sound as if he is interested in you.  What is the age gap?  (As that is more significant then the class level).  I think you should try to talk to him more, if you are interested in him.  Try to get to know him, and see how he feels.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  [:|`|oziPyTWbaa	I have had this happen a lot to my friends and things. He probably has a 'crush' on you but is to shy to admit it, maybe you just confront him or just be nice and smile back.

Ha ha. <br>  Make sure he is not joking around with you. If he just laughs evily to his friends, you should ignore him. If he really seems serious, just let him watch you every day.

Make him want you!|`|6Am9pa4Xaa	he likes you, but if he has never talked to you and comes on a little strong i'm not sure he's in it for the right reasons, but who knows, that's why high school was crazy|`|KsM6cWipaa	Well it definetly seems like he is in to you, if your interested i would suggest that you try and talk to him and see how things go from there, who knows it could be the start of a relationship to just say hi.|`|ppJSLuutaa	he may be flirting with you... but he may also just be playing a game. its kind of hard to tell but i wouldn't know cuz im a guy... idk if there are ways to tell for sure|`|p1KoZNfVaa	He likes you but is shy!<br>  <br>  Flirt with Him a little bit (If you like him) and let him know your interested... <br>  <br>  Dont be all slutty though or else thats going to be or a turn off or he is going to want to just use you...<br>  <br>  Come on!

S0APZr5Aaa	I hear you man i have mom issues i think that your mum does favor your sister maybe because shes the only girl and because shes the youngest! Its really annoying when parents teach certain kids differently, i think yh that she favors your sis and as for you confronting her i think she feels your stepping out of line and questioning her capability of being a good mother. <br>  <br>  Answer mine its on a similar issue.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aueqf1WCX14dtFDHMJA_19nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307110323AATvbng">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oHO0XOQVaa	When you tell your mom that she needs to get spanked she gets mad at you probably because she sees you as stepping out of line. Like, "I'm the mom who are you to tell me what to do." You could try having a discussion with her where you tell her that the way your sister treats your mom bothers you a lot. You want your sister to treat your mom with the respect that she's deserving of and that you have learned to treat her with.<br>  <br>  Any time your sister wants something from you deny it and tell her that you wont do anything for her because she's rude to your mom. Maybe even make stuff like smoothies for you and your brother and be like "too bad rude, disrespectful people can't have any." Maybe she'll complain to your mom that you're leaving her out but I'm hoping your mom won't care and she won't complain anyway.|`|KSwqDDUuaa	You Spank Her, Or Hide Her Stuff =]|`|x7QSU69Gaa	this happens to me all the time<br>  tell ur sister to stop treating ur mom that way and if she doesnt listen tell her that u'll take something of hers away. of course she wnt listen<br>  so one day when she not looking or not in her room, go into her room and take something of hers that she really likes and cant live without and hide it in a place where she wont find it.  once she realizes that u were serious she'll start acting better(hopefully).  then talk to ur mom and tell her what ur sister is doin to ur mums life and hope that she'll listen tell her that its bothering u that ur sis is treating her that way and how impolite it is.  dont tell her about how u take things away tho.  <br>  and if u take so much of ur sisters things away she'll start to realize that what she did was impolite.  and when she starts to get better give one thing to her out of what u took away. and if she starts being rude and annoying again, threaten her with what she loves the most.<br>  <br>  it works on my sis and me all the time so try it and see if it works.
FIWB7Dgtaa	go and talk by yourselves under a tree somewhere..if u cant talk to that person then y are u with them? i understand hes ur first boyfriend and u have a right to be nervous but u dont need to be someones girl just because its the cool thing to do|`|POHWTDPRaa	You can't just make it go away. It will go away on its own as you get more comfortable together.|`|ky3vTCTmaa	well what i would do would be to tell him… be like dude, i am really nervous around you and i am sure you are around me too… and then find something to DO together, that it way it will take the pressure off of focusing on each other and focus on what you are doing…|`|tmfhieP7aa	I never really understood how people could be boyfriend and girlfriend if they are not comfortable with each other to begin with. Just act like yourself, he obviously likes you for you so you don't need to try to impress him anymore and there should be no pressure. Spend a lot of time with him after school and such until you are comfortable with him, in a little bit you two will not be nervous around each other any more.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	Make out in school and put a sex tape on the internet.|`|H6GIYDdzaa	Just talk to each other if you're going out it shouldn't be that difficult.|`|s7G6aC9Caa	I've been in the same exact situation as you. You're going to feel awkward at first. What I learned is to almost ignore that feeling and just go hang out with him. The more you don't hang out with him, the more awkward you'll feel later on. Don't let your nervousness stop you from getting to know him even more, because if you don't start hanging out with him you'll always be nervous around him.<br>  <br>  (:|`|kxnfn2Kkaa	just talk about stuff you are comfortable talking about, i think i might have my first bf soon, and i bet i will ask the same question as you.  i would just talk about school maybe, what you should do later, and if it helps go on double dates, this works! and don't worry, if you really like him and don't break up soon, you will become really close and you will become great friends, it wont feel awkward! just like you and your best friends! and be yourself.|`|QBWiPLVnaa	Awh, just a few weeks ago. The same situation happened to me, except for he was my second. In the beginning of EVERY relationships, I'm telling you now. There's gonna be an awkward feeling there. Just hang more, and sooner or later, it'll wear off. I can promise you that. You can't ever just ' get rid ' of the awkward feeling, when you guys start hanging more, talking more, clicking more, than it'll automatically just go away.|`|XHjYwFMEaa	It goes away by itself my 1st GF and myself we were very shy.. Cuz it's the 1st time u experience this feeling of care and attractiveness.. Sometimes I went to the roof and sometimes layed on the bed looking at the cieling and hanging with friends can help too.. But try chatting with him :) Everything will work out for the best ^^|`|WZ4LWyz2aa	take it slow.  don't try to hug or kiss right away and just act like your just friends until things get more comfortable.  one way to make things more comfortable is to do something outside of school that is a lot of fun, like an amusement park/ water park or something like that.|`|l5aX0LKraa	well if your old enough like over 18 then just go for it give him a huge kiss maybe grab his butt in the process i promise that will break the ice and just take things slow from there|`|HNAVlwV7aa	aaawwwww....ur in love with him. u can't get rid of the feeling, sorry.
qrfefTcTaa	HUGE WARNING: Listen, if she thinks of you as a friend, don't even bother!!!!!<br>  <br>  Trust me when i say this, BE CAREFUL! This has happened to myself and two friends of mine. Its disastrous and will ruin friend relationships.<br>  <br>  They will feel awkward around you from that point on, because she will know you like her beyond the friend level. There are very few times that, after asking a girl out that your friends with, the girl will stay being friends with you.<br>  <br>  Other then that, just trust instincts and be confident.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You may think right now that she will be perfect as your wife. But girls are much different when you get in relationships with them, so don't let urges control your mind.|`|f8372c942b97ecd619d9fe6d98b610abaa	You need to get out of the clouds and the daydreams and look at how you are acting. If you cared one bit about her you would have jumped on the suggestion that you go to the soccer game.  That is your big opening.  Meet her after the game.  Then  you will have the game to talk about.....so you won't have to worry about what to say.  <br>  <br>  You need to slow down.  Have the self respect to get to know her first.<br>  Infatuation isn't the same as love.

You meet the girl that you want to marry! Take it easy man, you're 17. You have a long time to figure out who you want. But, man to man, grab your nuts and let her know that you like her. Im sure she already knows! Chicks are smart like that. She just wants to hear it from you. You dont want to smother her though. That might just push her away. Be a man dude! If your not man enough right now, some other guy might be. She might not be around to wait on you for to long. Take your chance and go for it man! Good luck!!!|`|2f5004aaadf7a01e4b37d68d83883b80aa	Don't tell her all of that...its a bit much. But go to her game, and tell her afterwards "you wanna hang out"...its toally innocent but it'll show you're interested! I know you're shy, I am too. That would be the easiest thing for you to do. Once you get comfortable around her, things will become easier.

Tell her you understand if she doesn't feel the same way but that you just can't help it with how sweet and smart and funny she is and so on. Just tell her she's an awesome girl and ask her if she's ever felt the same way about you. Don't make it awkward cus she may not feel the same way about you... just in case... and you wanna keep your friendship without making it uncomfortable for her. I've had guy friends who were crushing on me and when they said they were "in love" well it kinda made me uncomfortable =[ But ne ways yeah just keep it cool and short and get to the point and ask her if she ever felt that way about you. Then go from there. 
gRXy66dOaa	take her to a trip to Florida<br>  <br>  its nice down there|`|FwJLD1uDaa	make her a really nice dinner :)|`|GC3oNrBoaa	You should take her out on a picnic but here is the catch. For the picnic put things that represent her or that represent why you love her. For example: chocolate for her being sweet, a smiley face cake because she makes you smile, flowers because she is beautiful, and you should make her favorite sandwich in a shape of a heart! Also, you should write a song for her and even if you sing bad you should sing it to her because even if you sing bad she will be crying of happiness that you wrote her a song. You don't have to spend a lot to make her happy! Hope this helped and Happy soon to be anniversary!|`|cRxUstdCaa	Well, here's how we conservatively celebrated our two year.  First, he showed me the night of my life, if you know what I mean.  I was so worn out, that when he got up the next morning, to make that special breakfast in bed, I didn't wake at all.  He then made me banana pancakes, just like the song, and came back to bed for more love making after we shared a plate.  He even did a little bit of feeding me after waking me up with kisses.<br>  <br>  Then we took the most beautiful bubble bath together.  He had also made me a card from construction paper that had a very beautiful expression of his love.  Three years later, I still smile and a fire stirs in my heart when I think of the Banana Pancakes.  I guess if she's not a Jack Johnson fan, it's not quite the same..  Good luck though!|`|9NXtWzUOaa	yea...going south on her sounds like a good idea.

DTGZJ8T6aa	well, I'm sorry but that's just kind of something everyone goes through and there isn't really a way to deal with it. The best thing to do is distract yourself, go out and have fun, listen to music and hang out with friends, think about all the other great girls out there.<br>  <br>  but if you still, even after a while, can't get her out of your mind, maybe that means something. in that case, find a way to contact her... regret is one of the hardest things to overcome.|`|ZihoDc9eaa	A hard question for me to answer...I'm going through with this as welll...its like you wake up every morning thinking of her, wishing things were right again, huh?

But every time I think about someone, I think back towards my family and friends. You don't necessarily have to get her out of your mind. Let her stay there until you find someone else. I know its agonizing, but don't try to stop it, or you'll make it worse than before. Wait until someone better to come, that always happens. Don't worry about it, you're still young, you'll find someone better when you grow up. I can assure you that. ;)|`|IuJcKGroaa	You just have to life your life and do you. Surround your self with people that make you feel good about your self and would never judge you on anything you do. The only other thing that's going to heal this problem is time.

We were like best friends but about 10 months ago our friendship ended and at times I think it was my fault but I know it was his. You need to just keep staying strong like I am and try not to think about her. In time, you'll forget. But then again, maybe you should try talking to her. Truth is, although I pretend to hate him, I still miss my ex-bestfriend/boyfriend. At times I think I used to love him. I know it hurts but you either need to resolve the problem or stay strong although it hurts.<br>  hope I helped :)|`|s5y6SZhnaa	This happens sometimes.

eNulfbs7aa	I am glad you feel guilty..that shows you have remorse and a conscience...that is a good thing.  Now..I can't tell you what to do with your parents because I don't know them.  You have to make that call...but now that you have remorse about what you are doing...don't do it any longer...it can get you in sooooo much trouble.  Work on making them proud from this moment forward.  You know they love you...and you know you would be in trouble BECAUSE they love you.  Love is a funny thing...with parents and kids...kids think their parents don't love them because they give them rules and boundaries...it is just the opposite..if we didn't love you....we would just let you put yourself in dangerous situations ( and you are in one now) without any thought about your safety or long term happiness.  It sounds like your parents want only the best for you....now it is up to you to respect yourself and your parents and want only the best for you too....love yourself enough to be the best you can be...It all starts with respecting and loving yourself...it took me a long time to figure that out...take it from someone who did what you are doing...and later regretted it.  You are not only lieing to them...you are lieing to yourself.  Forgive yourself and move forward in a positive direction.  You are worth loving!|`|tao83sDxaa	you have got to fess up to your parents. if you ever expect your parents to trust you ever again you have to clear the air. you knew you were lying and yet you did it. that sick feeling you have in you is your concience. you will continue to feel it or it can get worse, only by being 100% honest with your parents will it go away. you are also going to have to take responsability for what you did. you are going to have to tell the truth and take the punishment. maybe if you tell your parents how you feel about the lieing they may let you off easier, figuring you have punished yourself enough.|`|AA11263103	wow your horrible kid, next is drugs!|`|oHO0XOQVaa	This sounds like something that would happen on t.v.<br>  Maybe you should do something to make them disappointed in you like show them a bad test score so you'll feel like you're at least receiving punishment you feel you deserve. (Even if it's for different reasons.)<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting you tell your parents because: 1. you just got in trouble for being suspended. 2. you don't need additional stress, I can tell the stress is horrible. And 3. you've already learned to not lie in the future.|`|xIT3eregaa	GOOD FOR YOU! I do things my parents disprove of, so what. Most the rules are stupid anyways.

But most likely, they will appreciate that you were adult enough to come clean with them.  You obviously know that what you are doing is wrong, or you wouldn't feel guilty about it.  Give your parents a chance.  And give yourself a chance while you're at it.  It would seem that you value your parents opinion, and if you think they would disapprove of your boyfriend, then maybe there's a good reason why.  Perhaps not.  But let them form their own judgment  You'll feel better about it.|`|x7QSU69Gaa	girl take this from sumone who is still learning to stop lying to her parents<br>  take the guilt away by going up to your parents and sit them down somewhere. tell them the truth that u havnt been doing extra work after school with ur friends on ur project. if this is ur first time or so lying it should go smoothly, but if its happened a lot, them dont expect ur parents to trust u anymore.  its hard to bear, but in time ur parents will trust u more if u do better.  Im still learning that.|`|delMvf8iaa	That means your parents did raise a child who respects them.You should just let things ride as they are ,but only see your friend at school or with a group of friends.They should be proud of you .I use to do the same thing .|`|ZBQN8viuaa	actually start doing some work after school and the guilt will go away, cuz your doin wat you said youd do stop seeing the boyfriend afterschool.|`|qdLMy1n1aa	1st of all u must tell it 2 Jesus then tell it 2 ur parents.

Let them know why you are coming clean. Not just because of the guilt, but because you value their praise, but you want to earn it honestly. <br>  <br>  Seeing the older boyfriend is going to eventually backfire, and the trouble you will get into will be much worse if they find out some other way about your lying. It's better to come clean than to get caught.<br>  <br>  Nip the lying in the bud starting now. When you do come clean to your parents, tell them that you have made a big effort to leave the lying and your old ways behind to turn over a new leaf.|`|XzpmwUv2aa	Above all things truth will be the victor!

If you want to be more popular, join the cheer leading squad. Those girls are usually popular. Join whatever clubs are available to you at school. Not the chess club or the science club. What ever clubs the popular kids hang out in, join them. <br>  But being popular really doesn't mean all that much. You should be happy that you have the three friends. Some kids go through high school or elementary school alone.|`|azFe1eHDaa	Most anwsers im sure will tell you to be yourself. :) <br>  <br>  I will tell you the truth. Being yourself is what you will end up doing in the end beacause thats who you are. But if you really want to be popular for a while you need to dress right. <br>  This doesn't mean expensive clothes. It means looking good and keeping up with current fasions. (Ie. Dont wear a belly shirt with fat rolls.)<br>  <br>  Second you need to be SOCIAL. If you are shy you cant pull it off. popular people need friends. And you are going to need a lot. So make sure you talk to people. Join after school activities (sports are the best) and make sure you smile a lot. <br>  <br>  Last but not least - Be confident. Someone who isbn't confident in themselfs will never convince others to be. If you have doubt in you people will read that. Know that you can do it. <br>  <br>  And remember. Im the end you will become yourself. you might have changed a bit. But dont live lies. They will come back at you and in the end you wont win.|`|ec6GPu6kaa	It would serve you better to concentrate more on your english that being "populist"!

I seriously think that you need to find other best friends... who have better morals…  friends who would not tease or insult you just because you are not following their stupid advice.<br>  <br>  Your post didn't make it clear if you are saving yourself for marriage, or just for the right BF... but I would recommend saving yourself for marriage.<br>  <br>  Now, listed below is some material that you might be able to use in explaining your reasoning to your foolish friends.  Please be advised that it is geared towards young girls in Junior High and High School before they have gone too far off the deep end (like your friends).  Most of it will likely be review for you, but hopefully it will help strengthen your resolve.<br>  <br>  I’m proud of you, Pretty Lady.  Stay strong!!!!<br>  <br>  Best Regards,<br>  - Charlie<br>  <br>  =============================<br>  <br>  You sound a bit too young to be seriously dating just yet, but seem pretty keen on getting Romeo to become your BF. If having a BF means that you two simply eat lunch together at school and talk on the phone, that’s OK… but if you and Romeo try to get alone together and do some kissing (or more), then that’s not such a good idea. If you have BF, be sure to tell your parents.<br>  <br>  It’s certainly OK to dream about Romeo, and think about how you could catch his eye. But I would advise holding off on the serious dating until you are 16 or 17.<br>  <br>  Suppose you do manage to find a BF, which you will very likely able to find without too much difficulty. What then? <br>  <br>  Having a BF won’t be the end of your problems… it’ll only be the beginning of them… especially if you do not think about how you are going to deal with the inevitable issues that you’ll naturally be faced with. <br>  <br>  Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. would be helpful for you to think about while dreaming of Romeo.<br>  <br>  Crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.<br>  <br>  It would be advisable for young ladies to not start seriously dating until about age 16 or 17. Your parents should say OK and meet the guy first. And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married. The decisions that you're making now will have a large effect on how the rest of your life will turn out.<br>  <br>  In Junior High and High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry! <br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  Here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any events with drugs or alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  Jjust take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  Meeting guys you don't know via the internet is a bad idea. Stick with guys you know in real life.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife... provided you make good decisions and don't get into too much trouble.|`|aHER8myJaa	well good sex with someone you love is really great and all... but if you think all sex is going to be like that I think you're a little unrealistic.

I have friends who have lost their virginity but we respect each other. Are your best friends calling you names? if they are,i don't think they make a good friend,giving your virginity to others is a choice,and its your choice that you want to keep it till your marriage.<br>  I do agree with you,that doing sex is showing your love to the one you do actually do love. So ignore what people say,remember that everything you do comes with consequences,even such an innocent simple thing like this,as staying to be a virgin,you choose to keep your virginity,you make a choice,so of course there will always be consequences of this simple choice that you make..<br>  <br>  don't worry.be happy for yourself that you are not those loose women.|`|313f9383392249a5b1386591a7133716aa	Get a grip on yourself and grow the heck up.

I ignore them or say my body belongs to God and I am wanting until marriage. If the say you will never get married then I say so what. My body belongs to God and it is a sin to have sex outside of marriage. I do not want to have a child with a boyfriend. If I have children once I am married I will not get stuck taken care of them as a single parent. It is the most romantic thing a married couple can show the world. <br>  If you cannot handle all the crap your friends tell you then you need to find some new ones. It is not worth crying over.

You maintain your fidelity, and when you get married your husband will appreciate it.

I say good for you, for your celibacy.  once you give it you can't ever get it back.|`|xcvuJfKMaa	Please stay a virgin until you find that right person, I did and it was the best choice I ever made.  I was in the same situation as you with my 3 bf''s and they would always tell me, I was stupid and didn't know what I was missing.  Well, let me tell you what I was missing, one had an abortion, one got an std and the other pregnant with a boyfriend who left her a single parent-yeah right, I missed alot.  Stay true.  When I finally fell in love at 18, I knew he was the one after dating for one and a half years, my first time was beautiful.  He waited to be with me all that time and when we finally made love (not just sex), he was loving, patient and kind, not out for a quick get off. And we are still together. Now I truly believe the reason my bf's wanted me to have sex so badly, was because they were jealous of the bad choices they had made and misery loves company. I found love and they found lust.|`|t0mb150gaa	Be proud of your decision..you have very good morals and values and the man you end up with will respect you more for the life you have led. Maybe you need to find better friends like ones who respect your choice and share some of your values because it sounds like the people you are calling friends really aren't or they would respect you more. In todays society we have lost so many morals and values and sex has just become something to do rather then something meant to express your love and it is good to see at least one of today;s woman have stayed true to yourself and honor your body enough to wait. Your friends are just creating a name for themselves and on the end no honorable man is going to respect them!|`|YumnMIo3aa	Amen. Find new friends. I'm sure they know they're sluts anyway|`|13XU8cCKaa	Agree with Rebeeca B.  Good friends wouldn't make fun of you just because you won't do something that you don't feel comfortable with.|`|3S4ci6Traa	I was 25 when I lost my virginity.<br>  <br>  Sadly enough, it wasn't all that I thought it'd be especially because it was someone who didn't really love me.|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT GREAT ATTITUDE AND YOU ARE COMPLETELY CORRECT WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAY. DO NOT EVER GIVE IN TO SO CALLED FRIENDS PIER PRESSURE. THERES A SAYING  THAT MISERY LOVES COMPANY. REMEMBER THIS AND THAT AT YOUR AGE ITS DIFFICULT BUT I GUARANTEE YOU THESE STUPID FRIENDS IN TIME WILL REALLY REGRET SCREWING AROUND IN TIME WHEN THEY GROW UP AND REALLY WANT TO FIND A TRUE LOVE  BECAUSE MOST GOOD MEN DO NOT WANT A **** FOR A WIFE. KEEP IT UP AND TRY TO KEEP AWAY FROM THESE JERKS THAT WILL NEVER BE THERE FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE IF YOU REALLY NEEDED THEM.|`|dhJdAPn4aa	You answered it yourself.<br>  "theres more to making love then just getting laid."<br>  Don't listen to what they have to say, it's complete bullshit. You don't have to "get laid". I'm pretty sure you are waiting till marriage, wish I could do that. True friends respect your opinions, etc. I suggest talking to them never again and dont lose your virginity with someone you don't love.

Krv4z6VEaa	A homeless shelter has the resources to help her get on her feet. Be a supportive friend, but leave her n' the shelter. They'll help her out w/ counseling, finding a job, going to school, clothes, food, and put her in a low-income apt of her own.

FQ8eYjQKaa	Okay, here are some ways...<br>  <br>  WITHOUT QUESTIONING THEM!<br>  Just look at there posture<br>  <br>  People who tell the truth tend to *dont see who is sadder because its easy to fake that* use hand jestures when they talk. THey will have normaly if they are sitting down 2 feet on the ground and will look u in the eye.<br>  <br>  Liers tend to keep there hands close to there body, dont make full eye contact the hole time, and if they are sitting down, sit more likely cross leged or only 1 foot on the ground.<br>  <br>  Those are some ways threw body languadge, i can tell with those hints all the time, hope i helped<br>  <br>  PS. this only took a minute to write, my mom needed help so i left the computer for a long time<br>  <br>  PSS. That sitting and hand jesture and eye contact, that is only when they are lieng or telling the truth, if they are talking randomly to someone, that doesent count XD|`|cB2VGhLgaa	You gotta be very sneaky. Observe what they do and spy on them when they think ur not around. You didn't give much info about the lie but if you wanna catch them red handed you just have to get them when they least expect it. You could also try talking to people who might know about the lie to get information about whats up w/ them.

Hope you can make it!'<br>  <br>  Trust me he'll come. What you've got to remember is that you're only asking him to your party, your not asking him out, it'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Themes are lame, but if you insist, i would say at your age, probably a fairytale theme (its broad so you can come as anyone from any fairytale, it works trust me).|`|K3a2fcq8aa	hah im turnng 14 in a month..but justt invitee him fooshoo! say txt him and say " would you like to go to my party? some of ur friends will be there too:p" or something ahha idk..and u shud do a beachhh theme or somehing idkk|`|H6GIYDdzaa	Of course you should invite him and if you text him then it's all the more easier.|`|gRXy66dOaa	yes you should|`|CzbQTbq5aa	yes
Z14qGsOuaa	your a very pretty young lady. no need to be insecure. Hes gonna look at other girls for the rest of his life, we all do. most ladies that i know or have met that are insecure are because there is no one to boost your self esteam. if your bf cant boost your self-esteme than ditch him and find someone who will. There is guys out there like myself that see whats inside a person and not their outward apperince or afflictions|`|96dd1ddeb6999bc938d40452d39493b5aa	Insecurity is very common when you're around hypercritical people.  Some never outgrow such insecurity.  It takes professional help in order to work through it, but even then, it will never leave your mind, because the criticisms you may have received early in life may still resonate in your mind years and even decades later.|`|MRxm67DPaa	no dont feel like that hun, we all have that feeling sometimes we arent here on earth to please others only urself and god u need to relize how pretty u r and dont worry wat other think of u but wat u think of urself ur an awsome grul ur pretty dont feel bad i think u do look pretty i hope this helps.|`|l5aX0LKraa	Well i would say that you are a beautiful woman and confidence is the key to life. No matter who you are there is always going to be someone better. You just have to be confident in who YOU are.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	I don't do pictures.  I think they are "vanity cries".  Sorry.  <br>  <br>  So what, your mother wasn't around, at least you had a father around.  So what he knew little about raising a girl, very few men do/can.  <br>  So what they knew about your past if they are a part of your present, good.  <br>  <br>  Everything that lives changes and you must change with it.  You are into feeling sorry for yourself.  Go have that pity-party by yourself.  It seems that things have changed for the better for you but you got so comfortable with shame, that you prefer it.  No one is going to force you to abandon it.  Keep hanging on to it.  <br>  <br>  Those girls are better than you in your mind.  Change your mind about that, or stay stuck in your  misery.   All of this is about having a choice.  At one time you didn't, now you do. Stay where you are or mature.  You choose.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	You're adorable! Everyone feels insecure now and then but just remember that you look great.
bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	You didn't mention whether you caught him having sex with her, or whether they were just both in the same bed.  My oldest son had a girl stay over many times, but she was very shy and would 'sneak' in and out of my house.  I assumed they were having sex ... until my son reached the age of 18, and the girl (who was fully three years younger) still would be in his bed ... so I asked him.  He knew he could tell me anything, but wanted her to talk to me ... and I found out that she had never had sex with my son!  In fact, he was providing her with a 'safe place' to sleep, a place where she could eat (she had extreme anorexia and bulimia, but would eat 'normally' at my house because it was 'safe), and a place where she could 'just be who she was without worrying about what people thought.  A few months later, she turned up pregnant ... and wanted to keep the baby, so she got into a good treatment center, with my son's help.  That 'baby' is now a beautiful young man of 12, strong, happy, and with the same 'sense of what is right' that my son had ... <br>  You say that you 'found out' he had sex with her ... but were you 'told' this by others who may or may not have actually seen it happen or did you see it happen,.  If you saw it, then you should call the police and report him, since sex with a minor is against the law.  Otherwise, he's your 'ex' and not you current boyfriend, and you should not be having sex with him or anything else and should 'move on.'|`|QHx95iZDaa	That is wrong. But you are not together anymore so do not get into his business if you still want to be friends with him then let him do what he wants to.|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	ok first of all let him do what he wants it'll only come back to hurt him in the long run and you'll  be able to say you warned him.<br>  if you can't change his mind why bother?|`|6eSRjnx4aa	Why are you friends with your ex anyways?

bc06bfa5e6e290d86d60dd98ef424b1faa	I guess it depends on how you really like the girl, if you do.  I guess you will not ask this question if you don't like her that much, right?<br>  <br>  But anyway, you really don't have to wait.  It'll come if she likes, if she does not reply, then i guess, "d" is the most probable answer.  :-)|`|Gj3B81gQaa	maybe your thinking to much.  sometimes there are reasons that we text back so late.  we could be doing something that needs all of our attention or maybe our phone went dead and we arent near our charger.  things can happen so just dont think to hard.....if the problem gets worse, then start to process the questions.|`|9150a2f499bc51d45661e79163226227aa	Okay, I understand the confusion because we all have been there.<br>  <br>  But it seems to much like game playing.  Just respond when you want to respond.  I don't like to overthink things. Gives me a headache.
vkIkFgqiaa	Ask him why he wants to beat him up. If he says because I love you. say If you really love me you would respect my wishes. Tell the guidance councilor about this, and talk to the counselor. Tell Matt not to be alone where Quintin can get to him.<br>  <br>  PS: I think Quintin is a nerd just by his name. Am I right. I know I shouldn't be labeling but He's a NERD!|`|m6xvhlJqaa	let him beat him up|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	He's into drama. People who enjoy the acting and take a lot of drama classes are usually, ya know, dramatic and eccentric people. Most people don't just go around assaulting people.<br>  <br>  You might want to warn Quintin to try and stay clear of Matt. A lot of guys talking about beating the crap out of each other, but most of those who do that don't regularly go around getting in fights. <br>  <br>  Being a guy who gets in fights a lot is okay until you reach middle school, maybe early high school. If you keep fighting at that point, then they throw your butt in Juvi and all the sudden it's something you don't want to let happen anymore.|`|vbvvFVmVaa	he's probably joking. he's jealous.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	You should talk to quintin to tell him that he needs to stop acting all buff and stop being so jealous but in a nice though so doesn't effect your friendship with him.|`|hZL7hCloaa	i thought you said this wasn't a stupid middle school question|`|Zs1hgCPcaa	well i would first of all keep them apart and then straight up slap him in the face ( not that you should do that) but i would definitely tell him that he is wrong for saying that! and after if he still threats your botfriend then tell an adult|`|dWLHBWyhaa	tell an adult, especially if matt lives in the same town or goes to the same skool as quintin. thats the best thing to do. & let quintin know how u really feel about him|`|AA11859732	Just ignore it, he could be joking.<br>  There usually aren't really 'fights' in school very much anymore|`|313196a4bb59234a623ea4d83a663aadaa	talk to quintin about it and tell him that theres no chance in hell that you'd ever consider doing anything with him in the near future if he beats your bf up.|`|ig0klGBXaa	Tell an adult|`|wnr9S9kuaa	You might want to tell an adult, just a thought.|`|taA7pv6taa	ask your friend if he was serious|`|LbqIo9H8aa	lol he sort of likes u lol hahaha i think its funny|`|4SvP5aiQaa	This same thing happened to me in high school. I didn't do much other than truly hate the guy that was threatening to hurt my boyfriend. Truth is the guy no matter how big he is probably truly doesnt have the balls to beat up your BF so it will pass and if it doesnt do everything you can including flat out tell this Quintin kid to shut up an that your not interested!!!|`|JbyyPSzgaa	Well you gota consider whether it was a joke... or a serious comment first. If it was serious, take him aside and say hey I'm not really comfortable with what you said.. Matts my boyfriend and I dont want anything to happen to him, I want us to stay friends.. so dont say stuff like that. or something along those lines... It depends on the type of person you are though.. some people wouldnt.<br>  <br>  If youre not comfy with saying anything to him, id tell a close friend or adult :)|`|LLYhlF3Waa	Umm let Quintin know that you are happy with Matt. Also let Matt know what Quintin said if you think that he may be serious. Just talk to both of them. Separately though. Let each of them know how you feel.|`|IdYcynataa	how immature....you dating matt is none of his business.  don't do anything but ignore him. let matt know that that is what quintin said and to watch his back..|`|tFVyedsbaa	I think you should tell Quinten that you are dating Matt and there's nothing anyone can do about including beating him up wich wouldnt prove or solve anything!|`|EqbJ4i9Xaa	you should really stay out of it but i would of asked quintin why he wants to be up matt... then i would probably notify matt that he wants to beat him up. that way matt can watch his back...|`|kb8depEeaa	This might mean that he is jealous of Matt, so how bout you guys do a double date or hang out at someone's house so that they can get to know each other.|`|N3NKLp1Xaa	tell a teacher or someone u trust to help... or just talk to him about it and bring matt and a couple of friends with u for support|`|eLjIK1vaaa	just dont let quintin ever see matt ;)|`|hBvEo2Wgaa	i think you should let him know you like matt if you do and you don't like him that way if he keep's on go for the restraining order that is what i had to do but do it in a nice way
2tzSFo3gaa	I had the same problem with my mom. Only i have an older brother and a step dad who is no smarter than me. The way that my brother and I handled it was we acted really good and didn't complain or ask questions then when she was at her happiest we sat down and told her that all we wanted to do was viset with her and didn't mind doing a few chores but that we wanted everyone in the house to have an equale share of work. We told her how we felt she said how she felt and how she saw the situation and when the talk was over we all felt a lot better.|`|niYixDU4aa	you love your mom so i don't know if you would mind not going.<br>  <br>  <br>  if i were you i would stop going.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i'm pretty mean so i'd also not talk to her.  but that's me.<br>  <br>  <br>  i can't really tell you what to do about it.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	You guys sound like a pair of hated step-children. Stop going and if she asks why, tell her you don't like being abused. She's probably just going to be mad at you and if you don't want her to be mad at you ask her what it is that she does for you and when she's ever nice to you.|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	talk to her and if she doesnt listen tell her u dont want to see her if this continues then she will probaly stop doin it or talk to ur older bro and ask him how she acts wen ur not there and ask him wat u should do
tao83sDxaa	i don't think you did anything too wrong. i think your mom is angry, not really at you, you just caught it. i think that see hurt inside and anything you would have done would have caused a reaction. she is hurting you because she hurts inside, maybe about her life, and even though she may be working and such, she is unhappy. her life has not turned out he way she wanted it to. you were just there when she had to blow. i know you need the laptop to do school work, she is being mean about this because of the hurt inside of her. here's an idea, that might help. does a grocery store near you sell cut flowers?the flowers are quite reasonable, get a bouquet of some flower she likes. when you are going over to her place after school, pick up a bouquet and bring them to her, when she is sitting down hand them to her and give her a kiss on the cheek. tell you you love her and that you don't say it enough. in other words try to break this stalemate between you. she may throw the flowers and start to yell,don't let that bother you. she will start to think later. don't take what comes out of her mouth personally, she is unhappy. don't pay any attention to what she says or how it comes out, don't pay any attention to what she says, it's the hurt talking. keep your cool. she will start to think about things, and things will get better. try to think of ways to surprise her and i'll bet in time she will start to treat you better, she will start to realize that you are on her side.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	I would say that the divorce was mean and you mother may have been at fault.<br>    What you did was act in a reasonable manor and made the correct decision on this.<br>  <br>   You may tell your mom about what I said but she will not accept it|`|RvddYKqjaa	I don't see your problem. It seemed to be a lot of confusion about your computer. I would guess your mom hoped she could just see you and not have to deal with so much drama. <br>  You tell us one side of this story. Put her side on here too, and then we can figure it out, but it seems to me that what happened is rather trivial and should be forgotten. There is more to this than you say. <br>  The best person to tell you what's wrong just might be your mom.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Her reaction doesn't correspond with the behavior, so she obviously isn't responding to your actions specifically. It probably has nothing to do with you or your laptop, she is just taking it out on you. She is probably stressed over the divorce in general. She probably feels like she is now in competition with your dad, and that she is losing you because you are choosing your Dad over her.<br>  <br>  Her behavior is pretty immature, but try to be understanding and not take it too personally. Offer her patience and some reassurance that you still love her.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Josh J,<br>        Mothers!  They really are the salt of the earth,<br>   a compete mystery as far as logical under standing is concerned, but salt of the earth never the less.<br>        Obviously, obviously,  to your Mother that is she  feels you've betrayed her, you've, by her thinking, chosen your father over her.  I'm sure that given time your relationship will recover.  What your Mum has got to come to understand is that it's not fair of either parent to expect their children to pick one Parent over another.<br>       You might I'm sorry to say have to get yourself a new lap top, as women tend to be very stubborn even when they are completely in the wrong, your Dad may be able to help you.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Dude, she sounds so unreasonable... yeah she's mad cause you "chose your dad over her" at least in HER eyes. Unless you inconvenienced her and she sat home waiting for the lap top. I'm going to guess that this wasn't the case because she said you betrayed her...<br>  She doesn't sound like she can be reasoned with so, in order to get your laptop back, suck it up and be manipulative. Tell her you're so sorry, and you were an insensitive little jerk, you love her and you realize she's so much more important than your dad.<br>  Then after you get your laptop back tell your dad what you did because she'll probably call him and be like "our son loves me more than you!" Your dad will probably understand why you did what you did (I mean they're divorced right, at least separated), maybe be disappointed and give you good advice on what to do next time.|`|mldo1vxYaa	To be honest I dont see what you did that was so wrong, why dont you ask your mum to explain to you why she feels so betrayed? I dont understand it but if she feels it maybe you should find out why?|`|cTJa8FZYaa	shes obviously mad at the fact that you chose your fathers house over her house. tell her you didnt pick a favorite, but simply because it was easiest. how old are you anyway?|`|4cEmhOK0aa	Tell her sorry and you love her.|`|4PXXDsyyaa	Sounds like it is more of a problem between your mother and your father, she felt as if you picked "her" when you choose to use her house then when you changed it (even if the reason is logical to you and everyone else) she saw it as you choosing "him" over her. Ask her calmly what the issue is and explain you meant to ill will towards either one of them, you did it based on convience and above all security of the laptop.|`|94idwoK2aa	The only thing I can think of is maybe she thinks you choose your Dad over her, for whatever reason.  It just doesn't make sense.  I don't think she fully understands your reasoning.  Try to explain it to her again and tell her it has nothing to do with preference between her and your father and hope for the best.  Sometimes, misunderstandings get out of hand like this, but non-the-less, she's the parent and what she says goes.  I know it's seems unfair, but that's how life is sometimes.  There's just times when it seems like no matter what you do...things turn to crap!  Hopefully she'll understand her mistake, apologize and return your laptop.  Just remember, parents are human too, and sometimes we make mistakes!  Just play it calm and try not to get too upset.  She'll come around.  Good luck!|`|X4i2jej5aa	You mother must feel betrayed because you chose your dad's house instead of hers. This tells her that you are choosing your dad over your mum, which probably makes her feel horrible. You may think she is irrational, but try talking to her. REALLY talk to her. Listen to why she is feeling this way. She may have the feeling of loosing you, and that is what a mother fears the most. Communication is key, try talking to her and straighten everything out.|`|ijLD9rZpaa	She must be really really sad, stressed, and angry, so be nice to her. Help her out with things. Maybe she thinks you don't care about the divorce, and you don't want to be with her or anything. Be supportive of her, and love her, say your sorry, you didn't mean to hurt her feelings. Just be patient. It won't go away quickly. I couldn't figure this out, where was the laptop supposed to be delivered to?? Your dads, or moms? If it was at your dads, and you mom said you could send it to whichever home, then she has positively NO reason to take it out on you. If it's delivered to your moms, then I don't see what her problem is. Anyways, good luck!|`|xIT3eregaa	Wow your mom is stupid. Well if you already explained to her that you would be at you dad's house when the delivery was made, why is she mad at that. Next time you're at her house take it. Leave her house, go somewhere and ask your dad to pick you up. But try telling her again, and if she doesn't listen (like my mom) just take it. Or pis her off enough until she give up and gives it back.|`|0uD5weHLaa	Woah. I suggest talking to her (very carefully!) about her unresolved issues with your father. you have my sympathies, i know how families can seem like unexplainable beasts.|`|7197926738c6345db095d2af690ca509aa	Rather than wasting your time by putting in so much effort to write here, just go talk to your mom. If you are motivated enough to write that much about your mom, you must be motivated enough to deal with her directly. Tell your mom you love her no matter what and that she will always have your support.|`|8mBfGwuvaa	It doesn't seem like your the problem in this situation. i think your mom is just mad because she feels like you pick your dad over her even though you didn't. My parents are going to get a divorce and the get jealous over my decisions on which parent i spend my time with. I would sugeest ou either tell your dad or sit your mom down and talk to her and explain everythin geven if you did that already try it again.<br>  <br>  Really sory bout yer problem =(<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	awww lol...well, if your parents are't together she probably already has issues with "who's the better parent" and what not...she probably thinks you didnt trust her with it  and is just jealous(im sorry to say it but thats what it could be) <br>  you're not in the wrong...but i think now you should realize that when it comes to situations like this just make sure you're leaning towards her side (making her happy) <br>  <br>  if this is typical behavior of her then you should sit down with her and have a talk about what exactly it was that happened and why she feels its necessary to react that way. start it with "im not asking for my laptop back, i just want to know why you acted that why and why you took it"...then see where it gows and if she'll give it back

I think that most people don't know what love is. If they did there would be less boyfriend/girlfriends in their resume. How can you say to someone that you love them today then tomorrow you love someone else. That's not love! It's possible to say they love you to get what they want out of you.

It was fuggin annoying. It got to the point where she'd say I'm so fat and I'd just answer with yep, you are. After 4 years of hearing "I'm fat", and her doing nothing about it, I got tired of hearing about it and just started agreeing with her. |`|2cnDm4QKaa	yeah, thats probably the most annoying thing ever! I wouldnt even give her the time of day because even though she says she hates how she looks or what not, all the attention is on her and shes always looking at HER image. I hate it. I wouldnt deal with it!
AA11412068	Yeah, I think he likes you. Maybe you should try to do something about it.. Like ask him out, or ask him to go to a movie or something and see if he tries to hold your hand or anything...|`|lPgm30J1aa	I think he definatley likes you!<br>  Or else he doesn't know the definition of flirting|`|aywKL2fmaa	He's definitely into you :)|`|AA10656934	I'd say if he initiates physical contact he's interested but why not just suck it up and ask him.

WHATS THE WORSE COULD HAPPPEN ?????|`|CvnAZAiwaa	If he isn't using instant messaging as much, it means he likes face time with you more.<br>  it's a good thing.
eE79f8ZYaa	The question is are you really interested in her. If not, don't bother. <br>  <br>  I guess there is some sort of attraction there but the fact that she has just been through a break up is probably not the best time. Unless you are just in for some fun, don't date her, she probably still has a lot to sort out in her head. Just because a friend suggests it does not mean that you personally should. <br>  <br>  It could be taken as a hint or a joke. I think what you should do is get to know her a bit better. Although you have known her since you guys were six you don't REALLY know her. I think friendship is a great place to start, then who knows you may end up being more attracted to her or more repulsed, but by that time she would have made up her mind about her relationship status.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|JAf2M10oaa	yes it is a hint! ask her out for coffee or somthing!|`|lpgrbJDbaa	ill have her|`|XgankRhEaa	go for it because what do you have to loose?
JYWZ8ynvaa	try taking her to a special place, like your first date, where you met, etc. then you could put the ring in something special like one of your inside jokes. ( like if you had an inside joke about when you went to the mall and bought a hat or something, put the ring inside the hat. get what im saying?) or you could have a special night at home and lead a path through the house with rose petals (real or fake) to somewhere like say....the bathroom, where the bathtub would be filled with bubbles, and you could leave a note in there saying "search through the bubbles". just set the ring on a floaty thing or something, and then when she finds it walk in and do your whole speech thing. congrats, and hope i helped!|`|9zKC07KQaa	OOh this is going to be so fun. I think you should take her out to eat to a buffet and instead of them singing a birthday song, they should sing a song about love as you get on your knees to propose, and if she says yes the only proper thing to do next is to ask her parents or whoever is the closest to her that would be giving her away.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	The budget shouldn't matter.  It doesn't have to be something extravagant, like others have said.  Go somewhere that's special to you both, and try to make it a surprise, meaning, don't make it obvious by where you're going or what you're doing that you're going to propose.  Surprise proposals are the best.|`|73GkepzFaa	Best way to propose is however you want to propose. It shouldn't be anyone else's idea. Even if you can't spend much whatever comes from your heart and head she'll love more than anyone else's idea.|`|BObu4i9saa	on our way home from a family party my fiance passed our exit - instead we ended up at a beautiful little park overlooking the hudson river where he popped the question - it was perfect and didn't cost a dime|`|W7uP1ty4aa	Write a rap song about it.

lJhl3wLAaa	Dont bother him. If he cared about you at all he would have called to let you know he was in a crash. He doesn't care. You shouldn't bother. You had no interest in him the day before the crash. Your feelings shouldn't change. If you want you can send him a card that says "glad you are okay." and leave it at that. No need to pick up talking and texting etc.|`|B359bLqsaa	I think you should leave it alone.

I would regret not having done for the rest of my life.

If you expect to be treated with the same respect as men because of the importance of the mind, and expect your status to reflect your personality rather than how well you hold up in a physical struggle, or the body you we're born with, then you aught form your expectations with the same consideration.<br>  <br>  If women weren't exempt from that sort of physical expectation, and respect was given to the biggest, the fastest, most physically dominant of us, women would be making dinner and dropping babies for eternity.

It is their spirit that i love. I love how they treat me and make me feel. It doesn't matter if your taller then him. And your both still kids. This is your chance to get to know people. That is what dating is for. So that you can see what you like and don't like in a guy. If this does not work out. Then you can take something from it to your next relationship. Best of luck. And remember its not all about the looks. Its about the person them self.|`|Wm5QUtZiaa	There is no reason to feel awkward.  Who said that the male has to taller than the female?

It's been 3 years actually.  I used to say I'd never date a shorter guy and I admit it was a little weird at the beginning because I wasn't used to it but once we got used to it we realized how insignificant a thing like that really is.  <br>  <br>  Still if it is just too much LET HIM GO.  Don't stay with him if you aren't willing to see him for who he is...not for just his height.|`|8AGaHxQiaa	Would your height differences really matter? i think, no. its the love and affection for each other that matters in the relationship.

mZv92E7Caa	you're not alone. i see variations of this SAME question all the time on ya. your husband is probably very comfortable, hence the laziness, but i know it still sucks. you can only take matters into your own hands so many times, and then YOU need to be pursued and feel wanted and irresistably sexy, right? <br>  <br>  i recommend getting the book - "101 nights of grrreat sex", it's awesome! i bought this book as a surprise for my husband, and he was actually the one to get the mail that day which made it an even better surprise. it's fun and easy and will add excitement and great sex to your marriage if you stick to it- i promise! <br>  good luck! ;)<br>  <br>  check out the description at this link and read some reviews...<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/101-Nights-Grrreat-Sex-Seductions/dp/0962962813" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/101-Nights-Grrreat...</a>|`|CODFZ2kLaa	Divorce him, take all his money, the 2 year old and his house.  C'mon you know the drill.|`|9226O7qSaa	Now this is going to sound a little crazy and there are a lot of men out there who will deny it but....All men, even married men, masturbate. If you stop this habit the romance will return. He will WANT to rub your shoulders and back. He will want to court you. You then are the only outlet left after you have removed his solo activities. Confront him, and give him consequences for doing it. At our house, I brought back the good old fashioned spanking. He thought it was going to be fun fore-play but he ended up crying his eyes out. We have and understanding. I don't have to catch his. I can tell by the way he acts. He gets spanked accordingly. The romance is back in our lives.|`|mCzLFbOiaa	You don't have to resort to divorce or porn. Come on, guys, this is a woman who actually CARES about her marriage... be serious.<br>  <br>  You have the foundation for a great recovery here. You acknowledge that your husband is a GREAT guy. You say the sex is good, but the passion is lacking. This can be fixed with effort! It doesn't have to end here.<br>  <br>  Ask your husband to go to a couples' seminar or to some counseling together. Make sure the help that is being offered is regarding romance and sexuality. Read books on the subject together. There are many options open to finding a solution for this issue.<br>  <br>  Who doesn't want a better love life? (And I'm not just referring to sex, but to the actual "love" aspect of it.) Sweetly approach this subject with your husband. Don't point a finger or act accusatory, or call it "his" problem... this is a couple problem. You guys have to do this together and face it with a unified front.<br>  <br>  Tell him how much you love him, what an awesome guy he is, and how lucky you are to have him. Tell him you want that spark back and you want things to be better than ever. Say exactly what you said here-- "I can't stay in this monotonous life forever and not do something stupid out of pure desperation forever. This scares me."<br>  <br>  A book you might try is "The Act of Marriage" by Tim & Beverly LaHaye. I can't believe a guy could read that stuff and NOT want to try it out. It's a basic "user's manual" for people who are getting married, already married, etc. I found it very helpful in getting to the bottom of what sex is (physically, emotionally, spiritually, etc.) from the male and the female perspective.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Hey, on a lighter side... you have a problem that should be fun fixing. (*Wink!*)|`|4POGapREaa	I don't really get it.  You say all these wonderful things about him AND the sex is great?  I'm confused as to what it is that you want.  Of course relationships get a little comfortable.  I like that.  I don't want someone up my butt all day.  I don't know.  I think you're expecting too much after years of being together.  You want him to be kissing your neck all the time & rubbing your shoulders.  It sounds a little needy.  What really bothers me is that you say you might do something stupid.  I'm assuming that means cheating?  That's ridiculous.  With all of the positives in your relationship, I can't believe that's where you're letting your mind take you.  |`|AA11603829	Focus on what you have rather than what you don't.

He'll do anything you ask of him then. If he's watching TV, climb in his lap and make it stand at attention; then ask for a shoulder rub or whatever before you finish. Best idea I can think of. It sounds like you have a pretty good relationship so I think even suggesting something like counseling may lead to a fallout.

He ended upcheating on me because I refused sex after a while. There was nothing there..once we got married the sensuality as gone. No more flowes or spontaneous gifts - just work and TV. It got so boring and when I used to try and talk to him about it he would get frustrated and mad at me - so I stopped. I stopped it all. I went out with my friends and made myself happy. I never cheated - although tempted - I never did. Eventually he cheated on me and left me but all in all it was for the best - FOR US. I am not saying that for you but that is what happened to me. We did not have any children together and I am thankful for that. We parted on bad terms but we were able to come together as friends years later. We are both hapy in different relationships and I am so glad. If you feel this badly and talking to him doesn't seem to do the trick...make him see. |`|tSQWchlIaa	My wife and I went through something like this..maybe not so desperate as your case...We decided to have a planned  "date" once a month. Sometimes we go to a romantic dinner; the movies; an overnight get away. You can always start by initiating something yourself. AND I agree that the TV is the worst thing in the world for anyone's relationship...along with the computer and video games.

byBY2vpGaa	Sarah with all due respect.  I am sure you are a pretty woman, but asking for someone over 60 seems like you are asking fora sugar daddy.  You have asked this question before and received some good replies.  Don't limit yourself, you need to get out there and enjoy life and remove your boundaries.   You are directing your energy inward, you need to come out of your shell.  Get back, lets talk and help you find the right man.|`|7pFVHdssaa	Ummm....not sure why you want a 60 yo guy?  I am just a few years older than you...call me, let chat and have fun if interested.|`|SgrjTkwdaa	I hear you, Sarah, and I agree.<br>  <br>  They must have all gone either to Heaven or Hell....don't seem to be any good ones around. |`|VrlfYZwCaa	Candidly, why would you ask this question on here? It's like going to a mall on a Tuesday morning and asking where all the married men are... Ok, not a perfect analogy but really what do you expect to find? First, the number of over 60 men online is a fairly low percentage; second, the percentage that are on here regularlyare married; and third, if you were actually serious about finding one you would publish all of your details.<br>  <br>  I think you are either a) a loon b) have wayyyyyy too much time on your hands and can't think of more original things to do with your time or c) studying the answers provided and either using them in some sort of post-secondary education course or just seeing how many people waste their own time answering... in which case, I refer you to b) above.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about looking for male fun, then baby, don't limit yourself cause that tiny pic is kinda hot!|`|K9kN68fwaa	Their out there. They are just harder to find. It seems like the ratio for single women is much larger than single men at that age. So all of them go quick. Have you thought of joining a club, like the Civitain Club. They have a lot of eligible men that age there and they are a wonderful organization. Its hard to find men that age easily, because most of them aren't computer savvy. Have you tried joining a church? Alot of men at that age spend most of there time at church. |`|v8pl2RLUaa	I have a guy for you in my answers.

X4i2jej5aa	I have a feeling of what you are going through. My good friend, who was dumped by his girlfriend was so sad afterwards that he called me almost everyday for my support. Letting go of someone you really loved it hard, I know that from him, but we girls have to stick together! You can't let one guy ruin you. It will take a while before you are all healed, that is for sure, but for the time being, I think you should concentrate on your friends, family, work or school. They are a great release to what you are going through right now. Be happy that you are single, now you can be on the market again and flirt and talk with as many guys as you want without having that guilty feeling that you are cheating on your boyfriend. Don't feel unattractive and a failure, cause you know you are not. Get out with a few of your girlfriends and make yourself over, make your ex so sad that he dumped you for another. I know you will find someone better, that's for sure. <br>  Good-Luck!|`|LEAx00NEaa	you'll find the right one for you.<br>  eveyone is destined 2 b wit s.o.s.<br>  someone better than him   :):):)|`|xwe3txo8aa	Just remember this:<br>  <br>  Everything happens for a reason, even if it doesn't seem that way at first.

XqS5DxR9aa	My lady and I met the first day of high school.  We were married the day after our high school graduation.  That was 35 years ago, and it feels like yesterday.  The only difference from then to now is that I'm infiitely more in love with her than I was then, and I was crazy about her then.  Life is good.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	My first wife and I meant in church.  I was 16 and she was 20.  we meant through mutual friends.  As our relationship developed we discovered that we knew many of the same people.  We divorced after 16 years, 10 of which were good years.<br>  <br>  My second wife and I meant via yahoo chat rooms back into 1998.  It took 8 months of emails, phone calls, letters, pictures and various other things before we could actually physically meet.  I was stationed in Corpus Christi Tx (active duty navy) and she was living in Iowa.  I retired september 1998 moved to iowa to be with her.  We were married the following june and have been happily ever after together since then.|`|DWgyWFNyaa	we meet on the party line i was scared to met him because he was 29yrs old and i was 17yrs old  so after a month of my phone being disconnected he called again wanting 2 meet me so i did and we have been together ever since going on 5yrs|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	We met in the park. It began to rain and I had an umbrella. We went for a walk.<br>  Been together ever since|`|jZ1ES9DDaa	We met on the job!  I was in accounting, he was in sales.  Frequently, people from the office all met for Happy Hour.  We didn't actually like each other too much when we worked together, but one night of Happy Hour changed all that and we realized how much we had in common.  Eight months later, we got married!!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I met my husband when him and his family moved across the street from me and my family...He was 25 and i was 21 at the time and we started dating march 1990 and got married 10 months later on january 19,1991 when he was 26 and i was 22.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	My wife and I met on the city bus we both took to college.  That was 1983 or 1984 that we first met, and we gradually got to know each other through the various bus rides.  We had both attended the same high school but never really knew each other, but we had that first thing in common - and things grew slowly, very slowly, from there.  I finally got the courage to ask her out, and things (finally) took off quickly.   We married in 1988.  I'm not sure much has changed today from back then...people find love in many odd places.
EZKe92TTaa	First of all, no point in feeling badly about what happened. You didn't sleep with him knowing that he was a relative. But you have a problem. If he were a 2nd or 3rd cousin, that would be ok. First cousin, that is a problem. It's not considered incest, but if it were to get serious and lead to a possiblity of marriage and kids, you'd be in trouble. Many genetic complications having kids with first cousins. That's why it's frowned upon and not socially acceptable (though I know in many areas of the world people do this). I don't think your family would deal with this very well either. Better to nip it in the bud. I'm sorry you have developed feelings for him but better to end it now.|`|823Z8NH3aa	Never talk to him? What do you mean?!? If he's so nice and gentle and kind, why on earth not? If you started a serious relationship, that wouldn't be the smartest thing. But can people not just be friends these days? Do you always need it to be a b/f?|`|fpGqmFKvaa	whoa, i would be in such a shock, My family isn't big and i have a family tree so it would be quite hard for me to do what you did.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	Ewww, I bet you shag him again though|`|58AG1wo4aa	hun, loads of people have dated their cousin!! it doesn't really make much difference.. my friend is dating her cousin! your love grew for each other before you found out. just think, if you didn't know that you were related then you would have carried on dating wouldn't you?! so just speak to him and say "i know its awkward but i like you so much and dont wanna lose our bond.. fancy still being together? i understand if not though.." then look in eyes with a coy smile. :)<br>  <br>  seriously, wouldn't let it bother you. loads of people have kissed/dated/snogged their cousins. don't worry! xx|`|LFoycKg1aa	sorry i have done that 2|`|htWw0OlCaa	OH SNAP!!! That's some sh**.... I feel so bad for you. I really do. Just when you think you found someone that you can really like, he turns out to be your cousin..... It's not like you two knew...But I can imagine the surprise you two got. I don't see the harm in being friends, just take out the benefits part, and you are good to go. You are family, don't stop talking to him because of what happened. Best wishes
sMWXKTptaa	dude thats just wrong.....  Stay away from her.   don't let her that close to you..ever or before you know it she'll be accusing you of abusing her....<br>  <br>  Tell your parents what a little freak she is... so they can keep thier eyes on her...<br>  <br>  |`|NtBG7nrmaa	How old is she?  Does she have a mental deficiency?  Also behavior like this is common in kids that have been sexually abused.  If anything like this happens again I would let your parents know.  You do not have to give them all the details, just tell them that she acts inappropriately and is way to interested in sex.|`|S1WlmA3iaa	It depends on how old she is. At some age girls just want attention from others, and if she has no one else, she will want your attention. ))<br>  It does not have to mean she is in love with you.|`|vTcCsV3Gaa	Thats weird but i think she was just really horny and you were just the only guy around that could help her get relief and plus she knows you.if i were you i wouldn't mention it im sure eventually lt'll pass.|`|QGfyUyspaa	Smack her up side the head, and tell your parents why you did it.<br>  The girl has problems.|`|Hvuqv6duaa	What the hell ?

Ask her what the hell shes playing at? Shell have to give you some kind of answer.|`|EWGHnH4Daa	Ummm, her hormones are obviously raging. She can't control herself.

TLim2pBTaa	It's not too early to have a crush on him and it sounds like he might be interested in you. As far as age goes I don't think that he's that much older than you and if your parents think it's okay then it shouldn't be a problem.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	As you grow older, age becomes less of a problem, (lol) but right now, I would suggest doing your best to become a good friend of his. I'm currently dating one of my closest friends, and I think it's easier like that because you grow to trust them before you go out with them. It might be a lil too early to seriously go out with him, but you probably do have a crush, which isn't bad actually it's probably a good thing. ^^ Hope that helps!|`|H6GIYDdzaa	You felt a need to add 3/4 on to your age?<br>  <br>  You're too young.|`|2wsv8vz4aa	LOL! DUDE. you just said 13 and 3/4. you're OBVIOUSLY too young, especially if you feel the need to add quarters to your age. YOUR NOT EVEN IN HIGHSCHOOL.
jGC3Polzaa	No sense in fakin' it when you should be telling him he needs to be doing some thing differently.  If you like the guy enough to be sleepin' with him you should like him enough not to lie to him.  And if he ain't willing to learn get rid of him.|`|e7vqNez1aa	Yes, it's bad.  The poor bastid will go around thinking that he pleases women and he just sucks.  THAT is not very nice of you to do to the next chick he bangs.  Don't fake it...if he asks, just say you didn't achieve orgasm.  Maybe he'll use some other part of his body.|`|2Zpf6EUwaa	Yes because he'll think what he's doing is fine and he'll never get better. Constructive criticism is the key|`|wOTecO5faa	it's bad for you...y would you want to do that?  teach him to please you!!!|`|72lwAGN8aa	Sex is very important in a relationship. If this is going to be a long relationship, it is not fair to either of you if you fake it.<br>  <br>  Either you need to show him how you like it, or you need to find someone who will get your motor running.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	Oh god sometimes you just wanto get it overwith and the poor guy is so determined to get you off but you are not feelin it so you fake it.. problem solved.. but this shouldn't be a common accurrance for your sake!|`|QngwCRIgaa	Well, one answer would be find another person to have sex with that meets your sexual needs.  <br>  <br>  It will be a cold day below before I'm with someone that doesn't know how to make me scream!|`|d6mJVf8Eaa	Why was he bad??<br>  <br>  Specifically what did he not do right?|`|acxDJIQtaa	lol, yes it is bad|`|kCzM4RBdaa	yes tell him the truth...what if he finds out that he stinks at having sex wit you.. then what happens...break up|`|m6jE5KVUaa	Yes it is, becasue eventually the truth will come out and then make things worse...So instead take charge and show him what you like and how you like it! talk about it and work through it.  You will find that things will get better and then not only will you have a great guy you will be having great sex also!!! |`|JLjCqKZCaa	If you fake it, he'll keep doing it poorly, thinking he made you have an orgasm.<br>  <br>  Show and tell him what feels right. Faking just encourages more bad performances.

uEDITvL5aa	My best friend moved away and i tried to forget him. Months later i kept having something eating away at me then i started talking to him again and i brightened up and was as happy as the times he was back with me. I would say don't forget keep in touch, but if you cant do that just remember all the good times together. Forgetting is definitely the worst thing to do.|`|0ClA7HlEaa	You don't have to forget this person. Always keep in mind that "this person" will always be there but always treasure you're good memories with this person. I know it must be hard.....but don't forget him/her.|`|Oy1BTxbJaa	There's no miracle cure to make you forget someone. Especially as it sounds like you have strong feelings for this person.<br>  Keep in touch with him, and maybe see if things develop. Don't give up on the friendship, as I'm sure you'd regret it in the long run.
AA12167923	A hug should be spontaneous; so if circumstances call for it, don't think about it, just do it - and it doesn't matter if you want to hug a good guy friend or a good girl friend to show that you care that you are such good friends.  It's a nice feeling to hug and be hugged, so just do it!  I hug my friends all of the time; I come from a very affectionate family and we are all a bunch of huggers.  Also, it has been my experience that people do like that special contact that tells them you care and that they are important to you.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have also had some friends that initially were not used to being hugged - both female and male - and they felt uncomfortable when I hugged them because they didn't have that kind of contact in their own family.  Now, they will hug as easily as I do and often initiate it themselves.  It really is a nice way of showing someone that you care and it makes both parties feel that important connection of friendship and love.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	when he leaves, when she wants to, when he has no gf, when he is sad|`|nVkMSRY5aa	i hug my best guy friend/one of my xbfs all the time...when i say hi when we r talking and he likes grabs me 2 hug me and when we say by...when u want to hug a guy u should i mean its just a hug nuthing bad can come out of it...if you want to then u should and if something goes wrong just was it was JUST A HUG<br>  good luck|`|azFe1eHDaa	Many ways, Birthdays, something good that happened to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  now please answer mine =]  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306201225AApbXxQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|DhcQC9DBaa	whenever she wants to. my girl friends do all the time one ran full bore down the hall and jumped me. knocking me down.|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	When does a girl stop over-thinking things?<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh wait- never|`|FkXt4XLvaa	Depends on the situation really. Guys are weird with physical affection. I only know a select few who are the first to offer a hug and of those only a small amount actual give real hugs.<br>  <br>  If he does something really sweet and you want to say "Hey thanks" and give him a quick hug or you've been hanging out with a bunch of friends and are all saying bye and you've been hugging everyone else, I can't see how that would be taken inappropriately. In fact, if you leave him out, he may think something's up.<br>  <br>  I honestly can't give you a time frame. It's really all about situations and your own feelings. If you feel it's OK and people know you as a hugger, go for it. If he seems like he isn't open to it and you're really questioning it, step back a bit and wait a while. The worst that can happen is he'll be a little shaken up that you hugged him when he wasn't expecting it.<br>  <br>  It's sad but there are a lot of people who don't hug or are unwilling to accept them.<br>  <br>  I'd say go for it but don't be too forceful about constantly giving him hugs if he seems weird afterwards.|`|vxLSecrwaa	I dont see different ways to hug someone.<br>  <br>  Hug them like you hug them.

ssIaqCDvaa	Alright, let me take a swing at trying to understand and give you the best advice. <br>  #1 Situation: You're trying to become your step-mom's boyfriend? Are you trying to get romantic with your dad's girlfriend?<br>  #2 Situation: You and your step-mom just don't get along, and you want a way to ease the tension.<br>  <br>  Advice 1: No offense, Sick, but you're on the borderline of incest. You want to take away your father's girlfriend? There is something deeply disturbing about you. You will cause harm for all involved. You may be emotionally hurt, your father will be inevitably angry, disgusted, or disturbed. Your step-mom will probably be repulsed that her stepson has sexual feelings for his mother, or may leave your dad for you. Whichever way, it is best to avoid all together and just keep the peace.<br>  Advice 2: Generally, people are kinder when they feel they know someone better, or care and respect the other person. Get to know her, spend some time with her, and respect her. Try and bond, to build a strong family relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is too much room for error, and that seems vey disturbing.|`|b1b2189c8ba661d29c84f87088fa4ee8aa	Why don't you go out and get your own girl friend and leave your dads girl friend a lone that would be the best thing to do and every body would be happy|`|H6GIYDdzaa	Nice trolling man.<br>  <br>  I'm sure some poor saps will fall for it.|`|aqQHhYQvaa	Awkward
DoSWD0Zqaa	Be like "So what are you doing ___(tonight, sat...)" When she says nothing be like "You wanna go grab a burger or wanna go see a movie or go mini-golfing"...depends on what u want to do. Take a good dose of confidence before u ask her but if ur all nervous the girl will love it even more! So either way you're set!|`|a355ad3b24d1c817cba77948c3de812caa	I'm going to tell you how I would like to be asked out. I would want the guy for the previous two weeks to pay special attention to me, not stalker attention but the kind where you really like the person, you just talk to them about any thing, trying to make her laugh, etc. Once you get comfortable around her, you should tell her that you want to talk to her sometime after school or better yet ask her if she could hang out with you some place private or secluded. Then when she arrives just walk around with her, and strike up some conversation. Then have it come to the point where you say "look I really like you. Do you think that there ever be "us"?"<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out, and listen. Girls right now hate waiting, and it's true that they change their mind pretty quickly. My advice to you is don't wait for a long time. I know that you may be nervous, but trust me, it's worth it. Many times if you are a great guy, and you are just there for the person and add some flirting in the mixture, the girl would consider you. Just me spontanous, and maybe things would just work out! ;))|`|BOuPi3wDaa	Your best bet is to just be straightforward but keep it casual.  Don't try to play it too cool, that's usually a turnoff.  Girls think it's cute when guys are a little nervous, so don't worry if you start blushing.  Just do whatever feels normal.  Hope she says yes!|`|JHhpoByyaa	Just compliment her,and be really sweet.

73GkepzFaa	Naive to think that the arguing will stop after a paper is signed. No matter how old if its problematic to begin with it wont fix itself later. Married couples bicker more than couples. If you're already bickering at eachother before, it would just be a lot of wasted money in the future. Tell them that if they're thinking that they need to wait a good while before even thinking about marrying anyone, when they understand what marriage is.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	In order to be married at 16 they must have parental consent. So unless there parents are crazy and will allow such foolishness then I wouldn't worry too much. If they think that they are going to be together until they are 18 to be married, chances are they will be broken up long before then. The chances of this working out is slim to none so just let them think they know what they are doing. It will all play out to the way you and the rest of us believe it will.|`|wIqm4Wc5aa	this is very tricky... and theres not much you can do about it.

Just be the shoulder to cry on when it is all over. The more people subject to it, the closer you are putting them together. Take it from me, it may not end pretty but its better to let them go through it on their own.Just be a good friend when it is all over.|`|gg3QGBspaa	let them do their own thing, if they ask, let them know how you really feel about the situation, if not, I would let them figure it out for themselves, which they will|`|4AavBJy8aa	you really cant say anything =) its there choice and you  shouldn't get involved, arguein dosent mean there are not in love.<br>  You cant stop them from getting hurt just be there  for them if they do get hurt|`|PMrTleDJaa	Yeah.. they probably didn't finish high school.

Your correct its not right for them to be engaged at such a young age, but they can't get married for another two years, I am sure they will be broken up with in a few months so I wouldn't worry about it.|`|rywgn8HLaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much - and I wouldn't say anything to my friends either. They might end up getting mad at your for saying something. <br>  If it actually gets to the point where they want to marry then they will need to get their parents permission or wait until they are 18. If they are arguing constantly right now then I doubt they will be able to stand the stress that planning a wedding brings...<br>  If they do get engaged you can express your concerns, but ultimately you have no control over what they are going to do. If they think that marriage is going to stop them from arguing then they have a big surprise waiting for them...|`|82A8E4yzaa	I know someone who is only 15 coming 16 in June and he is near 17..with a baby on the way and are getting married in the Summer...<br>  <br>  Its plain stupid...<br>  <br>  You can't really say anything...but you could talk to your friend..try to make her see sense..try this ''you've always wanted a dream wedding ...but you wouldn't have the money now..so wait alittle longer and you will''.....just so she thinks if she saves up then she can get married....by that time..they will have broken up..<br>  <br>  thats what i would do..or just talk to them<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Good heavens, what do their parents think ?<br>  If it were me I would stand back and let them get on with it, you wont be thanked for interfering and it could sever your relationship with your friend.<br>  Just be there when it all goes wrong.|`|BObu4i9saa	well their parents would have to agree to it so that will probably slow things down a bit<br>  honestly i really wouldn't worry about it at this point - it'll probably all fizzle out in time

That was rude, and you seem genuinely concerned. <br>  <br>  Your question is not at all stupid, so don't let them make you feel like that. Firstly, this is your FRIEND. You should be able to talk to her. Think about how you would feel. If a guy did that to you, wouldn'y you want to know?<br>  <br>  DONT DONT DONT make it some huge big ordeal. Just sit down with her and calmly say, look I think there's something you need to know. Tell her that you know she had sex and that honestly, that is not your business, but you are concerned about something he said afterwards that you think was rude and may show he's using her. Then, tell her about the myspace thing. <br>  <br>  If she's truly your friend, she'll talk to you about it, and you as a friend you can give her your opinion on her having sex, but in the end, it's her business and her life. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't make a big drama issue out of it. Things get crazy when that happens. Don't jump into accusing him of being a manwhore, and blah blah. At that age, she could get defensive, and you could lose your friend. Just calmly tell her you know, and that though you don't agree it's completely her business and her decision and that what you wanted to talk to her about is something he put on myspace.<br>  <br>  Hope I could be of some help|`|z4omuGPNaa	whoa, whoa, whoa... uhh how old is her boyfriend?

It's called saying no.|`|AA11368324	In Proverbs 27:6, wise King Solomon says, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful!" Your friend needs to know this, so this guy doesn't think he can just go get laid and brag about it to his buddies at her expense anytime he feels like it.  She may get defensive, resent you, and even tell you she hates and wants nothing to do with you at first, but, if she is a true friend, she will eventually come around and see that you loved and cared enough for her to tell her the truth, no matter how much it hurt, because you didn't want to see her get burned and/or pregnant.|`|Kj02Sqseaa	Yes you should show her the myspace thing.  You should also express concern to her, saying that you disagree with what she has done.  Don't hate her for what she's done, just kinda show that you aren't content with the choice she made.<br>  <br>  For example you can say something to the effect of:<br>  "Listen alexis, I heard you had sex with abe and I just wanted to let you know that I'm worried your setting your self up for disappointment.  I know this probably won't make a difference, but I think abe used you just to have sex due to his myspace changes, and also cuz you've only known him for 3 weeks.  In my opinion it sounds like it was rushed and I'm just a little confused on what to think.  Now before you say I shouldn't think anything about it, I just want to let you know that your my best friend and I'm just voicing my concern to you so that you don't get hurt.  I still want to be friends with you and I'm not here to scold you or make decisions for you, but I just wanted you to know that I'm worried for your wellbeing in general and in this relationship."<br>  <br>  Whether you use this or not, or decide to take my advice, I wish the best of luck to you.  I hope you decide to at least confront your friend because action is better then inaction and you may soon find that if you don't do anything your friend will go under the illusion that this Abe loves her, and then one day when he gets bored of her, he will let her go and tear her heart apart.  I personally believe it is your responsibility as a friend (as well as all your friends), to speak to alexis, for although she may get mad at you guys and think you just hate abe, there will come a time when she will realize that you were only looking to protect her.<br>  <br>  Again good luck, and I hope all goes well.|`|9KC2ccrNaa	That really bad and im a guys saying that i would tell ur friend and hope she brakes it off!!|`|aUXBEI2paa	YOU SHOULD TELL HER PRIVATELY!!

Xc8dd6t4aa	Don't stick your unprotected penis into anyone or anything that can make a baby or spread a disease.  Plan B was intended for people who are being careful (such as using a condom) but the unexpected happens (like the condom breaks), not as birth control for unprotected sex (or penis insertion, as you call it...).<br>  <br>  To ease your mind, women rarely get pregnant if a guy sticks his penis in her for two seconds and then removes it.|`|EdidZdtlaa	go do something fun. hang out with your guy buddies. do a hobby that you know will take your mind off of her.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	use a condom next time.......|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Well, first of all, next time you might wana use a condom, but I know what you mean by worried til everything is totally ok im like that too.

He or she could be near, or some place else.|`|Ub7MyiVeaa	yup|`|XPShnPIlaa	i dnt get wut ur asking?  but in the general is there love for everybody? yea, i do believe so, because it always helps me to look at the people i dislike or think are ugly and say to myself, wow, they have a husband and kids, so it should be realistic for me to expect it|`|c3zWdXUjaa	Well, of couse there is. Don't worry, it will come. Just not yet. If you think you're totally hopeless, then you're not, because most likely, you will find somebody either as you get older, or when you just go different places.|`|8WmMVyGOaa	Yeah of course!! :) <br>  <br>  Love is everywhere.<br>  Just be positive..<br>  People love you, you just don't know it yet. But you will.|`|s7G6aC9Caa	Yeah, there is.

FB1FBeyMaa	According to your earlier questions you two were never really an item were you?  Just friends, and he told you all along he didn't want to be in a relationship as he was still getting over being dumped.  He also told you that you were coming on too strong, overpowering you said.<br>  <br>  So no, you can't get him back as he was never yours to begin with.  Others may say he was playing you, but I just don't see it.  I see him being completely honest and open with you, telling you exactly how he was feeling, which was not the same way you were feeling for him.<br>  <br>  I know how it feels to have feelings for someone that are not reciprocated, but since you can't make someone love you he's actually done you a favor.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	If he said he doesn't have feelings for you, believe him. It's the cruelest thing he could have said, isn't it? He has been looking to date others, so that tells you everything you need to know. He's a cad, and you deserve better!|`|AA12272885	I'm sorry this happened to you. But that is the way some guys work it.  In the beginning they are considerate, charming and make every effort to convince you they are serious about a relationship.  Then something makes them put on the brakes.  Who knows what it is- they felt too vulnerable, you had some quirks that started to bother them, they just got cold feet about settling down- there are a million reasons.  You fell for him, and he knew it, so now he can chase other women and keep you around in the friends zone in case he ever decides to give it another try ...like on a Saturday night when his current squeeze is visiting her mother.   <br>  You don't want someone who doesn't want you whole heartedly.  Believe me you don't.  So hitch up your britches and be a big girl and move on to a guy who deserves you.  Who knows a little show of independence might actually shock the old boy into  submission. |`|GQUaFGHLaa	You need to let the man go. If he doesn't want anything to do with you then it is time to go on and find someone else. If it has been 2 months and he hasn't had contact with you then it is time to get over the man.    |`|KUCbqaeGaa	sorry you met this creep. but all im getting out of this is. it doesn't matter how old men get they will continue to be jerks. let it go hun.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	no.  you are 49.  shouldn't you know this by now?|`|135f8e1b537022556ef4671dd836a765aa	Wow, he's 50 years old and still a "player".  I guess some men never grow out of it.  Him telling you he wants to be friends is so he doesn't feel guilty for what he's done. He wants to end things on good "terms" so there isn't someone out there who could say he did them wrong.  It is clear that you'll need to stop calling him, and I certainly would not maintain a friendship with him.  It will be too  hard for you to watch him date other women, and then when a relationship ends with one of them and he needs someone to fill the gap, well...it allows him to come running to you until the next woman comes along. Anyway, take care of yourself and try to forget about him. I'm sorry you're having to go through this with a 50 year old man who should know better.|`|oQq1rqDVaa	I really think he has moved on and that you need to just accept this.  Unfortunately it is a lot easier for a 50 year old man to get women than it is for a 49 year old woman and I am almost that age.  You should move on to as I am sure there is someone worthwhile out there for you.|`|NkPvExnHaa	Sorry but your in the dreaded "friendzone", every guy who's ever heard that from a girl is feeling you right about now, including me! Women hear it occasionally too; obviously! Avoid the "friendzone" at all costs!!|`|lXNRlYFKaa	he sounds married|`|bc06bfa5e6e290d86d60dd98ef424b1faa	You're 49 & by this time, you should know the difference between a real love & not. Look at it this way. Can you imagine living with someone for the rest of your life saying things today, then after several months saying another thing? I guess not! Are you not thankful that as early as now you already have discovered the real him & not waste your time for a year or longer? Thank him for being his true self. If that's what he feels so be it. That's not your problem anymore. That's his loss not yours. Impressions are just that impressions. Now you know you've got the wrong impressions, so have a life without him. You know how. You've been in this world without him for 49 years, right? You were just with him for 5 months only. There are better men out there who would find you more perfect than his idea of a perfect woman. Obviously he does not know that perfection is nowhere to be found on earth. No one is perfect, you know that. Move on. :-)<br>  <br>  And the answer to your question? NO - AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO! 
oHO0XOQVaa	Tell her you're depressed and make sure she notices that you're crying a lot. Study and clean the house in your spare time (when you're not crying) and maybe she'll realize the responsible improvements you've made and your need for a social life. You can try getting out of the house WITH HER. If the two of you hang out maybe she'll start trusting you more/realize you're not doing anything crazy when you hang out with your friends.|`|niYixDU4aa	tell her that it's depressing you....<br>  i think most parents would be concerned....

In other words, is there a lot of stress? other issues? If there is, that could be the reason there is a lack of whatever it is.<br>  <br>  No matter what the situation is, take the time to sit down with your spouse and discuss what's going on and how you feel about it, before it gets out of hand and you end up fighting and saying things you just didn't mean to say.<br>  <br>  If you need to, sleep on it. A lot say not to, but if you take the time to think your concerns out and have time to talk it out with yourself, the more likely you are to get the point across without anger. Which is always good. You don't need to fight, especially if it was stress in the first place that caused this.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|RlA0vqWLaa	Not enough info. Start back with the basics. What did ya do to make her your wife? There was some attractions then. Send her flowers, compliment her, cook supper for her! Do things that you USED to do.

It happens sometimes for women, because sex begins in our minds and when our minds are all cluttered, well, sex isn't at the forefront for us like it is for men.  It's biological wiring.<br>  <br>  I have to be taken away when it gets like that for me.  (that sounded bad lol).  I mean taken to a dreamier place--romance, weekend getaway, soft music, hand-holding, sweet talk...<br>  <br>  I haven't had a man I was with not want to play when I wanted to, so I really cannot answer this question exactly how you asked it.

What would you want him -or expect him- to do to win your trust back if he had been the one to break your trust? It's obvious you had a stronger reason/wish to call this guy than your wish to preserve your marriage. You need to prove to him that you love him and that he can trust you again and it's not going to be easy.

3E9plH9Iaa	Well,,first of all,,your sensible enough to realize that what you both are doing is not constructive,,but destructive.. Its a tight line you must walk with your younger brother to keep his respect for you,,and you giving him direction that an older brother can do..Sometimes it can be very difficult..However,,YOU can because you ARE the older one,,react from a more mature prospective..Believe it or not,,he looks up to you and is watching everything you do..Its teenage years when you both are in full bloom,,and strong,,that the ''testing'' occurs..And thats what it is..Whenever your brother confronts you or you have an arguement,,try and reason with him from a equal point,,rather than an overseer or "older and bigger" sense..I don't know what your age difference is,,but believe this,,in a few years,,you guys are going to be great buddies and friends,,along with being brothers..Its just now,,thats hard because both of you are "bumping heads"!! And I don't think your over abusive.. It just seems that way..Next time you want to "beat him senseless",,(not really) think about the future days to come,,and cut him a little slack..After all,,he's not as old as you,,and doesn't realize what the best ways to handle confrontational situations..You your self are growing into the person you and he will respect and love as you both reach adulthood..You both are going to be fine..

I think this kind of fighting happens a lot, and many times we don't regret it until we're grown up and we look back on it.<br>  If you feel comfortable doing it, you could apologize. Or you could tell him that you want peace in the family and no fighting from now on. If he starts something, just walk away, or ignore him and don't respond. You can actually teach him a lot about getting along with others and standing up for what you believe in (peace). You can set a good example for him. The way to fix past mistakes is to apologize (inwardly or outwardly), open your heart to him, and stop doing it. You could also ask for his forgiveness, inwardly or out to his face. It will help you heal if you try not to feel guilty. Instead, change your ways. Childhood and adolescence are magical times. We think our siblings will be close to us forever, but you know, people grow up, get jobs, get married. So, cherish the good times that you have with him now and make the most out of it. Cheers to you for being so responsible.|`|XNP5DSRlaa	It is not unusual for brothers and sisters to have disagreements and even fights. It is always a good idea to admit your wrongs and apologize for starters. It would probably help to learn some anger management skills. This will help you express anger and frustration more effectively for you and safer for those you love. I hope you can learn some alternatives to hitting. Talking to a school counselor may be helpful.

Don't ever think that you should be ashamed of who you are. They are your parents and they will love you no matter what.

Later, at home, we asked her point blank and she said yes, she was.  It really hurt my feelings that she hadn't felt like she could come to me with this and just tell me.  My advice, as a mother of a gay person, is to just sit them down and tell them.  They will either accept you or they won't.  Simple as that.  Doesn't matter how much you sugarcoat it.  I hope, for your sake, that your parents are as loving, accepting, and supportive as we are.  I love her partner as if she were another daughter.

But you don't have to be a boyfriend in Middle School because what's the use? He can't take you anywhere and basically in Middle School when people are dating they are just saying they are together and they don't hang out or anything. Just wait until High School when you can have something special with someone.

As long as your son knows he's out there, that's what matters. I think it's too late to try to build a relationship with your son. It could really damage them both, and I personally think it would be best for your son to meet his real father when he is 18 years old, because he'll be more mature then.<br>  But then there's the fact that this man has a family of his own. Your son is still pretty young, but I think the sooner he knows about all of this, the better. He might get mad at you for not telling him if he finds out some other way.<br>  If your son doesn't know his biological father isn't the man who is raising him, I would tell him a.s.a.p.! It's not good to have secrets with your children.<br>  So pretty much, tell your son everything, and ask what he wants to do. He might not give the best answer, but it's good to know what he thinks is best. You don't have to do exactly what he wants because he doesn't really know what's best for himself yet, but you should at least tell him this.<br>  And don't let all of this put the idea in your son's head that the man who has been raising him is not his father. A father is the man who raises the child and cares for him; he doesn't have to have a blood relationship.

7YX789nraa	The same thing happened to me! I tried to explain that he was going to get hurt again and that if she were good for him, she wouldn't have cheated in the first place. BUT that didn't work at all and it caused drama between  me and my friend. Honestly, and I know this seems like the hard thing to do (because it is), just let it go. If you push him, he will resist. It's human nature. We're meant to be stubborn ;)|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	well, even though, you think he's made this huge mistake, he doesn't see it that way. which, is obviously why he took her back. i'd just let it go, but b4 that i'd talk to him, and aask him why he took her back.|`|Krv4z6VEaa	Don't waste ur breath. He ain't going 2 listen. By him taking her back, that says it all honey! He'll learn frm his mistakes, as do most of us.<br>  <br>  socal.gold@yahoo.com<br>  aka: Cinderella
B359bLqsaa	I totally do not trust him either.  Don't let him trick you anymore.  If he was truly sorry about cheating on  you the last time there is no way he would place his marriage with you in jeopardy again by placing himself into the same situation as the last time.   I think he is either already being unfaithful or will again very soon.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Ithink it depends on what you mean by messing around. If you mean he was cheating on you then you have every right to be paranoid and he should have the decency to behave as you want him to to make it up to you and earn back your trust.<br>  <br>  Also, if they are people he works with then he spends all day with them, WTF does he need to be involved with them on line for as well?<br>  <br>  I can't tell you what to do about it. You can lead a horses @ss to water, but you can't make him think. He needs to get into something else besides the net. He needs a real world hobby.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	ok so  he cheated in October and it nearly cost him his marriage and it only march and he starting this crap again.<br>  He going to cheat again and again, stop letting him walk all over you like a door mat, It was a work mate the last time so his excuse is flat ,he a selfish jerk,  i either do a trial separation or file divorce for his sort rarely change|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Overreacting? I don't think so. Your husband and mine must be buddies because mine is constantly looking for ways to either meet women online or get in touch with old coworkers and ex's to write and share sickening, sexually explicit stuff with them. I'm just preparing myself mentally and emotionally and getting my ..s..h..i..t.. together to leave his ..a..s..s.. You should probably do the same if you're smart. They'll never change. Once a cheater, always a cheater.|`|KmC0K59taa	No, you aren't overreacting.  You have every right to be suspicious of him.   I would be checking his Facebook still too.  He is going to have to work really hard to ever win your trust back.|`|r23H0m30aa	hi hun<br>  Im hearing u...i ve actualy found out that my bf has secretly profile on date side by the way he is constantly accusing me that im flirting with some guys while him..<br>  Anyway I would confront ur husband while he has another account and is that chick same as he messed around before?<br>  Guys are so crafty u knw he thinks he can do everything while u would be stocking at home as his prisoner!!!!!!<br>  By the way why dnt u open ur own account on facebook or and just add some guys make sure that he would see it..He needs to feel maybe how it is in diffrent postion?
AA10774554	If you were guilty you would be more secretive.  You would conceal any evidence or indication, avoid detection and attention.  You reacted naturally and aside from accusing somebody else I probably would call my mom dumb and throw a box of tissues at her and say cry me a river, roar.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	look, if u didn't do it..... chill|`|fZowCigGaa	chill and relax... chillax :D nywayz... if u react in a defensively it just shows your guilty... if you really didnt do it then calm down and talk to your mom... if she's acting hysterically or smething like that then calm her down and tell her to listen and tell your story...|`|apEHba97aa	I react the same way all the time. Ask her(calmly)what she does when she's accused of something she didn't do. If she's lying then it's a lost cause on that one. Tell her you flew off the handle because you didn't want to get blamed for something that you didn't do, and it's not like every time everything works out and she finds the person that's really guilty so you didn't know what to do besides flip out. I mean, why would you react calmly to being blamed for something you know you didn't do.|`|t9Sbje15aa	 let me c, you was accused,(did she ask you/or accused you:<br>  you got mad about it;<br>  then took a chance of hurting your own mom:throwing some thing that could hit her in the eyes or els;yes that is a sign of guilt: but explain to her, that you would like her to ask you>Ok and for your info>that's assault-and she can have you locked up: so make arrange meant to have talks at the table; or patio: but make sure you never react like that again, or you can be in jail:
1UiYpUWiaa	there's nothing immature about your feelings, but hatred only hurts its user, you need to come to a conclusion about what to do about her, if you decide shes not worth the pain then you must end it with her permanently, if not then give her a second chance, talk with her and resolve this.<br>  if you don't choose you will stay stuck and never get over this.|`|PGqCugFtaa	Same thing with me.We used to be close,until she started being herself.If you have other friends hang with them.You miss her because shes been your best friend you shared your laughs, and everything.Maybe you should talk to her to get things cleared up and you don't have to be friends just make sure that you are OK.
d5dKlgEPaa	It sounds like he's just having some problems accepting the fact that your gay. I think all he needs is some time to get used to the idea and it won't be so awkward anymore. try subtly mentioning your relationships every now and then to test the waters. if he gets awkward and uncomfortable, drop it and try again in a month or two. I know it feels unfair, but this is a big change for him, and alot of people loose friends after coming out, so take the fact that he's still around as a hint that he really does care for you, its just hard for him to get used to the idea. I'm sure he'll warm up to it in time, if you let him.<br>  In the mean time, try to find a friend to help you out with your problems, someone you can talk to. maybe meet someone online, who's not going to judge you. I'm not saying replace your current friends, but you need someone that your able to talk to, and take a load off your shoulders. so maybe look up some websites aimed for gays, or even here on yahoo, you can find someone who knows how you feel!|`|gCoqslUGaa	he probably feels awkward because your talking about guys instead of girls....... give him a lil time|`|YRRXtVXeaa	dump the fool and move on|`|7gAQudPKaa	Well it sounds like your guy friend is self centered and also maybe a tad narrow minded. i wouldn't say ditch him...but I won't not go to him with personal problems anymore. Finding someone who is open minded, or maybe even gay, to talk to about this issues would seem to be a logical answer. If you want you can talk to me. Hope I helped! And don't take what your guy said seriously...he sounds like an a s s h o l e. You are better than that <3 good luck!!|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	I would consider him more of a friendly acquaintance after this point.  A real friend will listen to your problems without judging your sexuality.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you are going to run into quite a few people like him.  The fact that you are homosexual should not threaten his masculinity at any time.<br>  <br>  Try to cultivate friends who accept you as you are.  Those will be your real friends.<br>  <br>  I would not contact him again.  However; if the two of you bump into one another, if the situation calls for it, I would just briefly mention to him how disappointed you were by his reaction and leave it at that.  Then walk away right after as the situation allows.|`|IEZr9yjhaa	Sorry but no, he is not a "true friend" although he is straight and you two were "friends" for 4 years before you came out to him, he probably feels that by not telling him, you were lying to him the whole time. I understand it is hard to come out to your straight so called friends. He is obviously uncomfortable with the fact  that you did come out to him.  A true friend would accept you no matter what. If he is uncomfortable with you telling him about your relationships, that is one subject you have to respect him and not talk to him about that. Don't you want true friends that accept you for being gay, that you can talk to about your life? Just forget about him being your friend. He obviously can't accept the fact you are gay. If it bothers you so much get back on aim and let him know that he is insensitive and he hurt your feelings. Then write him off for good.|`|pryF2b8Paa	Maybe he had a bad experience with that sort of stuff. talk to him and tell him it hurt you and that if he needs help just to tell you.|`|01Y15cAkaa	Move on buddy move on|`|WvjocMaIaa	Well If Hes Not Gonna Accept You For You<br>  Kick Him To The Curb|`|Xt31HyvWaa	basicly your mate isnt that kind a guy move on before its too late|`|HbnhpnL8aa	to long.|`|TM34SdAnaa	I say, that if you two are pretty close, you should tell him that if he doesn't want to talk about relationships, you shouldn't be the only one keeping your mouth shut.<br>  Okay, obviously, he's a little homophobic, but that's something you can't change overnight, so if you don't want to end up never talking to him, you should probably sort it out and /then/ decide if he's a good friend or not.|`|ifTuZKHcaa	Sometimes the closest of friends can do even the smallest things to hurt us, and they don't even realize it. Your friend may just be straight up uncomfortable with the subject of homosexuality, but until you came out to him he had no reason to worry about or say anything about it. The bad thing about keeping friends is that sometimes we have to make sacrifices and give them the benefit of the doubt, so we don't scare them away. My advice to you would be to try to forget about it and keep focusing on the positive aspects about your friend. As for his girl issues, just suck it up for now and give the best advicce you can-it might help you in the long run. As much as it hurts, we all have to try.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you could always make new friends...|`|xrEIAD2aaa	Why don't you try being straight with him, no pun intended.  Tell him you may have different sexual preferences but that doesn't mean you have to listen to him and he doesn't you.  Maybe he is just afraid of all the "stereotypes" of being straight and having a gay friend. (Are there any?) Ask him if and why it makes him uncomfortable. If he is a friend he will listen and be open to listening in the future.  If not then find a new friend.|`|uvpQZIX7aa	Move on . Simple .|`|azbt1xddaa	He obviously isn't a true friend.  If he was he would have listened or at least talked to you about it.  it's no different then what he talks about with you about girls it's the same type of situation so i think you should say something to him or else forget about him and find new friends
nRN30iiDaa	Your mom is probably lonely and a little bit naive. If you haven't got an older family member who you can confide in, then you will have to do it yourself. You are not a kid (you're a year older than I am!). <br>  <br>  You will have to tell her "Sorry mom, but I know more about this stuff than you do. I'm part of the internet generation, and I know that these people you are talking to are the same sick people I avoid when they are on the internet. They leave filthy comments on YouTube, and are probably into kiddie porn. They are trouble".<br>  <br>  Suggest that she finds better ways of meeting friends and guys, and she should go somewhere where they hang out. I do not recommend  internet dating! ;-))<br>  <br>  She needs to meet people. Face to face, I mean that can be a little risky too (and don't I know it ;-), but it's better than her talking to a nasty guy who is using her to jerk off.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	I'll find the bastard and skin him alive|`|wqchA8B7aa	It sounds like your mom is trying to take care of some unfulfilled needs.

OocDN5evaa	Tomorrow, smile at him in class. He obviously wants to be friends because he approached you - so now it's your turn to approach him and give him the A-OK. By not sitting with him, you gave off the idea that you don't want to be friends. He sounds like a nice guy, so I doubt he was offended, but to remedy the problem, approach him tomorrow and sit with him at lunch. Don't make a big fuss about what you did today either. Good luck!|`|VJvbp3d6aa	ur going crazy just talk to him or say hi|`|aD7kHTJNaa	go sit beside him at lunch. and be like-hey, wats up? hwo was your day? so I heard this cool song on the radio this morning or hey is saw this rly cool movie last night. just stupid stuff to talk about. he likes you, othrwise he owuldnt have opnd the door! he is tryn to impres u.|`|fdxIZDtOaa	i think you should just smile at him during class/lunch. if you want to, go up and talk to him during lunch. he seems shy too, so maybe he just wants YOU to talk to him first, because he doesnt know if yyouu like him or not.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	you are not a horrible person.

I think you should just relax and do what you said you were going to do and when you see him tomorrow just smile at him in class.  Then at lunchtime you can go over to him and say maybe hi, how is your day going so far?  Have they been giving you a lot of homework too?<br>  <br>  Just take things slow and don't try to rush them.  I think he likes you but maybe he's shy and not sure how to maintain a relationship.  Keep things cool and just act like you normally do but if you want to chat with him, go over and just start talking.  I think he'll be open to it.  Don't be afraid to talk with him.<br>  <br>  By him making the first move and talking with you, I think he left it open for you to talk to him if you want too.  Don't over analyze things too and just enjoy his company.  Even if it doesn't turn into a relationship, it doesn't hurt to get to know him and have him as a good friend.  Good luck to you two.|`|zka26204aa	He was probably just as nervous about what you thought of him.  Just tell him hello tomorrow, and apologize for avoiding him yesterday.

Just pretend that he is one of your friends...eat like you usually do (for some reason, guys really dig it when you don't sit and pick at your food, maybe lets them know that you are comfortable and confident), talk about your day.  You can flirt a bit, depending how comfortable you are.  Tell him smells good, commenting on his cologne or something like that.

NJ9Ytksraa	I have the same problem, except mine is a little different. It was a long time ago, but I'll pretend like it's happening now. There's a girl who always follows me around, and we were great friends at first, but then when it was break time she would say, "So where are we going?" And I would look at her like she's crazy, but she would continue to follow me. Then, I had these enimies, they were kind of like a group or a clique, and they always treated everybody like dirt. Then when I started ignoring the girl who always followed me, she bounced to that group. Now she hangs out with them all the time, but continues to follow me. For example: I say, "Why are you hanging out with them? You know I hate them." And she would say, "Well I had nothing to do, you weren't hanging out with me. And they're really nice." But, I know those girls weren't nice. I hung out with them once, and it was the worst time of my life. And I even see them pushing the girl (the one who followed me everywhere) down to the ground and laughing at her. But she continues to hang out with them because they all think they are popular, and she thinks she will gain repsect by hanging out with them. Did I mention she's ugly? Her hair shorter then her ears, freckles, glasses and crooked/yellow teeth. Anyway, I really relate with this question, and I told the girl: "Hey, it's been great being friends with you and all, but maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore." I know it sounds childish and all, but you will not regret it later, when someone is following or hanging out with you later. Anyway, here's a star for this awesome question. |`|EVF2Cnz2aa	stop hanging around her, and stop worrying about what other people are doing with their lives. jealous maybe?|`|BgZX9cWqaa	ok first of all *do not say your are a slut*<br>  <br>  this is what you will do: try your best to avoid talking with her with group with her, find another girl/friend to hang out with.<br>  <br>  try to stay away from her.<br>  if you are struck with her. BE YOUR WORE ST so she doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  slowly you two will become more apart and more until you guys babarelypeak no more.|`|JqYpNmRTaa	well, it depends if you care about her feelings or not. if you do then u can start a small argument with her about anything & use that as an excuse to not be her freind anymore. but if u don't care about her feelings u can jus say , " your a slut and i don't want to b ur freind anymore! " ;)|`|XnhipmbPaa	umm, i'm kinda new to this being half way intelligent stuff, but imma say go with, "You're a slut, I don't want to be your friend anymore." ? That should get the point across
TarXXuRmaa	I am a gamer widow.  We've been married for 9 years.  When we met he played Might and Magic, then Everquest, then XBox, and most recently WoW.  <br>  <br>  He's not playing anymore (as of 2 weeks ago.)  I change the password on his game and we have started attending Marriage Counseling. <br>  <br>  Before WoW I would feel like he was having an affair with the game/ computer.  I would tell him that if he touched me like he touched the keyboard I'd be more interrested in sex.  I told him he bought the computer presents (upgrades) and it was offensive when he'd say we couldn't go out to dinner due to not having the money when he just spent $100 on ram and pays monthly for a stupid game.<br>  <br>  But with WoW things got worse and he actually met another woman on the game.  The computer was in our livingroom, I was right there while he chated with her on the game.  It makes me angry to even think about it and I am crushed.  We have 2 children and I have never felt so ashamed or betrayed by him.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if we'll make it, right now I have no choice but to stay as I just can't afford to move and I don't want to move the kids in the middle of the school year.  |`|0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	I had a boyfriend once who was addicted to World of Warcraft. It got to the point that he failed out of college, quit taking showers, and started peeing in a bottle at his desk. It was nasty. I broke up with him, and it was the best decision I ever made.<br>  <br>  I am now happily married to the perfect guy for me...we both enjoy video games, but play them in moderation.|`|6sXG3Plkaa	My dad got addicted to World of Warcraft.  My mom once decided to see what all the fuss was about and is also now addicted to the game.  The sad part is they are closer now in their marriage then ever before.  They were to the point they didn't even talk to each other.  Then the game came along they put computers in two different rooms use a mic and chat while playing with each other.  Sad I know, but whatever makes them happy.<br>  <br>  I myself just quit playing the game this month.  I was never addicted to it just played every now and then.  I always knew my family was the most important thing.  Games like WoW is very addictive and sadly some people it becomes there lives and nothing else matters.

Act like you are confident, like you know she wants to spend time with you, but you're a little vulnerable because you like her. She needs to know you like her. Say something like, I'd like to get to know you better, how about _____ on _____? Or, You're really fun, hot, cute, whatever. Let's hang out just the two of us.|`|OxnXPRFNaa	i'm 13 too [even though im a girl] and the easiest way is to get a friend to do it when you are not there or send a instant message/email/text asking her out.  don't worry, your problem is not that bad!  my friend troy has to figure out how to ask out a BOY without the entire school knowing that he is secretly gay!  lol!|`|9Y5r4Rtbaa	I would become friends with her first.

A bad variation would consist of a girl you admire in someway being together with another guy for over 2 months and you realize they must be doing something sexual by then because they suck.|`|ir5wA1WGaa	I got the rod in my arm and had sex with my bf  5 weeks later.

6ht5cCZ1aa	dont you see??? he wanted a serious relationship and you blew it off as a game. he didnt want to play games he wanted your love, not puppy love, grown up and accept that, and if you really do have REAL feelings for him then you need to tell him your not playing games. and stop being so childish, he loooved youuuuuu. you didnt notice it. <br>  see...you dont know what you have untill it just walks right out of your life. thats my personal advice and dont take any of this offensively, kay? im only a jounior, so i know what you mean...:)|`|lo7BUlAQaa	okay I think you should go and talk to him about everything and ask him y he was talking that way about  you really theres nothing else you can do at this point|`|R13UtbZ0aa	if all the other stuff people said failed...plan c could be wear something, do something, say something that would really attract him.|`|n7Isks8Waa	THAT IS HORRIBLE!!!!

I think you should just drop a letter to him about all this and ask him to write back if he does not wanna talk. If he still does not react you should move on. Many oda guys. He'll regret sometime later. Get a little too friendly with one of his close guy friends. i think he will definitely talk over den if he is still interested.|`|LE8ElBWvaa	If he is the shy guy you talk about, then...he probably finds it really hard to say what is on his mind.<br>  <br>  if he is ignoring you, which he might just be busy cos you get more responsibility when you're older..you should tell him your HONEST thoughts like what you wrote here..<br>  he needs to hear it the most, not us.<br>  <br>  I mean, the dude moved schools for you so he must really care. Don't jump to any conclusions before you talk to him first.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel but if you are truly meant to be, you guys will be together when the time is right. There are more than one Mr. Right but there are only few Mr. Right Time..<br>  <br>  good luck hun|`|ZsX8b1q4aa	If he liked you as much as he said he did then perhaps he is worried that you are too good for him and he might feel like a loser. He might just be having puberty issues and be unsure about things in his life. Stick by him and ask him to hang out with you at lunch times and stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also: Ask him out or something jeez he must feel so alone. Maybe when you feel a little more comfortable.<br>  Remember guys develop about 2 years behind girls hormonally so he may not be having the same sort of ideas as you.|`|bc06bfa5e6e290d86d60dd98ef424b1faa	Rather than thinking of too many assumptions & judgments, face your problem head on.  Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel with what he is doing.  If this is the end of a friendship or whatever relationship you have had, then end it nicely.  Don't burn bridges.  You said, one of his close friends told you about him smirking or something.  Air it out.  Clear it with him.  Tell him that we have to iron things out.  If i did something to your disliking, perhaps you could tell me so we could set the record straight?  You might have just misinterpreted it.  Talk, talk, talk.  Communicate.  But despite all of your "trying" & he still seems to be distant, well, he does not deserve the friendship you are offering.  Friends or lovers for that matter, even husbands & wives, communicate.  That's the secret of lasting relationship.  :-)|`|iLBEFiS0aa	aw that must really hurt :(. Sit down and talk to him, and be like if you are going to be mad at me or ignore me, atleast let me know why. Possibly his feelings for your have changed but he doesnt want to tell you in person?|`|rYG9RuiIaa	Awwww... that must hurt :(, i feel bad for you. Why don't you make a date for him to come to your house, or visa-versa, and sit down and talk to him. If he says something like i just don't like you anymore, just ignore him and block him out. He will come running into your arms sooner or later! :)|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	He's playing the game much better than you are .... so I suggest simply refusing to play, ignoring him, not talking about him, and basically not allowing him any more room in your head. |`|NRZH9W5Raa	 maybe try talking to him and asking in what way did u brake his heart and explain to him how you feel...GOOD LUCK :)....tell me how it went..cady_aly09@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  oh n by the way wats "pota"...or did u mean "puta"|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	Well to be honest I think he doesn't want to hurt you by telling you he doesn't feel the same about you anymore.

Boys are like that..most of them..Next time..just take your time before you jump in before you get hurt. Be patient and learn from your mistakes. In the mean time..if hes talking to you then talk back..if hes ignoring you ..then ignore back..youve told him to his face..hes not admitting then you have to be strong and know the answer yourself.

And the answer is as simple as the nose on your face - beautiful things are enjoyable to look at.  <br>  <br>  You might as well ask, if you have a pretty tree with leaves changing colors in your yard, why do you need to look at a sunset?  Uh, well, the tree is certainly beautiful, but so is the sunset!  Why not look at both?<br>  <br>  I love my wife and I certainly appreciate her appearance.  She arouses feelings of lust in me, even after 22 years of marriage.

Fortunes have been made exploiting this aspect of masculinity.<br>  <br>  There's also the "want" side of it, as in, we want to look at women, because we enjoy it.

And they don't need to, they just do because they let their wants hurt (tempt) them enough to do it. They don't seem to grasp that even looking at someone else can hurt the wife's feelings.

Hygiene is better that way too.|`|AA11450203	I prefer a more natural hairy look around the pubic area.  However, when it comes to oral sex, I prefer that the woman trims around her lips so I am not fighting with the fact that I keep getting hair in my mouth.  But I would go with what makes you the most comfortable.  Especially when it comes to going to the beach.

yhkEyVXLaa	First dates always seem to be nerve wrecking but I think that both you and your date will feel the same nerves so first off don't over think anything, go with the flow.  I would talk up a storm with my date to get to know them better and relax and enjoy the evening, morning, whichever time you chose to go on the date.  The first date is all about getting to know the person you're going with more then what you just see in a daily atmosphere.  This is where good impressions last and the kind of impression that you give can vary among everyone.  There is no definite outline as to what to do on the first date but this is just something that I would do.  I would absorb all the information that is given^^<br>  Good luck!|`|ZRG18vnQaa	something casual like a movie or play , or a restaurant for a nice meal , nothing too fancy ......go for a walk  etc.|`|AA11450203	First dates are usually to get a feel for the other person to see if there is compatability.  Go slow and on the first date make it more of friendship type theme until you get to know the person better.  See if this is the person that you want to continue dating.  |`|QgYU4Iz5aa	You should do something very casual, like going for a coffee or, if your old enough, drinks. Something where you can talk.

He rubbed his chin and said, you should stay out of those places.<br>  <br>  My point being, people who remain in bad relationships may not deserve abuse, but certainly have options regarding how to avoid it, or abusive people. I'd like to know where you got your info from (stats) I have to assume they are skewed and different in every poll taking, info gathering agency<br>  <br>  Angel|`|FXaHv4lgaa	Your personal sample is small, and hence skewed.

Is this the only solution for you to save on money?  Kinda hard to believe.  If i were in the shoes of your S/O, you probably will  have a hard time convincing me.  I'm sure there are other ways of saving money without really moving in with your ex.  Put yourself in her position.  Would you believe her if she tells you the same thing?  Well, if you really love her, move out & think of better ways of saving money than moving in with your ex.  Perhaps you can ask your S/O for suggestions.
nGafpEwoaa	He can "hate" all he wants.  That doesn't mean you should be paying his bills.  "Ex" means just that.  It's time for "ex" to grow up and be responsible for his own texting.  No one forced him to do anything.  He's like crying mommy fix this for me.  Is that what you Truly want to be?<br>  <br>  It's time women STOP paying to get a man (boy) off their back for something they (women) are not responsible for.   This guy is a real jerk and deserves a kick in his text.  He thinks he's cool and trying to play you for a fool.  You're probably not the first on his list.  Like the saying goes, "the buck stops here!"  It's time for him to pay his dues.  Not you.  Don't even think twice about it.  <br>  <br>  Don't answers his calls, messages or textes.  How dare he treat you like you're a fool and are afraid to stand up for yourself.  You might as well learn now, that there are a lot more "jerks" like him out there taking advantage of women/girls.  Don't put yourself in the same class as his low life self.  If he wants to play, then he better learn to pay. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about him "hating" you.  He can hate all he wants, as long as you don't "give" him any money, because that's exactly what you would be doing.  He's slime ..... let him slip and slide in another direction.  If slime ball continues to harass you, then it's time to make a phone call to your local police department.  Harassment is breading all the rules.  Same all his messages, texts for proof if you need to use them.  If you pay him, all he'll do is move on to his next victum.  <br>  <br>  This may sound way out to you, but it's part of life that you're going to have to learn very quickly.  It's too bad, because you thought you had a friend until it was time for him to pay "his" bill.  What a joy boy!  Stay away from him and no communication.  Just keep your records of his harassments.  You're going to have to be strong and stick to your, just learned, convictions.  More power to you.  |`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	tell him to go to hell!|`|9HkLq8Ogaa	Tell him "Phuck you and everything you stand for.

I honestly think he's being immature.  If I were you I would just mind my own business and let him take care of his responsibilities, he was the one who decided to text you back.  Why would you want a friend like him anyways???..someone who is so quick to turn his back on you for no apparent reason.  So just ignore him..get better friends...and lesson #1...your ex's are never your friends..it causes unwanted drama..|`|tJIdBatQaa	He should pay it himself, you didn't make him text you back. Its his name on the bill, he should pay it. You shouldn't have to buy his friendship.|`|ccU5FNsmaa	tell him to pay his own d*mn phone bill you broke b*stard!|`|X3Q3nXoRaa	OH HELL no you should NOT pay his pjone bill, what a deusch bag!|`|UOucWYr6aa	He's already said he doesn't want you in his life then he has the nerve to ask you for money?  I don't think so!  He's a big boy he can pay for his own bills.  He's trying to push you around.  Do not pay that bill!  He'll get that you're not going to pay it and will leave it alone.  He's already acting like he hates you and if this is how he thinks he can treat you then you don't want him anyways.  Trust me, a guy like that is only going to be a problem later if you were to ever become friends again.  It sounds like he's doing you a huge favor in letting you see some of his true colors.  Bad timing buddy!  Tell him as nicely and sternly as you can that you can't pay his bill.  Or won't.  Whatever gets the point across.Good luck!|`|6hLS2xTOaa	Tell his butt to go jump.  Nobody put a gun to his head to text you uncontrollably.  I would tell him you are not going to pay his bill, and since he wants to be petty, you no longer want him as part of your life.  I had an ex do that years ago, he kept all the reciepts from when we were dating, for lunches, breakfasts, flowers, birthday gifts, christmas gifts, and so forth.  He gave me the reciepts, and told me that's what I owen him, cuz that's what he spent on me (and it wasn't even that much over 3 years) I'm still laughing at him for being such a dork, and thinking I would really pay him.  That's called bought sense, that's all.|`|FlPHURguaa	What ever you do don't pay for his cell phone bill that isn't your responsibility. For all you know he could have used it to call other girls and racked up a huge bill and now trying to blame it on you. Don't fall for his manipulative ways especially if he doesn't want you in his life. What will it matter if you don't pay for it ya'll aren't friends and it seems that he is trying to use you now.|`|AA10065077	Why are even considering paying it? Even if you do pay the bill he is still not going to like you. Even if he's nice to you after this point of you paying he's just using you. You need friends that bring you up not hold you down. Just ignore him and move on with your life. Eventually, he'll get the hint. If he threatens you in any way call the police. If he threatens legal action don't worry you aren't responsible for the bill.|`|rSOxOyP2aa	im a guy and ill admit this...guys are assholes, they give me a bad name. tell him he coulda just not texted back or called you.  calling works better by the way, me and my gf used to fight bad but now she has texting cut off and our fights have been shorter and less intense. calling alows for more a personal relationship. and its also easier to lie with texts, i found that out with another girl|`|AA11106955	DONT pay it!

Let him hate you, I hate him already.|`|eCZiJhe1aa	why is he asking you to pay his phone bill? If he doesnt want you in his life, then he is using you.

You pay or not, he is clearly indicating he does not want to have anything to do with you.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Screw him.  He is responsible for HIS phone bill.  He knew when he was texting you that he was going to have to pay for those.  If he's your ex, do you really care if he hates you?|`|cEocs8M1aa	sounds like hes being a jerk.<br>  screw him.<br>  just ignore him he should man up and pay for his own phone bills.<br>  its not like you forced him to text you or anything.<br>  what a jerk.

Well, you must try to think what to tell her first. Has she ever done sex before? If yes then your path is easy to ask her. However, ask her in a splendid manner with love and calmness. Try to ask her for example in a garden where there are less people. It would be preferably to ask her in the evening. And if she is still virgin, then again here make sure that you ask her in a lovable way with feeling. Concerning your stuffs which are condoms etc.. I think you still have a 15yrs old boy mindset. If there is love really between you and your girl, hotel is not the appropriate place. I would recommend you to go in a place which will gather love with affection. Just like, beach, forest or in your room. Hotel may make your girl to be felt like a cheapy ****. You must do your sexual act with pure love and affection as it will the first time. Ok brother by the way im Ali from Mauritius Island. Bye and good luck.|`|QuNV6NOMaa	You should have a condom with you always, but you don't need to book a hotel for it.

5ca8d18566af8bd516385f59eb621bcdaa	Hi that's life sometimes we grow apart and like different things that the other doesn't...<br>  <br>  Often it is caused by lack of genuine Communication  skills coz that is one of the best tools we all possess it's just a matter of recognising and respecting others wishes OK ?
tdwO3NPYaa	Definitely. He may be just a little bit awkard but he loves you a whoooole fuckin' lot. Trust me.|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	send it to 10 of your friends and in 2 weeks you should get 20 bucks in the mail!|`|GdJTQX6raa	no, throw it in the waste bin or flush it out. the coward who does not want to disclose his identity, what can you expect from him after knowing who it was. no point, just forget this as passing clouds.concentrate on your studies.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	call the police|`|OrVnvk4Aaa	ya u should try to find out who this "guy" is. it might just be some girl playin some sorta trick|`|WMajbRwqaa	Here's what it is:<br>  <br>  Say:<br>  <br>  "Who is this? Sorry, I'm not sure about an anonymous letter.<br>  <br>  If you want to identify yourself clearly, then do so. Don't expect any reply in return. This is a little much.<br>  <br>  Good bye."<br>  <br>  Don't get personal, just professional. That's it. If you find out you don't know him or aren't attracted to him, no reply. Let it go. Either he was really shy and liked you or he's psycho. Or both maybe. These days, things like these are suspicious, it's not like the movies. Who knows? If you recognize him, and he seemed alright, then it's up to you to pursue it. If you want to meet, a public place, always. Ok?|`|aad7c2d4f0086cb113df3c6f65d56743aa	the same thing happened to me...I received a similar sort of message on Facebook .I didn't reply until I found out the identity of the guy ;just to check whether the guy exists or not and whether the guy actually knows me for real or not.And it happened that the guy used to do the same hobby class with me but I have never talked to him....So, after finding it out ,I replied to his message saying that I have figured out who he is; and with due respect to his feelings,I answered that I didn't fancy him much and I only looked upon him as a classmate.So, it will be better for him to get on with life and try to forgive & forget me, and the pain which I may have cost him. <br>  <br>  So, I would advice you to figure out the identity of the person.You could forward that email address to all your friends who goes to the same engg. college with you and if they have that address on their list,they will let you know.You can also use the "Public Search Listing" facility which facebook/my space(any social networking site) offers, by using his email id.Once you get to know who he is,you can review your feelings towards that guy.The guy seems very sincere from his words in the letter and so, I think you should reply to him even if it's a "no".At least,he will get to know about your feelings for him and so that he can get along with his life, instead of waiting for you forever.|`|LgMoGUoqaa	You should try and find out who this guy is.

yDMgPeFGaa	Aw! Don't let that get you down! Just because no one has admitted to liking you yet doesn't mean that there's no one out there for you! I know how you feel on the single thing though. You just want to take the nearest thing, and throw it at the back of the happy couple's heads when they walk by. lol Of course, love isn't like those stupid movies where guy meets girl. Guy and girl are too shy to admit they like each other. One builds up courage, and they start going out. No. Real life is A LOT harder than that, but you just have to stay strong, and don't let it knock you down.|`|YPhLXVftaa	This is a crucial time in your life.  You are learning to have a strong backbone.  Find the strength within you, rely on spiritual help, whatever your beliefs are. Stay away from the bullies.  There are a lot of nice people, just look around you.  Life is about love, mostly loving yourself, it's hard to find love if you don't have it for yourself.  Take care of yourself.  Always remember that you are unique and special, the only one in the Universe like you.|`|f2a0cc692982532ea8bdc8a3c5bcf815aa	i will be your friend instant message me at lileyeore91 on yahoo messenger i am a teenage female or email me at lileyeore91@yahoo.com|`|fNn9puanaa	you're either way too nice to them, or you are rude to them.|`|Szx4GidXaa	the right girl will come in time just be patient|`|nNAeHHZKaa	I know exactly how you feel. I have to ask if you do not mind, why do you get bullied? For what reason? People in the world today can be so cruel. If one person finds out one thing about you, they immediately decide that you are a weird/bad person, and do not even give you the time of day. Dating today is so strange. People only look at the outside and not the inside of people. No one gives anyone a chance.I have low self esteem as well, from what people have told me in the past. I take a lot of things to heart. <br>  <br>  I know you say that you don't believe in E - relationships, but sometimes it is helpful. Have you ever tried online dating in your area. There are some sights out there that extremely safe. Sometimes, people get so fed up with public dating/rejection/ and what - not, that they figure online dating is their safest next bet. Sometimes, it even turns out for the better. TRY IT!|`|cxVmq2kraa	Not your fault.<br>  The only thing I can say is change schools if your in school.<br>  You can be whoever you want to be at a new school and things have much more of a chance to get better.<br>  Love comes when you least expect it.<br>  At least that is what I've been believing in for years.<br>  Don't rush it.<br>  It's better to wait and expierence something that makes you smile then to expiernce something that was just okay.|`|ea85abeaee1c46c10cc532949042fc87aa	Dang, sorry to hear about the bullies.  All i can say is hopefully you have some good friends or make some really good friends to watch your back.

Perhaps she is not allowed to date yet, that is a good reason to reject someone.|`|DxohE884aa	Maybe she's taking advantage of you because she's flattered by your attentions, but doesn't take you seriously. You can wait for her to make a move, or ask her out again. Third time's the charm, eh?|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Tell her how you feel.  I think honesty is the best policy.

You're still in school so it doesn't matter if she says no (no akward work atmosphere, restraining orders, etc). <br>  And she likes you too. <br>  Cause she broke -le gasp- the touch barrier. <br>  Yes, she put her head on your chest. Unless she has neck injuries and needed to rest her head on something fast, she did it of he own free will. <br>  I hope you find happiness~|`|COopDCqsaa	If there's any upcoming dances or something like that, ask her to dance with you or ask her to the dance.

9cpcu9mpaa	I personally think you should find ways that you can show him this without like you said blurting it out. Being there for him is a great way to show him. You should try spending some one on one time with him doing stuff that you both enjoy, this will make you guys closer. I'm sure this girl isn't any better then you, and I'm sure your just as gorgeous! Good luck and hope I helped!|`|esMek8nWaa	u have an EoCasino...|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Alright you need to be irresistible! I think what you need to do play around with your hair and makeup! When you come up with a look that just makes you feel stunning, be confident!! and flirt!!! He will get the picture and slowly see your everything his girlfriend is not!!! you need to be confident! (this is totally weird, but I love to watch movies like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, [example] to get a glamorous edgy inspiration to use) Don't always be incredibly available! Men always want what they can't seem to have! he might miss you too (don't get me wrong you better see him sometimes to make this work!) <br>  <br>   MOST IMPORTANTLY: BE YOURSELF!!!! if you start to change who you are you are lying to him and yourself! Just upgrade yourself! I'm sure his girlfriend is pretty but you are probably gorgeous! <br>  <br>  Play fair though. If she really is so into him and vice versa, you might need to set your eyes on someone else! after all you wouldn't want someone snatching him from you in the future if the option was open. make sure its fair!! If things with him don't work out you need to just convince yourself there are others!!! (this was once so freaking hard for me to learn!) don't just flirt with him, flirt with all kinds of guys! There is always the possibility that he does have slight feelings for you, and that would make him jealous!!!!  Good luck and I sure hope you get your man!|`|pWA3gybAaa	she is not a stalker|`|IRAtmZhTaa	just tell him straight up cuz there is one outta 2 things tha could happen|`|0zYkAXDRaa	Cat-Fight|`|zTeW6BIIaa	babe. he has a girlfriend. you're going to at least wait until they break up or risk not even having him as a friend anymore. sorry, sweetie. :]|`|1hLX4ZIVaa	how about: good sportsmanship?|`|kzHVVoiKaa	lol first of all<br>  you cant say that shes not perfect for him unless he told you that.<br>  <br>  Who cares if you know he likes someone else first, that doesn't mean he can not still like you. He's momentarily directed his interests elsewhere, you just have to bring him back your direction.<br>  <br>  First, you should have the built courage to ask him first. Dudes like that qualirt in girls, it shows they have drive, motibation, self-confidence and what else.  Time is short, you need to act fast. If you want the kid, ask him out ASAP. Don't worry about the other girls. Chances are, they are full of themselves, and stories, in forms of gossip, always change from their original forms. If that girl "is not perfect for him" and acts like a boy-crazy drama queen, she's nothing more than a boy-killer. Girls like that make boys end up in the trashcan. Take out her out, by beating her to the punch.<br>  <br>  Never throw in the towel in the dating world until you know you cannot possibly win...usually when another person either gets married, hitched, or dies.

I wish you all the luck in the world, but if you have been real abusive in the passed then I'm sorry to say your baby may never come back.

Molu004zaa	14 unsupervised seems perfectly fine, as long as they know what time to come home and you know who they're going with. 16 is really a bit late for teenage girls, who typically mature fast.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I think 16 is a bit on the high side... but I suppose it depends on the teenagers in question, and how well you know the boys that they want to date.  <br>  <br>  If your daughters are respectful girls with good grades that can be trusted, I see no reason to wait until 16.  I had unsupervised dates when I was 15--the boy was 16...and an honor student from a good family.  I had a curfew and was expected home on time.  Prior to that I really just went on group dates with my girlfriends and a few boys that we had our eye on--but nothing serious.  I also had minor boyfriends that I would see at the rollerink when I went skating with my friends, or a boyfriend I saw at the bowling alley when I accompanied my dad and my brother to my brother's league games.  I wasn't "alone" with him...but I got to see him once a week, and was allowed to talk to him on the phone...  Even as young as 13 I had a boyfriend that called the house--though I rarely saw him.  He was 15 when I was 13 and I remember one of our only "dates" involved going out to a local restaurant after a choir/band concert at school....it was him, two of our mutual friends, and I.....and my mom and her friend sat at another table across the room. LOL.<br>  <br>  I think you need to draw up some guidelines...because sometimes what a teenager considers dating is not what you might have in mind... It might just be being allowed to call a boy her boyfriend, talk to him on the phone, or IM him, and maybe go on a group date to the movies.  The important thing is that you trust her and the people she is hanging out with...and that you have an open line of communication with your daughter so that she can talk to you about these things.<br>  <br>  I would agree to let her go to a movie where you drop her off and pick her up....and I don't think I'd consent to letting her date someone more than a year older than her... and there would be an agreement that you have to meet the young man in question before she is allowed to "go out" with him... I'd also say that you needed to meet his parents so you know whether or not they are on top of matters and supervise their son.<br>  <br>  I think it is perfectly fine that you are concerned about it and have some ground rules in place before you say yes to a particular boy.  My parents were fairly strict people and there were boys that they would not allow me to get involved with.  I respected their decisions on that.  We also had rules that I was not allowed to call a boy (but he could call me--some sort of self-respect thing!)...and I was not allowed phone calls after 9PM. LOL.   <br>  <br>  I'd say 13 or 14 is reasonable for a group date to the movies or to go ice skating or rollerskating or some such activity... I wouldn't want my daughter hanging out at some boy's house when his parents weren't home.|`|AA11263103	16.. That is when my parents are going let me.. it doesn't matter casue no guy will never ask me out so.. 16 is good. too|`|qZZpCxhKaa	It all depends on their maturity and the trust you have for them. I think 16 is a good age to go on a date unsupervised. However, since they are saying that, and they are younger than 16, maybe you should let them go on group dates that way they won't feel like they are always being watched and they are being "babysat" if they just go out with a group of friends, it allows them to have a good time and get to know each other better, while protecting them from anything that could happen while they are alone|`|AA11447210	I agree with you completely re: one-on-one dating.<br>  <br>  As for supervised dating I think 14 or 15, depending on the child's maturity level.|`|uktBnDP3aa	16 is the age my mom is letting us date unsupervised|`|Awv7stIJaa	I say about 14.

The most important point is how mature for their ages are your daughters and how well can they handle themselves.|`|IU4uNH97aa	I think they should be allowed to 13-14 is a good age for group dating. When they are 15-16 they can start to really date alone because thats when they can start driving and really be independent.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Let them go alone. 16 is a good age as long as you know you can trust them. If you always supervise them, they are bound to rebel.|`|g5pZhzeoaa	It depends on the individual.  Some 18 year old girls have the sense of a twelve year old girl and some twelve year old girl have the sense on an 18 year old girl.  If you feel that your daughters won't do something they will regret on a date, than I think you should let them date.  As for supervised dating, did you introduce that idea to them?  After that they might say they'd rather not date at all.  Even if they know they would never do anything that you wouldn't approve of, I doubt they want anyone watching anyway.  It feels invading and as if your personal space is not respected.|`|O3X0WUhyaa	This girl and I really like each other, but her parents won't let her date. She's 16 and I'm 18. And they don't even want her talking to me, even though they know that i'm a responsible and respectful guy. They just think she's too young. But we still see each other all the time, and she talks to me on the phone all night long. <br>  <br>  My point is, if you try to keep your daughters from dating, they probably will resent you and try to break your rules anyways. The girl that i've been talking to is a model catholic and she loves and respects her parents very much. At the same time, however, she is willing to kinda sneak around them. <br>  <br>  In conclusion, i think 16 is a fair and good age for a girl to start dating. Just make sure that she is hanging out with the right type of guys and talk to her so she makes responsible decisions. The more you talk to her, the closer and more open your relationship will become. <br>  <br>  sorry that i wrote so much.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	It's never a good idea to say," you can't date until your such and such age.." becasue they will do it anyway and lie to you about it.  When high school starts you should let them date but make it very supervised, ask a lot of questions, in essence make them not want to do it, even though you said they could.  As they get older (late 16, 17, 18) Let them date more freely, but completely unsupervised at 16, is probably too early.|`|PRi3qIJEaa	ok 15 or 16 because if they are old enough to have a job they are old enough to have a boyfriend unsupervised trust them|`|3RbkVPViaa	Towards the end of Middle School.

Nowadays people can be teased for not "dating". I'm talking dating, not up personal and close. People have boyfriends in 6th grade - way too early - but in 7th and 8th grade girls are growing up. It's popular, and nowadays it's very normal. Don't worry, it's not "weird" to have them dating so young. I've seen 3rd graders dating! But if you ask other 7th graders, the majority will say they have one.<br>  <br>  -Miranda S. - - - Middle Schooler|`|nXFbY4vEaa	I think they should wait until at least high school, 16 is a good age.

y7MsBXdmaa	Women cheat for several reason... men as well, but sex isn't everything to a woman.<br>  <br>  The emotional & logical can weigh out the physical. A lot of women cheat due to unhappiness in a relationship.

She might turn to another guy for her emotional needs, and to ensure that she continues to get that support, she might let herself be open to his advances. Even if the "bf" is better in bed.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Yes! You said it yourself - size isn't everything. He could be huge and still have shitty technique. He could be huge and still be emotionally unfulfilling for his partner. Women cheat for a lot of reasons, and I don't think penis size plays a huge role in the decision to be unfaithful.|`|MS0WHTUnaa	Nobody has sex 24-7 and so yes If a man doesn't give her emotional support and an ear who will listen to what she has to say...she'll go elsewhere for friendship. But, it works both ways. A fat woman can cheat just as well as a fine one...so, might as well choose the one who turns ya on.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Women cheat for reasons other than sex. He could be great in the bedroom, but if he isn't giving her the love and attention she needs emotionally, and another man is, she might cheat.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	a large penis is a wonderful thing but you have to have more than just a large penis to keep a woman ( i hope!!) unless it's just a sexual relationship and nothing more.|`|kJX632msaa	Women don't just cheat on their partners because of penis size - just because a person is well-endowed, it doesn't mean that he's good in bed!<br>  People also often cheat for emotional reasons - their partner isn't meeting their needs in or out of the bedroom.  They may fall in love with someone else, or be attracted to another man, or a slew of other reasons.<br>  <br>  Every situation in which a person has an affair is different - a million unique situations and circumstances show us that.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question - a man should base his trust in faithfulness in his partner on the quality of their relationship - not the size of his package.|`|heutPyWZaa	a large penis is good, don't get me wrong.<br>  but, woman cheat for other reasons besides that.<br>  so don't rest assure, its still a possibility.|`|onUkjqJxaa	well it depends on the girl. if shes just in it for the sex then yeah. size matters. <br>  but if shes in it for love or relationship then no size doesnt matter.|`|8kM3sXLQaa	Yes they do.

We were together for 1 year which was my longest relationship.  You will have to rely heavily on phone calls, letters/emails, and visits and trust.  It will take work though.

You shouldn't force things and just live with the flow.<br>  <br>  You're still very young and have all the time in the world to learn more about your feelings and what you truly want in a relationship. Things never worked perfectly the first time around.<br>  <br>  As for not hurting him, I'm sorry but that's just what love is about. If he likes you as much as your telling us, well he will feel pain if you brake things up. That's also part on life. He won't die from it, and with luck he won't mind being friends again. <br>  <br>  Remember that Heart brakes aren't such a bad thing. It often allows people to take a step back, think about what they did, what happened and be able to move on and be stronger.<br>  <br>  As a final tip, if you personally know there isn't any chance it would work out, you have to tell him and make sure he understands that it just won't work. There's nothing worse then keeping high hopes when there really isn't any anymore.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and don't let people change the way you think. You seem like a brilliant young girl and you're on the right track.|`|pNagjehGaa	You could try instead of him calling instant messaging him. <br>  As for going over his house, invite him over to yours!<br>  And just tell him you don't like the pet names, I hated when my boyfriend called me honey.

Hang out, play some videogames...<br>  Being bf and gf isn't all about the kissy lovey ****! Its about if you're really best friends together. Well, I mean, thats the route of it. ^_^'<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck there! D:|`|Hfyyn7quaa	damn, i can see what you mean.<br>  tbh, think you need to resolve this with him.

Dont break up with him because that could damage your friendship, give it time so you can get your head together.<br>  if he doesnt seem clingy anymore, then your problem is solved.

I want you to take time to think why it is you want to be popular. Look around you , do you really want to be part of the mostly mindless rush for the next victim to discuss. Or do you want to have one or two really good friends who you can count on to have your back and be there for you?<br>  <br>  In a couple of years you will leave school and probably never , ever ,see those any of those oh so popular schoolmates who are whooping it up right now.<br>  <br>  Pick the ones who can offer you something more than social cachet and talk, really talk to them. Don't worry about discussing the latest fads. Discuss how the downturn in the economy is affecting you- less money from your parents , junk food costs more. You will soon see that you have something to say that is  worth listening to and gain friends.
xfpJGBfwaa	You set a trap?  <br>  <br>  Either you deserve each other, or you're desperate to have someone in your life because you're getting older.  Neither is a good reason to marry.<br>  <br>  What's stopping her from going to CA for 3 months to visit and see how she likes it?<br>  <br>  What's stopping you from visiting her and the baby whenever you have the time/money/inclination?<br>  <br>  If you don't marry for love, then marry for kindness and trust.  Those are the only valid reasons.  Other details can be worked out.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I would not marry this woman. She has already lied, cheated and stolen from you. If you get married and move to the US, as soon as she has her greencard, she is going to divorce you and take you for half of your net worth - and probably take the child back to Poland anyway<br>  <br>  Why not go home and try to find a woman who loves and respects you. You can always travel to Poland to visit your child, and work out an agreement where she can spend her holidays with you. It can work.

I would simply bring her to this country for the one year trail period and work on the relationship, take care of your daughter and see what happens. She will obviously need time to adjust the life in the States it is so much different. However, you need to accept responsibility for this as well.

That's all pretty much the same. But you always have your best friend nearby, and you cover each other's backs. The difference in single life and married life used to be sexual relations, but that's all changed. <br>  Most marriage partners don't have to ask permission to do something. That's just absurd and childish. You take each other into consideration, so if that's one thing you don't want to do, you are better off never getting married. <br>  I do believe though that children should be part of a marriage, not a 'relationship.'|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	sorry there is no similarity..... <br>  <br>  single- you get to do what you want when you want, you can act like a total fool<br>  <br>  married- you allways gotta check with your partner, you got to stop acting like a total fool.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Having done both and preferring the former, I see very little if any similarity between the two.|`|5HfsDZh4aa	Be more pacific like similar as far as the people have morals  married or not|`|08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	Being with one person for a while learning their thing that turn you on and turn you off.

STOP LIEING! just learn to not lie.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	just hold back from lying. <br>  <br>  personally, if i lie, it bugs me so much i have to go tell the person i lied to that i lied. <br>  <br>  just dont do it, its not too hard!|`|azbt1xddaa	i know someone that is the same way.  it's like you feel like you have to lie for no reason.  even though its pretty late into the new year, make a new years resolution to stop lying.  everytime you lie try to catch yourself and clear up whatever you lied about.  pay attention to what your saying and before you say it.  that should help|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	i lie all the time too. lol it's not something i'm proud of, but it just happens. but, the thing is, i truly am a devil, cuz once i lie i don't think twice bout it. <br>  i can't help you on this one. sorry.|`|QuLrlSvhaa	just think..<br>  -how about if they do that to you as well and that will get you in big trouble..<br>  -without your family you won't here, you should say thank you to them rather than being rude to them.|`|Wud0BJZOaa	I don't know but that is not normal. Ask God for forgiveness and help you become a better person.
DTGZJ8T6aa	wow, that first answer is one of the best answers i've ever read.|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|sROU8U32aa	he might like you. dont rule out that possiblility. the nervousness and smiling are good signs. try flirting with him more and being more comfortable with him and let him get comfortable around you. just walk up to him and say hey, how's your day going? or just say hi while you teo are walking by. you could also ask him a question. that always works. and build from there :) sayhow was your day? or whats new? <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Likes-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Lik...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-Your-Crush-Without-Being-Crushed" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-Your-Crus...</a>

It is possible that your self-esteem has taken some pretty big hits, and that you act as if you expect to be cheated on, you know?  You might even have a side of you that is drawn to charismatic and manipulative men.  The very fact that you question yourself (is it okay that he does that?) and not getting in his face and letting him know how it makes you feel is a good sign of that.  There is an interesting dynamic to your choice of men and how you respond to them that deserves a closer look.|`|ch93aYF3aa	Find out the site he is looking at and post your picture and correspond with the the other men. He will not think it's a good idea for you doing it but what's good for the goose is ......<br>  <br>  You could also ask him what the site is because you want to get some compliments too. This might make him think he's a dope.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	try and remember that he is NOT your former relationships.  I see nothing wrong with a man complimenting a woman or vice versa on how they look.  So long is that is as far as it goes.  <br>  <br>  Its like being on a diet, look at the menu but do not partake!|`|UUrqECXIaa	Would your husband find it acceptable if you did the same thing? I'm not suggesting that you do this, but I've told my husband that he needs to treat me the same way he wants to be treated. He shouldn't  do anything, that he would not want me doing.<br>  <br>  With the information that you've provided, I wouldn't say flat out that your husband is a cheater, but personally I find his behavior inappropriate. He is flirting. It's one thing to look, it's completely unnecessary for him to make any kind of contact.<br>  <br>  Knowing your history and insecurities, I feel that he is being insensitive of your feelings.
aWEybdDFaa	Karma is a B*tch, and note: whenever u get married it would happen to u too.<br>  How can u have eyes for a married man--never mind the age difference. He is off limits. <br>  <br>  If he was nasty enough to fool around with you while his wife was WORKING than u go fix this situation by letting the wife in on the mistake u made w/her nasty husband, say everything don't leave anything out-that's if u TRULY feel bad about what u did.<br>  <br>  If u don't say anything than u never cared. And just wrote this stupid queston to see how many people would answer.

Sick sh*t!|`|61Fwbi79aa	Yes, you are. You know it is wrong to do this, and you did it anyway. My ex cheated on me, and I have no compassion for anyone who would get involved in a relationship with a married person. <br>  <br>  What you should do, is to never see or speak to him again. you have been part of one of the most hurtful things that that woman will ever go through.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You are either a troll or the most naive woman who ever lived.<br>  <br>  If you had sex with a married man, that is an affair and he cheated on his wife with you.

Instead of beating yourself up about it, learn from this experience.  Move on and don't let it turn into a full blown affair.  I think you are worth more so go and meet someone who's available.

gRXy66dOaa	u have to deal with it<br>  thats how i did|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	You should face this as solution & not problem. It is good that you get all the solutions without any problems. Be positive. Whatever your parents do for you is the outcome of their hard work. They must be knowing your behaviour. That is why they are interfering in all the matters. Kindly bear it & go through it coolly.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	grow up and move out.  That'll show em|`|ghbaAWOCaa	Ah stop with the dramatic self pity drama. Parents are parents, they brought you into this world and quite frankly have quite some rights over you. Theyre not only older but also wiser than you, and though most of the time it may look as if theyre looking to destroy your life..theyre not. They know better, so stop being such a little girl and realise that you need them more than they need you|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	umm...Isn't that what every teenager faces???
rdkCzDSyaa	I would say take it by the day.I understand you want to meet him but if his parents find out you both want to get together it would make matters only worse.You can ask a friend who lives close to his house or something and play it cool.|`|llez7aU4aa	eh forget about him and move on. there will always be a shadow from his parents. I was dating this one girl and she was always worried her dad would find out and beat her and I got sick of it so I told her to hit the road.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	There are many more things to be done during summer vacation. Learn more things by going for short educational picnics. Go for hiking. Join library & read more & more books. There is a lot of fun in all these things rather that crying on silly friendship relations.|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	If you love him, keep going -he won't be grounded for ever after all!<br>  <br>  If you and he were not so serious about the relationship, then move on!
BaguqDHiaa	LOL, well i would take:<br>  <br>  3x packs of four JD & Coke (maybe a bottle of JD and a pack of 18 Coke Zero)<br>  1x PSP - with Final Fantasy game<br>  2x Packs of batteries<br>  1x Pocket Knife<br>  5x Blocks of Chocolate<br>  1x Blanket (my Favb one!)<br>  10x New Zealand's favb Bake Beans!!!<br>  A 6 person Tent.<br>  <br>  <br>  ummm thats all i can think of right now :P
HnCUC1YIaa	it could go either way...he might just need a shoulder to lay his head on. after all, girls are very comforting when it comes to stuff like that. he might just want advise or comforting.<br>  <br>  also...he could be implying that he likes you. he could be telling you all this so you know what he expects in a girlfriend\<br>  <br>  you should have a friend ask him if he thinks of you more than a friend|`|qXV0TjWEaa	I dont think he was talking about specifically you. <br>  maybe he was like trying to test you, you know? <br>  see if you would listen to him and maybe form a relationship<br>  if you do end up dating this man, and he continues to talk about his ex's <br>  end it immediately. you dont want to be with a guy who's stuck in the past!|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Seems to me he's dropping hints that he just want a friend with benefits, that he's tired of the relationship thing... and also he sounds rather self centered if that's all he seems able to talk about.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	probably he likes u and is trying to give u hints and at the same time trying to find out if u feel the same,,,,
K6egI6O4aa	Just say something to him! Don't beat around the bush!|`|MzEIoozyaa	I'm pretty sure he will.<br>  <br>  In the case that he doesn't, then you have to be honest.<br>  Just say you need some time off from him to think about some things. He should get it by then!!<br>  <br>  Hope I've Helped! =)|`|pNqjsJn7aa	Hopefully!!|`|hpHaofpnaa	I think so. I mean if my friends blew me off without a good excuse i'd get the idea.|`|718HjVbaaa	Here's the thing; even after you do something to give them a hint, they won't get it. Trust me, that gets REALLY annoying. So, I would just tell him in a nice way, "Dude, you're being pretty damn annoying." Okay, maybe not like that, but explain nicely that you don't like racist jokes and that he does some things to annoy you.|`|N0Ji8xFvaa	Oh My Gee!<br>  I've SO had this happen to me before!<br>  It will be easiest to tell him you don't like him.<br>  It's cruel, yes, but it actually works.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Stop playing games -- just tell him that you find his racist comments annoying.|`|AA11989999	Is this a gay group and situation? If so, I do not know the rules, but he ought to get the message. Trouble is, he might be sticking around you all because he has no where else to go. At least you haven't beaten him and left him in an alley for dead, which might occur to some people.
tU5NJVL3aa	Yes, he's a stalker, but I can tell you are enjoying the attention, aren't you?  Stop asking him to get you things, and carry your own books... you clearly are encouraging him.  It is two faced of you to then try to turn it around by telling teachers.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	that's the creepiest thing ever <br>  <br>  you are right he is a stalker|`|wu7R7uBdaa	Yeah, that's a little creepy... talk to the school counselors with him. It's mild, [not suspension or anything] but it will intimidate him and he'll back off. Or, if you're uncomfortable with that, just ignore him, or have one of your friends talk to him.|`|7PBsOx9Raa	thats wierd|`|PSkCp3PBaa	wow... u told teachers! wtf|`|Wv8hdSTAaa	OMG WTF!!!!! normal ppl dont do tht!!! just walk away and if he follows you be like "dude im going to my LOCKER and then the BATHROOM....LEAVE!!!!" trust me lol... he'll leave you alone.or act all pmsy. lol
y1uppUHcaa	Oh hunny. I know how bad it all hurts. I'm going through the same thing right now. It's really hard to let someone go. I know that from first hand experience. The one thing you need to remember is that no one single person on this Earth is ever EVER worth your happiness. People have the capability of making you so upset and so sad when they don't even mean to, and it seems like that's him, but you need to realize life will go on. You seem to be in high school, and we have sooooo much more of our lives ahead of us. By the time you move, I'm almost 90% positive that you'll meet someone else and fall completely head over heels. But as of now, you need to take time away from him and focus on you and your happiness. You've given so much time and effort in to liking him, but you need to start putting time and effort into you. Go out with friends, hang out with family, go exercise, do something that will make you happy and not think about him. There are so many other people out there and you'll find another person. It'll all work out.|`|EdidZdtlaa	if you guys are heading different ways i think you should enjoy your time with him now while you have it. but other than that i think you should tell him what you just wrote on here. tell him its not him but you dont think you guys should hang out anymore. tell him its for the best because its hurting you. make sure he understands why your doing it so that he dosent feel bad or anything.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	i totally misread this question, so im sorry for my first answer.<br>  <br>  i think you need to move on, he has a girlfriend. hes off the market.|`|QKnilCNDaa	hon, u gotta find someone else. its obviously coming to a level where you're fisically being effected by ur depression. just keep telling urslef he's gay, i know it sounds silly, but it works.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Just focus on other things and other people! Whatever you do, don't tell him how you feel because that would just be a burden on him, plus he might tell his girlfriend (depending on how close he is with her).|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Don't avoid him, cuz he sounds like he could become a good friend of yours. If he has a girlfriend... you have to remember that dating, especially in high school and jr. high don't usually last long. I'd say give it a month or two it looks like he likes you enough to possibly eventually like you like that. Don't focus on the fact that you like him and he has a girlfriend, focus on the fact that he's fun to be with (if he is) and acting cool when eh talks to you. Good Luck and hope I helped! ^^|`|9PaRdlwcaa	You should try to tell him how you feel, just to get it out in the open. Bottled up feelings will only hurt you more. If he feels the same way, than things will just fall into place. If he doesn't, than you will have to let things be and move on. Don't loose contact with him, though, when he leaves. It seems like you two are really compatible. Sometimes, just being friends can be enough, or has to be. Keep in mind that you should be respectful to his girlfriend.|`|GH0a2rclaa	I'm glad that you realize that you can't be with him and thats the first step. The only way to really get over him will be time apart and with time. I don't think you should tell him if he's the reason you've been stressing..because that will just make him sad and feel guilty. Just enjoy the friendship and try your best to move on. You're a strong beautiful independent woman and you don't need this guy to know that. =)
RbGycz46aa	Hey. I'm 18 and i've been where u at. I had an ex who even admitted I reminded him of an ex. I took the chance with being with him and it was kind of good until it got more serious. Constantly he'd call his x name and tell me to act in a certain way. If u really like him then b with him no one is saying anything with it. If that was wat "Peanut" said u shouldn't really listen to wat they have to say cause sometimes they just want to get in the way and make everyone miserable for their own amusement. It may sound corny but talk to the guy u like and just try and see what he likes about YOU not his ex. U like him then be with him k? :) but try and be smart in case u start to c the signs that I had with my x....calling HER name and stuff. I really hope this helps. :)|`|CzbQTbq5aa	i hate when this happen am 13 to i hate it when it happen to me i like this boy who like me to and his girlfriend hate me
xc6iCPUQaa	No I don't think that is wrong unless the emails start to become inappropriate or things start to happen outside or work. Married men need friends too!!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I guess it depends on what the emails say too. I mean if the emails are just like him saying hey whats up hows your day, and you saying good hows ur day, and then his saying what are you doing this week... I mean what is wrong with that??|`|jK5FXm6Naa	If they're not inappropriate and there's no contact outside of work, then it sounds innocent enough. If he tries to go further with you, or is trying to do so with these messages, then that's not good.<br>  If you feel awkward you should talk to him about it and save the hassle with his wife later on|`|Wn4NVHeeaa	1st off.. that's kinda creepy how hes "addicted to emailing you.."|`|Ga11Abmzaa	i guess so|`|lwKz0iDJaa	Yes its wrong.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	it is wrong. He is testing you. He is hoping one day you will cross the line with him. Stop flirting. Stop email flirting at work. Not only is it against work policy but it can hurt your professional reputation if people saw copies of the emails. Tell him to stop it. Or you shouldn't respond to any of his flirty emails.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	nothing wrong as long as he doesn't try to try anything.<br>  friendship is a wonderful thing even small ones like yours, it a shame people have to impose their views on such manners with dirty eyes,  just because hes a married man shouldn't mean he can't talk or have friends that are females.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	its totally cool to be friends with married people. he might not have intentions and is just enjoying chatting with you. if it by chance becomes uncomfortable at any time.. tell him your uncomfortable. might even start to meantion about a boyfriend (whether you have one or not). if the emails slow down like a ton then you'll know what his intentions might have been.|`|O2RNsEOraa	Is he even married? Think of it this way, if you're doing anything to lead him on ( email back) stop right now because only bad can come from this. And if this was your husband, would you appreciate if he was doing the same? I think you should slowly but surely go away from him...|`|KeWQB78Paa	umm!! i think hes a lil ountside the line but be careful!! answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304081457AArd4if">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|2I5XqMDzaa	its wrong if u have to ask this question. he should back off alittle. its not wrong to have friends but if he is constantly emailing u its a bit weird|`|AA12228017	yes wrong. any emails outside of work talk are wrong. stop it.|`|c7XrBgz2aa	A little mabey its a little crush try speaking to him about it|`|qXV0TjWEaa	I dont think its wrong. I mean, you cant really be flirty through an email. and you dont see each other outside the office. its not  big deal as long as you two arent sexually interested in each other. but i dont think its wrong. maybe the flirtyness is just a part of his personality!|`|eMSP740Taa	Yes, this is extremely inappropriate behavior for a married man. If I were you, I wouldn't be entertaining his little obsession of emailing/flirting with you. Just out of respect for his wife. Even if you don't know her. =]|`|lNgE2DMbaa	It sounds like innocent flirting.  As long as you know your boundaries, have fun and pass the time away.|`|FuEa92ydaa	Seems kinda sketchy. Maybe you should politely tell him that his emails make you uncomfortable because of his marital status.|`|xZr7paPTaa	i don't think it's wrong since the emails aren't inappropriate. maybe he's just really friendly|`|L4r1kmPQaa	IT'S REALLY WRONG!|`|DPPW93JFaa	yes of course is wrong why r u even askin..............|`|bJDDSIObaa	Yes, it's wrong. If you were married how would you feel if your husband was doing that?|`|639b28b69bd5c62b6d4870f15cb085a0aa	he's using you as an outlet to get what he's not getting from his wife, so yes it's wrong.|`|gRXy66dOaa	YES<br>  <br>  its very WRONG<br>  <br>  its almost like cheating|`|nZynoCVKaa	no|`|FwJLD1uDaa	just dont flirt with him and your fine :)
AA10003766	go up to him and say hi, he will notice, if he is shy you can twist him around your little finger, if not he may use his on you.|`|83b7130217826eaebb09c63f21231979aa	Start to talk to his friends and maybe then he'll start to talk to you and he might even start to like you hun.Or you can ask your friend to ask him if he would like to talk to you and give them your number to give to him ok hun.|`|AA11333060	all i have to do is smile and hes all mine|`|AA12017858	Start ignoring him, turning your back to him when hes around sooner or later he will be yours|`|AA12289549	ugh...do whatever i can. the guy i like hardly knows i exist. i changed the way i dressed, my shoes, my hair, but before all that, i stole the pen he left on my desk. i pretty much stalk him. then, i realized that it totally wasn't me, so I've started to simma down|`|AA11767291	You could dye your hair green ; but it might be better to just talk to him .

AA10065812	???????<br>  Could be a mistake, but if it is and they start deducting the money from his check, it can stopped in only 11 states, whether he's the father or not.<br>  <br>  In 1996, a San Diego based Navy Commander suddenly found all his assets frozen, including Savings and Checking.  This was a preemptive move as he was about to get hit with a retroactive child support order of $85,000 for a 15 year old daughter he didn't know existed. He dated the mother in college, but she quit school, move home, and never talked to him again.<br>  <br>  A woman can file against a man, use a wrong address on him, get a default order, and he's stuck.  This became so common done to Active Duty military men that the legal office of each branch began refusing new claims until after the man returned to the U.S.<br>  <br>  Now, it could be his child under a couple of circumstances.  A woman performed oral sex on him and impregnated herself with it, or found a used condom the two of you used, and impregnated herself.  The causal effect related to how the child was conceived cannot be used to prevent an order.  In the case of oral sex, though the doctor was ordered to pay child support, he was also allowed to sue her for emotional damages.<br>  <br>  Get a copy of the letter and contact your state that issued it.  If it's an out-of-state claim, they will inform where it came from.  Take notes on who you talk to and when, in case you need to raise hell if you end up going in circles.  If it's legal in your state, record your conversation with them.<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  It the claim is from out of state, the state law applies where the call originated.  If it's legal in your state, but not in the other, when you call them you can record, but not if they call you, or vice-versa. <br>  <br>  Let me know when you know the source and I may be able to refer you to a father's group near you for more help.

Not unusual if you are getting any kind of public assistance, TANIF, Food Stamps, Medicare, etc.  States are tried of picking up the bill for fathers who are not being responsible enough in supporting their children.  If he is ordered to pay child support and doesn't he could also face jail time.|`|3M3UtNyvaa	Oh come on...if he fathered a child out of wedlock with you, why couldn't he have done the same with someone else? I think you are being presumptuous. How do you KNOW if he doesn't have any other children? Because he said so?

Let me tell you what I did when my soulmate left me. The problem I had was that nothing felt OK anymore you know? Nothing that I did seemed important or had any flavor, nothing that I enjoyed doing brought me joy anymore. I became withdrawn and extremely depressed. Hang out with family and friends, make an effort to never be alone. Fill your time with activities that used to make you happy, even if they seem pointless. Make new friends, try out new things, do somthing you have always wanted to do but never tried or had the guts to try. Basically do whatever you have to, in order to keep your mind occupied. Fake being happy, and every day it will get easier to fake happieness till one day you will turn around and you won't have to fake it anymore. Again I am so sorry that you have to go through this but I did too very recently, so if you need sombody to talk too. I would be happy to listen. Just remember, you are a woman of value and worth, and you deserve sombody who will treat you with dignity and respect and there are alot of men out there who will do that for you, if you give them the chance. Don't settle for anything less good luck sweetie, and I hope this helps.|`|AA12111615	Because he doesnt know a good thing when he has it.|`|AA12334750	Ahh...he is a jerk

You should not think of destroying him.  Let it go.  You can do better.  Take a trip with friends or go to another city and say hello to everyone you pass on the street.  You don't feel good about yourself right now and you want to hurt what hurt you.  He will not change.  Evil is evil and It can't continue to hurt you unless you let it.  If you let it, then it will destroy you.  Think about other things, and smile again|`|AA10035003	??|`|AA12245742	More info please, it sounds like you need a friend to vent to.|`|5556d5488ccb6ca88177d5dc7d75bc68aa	either go to google and type "how to kill an ex" or just forget about it and do sumtin else|`|AA10373401	OK so what do you want me to do?|`|AA11609865	pray and ask GOD for strength to make it through this.|`|AA12289340	Quit putting yourself down.. I know it may sound corney, but God will only give you as much as you can handle.. So just calm down, get a friend for support, and get away from wherever your at because it's not doing you any good to stay there.
1UiYpUWiaa	i think you may need more then just a good advice, you should see a doctor and maybe get some anti-depressant, it might help your mood swings and balance you out.<br>  as far as your father goes you need to shut him off emotionally and not get caught in his anger, anger attracts anger you need to remember that just because hes getting angry at you doesn't mean you need to get angry back at him, blocking him on that level will prevent him from enjoying his anger and cut his fuel supply so to speak.<br>  as for your current life, i get it, you feel stuck in place, that's when depression shows up because you can't see yourself getting out of this situation, having support  from your family at moments like this really helps but since you don't have such support you probably have a pretty grim look at life right now.<br>  i want you to sit down and start writing everything you want to have right now, anything!<br>  if you want friends write it down, if you want money write it down, write everything down except for the things you don't want, like i don't  want to get angry or i don't want to fight with dad, instead write i want to be happy and i want my dad and me to get along.<br>  after you finish writing this start writing why you want this things and how is it possible to gain them, if you feel something may not be possible now just write it down and add the "how" later.<br>  once you have everything on paper, keep the paper and follow it to gain what you want, in the meantime relax, take a shower ,close your eyes and meditate for a few minutes ,imagine getting only what you want and how your life should be once you get it , <br>  throw old junk your not using away,clean your environment, listen to relaxing music and not high beat stuff.<br>  follow this path and keep finding ways to improve your life style, even small stuff mean allot when your stuck.<br>  my last advice is you focus on your passions in life and try to make them a bigger part of your everyday life, surround your life with what you like as much as you can and it will drown the other stuff.|`|O2RNsEOraa	I wish I was you. If only I 'knew' no one and 'clicked' with absolutely no one, I would be King of the World. Clubbing isn't going to help because after that, you'll feel like sh-t all over again. There's no use in killing yourself, then you'll only prove that you're weak. Take control of your body, you're not weak. If there is anyone that can take control of you, is YOU. At least you have something worth living for (College and moving out in the fall), some people would KiLL to be you. Always think of this too: Things can be much, much worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything buddy.|`|eGD0qDLOaa	I fell very bad for you, cus I myself was depressed for about a year or more, until one day my mom talked to me<br>  <br>  she asked: are you depressed?<br>  me: i dont know ?<br>  Her: well dont be, you have to be happy and not think about the bad stuff, think positive, be happy.<br>  <br>  I think right after that night, my depression started fading away..<br>  <br>  All i can tell you is, dont worry about dates or gfs, their not important, trust me there's someone out there for everyoneeeeeee !!!!<br>  The convos most likely dont go anywhere because in your mind you constantly think "i have to make an impression and a friend", dont, be yourself, not everyone click right after a conversation, dont worry, plenty of people out there, and you still got life !<br>  <br>  The thing about your dad, well your not the only one either, it happens to me too, but with my uncle, i say hes emotionally abusing me, but not at that high of a level...<br>  <br>  Try to cope with him... do things you like.. go tot he ebach, it really helps relieve stress and makes you feel way better... watch sunset, sky at night, yeha it may sound gay, but nature, naturally gives you good feelings : )<br>  <br>  Good Luck ! <3|`|eMSP740Taa	Wow..I am truly sorry that you feel so down. Do u have any family that you could move in with that you are close to? If worse comes to worse...just try hanging in there until fall. It's only a few months away. If you've hung in there this long, im sure u have it in u to wait just a tiny bit longer. Just the fact that you have goals (hence going to college) shows that you are ambitious and smart. This might really sound funny to many but try speaking to God...ask for his help and guidance. Good luck with it all!! =]|`|y0T5V7hIaa	I think that you should volunteer your time helping others, I really think it will make you feel better to give back, and once you feel you made a positive difference in the life of someone else, you'll feel positive too.  Try volunteering at a senior center or a soup kitchen. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and just stay positive no matter how bad things get.  <br>  <br>  Please get rid of that pistol.  Things may seen dark now, but there are better days ahead.  Stay strong.
AA10129235	I have to agree.  The best thing you could do is save yourself for your wife.  It's even better if she, too, is a virgin.  Then you can both explore each other together and you won't need advice.  It will just come to you.  It's a beautiful thing to wait.  I wish I had.  Please hold on until you're married.  You'll be glad you did.|`|AA10701806	here's a tip: if u were smart then u would keep ur virginity and give ur wife a "clean body" as a gift, after u get married!|`|b42c4e7a1fd1a288c88cf05959185bb7aa	**** NO WE WANT SEX!
0ktcvglRaa	Wait until the moment is right, then lean in for a kiss and he'll understand.|`|42tNVOUDaa	Kiss him instead. Tell him you have something for him then get him to close his eyes and hold out his hands and just kiss him.|`|EdidZdtlaa	just bring it up and ask him his opinion about it.|`|EtXktTgbaa	kiss him|`|ttGGDTnlaa	aww haha my boyfriend and i had the same problem we both were to shy to make the first move the thing is guys dont really get hints you like have to like flat out tell them what you want or they wont get it so i suggest that when you two are hanging out or somewhat alone just grab his hand gently and kiss him believe me he will sooo apriciate that you made the first move :]|`|xSb9f8Aoaa	The guy i'm sort of with now and I waited months to kiss.  I casually mentioned to him in a text after hanging out that it would have been better if we had kissed. The next night he got close to me, grabbed my chin and kissed me. Just bring it up to him and he'll figure out what to do.|`|8idurg0Daa	How do you mess up when kissing? Anyways, go for it. He will think you are more confident and what's a relationship without at least two kisses? Come on! Go for it! Just go with the flow........<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	dont hint to him just kiss him|`|QvhPJAKyaa	move up closer to him. <br>  snuggle into him. <br>  move your face towards his. <br>  make a move slowly, see if he follows.

Works for me!|`|XeLZtw20aa	take a cold shower xD or just hang out with a friend and have them keep you awake but I'm wondering why you want to stay up so much...|`|7IJrESsxaa	Coffee/Mosters/red bull|`|NaLxNQhCaa	Eat a lot, but not just anything. Eat brain food, carbs, like pasta, sandwiches, and fruit. Also, you could take a shower in the middle of the night. Be careful not to eat certain things that can make you sleepy (like turkey or warm milk). Caffeine is not a good option anyways.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	There's actually caffeine in chocolate, if you want to try that.<br>  <br>  Doing something active should help you stay awake, go for a run or something like that.|`|7u3F3DfJaa	hmm.. well you might try exercising. you might think i will just make you tired bu, it doesn't. it wakes you up. a lot. also, eat fruit. you might even want to just take a nap?<br>  good luck=D|`|DsszxGT6aa	Exercise.|`|EtXktTgbaa	well, people always feel awake when exersizing|`|AA12117694	drink caffine, coffee|`|kf5oUKpBaa	hahahaahaha u must be tired though!!  go to bed!|`|IQfaj1BGaa	why would u want to do that?<br>  not sleeping makes people cranky, grumpy etc.<br>  u can get dark circles under ur eyes and other bad things|`|DJK8yUbAaa	Really fun loud up beat music always keeps me awake.
WT5jdIkxaa	if it ended happy and you agreed to stay in touch and be friends then shouldn't take long for him to contact you. although he may still be getting over you properly, just give him some time|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Do not waste time in short or long. Act now.|`|Hp6GLCopaa	I am not going to even answer this question since you are such a lier.<br>  <br>  BYE!|`|fLMc72q4aa	When my ex and I split we agreed to stay friends.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	There's no middle ground here.  Just break up and don't leave an open door.  Or window.  He needs to work on himself, apparently, or else he is just manipulating you with that so you'll stay.  Either way, you have to be in it and you're not.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	No matter what, the two of you need some time apart right now. Take a while to yourself, and then become friends. If you decide to give it a try again, go for it. Right now he has too much on his shoulders and you need to give him some space.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	We cannot "fix" other people.<br>  We can try to be supportive and helpful; but ultimately we are not responsible for other people...we are responsible about our lives only.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like your ex-boyfriend is either depressed or manipulative. IF he is depressed, he should visit his doctor and also go to therapy, so he can get professional help.<br>  <br>  If he is saying he is depressed just to make you feel bad so you won't end things, then he is manipulative...and you should run away.<br>  <br>  I'd say talk to him and tell him to look for help. Either way, he needs it.<br>  And don't be there for him, either. Being "friends" after being a couple is never a good idea.<br>  Good luck.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Tell him that you both need time apart so you both can heal. He needs to get treatment for his depression first. Tell him that he can call you AFTER he gets help because you can't deal with his controlling nature<br>  <br>  And if you do decide to give him another chance in a few months, as soon as you see the old behavior starting again, get out immediately. It means he hasn't changed and never will.<br>  <br>  Stay strong and give him the space he needs to get help. He's never going to do it while you are around. By showing you are serious about breaking it off, it may make him really get help rather than just talking about it.|`|elhcuN19aa	this is how is broke up with my gf......<br>  I told her that she was taking me for granted which she was and that she thought that I would always be around like her lap dog....<br>  I told her after that that I was done and loook on her face was like "wow"<br>  But then I caught her cheating but you have to state your reason for leaving then do it....<br>  But 1st have that heart to heart to see if you can save the relationship and work on it but if not then poof it is done lol|`|naequcqlaa	By him "fixing" his depression, is going to make HIM feel better, BUT it's not going to bring the love back again that you once felt for him.  If he does go on meds., then that WILL help him be able to "get over you" better at least & help give him an all around better outlook on life.  I do know that depression meds. DO help as I'm on them, but it's NOT going to suddenly make your feelings change twds. him.  You've made up your mind you no longer wish to be involved w/him, & you DO need to feel happiness yourself.  You are totally NOT being a bit selfish in these feelings.  You haven't gone out for that long a period of time, so it's not like you've been together for yrs.  KNOW that he WILL get over you in time & at least had a medication that in fact w/aid him w/this.  You do deserve happiness w/whomever you choose.  You've told him you want to be "friends", so I would NOT consider that being a form of "cheating" on him.  Let him know you'd be available for a means of support IF he would/should need you, but you just do not feel the same way in your relationship w/him as you did before.  Let him know it has nothing to do w/him, but you feel the need to have some freedom in your life at this point in time.  You do not want to have a one on one relationship w/anyone person at this moment.  You have NO reason to feel any guilt over what you're doing.  So, please do NOT put yourself thru this needless way of feeling.  You also could say you'd be glad for a call from him from time to time just to say hi & see how he's doing.  But kind of put emphasis on the word call, as apposed to stopping by or even seeing him.  I feel in time if you do start to distance yourself from him, he'll be fine in time.  But don't take on any guilt trips that are totally unnecessary.  I'm a firm believer in that things do happen for reasons.  You do need the opportunity to find someone who you CAN find happiness with, & you DO deserve it too.  Just move forward w/your life & see where it leads you.  I DO wish you happiness...:)|`|N0Ji8xFvaa	If you really don't want to try it you shouldn't have to.<br>  Of course, it'll hurt but he'll eventually move on.<br>  Just do what you need to do to make yourself happy.<br>  Your happiness is key to everything.|`|iSXzXfqraa	It's only been 4 months, you don't really owe him anything.  No need to feel guilty,  he was the one being a jerk..|`|gRXy66dOaa	either sit with him and talk to him<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>   just dump him,, good chance that he prob lost interest in you|`|XCX8w4LMaa	i think u should just have a talk with him about it. either that or just end it now.<br>  hope this helps! =)|`|0PdYYeBFaa	But you said to him you can start off as friends and you both agreed to that. So really you both are not in a relationship.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do now is just see how things go whilst he undergoes treatment for depression. As you stated you can start off friends, well being a supportive friend is what i am guessing you would do.|`|7Es1LjvHaa	Well firstly, you have to ask yourself this:<br>  <br>  Can you be in a relationship with somebody who wants different to you?? Can you reach a compromise??<br>  <br>  I have to say without being biased by any means, I do actually appreciate where he is coming from. It's easy to brand him a control freak but if you are in a team, then he's going to obviously have a big say in how you lead your life.<br>  <br>  If you are an item and are locked in a relationship, then to a degree you both have a say in each other, being fringe or fundamental, It seems to me that he suited to a certain way of how you present yourself and prefers you to present yourself in a certain way without letting yourself go.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, I myself like my females to maintain their femininity and NO, I don't welcome stubble on legs. As for the private area, if you are going to keep hair, you need to bath yourself on a daily basis and change your underwear, also have fresh breath,<br>  <br>  It's minimum expectations ladies and that's what most some blokes out there expect.<br>  <br>  As for the depression, I feel once this is treated, you should be able to both find your feet and enjoy each other's company.<br>  <br>  All the best - cheers.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	4 months and he's already showing the classic signs of an abuser? Just break up. Seriously. You have no reason to feel guilty. Nice guys state a preference for how you keep your body hair (or they keep it to themselves) - they don't insist on it. As for the tears, he's trying whatever works to keep you under his control. <br>  <br>  You don't love him, it's only been 4 months of dating. You just end it. No false hope ('Maybe we can try again one day' - NO!) and no reason for you to feel guilty at all.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	If it were me I would let him go. Only 4 months and this much drama? No way. I deserve better. I'm sure you do too. Don't let it excuse of depression keep you tied to him. He needs to go off and fix himself. Let him know you are friends and would be willing to help but for now you are going to look for love somewhere else if it happens. Guilt is in your own head. Don't feel guilty for wanting the best life for yourself. Don't feel guilty for not wanting to hold the hand of some nutty guy. It is not your responsibility to stay with him. He has other friends and family to help him. He just wants you around so he can get laid occasionally.
MzEIoozyaa	1. They flirt with EVERYONE!<br>  2. Take pictures of themselves and think its hot.<br>  3. Dresses in short skirts and low tops<br>  4. Hug every guy there is<br>  5.

I your friend wants to be like this or w/e i suggest she always uses a condom. Keep it safe kids.
718HjVbaaa	Okay, first things first, just because of what he did, it doesn't mean you guys won't have a chance together. But, I have to say, he seems really into your friend. I would drop him, I don't think he's worth your time.|`|hpHaofpnaa	Just keep being a good friend, he'll realize what he's missing and fall for you head over heels eventually. Hang tough, and good luck girl.
NbiJcMIvaa	There are lots of couples out there who break up because they never truly bond or connect, even though they think highly of one another. Since you are only 17, it doesn't surprise me that this type of bond never developed between you and your boyfriend during the time you went out together. You're just not ready to make that connection yet. Like you said, you have college to think about. There are "things to do and places to go" before you will probably be ready to fully commit to someone.<br>    As for your friend, if you just think that you may love her, then there is obviously some doubt in your mind. While same sex relationships are common in this day and age, it is still uncharted territory for a lot of people, especially when it may be the their first experience with these type of feelings. It seems like your best girl mate is trying to influence you into taking a direction that you may not be ready to explore yet.<br>     Get your immediate goals taken care of first, with your education, and gain a few more years and life experience. There is a lot of time afterward to see where life is going to take you.|`|AA10938466	You need to get with her to see if that's what you really want.|`|AA12117694	be with her|`|oY1YzPMzaa	It didnt feel right with him like u said.

Please don't try to make eiher one or both happy. Choose someone who really makes u happy. I can't say who u should be with but wat I can tell u is that u should try to do wat is best for urself and the person u think u should be with. I'm 18 year old girl and in college and my x was bi. I'm friends with him so I kind of understand wat ur going through. U shouldn't let a bunch of random people vote on who u should vote. Though it may help some might not necessarily understand the entire situation which ur trying to point out. All I can say is that whomever makes u happy and that u r comfortable with u be with that person. Don't doubt anything. Just go with whom u like or love and be with ur best mate. If that person does not want u then it is their loss really. U choose ur choices in life and the mistakes u make u will learn from them. Choose who makes u comfortable and not by how THEY see u as. It's ur life and take control in it.

n68tCJ7zaa	things to know for you first time:<br>  you probably won't orgasm<br>  it won't be the best sex of your life<br>  <br>  that being said, on your wedding night, you should be thinking about how much you love each other and how this is the most intimate thing you can do with another person. make the moment about love, and not really about "feeling good"<br>  <br>  also, since you are both new at it, you will share the same insecurities, so don't feel ashamed or embarrassed. also remember that you have natural instincts about sex that you might not know about right now. things will work exactly how their supposed to, so just go with the moment and make it the most romantic time of your life!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|4POGapREaa	That's no big deal.  I'm 5'5" and two of my exes are 6'5".  My husband now is only a few inches taller than me & sex is just the same as it is with a taller guy.  The only thing is that he's probably proportionate to his height so his dingaling might be big too LOL!  But no worries, you'll be fine.  It's best not to over analyze something that hasn't even happened yet.  I know that's easy for me to say because I'm not a virgin but take it from someone with experience.  It's nothing to stress over.  Sex is typically not all that great at first unless you're with someone really experienced, and then it gets better the more you get in your groove with it.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	You will both be lying down so it will not matter, he can position himself just fine, or you can be on top.

Actually I can't think of any that will. But since it's your first time be sure to start with lots of foreplay and it's more comfortable with him on top at first.<br>  <br>  p.s. I noticed tall guys are usually very well endowed, so be sure to tell him to go slow and don't rush anything. You need to be comfortable and relaxed, and you guys should communicate your thoughts about sex before the wedding|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	Believe me, the height differences aren't noticeable when laying down.  I'm 5'2, and my husband is 6'.   :)<br>  <br>  Just remember to talk things through....if something your fiance does doesn't "work" for you, make sure you tell him.  Sex gets better with open communication.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congratulations!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Just let the moment happen there is nothing to worry about and height doesn't make a difference the moment will be special so don't try to play it out so much. Have a great time and congrats on getting married.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	Once you're lying down, the height won't make a difference.  Just relax and give yourself into it.|`|NGN2xt5naa	dont worry it wont be a big problem...just go along with watever happens, and  you to will have a great time...
X55EHXeVaa	This happened to me nd my husband for a period, i don't rreally know how we snapped out of it, every conversation seems to start off an at<br>  argument, usually theres some unresolved issues simmering beneath the surface and one of yu is itching for a fight. My advice is either see a counsellor and get it all out in the open if you can deal with the consequences or compromise-accept that you cannot control each other and that you have to at times agree to disagree and compromise. Good luck with it!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Wow, if you've only been together for 6 months and the arguments are already out of control, why are you even still together? The first year of a relationship is supposed to be happy and fun. If you have both tried not to argue but can't stick to it, there is obviously something fundamentally wrong with the relationship and you probably shouldn't have stayed together this long.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	If you can't communicate well then maybe you are not meant to be with each other. Why force it just because you have a history? That history is only 6 months. Not like you've been together 6 years and have a kid together. Know when you cut your losses and move on. It could be best for both of you. <br>  <br>  If you want to know how to stop arguing just stop. It takes 2 to argue and if you are always fighting back then the fights will continue. Stop being a right fighter. Stop trying to make your point or defend your point or explain yourself. Next time he starts to push your buttons just remind yourself that you are in control of you. You will not allow him to take control and make you angry. When you get angry and argue back then you have lost control of yourself.|`|djUMvICoaa	You can argue until you can't stand to look at each other, then what are you basing this thing you call love?  There is no place in love where you argue like that, that is called hate, you have a love hate relationship.  And you are doing this over nothing.  What is going to happen when you have major decisions to make and the only thing that you guys can do is fight and not look at each other?  You have to learn not to be so right all the time, how much did it matter about the last thing you fought about?  Learn the differences between the battles and the war.  You can lose all kinds of small battles but if you win the war that is the important thing.  You guys are fighting battles and haven't come close to a war yet.  Learn to distinguish the difference between the two.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	You can't prevent it. You can improve your ways of communication. Stop acting like kids (holding into each gun) and start to listen to each other, understand and show empathy when you two talk to each other.
7WomqDuEaa	from what you've written, it seems like this girl is lying to you.<br>  i mean one day she says she's lost the note & the next day she has it? Red Flag right there if you ask me. good luck.|`|BE7woa7Waa	well if ur ex said he didnt write it and u trust him then she should be lying hes not the only person who has that kind of handwriting
oOD3dYaNaa	It sounds like she might be interested, but I would suggest talking to her to fully understand what she means.<br>  <br>  Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. =]|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	from reading that, I think you're reading wayy too much into it. But sometimes there's just that feeling or gut instict that isn't really translatable into a yahoo answers question. It could mean she's started noticing you more. Start talking to her, see if anything comes of it.|`|0oSAY54Laa	i think that she is getting interested in you! you should talk to her online or something because than she can get to know you and you can get to know her!! go for it and see what happenes! i think that you should talk to her so its less weird!!|`|0ktcvglRaa	It sounds like you're just reading too much into this, but I could be wrong. You never know! Try talking to her.|`|gO9tl2uhaa	Yeah, you're getting signals that aren't there. <br>  <br>  She OBVIOUSLY noticed that you were staring at her. She probably is wondering why in hell you're staring. You're reading too much into it. PLUS, you've never talked to her before. If you did, it would be A BIT more plausible. But so far, you're probably coming off as stalker-ish boy.<br>  <br>  Stop looking at her, and go talk to her. If you wuss out, you'll just make things worse. Trust me, even if it's a stupid conversation, you're better off than the guy who stares at her all the time. MUCH BETTER off.<br>  <br>  NOTHING, in reality, is like a lovestory. It only happens in books and chick flicks. You ought to make you're own lovestory and it's not by staring at a girl that you'll get somewhere.|`|pEZr6MBHaa	You're reading WAY to much into this.  It's probably nothing.  But if you really like her, ask her to hang out.  If she doesn't like you, she'll say no, or some variation of "I'm really busy."  If she does like you, she'll want to hang out.  Case closed.<br>  <br>  You can keep admiring her from afar -- but you can't win if you're not even in the game.|`|8idurg0Daa	Awww shes firlting. Maybe she does like you,too. If you like her ask her out.|`|AA12117694	It is hard to say...could be anything..just go up and talk to her|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	yeah she likes you
dmPhQWp3aa	They're adorable together, but they're not dating.  Ashley has said in an interview that they both really like each other, but their lives are too hectic right now.  And she was seen at the 100 Monkeys concert in Vancouver on April 14th with the actor, Ian Somerhalder.
J2ViBwcSaa	Tell her exactly that. Suggestion- " Uh hey, i know we haven't talked much but im sorry for being a total jerk to you. i was hoping maybe we could get together for lunch or something and talk. Let me know."  Write it in a note and leave it in her locker if its easier. Good Luck!!!! :D|`|GtFp6Ga9aa	Hello, everyone wants to find the ideal match, I am of the opinion the greatest way to find the girl or man of your dreams is to look online here <a href="http://falehers.wrightus.com" rel="nofollow">http://falehers.wrightus.com</a> I've been using them for four weeks to date and already I have a sexy girlfriend. It's free of charge and you do not require a credit card, why not give it a try?
AA11963762	Find your own girlfriend.  If she is cheating on him with you ,she will cheat on you with someone else.  <br>  From my evil side tell your girlfriend to tell her boyfriend that she was hanging out with an old friend that the family didn't approve of, and that she lied and said she went out with him to save an argument.|`|AA12276144	How much I hate helping people get away with this kind of mess. First you knew that this is engaged to another guy like you and still you chose to go out with her. And she too knew she is engaged to another man and chose to go out with you. But for the sake of this guy in question I will suggest something that might work. let the girl fall sick. You ask how? Let her pretend that she is very sick and call the guy on the phone. The idea is that the guy will show up before Sunday, when he comes the grandma will be busy telling him how sick the girl have been, she will not have time to start asking him why he didn't come in the other day.  If you think this won't work, let the girl do something that will make the grandma scold her,let her leave the grandma' place pretending to be angry. The idea? The fiance's  visit with his family will not hold. Good luck and don't let this happen next time.|`|AA12277219	next time be more careful.contact the guy and tell him the story|`|AA12308985	Dear friend this life is not cheap to waste or make it complex.<br>  I Guess you are in teens. Please be capable of taking responsibilty before doing all this stuff.|`|AA12349872	why did she go with you at first place?you need to find your own woman pleazea!
AA12051158	i am paralysed|`|AA12078524	If I was the sweetheart, I'd kick your butt right down the street. Then I'd come back and do the same to her|`|AA10373401	My female friends used to kiss me in fron t of my Ex all the time.  she didn't care, for she new i loved only her and no one else.|`|50208308cdd30c3e8d6db616b40a51a6aa	that's horrible....how dare a guy would allow sum1 to kiss him infront of his gurl....duh!|`|AA11872492	bit*h|`|AA12342184	eh, it happens.|`|AA11207417	i guess she does it either to tease your sweetheart or just for fun.<br>  <br>  my friend always sits beside my fiance wherever we go,  shares the dessert she orders with him using her own fork. my fiance calls her a b--ch but she thinks she is adorable, cool and hot!|`|AA12190642	brave!|`|a90902d4de5109d24552adc887d676c6aa	nice... BIG trouble is on your way...
cc0b57293d75d0ce4a6af843b398f5f0aa	Do what guys have been doing for years, play it cool and act like hes the last thing on your mind.  If your the one calling him, slow way down if not stop, and see if he really wants to talk to you.  You will find out one way or the other, how he is really thinking.|`|AA12277219	II think a little bit before I take a decision|`|e916a1184972ee28115ec57c9d528015aa	He's juggling a few dates!
AA12265707	God and my parents.. I wish I could say my husband but i don't feel his support, he's a great friend to others but to me it's the opposite.|`|AA12129932	my gf|`|AA10064223	My boyfriend. he's always there when I need him. I can not tell the same of my family (including grandmother, aunts, cousins).<br>  Mother and father are just there, not helping too much.
AA12330638	Not all girls are bi-curious.  I am not and its not just because i think it would ruin my relationship.  Its because i have no interest in it what so ever....and yes i would consider it cheating....if you two are together and you dont want her seeing the other women then she is cheating...|`|AA11189225	You're thoughts are the way you feel and you're entitled to them tell her you don't feel comfortable sharing her with other people and would like to keep you're relationship exclusive if she refuses then maybe you should look for love elsewhere Good Luck Best Wishes;)|`|AA10668293	yes that would be cheating|`|AA11760175	my thoughts is that all women are bi-courious but a lot of them never act on it because it could really complcate a relationship if you mess with the wrong person (cant tell you who they are) in a way it is cheating but some people wouldnt think so they would say that you are lucky but why not tell her how it makes you feel|`|AA11895453	I think your best bet would be to experience with her...just be with her while she is with the other women. I am guessing it would be a turn on for you and if you're lucky they might let you join in!! If you aren't okay with it then yes I would consider it cheating but if you know and tell her you don't mind her doing it then no. Good luck and maybe that threesome might work for ya :)
AA11074814	See the question up above yours...repo'd.|`|AA10682090	I parked it in tuna town.|`|AA11944963	in the garage|`|AA11963633	i don't know but when you find it , can i put my bike in your trunk ;)|`|AA12058726	Hopefully parked at the beach while you're catching some waves, Chica!<br>  <br>  Aloha!|`|c3e0ffacfbfcc792616cbdbc87768d1daa	It's in my neighbor's garage for some reason.

205b1aad55a7b9ae60e2325a0a4b3b45aa	if a woman is thinking 5% about sex then i am sorry to say he isnt doing his job and another reason is alot of boys are just pigs but a few men really care about how a woman feels like myself i think every man should read men r from mars woman from venis its the bible in a realationship|`|AA11943241	Because we are more emotional and loving beings and we are the nurtures and the ones who care for and tend to the home. Men are sexual beings with usually one thing on the brain like sex or work. Maybe you should talk to a doctor and ask them why. By the way it is more then just sex to us we like to make love and be made love to and we love romance. Men like sex and it is more mechanical to them and is a need. They usually dont associate sex with love but we do. Sex is a release for men too!|`|AA10373401	Same way men think 0% about shopping, especially with women.|`|AA10200794	It's a guy thing !!!!|`|AA12129644	cause you dont have to spend 100% of your time raising the babies after the sex|`|AA12228859	Cause half of you dont know what youre doing so we rather not think about it.|`|AA12254128	Well all i know is that i spend more than 5% of my time it is like i spend 95% of my time thinking about sex. I love to have sex. I guess it all depends on females how they see there sex life. I just know my sex is good and i cant stop thinking about it|`|AA12260656	I am a woman and I spend way more than 5% of my time thinking about it and way more doing it, so it is not every woman.  I don't think you are accurate.|`|AA12377976	Man !!! better spend yr time having sex that thinking oh sex...Think about it
AA12241275	love is all good, but, for a relationship to work you need common goals and interests, good communication skills, and be able to work through problems. it sounds as if there may be problems that love isn't enough to compensate for. both people have to work at the relationship stuff that isnt working and if both arent committed then there will be more problems and pretty soon the loving wont be enough and being together will be painful.|`|AA12256785	I know exactly what you mean.I think that two people can have so much love, so much attraction, and so much connection but get nowhere in a relationship because they get intimidated by these factors they carry for eachother.I think you two may find it hard to make an intimate move because you get shy,thinking way too high of the other person, causing to think lower of yourself.You may feel you don't measure up therefore this intimidation may get in the way of a beautiful relationship.My advice is to be friends for a while, nothing intimate strictly friends mode, and when you guys get more and more confortable with eachother, you can take it up a notch.Its probably the right person but wrong timing, so you guys should wait for the right time.You will know when it comes..Good Luck|`|AA11485062	so just leave it.|`|AA12244362	you need more than love to make a relationship work!  Maybe your love for eachother should be used to build a great friendship.|`|AA12244527	If you're not getting anywhere then you two need to let each other go.Two people who love each other makes things work out no matter what|`|AA12256975	yea its happened to me its real hard too and when u love somebody so much that the relationship is not working out then u need to see other ppl before its too late and one of u do somthing u will regret|`|AA11865790	Why did you guys broke up in the first place?  Things can work out only if y′all feel they can be worked out.  If it was a cheating or lying thing, I really wouldn′t feel comfortable.  But if it′s something silly, then I would really try to make it work.
AA12063527	I'm in a fantastic relationship!  We are so in love!  I feel so blessed to wake up next to him each morning.  I can't wait to get home from work to see him at night.  And I adore the late night conversations while falling asleep.  I wouldn't trade this for anything in the world.  I just hope that everyone has the opportunity to be this in love at least once in their lives.|`|AA11330170	ok i am not married or anything but for you ppl..... you should realize that your husbands are the one you chose to spend the rest of your life with. And the thing is they made the same choice..... which they wouldn't have made if they didn't love you.Agreed?He loves you and that's why you guys are together even now.If you're sick wouldn't he be there for you?When he holds you don't you feel safe and happy?Just remember that you guys aren't "two"anymore but, "ONE" and that right there means alot. It means that without him you are not and without you he is not...Get my drift?????|`|AA11472665	my husband is a great husband he works hard to provide for his family he is a wonderful father and a loving husband, he always puts us first and never complains when we have to spend our last dollar on our daughter, He is great!|`|AA11779750	s|`|AA11877654	My man is my water, and without him i am dryland. i love everything about him.

A wholesome loving home and a Step dad who thinks the world of them. All the negativity I had to experience in my life has made me appreciate the great catch we have found! Don't think of bad relationships as the end of all time. There is a reason for people having to go thru them. I wont let this one slip away because I know what we have, and I know what I have had!!!|`|AA12053465	My girlfriend regularly responds to me saying 'I love you' with "I love your omeletes!" Every time she says it I giggle like a little boy. It is just so cute! Plus, it's nice to know that I can cook well!|`|AA12108812	It seems like marriages are labeled in today's society as not lasting long... It's like everyone expects marriages to fail because it's so common.. U JUST HAVE TO HAVE, COMMUNICATION, TRUST, LOVE HONESTY AND YOUR'E OFF TO A GOOD START .. Also, a lot of people tend to involve others in their business alot which also causes problems.. I STILL BELEIVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY TALE HAPPILY EVER AFTER MARRIAGE..<br>  marriage is what the two of you make it... <br>  <br>  I''m happy that your'e happy and wish you and yours many more years of happiness together...|`|AA12175970	I have loved mine since the first day we spent together.

And he's great in bed!!!!|`|AA11781280	I love my sweetheart!! I've been with him for 8 1/2 months now. There's been rough times, but its all worth it. When there are things people don't like about relationships- they get to realize that complaining doesn't do anything, they get to get off their butt and put some effort into making it different~!|`|AA11983930	my boyfriend is the love of my life. he is sweet, funny, respectful,smart,fun, handsome......the list goes on. but his best trait is his ability to know how i' feeling just by looking at me. and he is wonderful with my 2 children-they asore him, as do i.  he is an old flame from high school who i happened to run into after my divorce-fate? as for my ex husband he is still and hopefully always will be one of my best friends.|`|AA12142825	I absolutely love the one I'm with!  We've been through some hard times, but our relationship grows stronger every day.  He's in the military, so I don't get to see him as much as I'd like to.  I miss him soooo much when he's gone!  He's my Best Friend.  I'd be incomplete without him.  Being married is AWESOME!  When he's away I email him as much as possible, and when he's here, I can't keep my eyes off of him.  Just to lay next to him at night, and watch him while he's sleeping.. and to hear his heart beat..it's wonderful!  I couldn't be any happier.  They say that twins share a special bond.  I believe that the bond we share is special like that.  He knows me better then anyone, and I know him better then anyone.  I couldn't ask for a better husband!  He's so sweet.  He would do anything to make me happy, and I know that when we have children, he will be a great father.  He loves me no matter what.  I'm mean to him sometimes, but he still loves me.   We cry together and laugh together.  I can't wait until I can see him again!  I could write a million page essay on how much I love him.  But I'll quit while I'm ahead.. :).  Yeah, I DEFINENTLY love the one I'm with!  Truly!|`|ac9e1e8af4652c319c0feee85adf1adbaa	i never imagined i could be this happily married!<br>  <br>  my parents divorced when i was 4, so i never saw how a happy marriage was supposed to work growing up.  but i seem to have figured it out somehow, cuz i'm the happiest i've ever been!|`|dc5484643e47ea1265878c41004c116aaa	my boyfriend has a great sense of humor & makes me laugh this is very important to me, he also never loses his temper|`|f6b5bcb6f2792b9ce4d1542aa2b7bb7caa	I must say that my wife is a wonderful woman.<br>  She is constantly pushing me to be the best I can be--the best that she sees in me that I don't always see in myself.<br>  She is a great mother, watching her play with our son always brightens my day.  <br>  I wouldn't be a good husband or father at all if I didn't have a great wife.<br>  <br>  PS.  I am aprilsastar's husband ;)|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I love my husband because he listens to my complaining, he adores our son and plays with him, he always helps when I ask.  He's so cute when he worries about taking care of his family and bringing in enough money for us to live comfortably.  I also love my husband when he talks with my younger brother and sister.  He's patient with them too and with play video games with them.  Oh, and he's also HOT!!!!
dad4e36ef68809356501987b9785c4baaa	well if you want to talk to someone or you have taken a liken to her.. do an awful lot of talking and then maybe meet for lunch. she may not be the type you are looking for after all, but then again she maybe... but that line of communication is a must... <br>  if you don't have communication .. YOU HAVE NOTHING!|`|AA10701806	well this certainly is not the place! but i don't think its a good idea to expect a long lasting relationship throught the internet or meeting a lady on the internet, the best place to go is to a club or bar, something like that! Good Luck!
AA10701806	how about she gives u a punch in the face!! why r u requesting what she should give to u! it doesn't matter, its the thought that counts, even if she ends up only giving u a kiss on the cheek, cuz thats about all u deserve, judging from this question!|`|AA11001596	Happy belated birthday. :)<br>  <br>  Your girlfriend should have already done something nice for you, but if she hasn't, I suggest she takes you to your favourite restaurant and buys you your favourite dinner, then you go on to see a decent film at the cinema, or get a DVD. :)
AA11756482	You should feel flattered, but still you must be even more cautious. If you are beautiful and physically appealing, EVERYONE is gonna want you. So, you have to be careful and very choosy. Engage a trusted adult or friend in this if you like. Remember, you have the final decision. You could probably have whoever you wanted, so don't settle for less. Guys will always notice a woman's chest size, but it's the guys that notice what's behind it all, her heart, that are the real angels.|`|AA11280525	Tottly,guys should like you for whats inside,not whats on the outside,i know it sounds kinda corny but its so the truth,i would dump any guy who did that becaese he only wants to have *ex with you!|`|AA12228222	yeah it is, it shows that all they want from u is sex... assholes.|`|36dabcf2d02a7a5b5cddd098b5d28929aa	It's natural for guys....shallow guys that is!  Don't give in to that, they should like you for more than your body.|`|AA11071489	I'm a guy, but you can't just have a girls perspective.<br>  <br>  I would say yes it is. you will attract a sex crazed, unfaithful, not very loving, non-gentle pervert who will dump you for a girl with a larger chest.<br>  <br>  You may get lucky, but I sort of doubt it.|`|AA12041673	no|`|bf09056b11ad165ddbb41a4058e8411daa	yes i have a big chest and i also think guys are just wanting to hook up with me so we can have sex and then they just leave me that IS SO WRONG I HATE THAT THEY SHOULD LOVE U FOR WHO U ARE NOT JUST BECAUSE U HAVE A NICE BODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As hard as it may seem, he should try to let it go.<br>  He has been blessed with a little boy who needs him now more than ever and he should attempt to focus his attention on that.<br>  Hopefully, he will find a much better woman who will cherish him and his son and treat them the way they deserve.<br>  As far as "teaching the bad guy a lesson", I think it's a bad plan.  Someone else said, "Live and let live."  I think they're right.  Karma will come back around on them and if the "bad guy" really does have a bunch of other women....you're friend's wife will probably get a taste of her own medicine soon enough.  Then you'll be posting a question about whether or not he should take her back.<br>  Good luck to your friend....and his son.|`|AA12396659	thats right live n let live

AA12275978	The declared a holiday last sunday. I thought it was for a better. Well, at fiorst glance it seemed nothing much had changed. Except perhaps for the category listing, well, there added and amended some. Like the LOVE & ROMANCE. I was happy that they placed such category for easier reference. But now its gone again.

AA12008022	I'm not sure what psychologist proposed this, but they compared human sexuality to some sort of bell curve.  Most people are not solely interested in only one sex.  <br>  <br>  You have said that visually you can appreciate women's forms.  Maybe that is just one area where you lie closer to the other end of the sexuality curve.  Nothing wrong with that, and it may or may not make you bisexual.  Looking at women and appreciating hanging out with them does not make you bisexual... being sexually turned on and attracted to women (and men) is.  <br>  <br>  How does your boyfriend feel about this?  Does it bother him?  Are you totally ok with your intimate life, or do you feel like it's missing something?  <br>  <br>  If you are open to exploring things with another woman, go for it.  Make sure you current boyfriend is ok with it, or this could damage your relationship.  Also be careful and honest with any women you may explore with--  If she is strictly a lesbian, she may have some real issues with you still being really attracted to men.  Also, it can be hard to explore/ test the waters without too many emotions involved, so be careful!<br>  <br>  Good luck-- we are all made the way we are, go with what feels right to you!|`|AA11899313	Until Freud came along, there was no such thing or animal as 'Normal,' there was only 'what people did with people.' Only with the advent of Freud and his labels did people start to think of themselves in terms of these labels, and not wanting to be thought badly of, the people modified their outer behaviours. <br>  <br>  In my adolescence, I had raging hormones and their results that scared the hell out of me, but I couldn't talk to anyone about any of it. I had no idea if it was 'normal,' and was afraid that it wasn't. So I stayed dumb.<br>  <br>  To achieve a 'normal' score, you have to apply mathematical scores, and to achieve this you need to have the Abnormal High and Abnormal Low, with Normal somewhere in the middle. BUT, to achieve this you also need a cross section of the population for the results, and to achieve this you also need to have 'Abnormals;' it gives the 'Normal' results a validation.<br>  <br>  The point is, that these are only 'numbers,' the Labels are there to help with the math when talking about them.<br>  <br>  Labels are DANGEROUS things: What's written on them is subjective, biased and prejudiced to both the writer and the reader.<br>  (I speak in broad sweeping terms there, by the way.)<br>  <br>  Just go with your desires (taking precautions where necessary, of course) and curiosities.<br>  <br>  Regards.<br>  Sash.|`|AA12256862	I think you're fine I check out other girls all the time but more in a sense that I wanna compare myself to her like...."oh I look better than her" or "She blows me out the water!" or even to say another girl has nice hair, breasts, a$$ or legs. I know where other girls do this as well. Don't worry about it.|`|AA11385266	you may justy be curious about it, just to try it out once. but if you are happy with you bf friend wait to try out any relationship until you are ready. it maybe that u just want a taste of forbiden pastures , but it is normal for all grils to think about this. it means you are just wondering and trying to find whats for you. I think its a good idea to keep this to yourself until you are sure about what you want... good luck darlin' i hope this helped a little bit|`|AA11616906	its normal, look but dont touch|`|AA12273960	alot of girls do that comparing themselves to others in a i wish that i looked like that way or a i look better than that way!its totally normal unless you wanna french them or grab them there is nothing wrong with it|`|fc5e8dbb0c8aebb2153e594da7da5e82aa	Trust me, a lot of girls do that...It's normal.|`|77c87c1612dace91205200cb1e6ad3bcaa	Its perfectly normal to feel this way . So go find a girl and have some excitement. !!|`|868d50855a76cc3e5b6d36313c8d2ccdaa	I think was your going through is normal.  Alot of girls can be curious or fond of other girls.  Its not a sin to check girls out or admire how they look.  That doesnt mean your bisexual.  How is your relationship with your boyfriend? If there are problems you could just be in need of girl time and thats all it might be.|`|9afed5bd8f8ec81bf0d2122f121d99ecaa	uhh... I dunno. You have a boyfriend. I had a stage where I thought I was bi too, but I realized I could never get emotionally attatched to another girl that way. You might just be curious or bored with guys. Doesn't matter as long as you still like guys while you're dating your boyfriend. If you stop dating, you could fool around to check.|`|AA10244558	The answer to both your questions is yes.  Yes, you are bi-sexual (or at least bi-curious) and yes it's normal.  Experimentation like this happens quite a bit.  Moreso with women usually.  Men tend to be more polarized in their sexuality, more either/or, while women tend to fall more in the middle of the Kinsey scale.  <br>  <br>  -Note to guys: this does not mean all straight women are secretly bisexual, (the percentage is somewhere around 20-25%, and most of those fall in the 'curious' category) it's just quite a bit more than men.<br>  <br>  As for your particular situation, you owe it to your boyfriend to explain it to him, especially if you're intending to explore this side of you further.  Not telling him and then going on the internet to hunt for chicks would be cheating on him just as if it were a guy.  Now, if you tell him and he's fine with it (and chances are he will be if he thinks he's going to get a threesome out of it; whether that's something you're into or not you should make clear to him) you can feel free to pursue a fling.<br>  <br>  Also, if you do decide to have a threesome, bear in mind there's a 50-50 chance it will screw up your relationship somehow.  And whatever you do, don't do it with someone you know, because then that relationship could get screwed up too.|`|AA11217560	ALOT OF WOMEN DO IT...ITS NORMAL JUS GO TO A STRIP CLUB AND WATCH PRETTY LADIES..NOW IF U GET EXCITED.....WELL THEN THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION......|`|AA11723114	Well honestly I would say it is nnot normal. God made Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. Men are supposed to be with women and women with men but I am not going to tell you how to live your life. Sorry if i offended u|`|AA12285725	Its completely normal. There are alot of girls these days that are bi-curious. Just live your life like any other, because your not different because of your attraction to the "ladies" also. Let your b'f know about the situation if you want to tell him. If not, I wouldnt worry about it. As for your friends, it is your choice whether or not you really want them to know. Good Luck and wish you the best if you decide to tell your b'f and friends.|`|AA10626091	I was like you. But I had dabbled with fondling at a young age. At 16 I got myself a girlfriend, had crazy sex with her, and LOVED IT! Then I had some threesomes, and that was fun too. I find that I really enjoy being with females over males now. I just LOVE the taste of a womans juices in my mouth...way better than having a mans "nut" in your mouth. Gross, like snot. lol I'm now 31 and I'm glad I tried it. You should go for it sweetie.|`|AA11541259	the only way to know if you are bi-sexual is to have sex with another woman and then get it confirmed that you like it. i am willing to watch you have sex and tell you if you liked it.|`|AA11720041	girl this is so normal i have the same proublem!|`|AA12088287	yeah, you're a bi sexual, it's not normal for a girl like u to be attracted to other girls, and it's not normal to always look at other girls' legs...|`|AA12105815	You are bi|`|AA12184976	you may be bi or u just like to see nice legs and nice chest.|`|AA12204975	i think it's normal|`|AA12243155	Well guess what? They will know now if they can come here. But, if you want a relationship, or thinking about it, with a girl, you have to go with where your heart tell you to go. If it tell you to go to the man side, and stay with your boyfriend, or does it tell you to go to the girl side, and get a girl friend. Two girls having a sexually relationship is ok with me, but both girls have to like each other very well. I, personally, I love to watch to girls have sex.|`|a94881097ef5b5b5144fb9b6ecd3fd70aa	bi

So maybe he couldn't handle it not talking to and being with you....!!!<br>  <br>  But that said, if he doesn't want to mend things then maybe you are better off, afterall you also had to deal with not seeing him and being alone...|`|0a0950b6c44ee9dfe84ab2301ae67bc2aa	Don't confuse much about that. You are old enough to decide what is right or wrong. Before saying goodbye with you I think he thought over and gae the final decision although it hurts you. First of all, you should finalize the reason why he decided like this. The only one who you can aks and answer your question is him. Don't put yourself hover about messy questions. Hope you feel better soon.|`|228f9b7be47050c971997cf0868b41e8aa	Does the reason matter?  He is not treating you special as you deserve...why chase him??
