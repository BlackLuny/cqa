I had my period 3 days early. Needless to say, I had sex 17 days after I took the ring out which would be 16 days after the start of my period. This is when I realized I had totally forgotten about putting that stupid thing back in! Dos anyone take the ring? Do you know if it lasts in your system at least a month so I can feel safe?

I get my blood work soon to check hcg levels. My pregnancy symptoms continue so I want to check if I'm still pregnant.. Could the bleeding have caused my hcg levels to be low and have a negative test, and when can I figure them to be high enough to take a home pregnancy test?      thanks

Now that the worst of his cold is over, he seems to wake every night at the same times and cry until one of us goes in and picks him up.   When we go into the room his eyes are closed but he's crying. the minute we pick him up he stops and falls back asleep.   We refuse to use the cry it out method on him, but its becoming a pain to get up 3 or more times a night, bring him into our room and let him fall asleep on our chest while yahoo answering at the early hrs in the morning.    I guess what my question is, is there any helpful tips to crack the habit or is think just a fase that he will grow out of.      Thanks

20090308031005AA9HGxr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Do you consider this ethical?	Situation:  A mother brings her baby to the hospital, it is a life or death situation. The hospital refuses to provide her child with medical care because the mother has no insurance and cannot pay for treatment. The hospital has a contract with an adoption agency such that if the mother surrender her baby, the agency will pay for the medical care.      So the mother has a choice: let her child die or surrender her baby for adoption. The baby recovers and goes for adoption, earning what supposedly is a profit for the agency (my guess is, at least twice what the medical treatment cost, and possibly more).      Do you consider this to be ethical?  Or is it extortion?       (Yes, this was a real-life situation. And it was a "Christian" agency.)      (Yes, am reposting this question in simplified format.)

I never had sex, but I did come in contact with some sperm last week, but I don't believe it went inside of me? A couple days later I started getting pregnancy symptoms. Bad cramps, extreme fatigue, back pain, my feet hurt, headaches, morning sickness. It's only been a week, but I'm very scared. It's too early to take a pregnancy test. I can't tell my mother, as she is very religious, and I can't tell the guy either, he won't believe me since we didn't have sex. I told my best friend, but I don't really have anyone else to talk to and I don't know what to do. I can't go to the clinic by myself either, I'm not ready to be a mom, and I don't know what I will do if I am pregnant. But I just don't see how it's even possible. Help me.

My Dr. said that my contractions aren't strong enough to do anything but since i'm dilating i'm pretty sure they are. I am contracting every 1 1/2 to 2 mins. and they are extremely uncomfortable, not quite painful but either were my mom's or grandmother's. i went to the hospital and stay the past 2 nights and they sent me home to "walk it out", they also said that i should go back when the contractions are so strong that i can barely stand it or if my water breaks, but i heard that not many women have there water break on there own. Is there anyway to make my contractions stronger or break my water? I haven't slept in days and i'm so afraid that my body is like stuck or something, but the baby wants out and he'll hurt himself.

20090227130509AAPDiP6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Labour Stopping and Starting? Why wont they do anything?	I went into premature labour at 34 wks on Monday and was given patches to stop the contractions so they could give me steriod injections to mature baby's lungs. Anyway, they managed to stop labour and I was eventually sent home but the following day contractions started again, they said they wouldnt try to stop it this time as baby had had the injections but eventually the contractions tailed off and again was sent home. I have been told now that I have to come back if they start again but they wont so anything to make the baby come just leave me to potentially stop/start labour all the time. I feel this is odd as surely it cant be good or normal to keep contracting but nothing happening. I am worried the baby could be harmed through this or that I will be too exhausted to actually deliver after being on/off in labour all the time.

20090307165618AAZlBBm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I expect a call or visit from Child Services?? I'm feeling soooo guilty?	So I get migraines occasionally, usually in the middle of the night. I keep all pills out of reach all the time. Well..last night I had a migraine and took my Excedrin out, took some and through it in the top drawer of my nightstand. (imagine 3am groggy, and eyes half open)       Well this morning we went about our normal routine. I had laundry in the living room, I was sorting it and putting it in each appropriate room, Bella was following me. Well on the last lap, she didn't follow me so I went looking for her and found she was in my room, on my bed, with the bottle of Excedrin OPEN in her lap. She was holding two pills and hitting them together. She was out of my site no more than 3 minutes. I freaked out. Called poison control, took her to the ER. Did a blood test and found out....she didn't take any. I feel like such a failure. I was sobbing in the ER, the staff was trying to reassure me and calm me down because she didn't look like she'd taken anything, no reaction that you might expect from taking pills. I am still SO upset even though she's fine. Especially because I don't leave these things where she can get them, it was a freak accident...      So other than feeling like the worst mother in the world, should I expect a call or visit from child services?

We used 2 hav  sex twice a day.  Now we hav sex a few tyms a month.  I ALWAYS get my period, but it's almost always late, 1tym it was on tym, usually 2-3 days late, once a week late & it's changed from 5 days to 3, sumtyms 4, 1 day being heavy.  That said, I've been REALLY tired for 3 weeks, most nights I've gone to bed lyk 3 AM, & hav So many thoughts in my head that it takes me an hour to fall asleep, but then I sleep until 2 PM, once I was STILL tired at that tym!  I hav a 7 year old & luckily most days my hubby puts her on the bus.  When he doesn't I get up then usually go rite to sleep until 2 PM, once I wanted to take a nap for an hour after putting her on the bus & daydreamed, then ended up falling asleep until 2 PM!  Before I started sleeping a lot, I was having cravings, which I still get sumtyms.  I've been getting naseus sumtyms & for the past 3 nites I hav been feeling movement in my stomach, tho I neva felt my dawta move when she was in my stomach, possibly due to sum meds I was on.  I also hav been REALLY starving a lot lately.  When I was pregnant with my dawta, I didn't find out until I was 3 months pregnant & I don't remember if I was still getting my period or y I woulda waited So long to test (her father's not my hubby so I can't ask him), but afta I found out I realized I had been fallin asleep early & her father's sis said I ate a lot at Thanksgivin & Xmas, b4 I tested.  I'm expectin my next period 3/15th & don't kno whether I'd b justified/should go to Planned Parenthood now, whether I should wait until afta I get my period, then wat if I STILL hav pregnancy symptoms, if I could go a 2nd tym in a month wit my insurance coverin it both tyms...I'M CONFUSED!

I'm talking both physical and mental abuse, to the point where counsellors and police were involved.  I love my brother dearly, and know he always loved this man, and wanted his approval, but hearing the baby's name just left me cold.  The baby was just born, and I've been sent photos of him with his name on it, but I know my brother will ring soon to ask what I think of the name.  What do I say?  The name is very unusual, I've only heard it once in my life, so it must be after this man.  I love my brother and don't want to hurt him, but should I tell him I hate the name?

Which my son will be tested for in 4 months.   Well if the child that a person adopts gets sick and you only have half of the medical history (the mother's medical history) but not the father's it can take a while to figure out what is wrong with the baby.

20090308003617AAqwgq3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Help! Confused, lonely (but not), head is spinning, What's going on!?	Oh my god, Im so confused right now. Im a thirteen year old girl and am going through a really wierd phase. I'm doing pretty well in school and im enjoying it and everything, Im an only child, but i have loads of friends in school but all of a sudden, I have noticed that I am feeling this wierd sense of isolation and desperate loneliness.      I'm the kind of person who's always quite interested in other peoples problems etc. not only cause by helping them you feel a sense of being a "do-gooder', but also because you can learn how other people feel about things a learn from this yourslef. I always try to be an open person and have one of my main priorities as always looking at both sides of a situation. Now, all of a sudden, its like I have all of these "issues" of my own, and its making my head spin.      Suddenly I feel like that saying "You can be in a room full of people, but still be all alone". I feel that I know myself really well, and in that sense I'm quite grounded, but now, it feels like thats ALL i have, and that no one else is there.      I've always wanted to have a best friend, someone who will always be there for me and someone who I can be really close with. I do have a group of close friends, but it kinda feels like if I wasnt there, sure they'd be a little upset, but my absense wouldnt really phase them that much. No one really cares that much, as long as there's a group to go to. It's like, my friends only ring me when they're bored and have nothing better to do. I feel like such a loner, even though, in reality I'm not.      Over the past two weeks I've been noticing that gradually I'm becoming really sad and isolated. But the wierd thing is, my mind kind of Wants to be sad... I don't know, its all so confusing.      Im the kind of person who always embraces the little joys of life and is happy in them, but recently a part of me is trying to covince the rest of me that all of that passion is a load of cr@p. I'm so alone, all by myself, so lonely, and it's not right.      What should I do? Thanks so much for all of your help.

20090308005626AAg9Z2W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Is it normal for a father to kiss his son on the lips?	I met this very nice african family that moved into our neighbor hood about a month ago from africa (just the father and son the mother died) and so I try to make them feel comfortable and welcome here in here. But the boys dad seems to be too protective of his son. The boy is shy and dosent have much friends in school people make fun of him while he trys his best to stay focused in school his dad wont let him go to any movies or walk around in a store by himself hell his dad wont even let him walk around the block he always has to be within the dads sight. And yesterday I volunteered to drop his son off at school because his father had to head to work a different way so I said I would drop his son off because I was going that way for work anyways. And his son had his backpack and everything on and then his dad just walked up looked him in the eyes for a second and then kissed him smack on the lips for two seconds and then asked me If I could pick him up at school because he wasnt going to be home until five. And he got in his car and took off. And his son who is fourteen years old just took that kiss like It was no big deal. Does anyone else think this man Is too protective of his son?

20090308010723AA8qS9o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Diluting night feeds. Has anyone tried this?	My 8 month old used to sleep through the night but after a really bad month where he seemed to pick up illness after illness, he's started waking up twice during the night and will not go back to sleep unless he has a bottle. He guzzles down an 8oz feed each time and then goes straight back to sleep. I keep giving him water first but he just cries like his little heart is going to break until he gets milk.      At first I thought he was just getting his strength back after eating very little whilst he was ill but it's been a while now since his last illness and he's still knocking back the night bottles. Invariably he's not interested in breakfast any more but eats his lunch and tea fine.      I'm concerned about the damage that night bottles might do to his teeth and would really like to get him back on track with his breakfasts but it's proving difficult. A friend suggested watering down the night feeds gradually so that he's taking less formula (at the moment he's having about 35oz per day with these night bottles) and therefore he'll eat better on a morning but the guidelines say that you should always make up bottles as per the instructions. Has anyone else tried diluting feeds with success or does anyone have any other advice?
20090227132332AAicLmg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would be the best ways to tell my parents about my boyfriend?	I already asked a question about this. Hes 19 , I'm 16 (17 in April). It will be 3 years since we started to date in august. My parents still have no idea. Well i told my mom I was seeing a boy for about a week and that's all she knows and he was suppose to come out to dinner with me and my mom a couple days ago but he got really nervous and didn't want to make a bad impression so he chickened out. I'm done lying to my parents . I think they have a right to know. They had a right to know 2 and a half years ago but i was to scared to tell them. Then it came lie after lie. How should I tell them? My parents are divorced so ill have to tell them at different times . So Letter? over the phone?, in person? email?  I don't know what way to do it. Advice appreciated. Thankss :)

20090308010310AAfbIHg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do I do about the baby's father?	Well I got a boyfriend over the holidays while I was visiting my dad thousands of miles away in Toronto. He was literally the first boyfriend I've ever had. He was a great guy, he really was... or so I thought.      Eventually of course I had to go back home to Victoria because of that evil little nuisance in life: school.      He insisted on having an "open relationship" since ours was so long distance...      I reluctantly gave in after what must have been hours of me begging and pleading for him to stay faithful.      I haven't really dated anyone regardless, but literally just a few hours ago he called me and told me that it's over because his crazy old suicidal, drug addicted ex is now pregnant with his child.      I had been preparing to tell him that *I* am pregnant with his child... but I didn't end up doing it, for obvious reasons.      I don't know what to do. This the worst situation I have ever been in. My mom knows, and I already telephoned my dad and told him everything, but both of them don't know what to do either. All they can say is that they'll be here for me every step of the way.      I'm finished high school, and I'm 19, so I'll probably be able to work this out okay...      But how do I tell my baby's father about this?      Me = crushed.      Very, very painfully crushed.

20090308011033AAxbJzT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is my 3 year old cousin attached to me?	I have a 3 year old cousin, who I see often. Whenever she first arrives, I'll be standing somewhere and she'll go looking for me, and when she finds me, she'll give me a big hug. Then, at lunch time, she wants to sit on my lap and eat her lunch, and she loves to share with me. When she goes down for a nap, she wants me to tuck her in, read her a story, and give her hugs and kisses.After her nap, she yells for me,and I usually go get her, and she cuddles with me for a while, while we watch t.v together. At night time, she gets scared, because it is dark outside, so she goes looking for me, and when she does find me she buries her head into my chest. When it is time for bed, she likes me to give her a bath, get her pj's on, and tuck her into bed. Last night it took an hour because she wanted a lot of hugs and kisses. Last night she had a nightmare, so I went into the room, next to her. She came over to me, and wrapped her arms around my neck and rested her head on my shoulder. I do enjoy spending time with her. Does anyone think she is attached to me? If so,why?

Went to visit my in laws on CHristmas They have a dog who constantly licks my daughters face (which i think is disgusting  esp since MIL stated the dog eats its poo and I have on many occassions asked for them to do something about the licking) A cpl hours after we lft my daughter broke out with bright red bloches on her face eyes were swollen and she was screeching crying. I called the dr who said to give her benadryl which worked       We went to their house the other day same thing with the licking  I was told she knows everyone has there diff opinion on raising kids but she always let the dog lick her kids and nev had a prob with it I stated well my opinion is that its disgusting! That night same thing hap w the crying and blotches and swelling etc.      She can over yest and we told her that the dr said babys allergic 2 dog in which my ma in law replied "Well i guess you wont be coming over to visit any more" in a sad yet snudy tone. We then stated she just has to put the dog in the garage or in its cage when we come and she says " Looks like Im going to be all by myself with the dog now" 2xs in same tone. I just rolled my eyes. Her cell rang and she said she had to leave bc her grandson had came to her house after school.      I feel like i should maybe provide her with liteture on allergic reactions or something bc it almost seems to me that shes saying that her dog is more important than having her grandaughter come over to visit   What do you think I should do Shld i just leave it?

20090106134344AAMZ0Sk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Dans quelle mesure peut-on laisser ses enfants regarder la télévision seuls?	J'ai les boulasses. Ce matin j'ai laissé Berthe-Blanche, ma fille cadette, 4 ans, devant la télé, c'était juste histoire de prendre une petite douche. En fait, ?a a pris un peu plus de temps parce que je me suis aussi épilée les guiboles, les aisselles, les sourcils, et que je me suis fait le maillot (à la lyonnaise). Dans la foulée, j'en ai profité pour me faire une petite coloration, un joli brushing et une french. Je trouve que des ongles soignés ?a finit toujours bien une bonne femme.      Quand j'ai eu fini c'était l'heure de préparer à bouffer. Le père rentre toujours à 12h08 et y'a intérêt à ce que ?a tra?ne pas avec lui, donc pas question de faire une partie de Memory ou je ne sais quel autre jeu débile avec Berthe-Blanche. Je préfère qu'elle regarde le 12-13 à la place, c'est plus instructif.      Une fois le père reparti et la vaisselle faite, plus un bruit dans la baraque. Méfiance... Pendant que je monte les marches des escaliers une à une, sans faire de bruit, j'entends que Berthe-Blanche chantonne dans sa chambre. J'ouvre à peine la porte, histoire de la surprendre dans son intimité et là... PATATRAC! Ma fille a mis sa couette sur le sol, elle est en petite culotte /débardeur et elle chante en se roulant par terre "Aaaaapelle mon numéroooo, j'ai le sang si ch???????.... Aaaaapelle mon numéroooo, j'ai le sang si ch???????..."      J'ai beau être une mère absolument parfaite en tout point, je culpabilise beaucoup depuis cet épisode douloureux.

The cramps she said were ovary cramps, not uterus cramps. Spotting is a sign of pregnancy, but she has also been stressed out lately, which can also cause the spotting. I was wondering how worried do you think we should be? And what can we do for the time being to gauge if she is pregnant or not? She cannot take a test until a week or so after ovulation.      The facts summed up:      We had sex with a condom, and no breaks I believe 7 days after her period ended and ovulation began. She just experienced some light vaginal bleeding, but she has been stressed. She is on birth control as well.      Please only real answers, I am pretty stressed about this. I am only 21, so obviously, this was not anything planned.      Thank you in advance for your help.

20090308012207AA3i9fn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Toxemia late in pregnancy.?	This is my first baby and I am overdue. My midwife says the baby is fine and is in no danger right now. I started having a little swelling last week and she just diagnosed me with mild toxemia. My blood pressure is perfectly fine, she just found protein in the urine. She said I can deliver on my own and have no issues since I'm just developing it and I have no other health issues. Has anyone else had toxemia and delivered naturally (not induced or c-section). I'm just looking for reasurrance really.
20090308013626AAFyQM1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Took provera, still no period after a week?	I started taking provera 10mg for 10 days to get my period. I am aware that it can take a few days after ending the pill to get your period. However, I am now done taking provera, I am on day 7 now (a week past taking it), and still no period, and no sign of it coming. I have had sore nipples for the past 4 days, and have been extremely tired. I am also on 2000mg of Metformin, and when or if I get my period I'll be starting clomid 100mg days 5-9. Could I be pregnant or something? I have taken provera before but I don't remember my nipples being sooo sore! I am pretty sure every time I've taken provera, my period started right away. What should I do? What do you think? I AM TTC
20090308012237AAd7nCd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can you help a constipated baby?	My 6 month old hasn't had a bowel movement in almost 3 day, and that's very unlike her. I can't think of anything else it could be besides constipation. She grunts and strains like she's trying to poo, but nothing ever comes out. I haven't changed her formula or fed her anything new in the past week or so and I haven't taken her to the doctor yet because she doesn't seem to be in any pain or discomfort. She's still as happy as can be. Is there anything I can do or give her to help her pass her poo?

20090308013054AATTNpl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This was so awesome for me, how about you?	I am 22w4d pregnant today. I went to a concert in san antonio this wednesday that just passed (Music wasn't extremely loud so I didn't harm my baby's delicate little ears). It was a great show, but not the point. At the end of the show, I noticed my baby had moved for the first time. I've felt movement before, but this time I could actually see my baby was on the right side of my belly. I thought it was so cool. I could see all of my right side of my belly a lot bigger than my left. And it felt a lot firmer. So, I don't actually have a question. I just wanted to share this with other pregnant woman because it was such an awesome experience for me.
20090308015937AAl0UBt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Any suggestions on better sleeping?	I'm 22w4d pregnant. My belly is not big at all and I normally don't have trouble sleeping. Sometimes it bothers me to lay on my belly, but not when I bring my leg up to help prop my belly up on the side a little. I know it's best to sleep on your sides, preferably your left, but I get tired of laying on my side all the time.       I'm not working so I'm not up at this hour for anything important. I simply just can't sleep. Have any of you pregnant women found anything that helps?
20090308030033AAvvK3u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Im confused ... negative test but no period?	I have been off my birthcontroll since november because my health card expired and i wasnt able to get another on untill just recently. im back on my birthcontrol as of sunday. from november till now i have been having unprotected sex. he uses the pull out method but i know for a fact that it doesnt work. I realize that if i am pregnant it is both of our faults and i am willing to deal with the consequances.       I am just confused. before i started birthcontroll a year ago i used to get my period for like 2 sometimes 3 weeks and then not get it for 2 to 3 months but since i have been on birthcontroll its always been regular .. even scince i got off of my birth controll its always been on time and usually lasts for about 4 to 5 days. but this month i missed it ... completly missed it. i took a pregnancy test but it came up negative. i have never missed a preiod its always just been late but its been over a week now that its late and i took the test and its negative so im confused y the test says negative but i havent gotten my period. the only symptoms i am having is im always tired no matter how much sleep i get, and i am starting to notice i go to the bathroom alot more but i dont think that symptom comes till later and then of course the missed period.       Any one have any imput ?? i would really appriciate everyones advice. cause i have thought this thing to death and am still very confused

20090308012308AATtJFy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long after being on the pill are you proctected?	I've been on Microgynon 30 for almost 2 weeks, am taking it to regulate my periods. I would normally use condoms as well, but this morning my boyfriend and I wound up having sex without one. I thought it would be fine, I'm pretty certain my doctor said I'd be covered from 7 days, but now I'm reading all sort of advice online ranging from 7 days to 1 month. Which is most accurate?      I started the pill on the day after I finished my period, I'd been waiting for a doctor's appointment and got one after my period, annoyingly.      The leaflet inside says to start taking it on the first day of your period and you're protected from day 1, I know that, but I'm just a little concerned about the month advice. Is that just to be extra safe?
