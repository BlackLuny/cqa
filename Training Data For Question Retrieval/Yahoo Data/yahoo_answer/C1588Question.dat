20090220182831AAi8ez0	Travel;United States;New York City	What's the difference between living in Singapore and New York?	Currently I'm a student living in Singapore with a Singapore passport. I'm thinking of studying in New York when I reach university age. I've heard lots of great things about New York, as well as bad. But the reasons why I can't wait to get there is because I'm eager to experience American (college) life, have international college friends, explore new places, don't really have to get 'stuck in the rut' like other Singaporeans, be overwhelmed by the availability/variety of good and services, heard that cost of living in New York is lower than Singapore (a survey ranked New York 23rd in terms of highest cost of living, while Singapore gets 13th), availability of jobs after graduation (though maybe not at this time), get to benefit from the PlaNYC 2030 citywide program of improving everything, from transport to environment ( www.nyc.gov/planyc ), know that New York has a huge Asian community for me to get comfortable with, and finally, heard that Singaporeans who lived/worked/studied there enjoyed their stay tremendously, so I hope I will too. I might even want to stay forever. But first I need to know why some people have a bad impression of New York life (is it because of dull work, problems any city would have, crime levels, or what?). What will I miss out if I choose to live in New York instead of Singapore? I also heard New York is voted the 'safest large city in USA', but what precautions should I still make? I come from a very safe country (not trying to brag but it's true according to statistics), so I might very easily let my guard down. But I'm still positive about going to New York, so I can't wait for my one-way ticket. One more thing, if I find it expensive to live in New York eventually, what should I do to keep costs down (e.g. where can I find the cheapest apartments, the reasonably priced shops/supermarkets, etc.)?

20090220182205AA2FsbY	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	How does the Red Box place at TriNoma, Quezon City work?	I'm coming home from the US and my friends (we're all mid-teens) asked me if I wanted to chill with them somewhere near my old school (their current school). we're still very close to each other even though our only means of communications are through Friendster and YM.          Anyway, one of them suggested Red Box. I asked a question about a good hang out here recently but I looked up Red Box and I found their site. So my questions are:         -How do they charge? by hour?   -are teens allowed in? Considering the fact that Red Box is a karaoke bar.   -I saw on their site that they offer a good deal on students with IDs. I think it will seem awkward of me to ask my friends to bring in their IDs, but can I use mine? it's Simsbury High School...do you think they'll accept it?   -How's the food? How much do they cost???         I'm on a tight budget but I don't wanna seem like a complete cheapskate.

20090220211722AA5kieJ	Travel;United States;New York City	How prestigious is Stony Brook University?	I'm thinking of going there because I've been old it's a very good school by my cousin who lives in New York. I am from Los Angeles and Ireland and I don't like LA so I'm either going to college in Ireland or New York. I've been accepted at Stony Brook, St. John's University, and a few others. I didn't apply to good schools like Fordham due to lack of confidence in my grades though it turns out I probably would have been accepted there. So Stony Brook is like the only good university I applied to (unless you count St. John's, Adelphi, etc. as good). I know stony Brook isn't in NYC but it's close enough for me and might be better because then you don't have the city distractions. I could just ride a train in whenever I want because it's only about an hour away. And it's very cheap ($12,000) a year. You can't really beat that for an out of state student.       So anyway how good is Stony Brook? Some people make a big deal of it... It's ranked 97th in the country. does that mean much? How good is it? Be completely honest. Is it prestigious at all like UCLA or something? Or is it just like an easy state school to get in to?      Also please don't tell me I won't fit in.. I was raised in Ireland partially and a lot of my family lives on the East Coast and California is depressing as hell and I love East Coast people. Thanks.      Thanks for your help.

20090220175859AAL5TP6	Travel;Air Travel	Questions for flight attendents?	I am 17 years old now and will be attending college next fall.      I actually really want to be, and have always wanted to be a flight attendent. Cultures, traveling, languages, people, and everything similar interests me SO much.      I think i will go to college and major in Lingustics which will allow me to become fluent in two, or three different languages. I am definatley going to study Italain, and maybe russian or german.       Now, i wanted to know will this give me an advantage in becoming a flight attendent? I am VERY nervous that i wont be hired to become one and then i dont know where i will go because thats all i want to be.   I do sort of mind where i live. i mean i am not too picky i just want to live somewhere on the west coast like seattle, L.A., Portland, but cities like chicago or boston would be fine too. I just COULDNT work anywhere in the south...      i would also want to fly to italy.      do you think i will have a good chance? and what other things could i do to perhaps give me a bigger advantage in getting the job i want?

So I am proudly Vietnamese and I was just reviewing the history of other askers who have asked about the Vietnamese Culture and Food, but I have yet to learn more about the world's interest in the culture and food.   I have been there two times in the summer, stayed for 2 months each and it was a very memorable summer.    The summer of '08 was the best I've had out of the...two.   At night, the streets were wild and I would always miss the sound of the cars and motorcycle's loud beeps of their horns. I stayed in both Saigon and Da Nang (Da Nang my personal favorite) and I loved it there. The fruits, the coffee shops, the clothing stores, amazing.      Please, share your personal experience with the culture and the food in Vietnam, I would happily appreciate all answers!      Thank you!

We'll have to make our own way back to London from there, so we want to know the cost of the train ticket + ferry. EuroRail lists the price as  whopping ￡180. Taking a plane costs a third of that!  Am I looking in the right place, or is there a cheaper way to travel?  The tour agency knocked off only US$25 from our tour fare, on account of our truncating our tour.  They told us the rail ticket costs on $75.  Who's telling the truth?

We already decided on Universal Studios but we are debating on weather to go to Magic Mountain or Disneyland. We've been to neither one.

I would also like to know which is a better park to go for 2 girls who are 10 and 13. Could someone also tell me other attractions that are good? Thanks.

My husband and I have been discussing the option of visiting South Africa in order to see Great White Sharks breaching. This is something we've just recently started discussing so as of now we have not made any plans.   One thing we're concerned about is our relationship. My husband is black and I am white. We know there has been a long history of racial tension and violence in South Africa however we feel we lack a true understanding of South Africa's social structure and politics. We're concerned about our safety and the safety of our children who are obviously biracial.    Would it be a good idea to vacation in South Africa or would we be better off taking a trip somewhere else?         Any help, advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
