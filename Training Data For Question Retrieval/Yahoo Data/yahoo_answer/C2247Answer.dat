RVpl9ZeIaa	Easy, you tribute 2 monsters and summon them like any other high level monster.<br>  <br>  Their text can be confusing, however it says that you CAN special summon them through Pyramid of Light. Unless their text specifically states, "This card cannot be normal summoned or set," then they CAN be summoned normally. Pyramid of Light is just to help summon them easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://forum.tcgplayer.com/showthread.php?t=167065" rel="nofollow">http://forum.tcgplayer.com/showthread.ph...</a>|`|DQyHwIeiaa	Normally you cant, unless you can find a way to special summon it from your hand.<br>  <br>  Actually you can use a hero emerges to get it out!|`|PsMoCVKRaa	you can tribute it OR summon from hand or deck(when you say from deck,I mean that you can use cathadrel of nobles^^) you cannot summon by special summon from graveyard...<br>  add me on MSN technology.master@live.com<br>  or yahoo :ultimate.zane@yahoo.com|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	the way you would normally tribute summon a monster with 7 or more stars.  all pyramid of light does is let you special summon it for 500 lp.  however, this card can't be special summoned once it is in your graveyard.|`|Ivswzg0Laa	I love how you talk about this like it's a question pertaining to reality. But I used to like Yu-Gi-Oh, so I can't blame you.|`|g863rNLJaa	you cant. you cant monster reborn it or anything unless pyramid of light is on the field|`|YyBAzQGEaa	Basically u cant, but if u read pyramid of lights effect they r destroyed and removed from play so if u have u "Return From a Different Dimension". With this affect it allows u to offer half your life points to Bring back as many removed from play monsters as possible but unfortunately only 4 that turn u activate that card.
XlLbXtEqaa	No, you do not want to buy an extended warranty from the store where you purchase this. Right out of the box there are instruction that tell you not to return the item to the store where you bought it. If Rock Band instruments are faulty what you'll do is go to this web site: <a href="http://support.ea.com/cgi-bin/ea.cfg/php/enduser/rockband.php" rel="nofollow">http://support.ea.com/cgi-bin/ea.cfg/php...</a><br>  <br>  It's pretty straight forward; you just follow the directions. You can choose an express method, where they send you the instrument first and then you ship your broken instrument back in that box.  This requires a credit card though (they withhold $90 until they get your broken instrument).  Then there is the slower method where they ship you an empty box, you ship your instrument to them and then they ship you a new instrument. This costs you nothing, the $90 dollars they hold onto is just to make sure people send their broken instruments back.<br>  <br>  Rock Band instruments are very sturdy though.  The initial batches from the 1st game as well as the 2nd had some issues but those are all ironed out now.  The drums are most prone to taking damage, but from what I can tell it's mostly due to people being way too rough on them.  They can take a beating though so rest assured that they'll be okay!<br>  <br>  One last thing, when you do buy it be sure to keep the receipt! There is a 60 or 90 day warranty on the instruments.  If you have an issue with the instruments you'll have to scan the receipt and send into them when prompted to.  Don't worry it's all easier than it sounds.<br>  <br>  You've made the right choice by picking Rock Band 2.  It is definitely the best music/rhythm game out there!|`|MuJddvuYaa	Buy the warrantity. The Drums break easily.<br>  <br>  Are you tired of being poor on Neopets?<br>  Do you want to earn millions on neopoints?<br>  Well Sign up on the link bellow to earn Millions.<br>  <br>  w w w . g a d a x . n e t / f o r u m / i n d e x . p h p ? r e f e r r e r i d = 5 3<br>  <br>  Put Mookie as your referer|`|IHHOHsMbaa	I regret not getting it.

rnfxNYx3aa	Right now the hobby of stained glass is very expensive.  When I first started a roll of solder was 5.99 now it runs around 15.99-17.99.  Copper foil is out of sight as well.  Your supplies to get started are kind of expensive because you want a high quality soldering iron that will hold a steady temp as you work, also expensive.<br>  <br>  I now have 9 full windows that I have made work for and clipped it into the very edge of the window.<br>  <br>  You want to buy stained glass to begin with the determine if you want to get into the art further.

4aFvYVFRaa	It's extremely rare to find either genres listed in fabric.<br>  The last fabric print of Sonic that was available in the US was in the 90's. <br>  There are a few out there these days, but they're incredibly rare to come across. <br>  As for Mario, it's the same deal with him. You can find lots of bed sheets and covers of him, but it's near impossible to find "yard by yard" fabric. <br>  You should check ebay right now, because there are a few Mario Fabric items for sale. And they are in the "yards", so I suggest you go and check under "mario fabric". You'll find some items right now. <br>  But Sonic the Hedgehog Fabric is a rare gem to come across.|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	Super Mario and Sonic farms are cruel and inhumane. The plumbers are forced to unblock toilets for 17 hours a day and rescue princesses for the other 7.<br>  In Sonic farms, the hedgehogs are tethered in cages so they can't spin or jump.  While in their cages, they have their spines cut off to make the bottoms of golf shoes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or you could try and find kids' printed duvet covers and use those. :-)

9poqDrd5aa	dont worry too much, an iso file is meant to be mounted on a virtual drive (please just use google or wikipedia) but if you have winrar or winzip (i think) you can extract the files just like a .rar file it wont always let you install the program though,  since some people copy a disk into an .iso so then when you mount it its the same as if you had the disk in your drive. Its not like it will autorun on you and install a virus or something unless you activate it when its mounted which you should "explore" it before opening, extracting or mounting.<br>  <br>  To put it simply an iso is just another mass file storage format.|`|cO10thlnaa	.ISO is a CD/DVD image, so if it's a game or program that you are looking for, it should be.

This seems to be a problem with the game. I have a high end system and even on low graphic settings the game runs slow and laggy. Check out the sega forums for possible fixes until a patch comes out.

WOLoABNVaa	You will at least need a Memory Card to store your Xbox Live Gamertag on. <br>  <br>  The hard drive is an optional accessory, that is not required to play online, although it is recommended if you plan on downloading new maps or levels for the games you like to play online,|`|IHHOHsMbaa	You need some form of memory. The internal flash memory isn't enough to really play.|`|qeVfPBGOaa	no.. live online does not require the harddrive, but you should get one anyway because if you play a lot of games ur gonna have to keep deleting profiles and memory and its gonna be really really homo.<br>  <br>  just buy a harddrive
fZsFhjceaa	Its difficult at the begining of the game as you are often hurt (Vault 101 guards), have no money and if you eat food you get irradiated, which is something you dont want to do.<br>  My advice is this:<br>  Go to Megaton and speak to Moriaty in the Saloon and get him to tell you to go and speak to Silver who lives in a house just outside of Megaton.  He will send you to retrieve 100 caps (if you dont keep pestering him, if you do, he wants 300), if you go to Silver, you can convince her pretty easily to give you 300 caps meaning that you can pay Moriaty for the info on your father and have 200 left over.<br>  <br>  Next, buy some ammo (dont need much) and kill the raiders in the school (kinda difficult, takes planning, only fight one at a time, try to use a baseball and VATS, only using you gun on other people with guns, then search their bodies for more weapons).<br>  <br>  Once you have cleared the school you can sleep on the matress and gain your XP back with no gain in radiation.<br>  <br>  You can also sell all the stuff you dont want in Megaton to get some more caps.<br>  <br>  Dont go to the radio station until you have some decent armour and weapons, there are some tough fights in DC and you WILL lose them if youre not prepared.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	I would start with doing the survival guide in Megaton. Those are some easy quests with decent rewards. Make sure to always do the optional portion of the quests because you can get some perks that you can't get through leveling. Do as many side quests as possible before doing the main ones.|`|08CYBgLTaa	I've had the best luck sneaking up on the raiders and killing them, then taking and repairing their weapons to upgrade or sell.  I've only played for about 8 hours but have some pretty decent weapons.  I really like the combat shotgun for close quarters and the laser pistol for feral ghouls...occasionally it vaporises them :)<br>  <br>  Check the super-duper mart and the germantown PD hq, I got some decent gear in those places
b3b268bd86d730469f543b3c4b321e88aa	Those are 3 great choices, but I personally like 8 best, and 7 and 10 both come in close second. Like i said close|`|uctxzjIIaa	FF4.|`|7Lmdrxicaa	well, haven't played ff8 yet :P<br>  ff VII and X where both great, but VII is the best. Love the story :D

quYLRIrgaa	Games are usually started on PCs and then ported to the consoles. The 360 has an architecture which is more suited to this, whereas the PS3 has proved more problematic - which is why on cross-platform games (especially more noticeable in the earlier years) the 360 version performed better.<br>  The difference now is usually not that big in favour of either console (publishers don't want to upset Sony/MS or the hordes of fanboys by making one version noticeably better if they can help it).<br>  But, you only need to look at the exclusives developed from the ground up with the PS3 in mind to realise how powerful it can be.|`|gfNzmmx9aa	guy above is right there is little to no diference in games that are on both platfroms but when it comes to exclusives that is when you see both consoles true power. just look at Killzone 2 and GOW2. obviously it hink KIllzone looks better cuase i own a ps3 lol.<br>  <br>  and this cost thing is bugging me xbox costs more when u *** up all the features needed to = a ps3<br>  <br>  console<br>  wifi<br>  hardrive (in some cases)<br>  online<br>  Hd-DVD

j6MvCr6Naa	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is coming out around Christmas 2009. There is absolutely no information on this game yet aexcept for that it's being developed by Infinity Ward (the studio that made the original Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare). This is a good thing because the inferior Call of Duty: World at War was developed by Treyarch and the game nowhere near as good as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. So you should be glad that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is being developed by the real deal. It's going to be fantastic.<br>  <br>  To the answerer above: Halo 3: ODST does not have its own multiplayer, all it has is more maps for Halo 3 and a new singleplayer Campaign.|`|bY8GDuaeaa	Well you have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Halo 3 ODST and Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Lost Planet 2 so far.<br>  <br>  And it's rumored there's a new Ghost Recon later this year.

kHRK66Mwaa	Here is the review done by GameTrailers. Yes, they are the same people who does those shows on Spike TV. They give RE5 a score of 9.0 out of 10. The video review does a fantastic job explaining the good points and the flaws. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/46359.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/46359...</a><br>  <br>  I completely agree with them that the graphics are gorgeous. Unfortunately, I also agree that the single player campaign when having the A.I. controlling Sheeva, is a pain. The design and inventory management is poorly done.|`|wGUQqZrVaa	here is a website that has already reviewed it. in my personol opinion i will give it a 9.2 out of 10. it is one of the best looking resident evil game ever made surpassing resident evil 4 by a longshot.however,it is true when people say it just doesnt feel like a resident evil game. there are no scares like the typical resident evil game has. ammo is plentifull and sheva's got your back.although she does get in your way at times she's not a big deal. weopons are more realistic than ever and are really powerfull. true resident evil fans would see we needed a big change.and capcom has done a good job at that. resident evil is a must buy for any avid gamer or just anyone who wants to have fun.|`|J1mNUHVdaa	i'd give my own review because i already saw the game <br>  <br>  <br>  well, for me id give it a 9.9/10 and the graphics are AWESOME like you saw a real movie with real people! but its kinda short....<br>  <br>  And this game has a very good storyline and action-packed gaming and its not that scary, just tensing.it also has upgraded gameplay from like resident evil 4, and it has that much controls too, but here on RE5 you can play a Co-Op mode, that means you can play the game on two players. there are also new monsters in this game, so are new characters like Sheva, Josh, Irving and Excella. they also confuses us in this game, at the end of RE5 trailer, you can see jill valentines grave  but, she  DID NOT die, wesker built up the fake grave to confuse chris and he controlled jill by putting a red controlling device on her chest. thats why jill became the "birdwoman". she's also gonna be a boss for this game. Wesker came back too and will gonna be another HARD boss for this game.....

Q7II8RoVaa	Hello Nyasia, <br>  <br>  Everything that the previous poster (HighSierraCamp) mentioned is absolutely right.  ACAcamps.org is a great resource for ACA accredited camps and that really is your best bet for a quality experience.  A little research will certainly get you a long way in finding the camp that works best for you.  <br>  <br>  I'd also suggest Kidscamps.com and mysummercamps.com, these two directories have a lot of camps to research through.  Just remember that the listings on these two directories are not exclusive, any camp can sign up accredited or not.<br>  <br>  I will take a moment and suggest you visit our camp at www.campfriendship.com.  We are an ACA accredited camp located in Virginia and we have a variety of programs for ages 6-16.  We certainly have showers a plenty but it's camp after all.  We are not affiliated with any religious organization and we do consider ourselves to be a nice camp. :)  The final decision on that will be up to you of course.  You are welcome to visit us online or give us a call with any questions you may have.  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your search.|`|HysoZOT1aa	Hi Nyasia,<br>  <br>  We're located all the way out in California, so I can't give you a recommendation from personal experience.  I can suggest, however, that you take a look at the American Camp Association's web site: www.ACACamps.org.  It is a large, non-profit organization that accredits camps and is not biased (except that the camps have to be accredited, which you probably want anyway).  You can search by area, your age, activity, and focus (i.e., not a religious camp).  If something looks interesting, contact the camp director and ask for a list of references and talk to a couple of campers.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that anyone who gives you a recommendation for a "nice" sleepaway camp in this forum may not have the same interests or standards as you so they may think a camp is nice that you wouldn't.<br>  <br>  If you want to read an article I wrote on how to choose a summer camp, you can follow the link below.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you have a great summer!

nrrsG5oiaa	Short and simple, no.  You need an active account to play and to get one of those, you need to register the game key from buying the game (included in the box).|`|AA11707728	Yes....and it's not illegal. However, it's not free either.  You pay by the account activation, not by the client.  Sure, you could pirate the client somehow.  But you will have to pay to activate an account, so what is the point?  Activate an account and you can download the client for free.  So what is the point of pirating the client?  Since it takes forever to download the client even at cable modem speed, might as well just buy a copy in the store.  Is Circuit City still open?  Go check to see if they have any copies left.  You'll pay half price.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think Warhammer Online ssssssuuuuuuuucccks.  Great game ideas implemented in the worst game client and worst gameplay I've ever seen in an MMO.  Truly, Mythic should hang its head in shame.  WO could have been great.  It could have knocked WoW off its lofty perch as top MMO......except Mythic obviously slacked off in development.  It's frustrating to see such a thing.  Game concept is cutting edge and a real advancement of the realm vs realm system.  But the implementation is beyond poor.  Someone, somewhere, deserves to be tarred and feathered for it.

If I plug the ethernet cable directly into the cable modem, I need to set up the configuration, which can be quite annoying.|`|s5IjyOygaa	a modem, a router (if you have a computer or other system connected to the internet), and an Ethernet cable.

gfmTgLDKaa	Legendary Pokemon aren't that great, I usually just get them for show. First of, your levels are more than good enough (40+ Pokemon can wipe the floor with the elite four as long as they're the right type), but you don't have the right types of Pokemon, this should help:<br>  <br>  You don't need the exact Pokemon, just the same type and if you can the same moves. It's all about which type beats what in Pokemon like rock paper and scissors.<br>  <br>  This is one of the best teams:<br>  <br>  Infernape Moves: Flamethrower- Close Combat- Flare Blitz- Flame wheel Empoleon Moves: Hydro Pump- Surf- Drill Pack- Bubblebeam Luxray moves: Discharge- Crunch- Thunder- Thunderbolt Garchomp moves: Dragon Claw- Earthquake- Dragon rush- Dragon Pulse Lucario moves: Aura Sphere- Dragon Pulse- Close Combat- ExtremeSpeed If diamond, dialga moves: Flash Cannon- Roar of time- Dragon Claw- Draco Meteor If pearl, palkia moves: Aqua Tail (if lv 80)- Spacial Rend- Dragon Claw- Draco Meteor<br>  <br>  I suggest you use a Fire type (Infernape) for the first Elite four since he has Bug type pokemon. His strongest pokemon is Drapion, so watch out. For the second elite four, I would use a water type (Empoleon) because she has Gruond type pokemon. Also, Hippowdon is her strongest pokemon and the sandstorm does not effest Empoleon. For the 3rd, use a water type for his 3 fire type pokemon, a fire type for Steelix, and a fighting type (Lucario) for Loppuny. Lucian, any pokemon will do. Like you saw in the episode, Bronzong is his strongest pokemon. For Cynthia, a mix.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have plenty of revives and hp potions. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|jK7pklCKaa	you cant win with that team? that should be able to wipe the floor with the elite four easily. just buy loads of hyper potions and revives and you will do it.|`|GCoqbQU8aa	My way I used the AR(action replay) sooo. yeah. anyway use your DIALGA if you have one and LOTS I mean LOTS of medical things you can get.

A surprising plot, clever dialogue, and intriguing cast of characters speed the story along.<br>  <br>  Hold the DS sideways like a book and use the Touch Screen to solve puzzles as the mystery novel comes to life.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that this is a very interesting and clever game, it took me around 20 hours to complete and the story great.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 78% meaning it's a pretty good game. But from personnel experience I can say that the game is brilliant and I abdolutely loved it.<br>  <br>  2. I would have to go with The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass. This is a brilliant, fun and colourful adventure. It will take you more than 30 hours to complete so it will definitely keep you busy.<br>  <br>  And to convince you that this is really a very good game, here is the average review score from reviewers all over the world:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, it's 90% which means it's a very good game.

wg8SQQjEaa	maybe try warhammer online|`|XyFukmcqaa	There is a great game coming out called Darkfall I highly suggest it if you ever played U.O. but even if you did not its still looking to be a great game and currently Beta is open you just need to purchase it.<br>  <br>  www.darkfallonline.com<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For gaming news, reviews, previews, discussions and much more check out <a href="http://www.notinthere.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notinthere.com/</a>|`|vxbR2tz2aa	You mention that you are looking for story, so you might be better to look at single player games (both the ones you mentioned are massively multiplayer online games). Any of the Bethesda games are great, Oblivion is the latest one and looks awesome. Their games are very open ended and have a huge world for you to explore however you like.<br>  <br>  Bioware is probably the best producer of games wih a great storyline. Knights of the Old Republic is one of theirs and is great but it is a sci-fi setting. If you want fantasy, try Neverwinter Nights 2. Its multiplayer but comes with a campaign that has a great story. They have a new game coming out soon called Dragon Age: Origins which looks amazing. Their latest game 'Mass Effect' has the best story I have ever seen in a game, but again, it is a Sci Fi setting.<br>  <br>  If you really do want a multiplayer game, both those you mentioned have good writing and interesting quest lines. I would go with WoW myself. I would avoid Warhammer and Guild Wars as these are primarily PvP games so shorter on storylines and quests.|`|KSfK4qR1aa	lord of the ring online, combines the feature of both games you mentioned, the lord of the rings genre and WoW RPG perspective,<br>  <br>  i cant get enough of it|`|XH81bdYkaa	If your into Star Wars, you could try Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic. It's a great and long game with many possibilities.|`|CsxaNyuhaa	Runescape|`|SottJIkIaa	You could try Guild Wars, its a one time payment.

gfmTgLDKaa	A role-playing game (RPG; often roleplaying game) is a game in which the participants assume the roles of fictional characters.[1] Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization,[1] and the actions succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[2] Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.[2]<br>  <br>  Most role-playing games are conducted like radio drama: only the spoken component is acted. One player, the game master (GM), creates a setting in which the other players play the role of a single character.[2] The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants; the other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Some outcomes are determined by the game system, and some are chosen by the GM.[2] There is a variety of role-playing game in which players do perform their characters' physical actions, known as live action role-playing games (LARP).[3]<br>  <br>  A genre of video game is also referred to as role-playing games. Although these games do not involve the playing of roles,[1] they take their name from the settings and game mechanics which they inherit from early role-playing games.[4] Due to the popularity of video games, the terms "role-playing game" and "RPG" have both to some degree been co-opted by the video gaming industry; as a result, games in which players play the roles of characters are sometimes referred to as "pen and paper" or "tabletop" role-playing games,[2] though neither pen and paper nor a table are strictly necessary.[2]|`|eWXkbDAqaa	A RPG is a game in which a person embodies the character they're playing. This differs from a traditional video game as most users do not act as if they're the actual character within the game.<br>  <br>  This is sometimes (often) the case with RPG players. <br>  <br>  According to Wikipedia, "Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization,[1] and the actions succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[2] Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game."<br>  <br>  Additionally, most role-playing games are conducted like radio drama: only the spoken component is acted. One player, the game master (GM), creates a setting in which the other players play the role of a single character.[2] The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants; the other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are also sub-genres of RPG's, called LARPs, or Live Action Role Playing, which is when a user physically embodies the game/character. They sometimes dress up as this character and act out battle scenes or various other scenes from the game. <br>  <br>  The most common RPG is "Dungeons and Dragons"|`|0didTstUaa	games included in this category are (but not limited to) world of warcraft, The Elder Scrolls 3 and 4 (3 - morrowind 4 - oblivion), the suffering.  a role playing game is defined as a game of which a player(you) takes control of a character in a specific situation, and usually involves making life changing choices for that character. MANY games are actually RPGs as well as other things. usually action games or shooting games.  i am not completely sure but i believe call of duty is an RPG, but not a very in depth one, as the storyline is pretty well drawn out for you. same goes for gears of war (1 and 2) and the halo stories. i hope i answered your question|`|sjxVAl5Zaa	From a pen and pencil point of view, I think what makes it a role playing game is not only the story line and the character as a bunch of numbers on a character sheet, but more of the life you breath into the character.  When a character is created you make yourself a "Role" to play, much like if you were a character in a play.  It is a give and take between a GM and a Player and their character to write the story that they are playing.<br>  <br>  One of my old characters for example was Greta Fredrick Hess of Eisen who took part in a horrible religious civil war that ravaged her home land for the last fifty years.  She fought for the Vaticine side (i.e. Catholic in this game world), but after she was wounded severely she was nursed back to health by a minster of the opposing side.  Now that the war is over, neither side has won or lost, the land is war torn and nothing is solved, she took crisis of faith.  This is my character as the game began.  Now I kind of an idea about her past and give her a few personality quirks, (gruff, humorless, honorable, etc.)  My GM at the time, took this and the five other characters that the other players made, and began a story set in the game world.  In this case it was the 7th Sea universe, an alternate renaissance Europe.  She got our characters together and we formed a party of characters.  Everything we said was thought to be what our characters said.  (unless we said out of character).  And everything we said our characters did.  i.e. "I climb the tallest tree, and get an idea of the layout of the surrounding land.  Is there a house or clearing that we can make camp for the night?" and the GM would tell us what we found or how the NPC reacted to what we said.  LARP is much like this type, only acted out to an even larger degree and most have a few GM's to keep the game flowing.  This is much like a free form play, the most popular seems to be Vampire story lines.<br>  <br>  In video games, I think RPG is any game that has a basic storyline of what you would find in tabletop plot, "Save the princess, find the crystal, slay the dragon, destroy the Death Star, etc."  I also find that most have some type of leveling system much like traditional table top rpg's have.<br>  <br>  The other type of RPG that I know about is more like writing groups.  These while they have rules, they don't use the normal methods of traditional RPG's to determine outcome, such as cards or dice, but discuss plot with all the other people playing.  So outcomes are thought of in advance and you have write and play the characters in such a way that gets it to the said outcome, which can be pretty challenging as well.|`|GSFH3Hvgaa	IT's when your really playing the character. You interact with other things while playing that character. You get to do stuff while that character that's the term role playing, you playing as that character.|`|YxK4YTvSaa	Its not just the storyline, I think that RPG games are where the character kinda develops and at the same  time the character changes how you want it to and you are in control of how the story ends|`|eE1DkQylaa	Role Playing Game. It is basicly a game when you have a character and you have to level it up. Like for example any games like Fallout3 or like runescape when you have a character and he must level up.|`|SQQca8G5aa	It means that you pretty much create a character that is or isn't like you and you follow a storyline.|`|4eO1uaLWaa	RPG = ROLE PLAYING GAME|`|8te6mUHIaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playin...</a>|`|lbgoHgDkaa	i find that RPGs have you more involved with the characters.  while in shooters, action, adventures, etc.  RPG games give you more or a range in customizing your characters (attack power, speed, defense, etc), while in other games you use what you get (pick up guns, pick up weapons, etc).  basically, RPGs allow you to customize your role.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	basically, a role playing game is one where you control the character and you can customize them to be like yourself, hence the term 'role playing'. certain elements in a role playing game are talking to people, a plot, lots of customization and items, lots of reading and a big world.|`|kmIBnlBZaa	basically it's anything.. .traditionally where players switch off attacking the other player. but has become a simple term for a story-mode or adventure game<br>  <br>  a lot of swordsman games like Fire Emblem, final fantasy and runescape are RPGs<br>  <br>  MMO signifies Massively-Multiplayer Online which just means all around the world pretty much<br>  <br>  RPGS!|`|OUo9J4i1aa	It's basically like fantasy really with a big epic story line.|`|PARFrmZVaa	Role<br>  Playing<br>  Game<br>  <br>  <br>  AKA CReating game
wTKX2L4xaa	It depends on the match type.Unless it's a Falls Count Anywhere, or a First Blood match, you must get the person into the ring to win. Just go to the person's head, and hit the grapple button to pick them up, then push them towards the ring. in the ring, hit your pin button.(Sorry, I can't remember the exact buttons;your manual should tell you the pin and grapple controls.)

7VXhmWbPaa	my favourite game when I was a kid was eagle-eye. This game works best at a playground. what you do is get one person to be the 'eagle'. The eagle chooses a place to sit, and everyone else has to try to tag the eagle without the eagle seeing you move. You have to slowely creep up behind or under the eagle and tag them when they are watching other people. If the eagle sees someone move they yell out eagle-eye and that person's name, and they have to go back to the start area. The first person to tag the eagle will become the eagle for the next round. The rules might be hard to explain to younger children, but once they get the hang of it, they'll be playing for hours.|`|yAmWKkrcaa	ring a round the rosie<br>  <br>  i spy<br>  <br>  red rover<br>  <br>  red light, green light<br>  <br>  Google these if you don't know them.... they are fun!|`|hY2L94iCaa	pass the parcel<br>  musical statues<br>  charades<br>  musical bumps<br>  musical chairs (or cushions/beanbags)<br>  stick names on forehead and guess who you are

The only people able to withstand the suits side effects are young 16 -18 year old teenagers.  And even then it's very rare to find someone capable.  Eventually it becomes increasingly more difficult to determine whether the "angels" were actually sent from god to destroy mankind or whether they are simply aliens.  The ending is too confusing to explain.  Great show though.|`|iewOi1L9aa	A secret organization called NERV makes giant mechas called EVAs that can only be piloted by 14 year olds.

ZOYyfBFYaa	This happens to me all the time since I bought the game. It has to do with the computer I think. The wants and needs come up but the rest is black. I have asked about this on yahoo before. Some things I do is that I hit control, alt delete and exit the game. When I reenter, I move position of the house. Another thing you can do is move the sim out of that house and move him in again. It just gets annoying after a while because of furniture and things. Then neighbours always come visit you. Hope I helped.

It's pure entertainment.|`|m8MyBdopaa	there is a game called mancala it is so fun. also there are credit card monopoly. those games are so fun. they are not too young, either. mancala is sort of a board game, it is kinda like with marbles and a wood board. it is very fun!|`|pxraxyudaa	Card and Board Games<br>  <a href="http://www.gamedmoz.org/English/Card-and-Board-Games.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamedmoz.org/English/Card-and...</a>|`|2luTwTkyaa	i think maybe battleship or monoply or clue. but if i were you i would want an electronic like a ds or playstation or a wii or an ipod|`|Oqet6D6paa	There are tons of games out there that may suit you, more than I suspect you would even imagine.

It's not FPS its a strategtically based game you click and point to where you want people to fight.|`|ngew4AWSaa	Halo was meh.<br>  <br>  Halo Wars is even meh-er, compared to the RTS's that you can get on PC.|`|tNSkgDMzaa	yah you control armies and it didnt come out yet try the demo on xbox live|`|II4Po8CZaa	yes it is|`|7WGsIEHYaa	Hey this is my own opinion but Halo wars is by far worth it. The only thing is is that if you like RTS games it is not going to be as hard as some of the other RTS games  and you cant play as covenants campaign or play as the flood and the campaign is short. You can though play as the covenant in multiplayer. All around it looks like a good solid game that should let you have hours of fun.|`|UPhNhtkXaa	I bought it the Day it released For  AUS And i was a bit disappointed But, The cinematic Were 10/10 perfect, After a Few levels i wished it was Made FPS :)) but ehh, get it if you want easy *** achievements|`|x3FEvok0aa	Depends if you like RTS games..it's a good console RTS, although simplified.

mde1I2Qoaa	No, you are way off.  If you are saying strongest damage without counting the fire rate then, M1 Garand for Rifles, MP40 for SMG, Browning for LMG, Double-Barreled for Shotguns, and PTRS for Bolt Action.  DP 47= piece of ****.  I've never EVER seen myself get killed by a DP 47.<br>  <br>  And DP 47 doesn't have that much of a great fire rate anyways.  If you are counting the fire rate, I'd say STG-44 would be the strongest rifle, Thommy or PPSH for SMG, Type 99 for LMG, Double Barreled for Shotgun, and PTRS for Bolt.|`|SBcxooLsaa	ya|`|KSIY3EVVaa	the strongest weapon with the best fire rate would definitly b the PPsh-41. ur not gonna get a better gun than that with close 2 maybe medium range combat. if ur planning 2 shoot 4 long distances, i recommend the STG-44 or the PTRS 4 actual sniping. the STG is almost as powerful as the M1 garand but its fire rate is much faster. the PTRS is obviously the best sniper cuz it has the best power AND fire rate.|`|BzcT9K2Jaa	i think you are right.  the double barreled shotgun is pretty good too.
3d1XRIzkaa	Yes, it sounds like you got ripped off. If you have your receipt, take it there. Ask them what the problem is.

Try playing counter strike(yes u gotta buy it-one time payment though)|`|tkjWzb4iaa	I would say Runescape because it has alot of skills, fun to raid godwars dungen and other high lvl bosses once you hit higher levels, and adventure quest sucks imo. <br>  <br>  I tried adventure quest and it was some point and click game and everything i tried to do " you have to be a guardian to do this!" im starting to wonder if they will say that when u go to sign up to be a guardian :\|`|k0p9kFsYaa	I THINK RUNESCAPE CAUSE ITS NOT FLAT

That way if one person doesnt have all the property with the same color they can build.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Yes. That's part of the game strategy.|`|gCtJkjpFaa	Yes it's allowed, and because they know the property is valuable to the person who owns Park Lane, they will probably keep the land or sell off for a large sum.<br>  <br>  That's if they're wise. :)|`|JNFadzqfaa	yup, that can be done.<br>   However, when that other player does buy that property you can try and make an offer to buy it from him or her, BUT THEY HAVE TO AGREE ok?|`|N33PlPwHaa	yes|`|AA11569882	Yes, that's how the game works, because if one player owns all the same colour then they can charge double the rent, so all the other players have to make sure that they do not own all of them and buy them out.<br>  <br>  It's not called the 'Family Break-Up" game for nothing, it's banned in my house!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	3 different people can buy the green properties. thats legal...you can sell a green if you wish, you can trade a green if you wish
j6MvCr6Naa	Bioshock:<br>  <br>  Bioshock is my favourite game of all time and definitely the best game ever made in my opinion. The graphics are absolutely fantastic, very detailed and the different effects like blood are very realistic and well done. The design is astonishing, the world of Rapture is the most unbelievable game world ever created, every level is has it's own new visual style, colours, design and atmosphere. The sound is also amazing, the game is constantly playing with your senses by putting in scary noises in the right places in time with what's happening on screen with creates an amazing atmosphere and immerses you in the game. The story is just as good, it's very complex in places but easy to follow, it has a very rich backstory and all the characters are well developed with amazing voice actors behind them. Be ready for some spectacular plot twists. The gameplay is also a great deal of fun and pretty much limitless because of the amount of different powers you can combine, this also let's you play in a very tactical and smart game if you want. You can't go wrong buying this game and you won't regret it.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Bioshock:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 96% meaning this is one of the best games ever made and in my opinion it is.|`|v0MGb17Saa	super mario bros.. it is the original series that still lives on today...|`|fs6yiPRoaa	Call of duty 4, Halo 3, Halo wars, to bad I can't play any of em online, my account got suspended, I guess it's against the rules to send a picture of your butt to your friend :D.

EzxeHsLHaa	Yes, I know, the Kadoaties want these items, but they are too expensive to be sold in a shop. You need to try the trading post like the person above me said. No other way to get it - maybe auctions, but you have to be good at sniping. And, as you said, if there are none up, there are none up.<br>  <br>  Trading post all the way.|`|ocIsJXHGaa	try ebay|`|yrDqtazLaa	Try the Trading Post. If you do not have any luck with the Trading Post, I would suggest searching galleries on the shop wizard and neomailing the people who have them in their gallery to see if they'd be willing to sell the item.
6SDckPH9aa	No its not that. Its actually the exact opposite. You are focusing too much on the health bar. It depends on the offense and defense of the opposing character. If you use someone like Akuma who has a very high attack against someone like Seth it'll seem like that. Most Ultra Combos could take out 40% - 60% depending on characters. Yet if Seth goes against someone like Dhalsim who has a low attack and defense it'll seem like your health bar is longer then before. Here is a proverb that will make more sense of everything I just said, "A weapon is only as good as it user." Not to insult your skill but if a defensive player uses someone like Akuma that's a bad match just like if an offensive player plays with E.Honda.

ozM1rX7Iaa	Because GTA 4: Lost and Damned is a download. If they let you rent the code, then only the first user would get it and it would be stupid since they would keep it. One reason: it is a download.|`|pflYF0Khaa	What the users have said above me is correct. It's because its a download that costs 1600MS points. You need to have Xbox Live and download it by buying points. Also you must have GTA IV in order to play Lost and Damned.|`|CnHZt6fYaa	Because its not a disc game but its an add on and if you buy it in a store you get the code to download it so basically because its a file not a disc

If you have an Edge card, you will get an extra 10% on each game.  The best thing to do would be to go to a store and ask them how much you can get.  The PS2 games will probably go for 5 or 10 bucks, and the PS3 games for more like $15 or $20.|`|a7pJggIeaa	most likely about 70 dollars, but it really depends on the games and the condition they are in and which game stop you go to. i reccommend calling them or going to the store and finding out.|`|xDr74nz5aa	well i wouldn't give you an exact price.. they ussually go on condition of the games and what games they are. for example the ps2 marvel vs. capcom 2 is worth $120 while gears of war 2 is only about $44|`|Gu8bynMKaa	it all depends on what the games are. but probabally around 50. unless you have and edge card.|`|E9Vr6ze2aa	Probably not much depends on the games ps2 games I would say $10 and the ps3 maybe $25

The graphics is impressive but the its not actually  world free roaming. You have 3 world you can access which is not that massive, but it does not affect the greatness of playing this game. The gameplay is very good. There are certain categories when playing Cabal. Such as Warrior, Arch, wizard, and more.<br>  <br>  2)Archlord- Archlord is a huge game. But the game is pretty difficult.

hFnSEAGjaa	go to cows and kill them.  Take the cowhides to the bank keep doing that and sell them 100 cowhides is 10k.  Kill 300 cows and get a rune scimi.  Next get a brass key and go to hill giants(near barbarian village) kill them and get the big bones. take the big bones(dont bury them) limpwurt roots nature runes and law runes(thats what they sometimes drop).  One inventory is about 12k.  After about 16 inventories you should be able to buy full rune.  Then buy some lobsters and strength potions and go to the cockroaches north of barbarians village (down the crevice)  Kill the roaches and take ALL the items you get.  Roach drops include rune scimitars,rune squares, 3 noted mith ores, 1 noted adamant ore, coins vary from 4 gp to 450 gp and mithril med helms also law runes vary from 4 laws to 25 laws.  If you use lobsters and stay there until you are out of food then you should make an average of about 45k per inventory.  But that varies- i made 300k from one inventory before then the trip right after that i only made 15k.|`|4D335m8Qaa	Ah, it's been years since I've played and I only ever played classic, but I made good gold from mining and fishing. You could also try going to a really popular fishing spot and people tend to drop fish that they have no room for after catching them and you can just grab them and sell them yourself. Also, you could store all of your things in the bank and go to an area where people tend to die a lot and just grab up all the stuff they lose when they die. And even if you end up dying there, too, it won't matter because all your own stuff is already store away! <br>  I also used to run scams with my friends, too, but that can get your IP address banned.

atYjLO4waa	Well, if you ever start a new game on this version or another version, I recommend that you don't train any of your Pokemon except for your starter. This is the easiest way to get past the elite four. But, since your team looks pretty strong right now and it's no fun to just plain restart, here's my advice:<br>  <br>  1. Remember to buy about 15 hyper potions, 5 revives, and 5 full heals. Use these items between each member of the elite 4. So, say your Torterra died after the second fight, just finish up the fight with your others and use a revive and hyper potion on it on your way to the next battle.<br>  <br>  2. Always remember to save after you beat each person so that you can just reset your DS and verse them again if you lose. If you keep losing again and again, try changing which Pokemon you start with. This will make the opponent send out different Pokemon than he would if you used the same ones in the same order.<br>  <br>  3. Also, you should go either into Victory road or into the water at the beginning of victory road to train your Torterra since Torterra is good against rock, ground, and water. Train your Lucario in the same cave, since he's good against rock.<br>  <br>  4. I recommend swapping your Clefairy on your team for a Gyarados. Clefairy is a moderately weak normal type, while Gyarados is a rather strong water/flying type. So, not only would this add some more strength to your team, it would also diversify the types.<br>  <br>  I think you should try number 3 first, then number 1 and do number 2 along with it. That's the best I got, so good luck on your battles =D|`|ZZTIJLQGaa	just go on www.pokemon.marriland.com and go on the pokedex and look for their weaknesess so you can beat them. Also use full restores on your pokemon and revives on the fainted ones. teach your pokemon<br>  Grasswhistle, Lovely Kiss, sing, Sleep Powder, hypnosis, or spore to put the foes pokemon to sleep. and if you have the TM dream eater use it on a pokemon. To get Gyarados use a super rod at lake Acuity. levels 30-55.

d2X4wwiyaa	Ok what you  have seems solid for the OTK.  I would however as you said recommend draw power to speed up the deck.  Furthermore morphtronic monitron can be helpful at activating the defensive affects several of which are great for stalling.  Inferno reckless summoning and machine duplication will quickly speed up your swarming abilities.    Hope that helps it looks very good but as you already observed draw power is always great but using other cards to increase swarming  or use the defense effect can help to.  How did it work in the tournament|`|cGtCBB5yaa	Add Morphtronic Map. Magnen , Datatron , and Clocken.|`|ea0VuB8Caa	I would say add 2 clockens (useful for last resort burn) and maybe 1 sakuretsu armor or other defensive cards.|`|eAoUXx3Qaa	submit your deck to the deck review section of<br>  www.teamhelmet.com<br>  then the deck will be posted with you name<br>  plus it will be fixed
oaz1hc2Daa	konami is way more strict then upperdeck one example KDE will not let us have flight at our sneack previews. KDE does things diffrently then UDE|`|DQyHwIeiaa	Its just different, it will be a little slow for a while, but it might pick up in a few months|`|d2X4wwiyaa	Konami hasn't made the game different, it is just in the transition phase and will need time to reorganize things to a new standard.  Honestly the tournaments when upperdeck ran it were lets say a tad unstructured.  Konami is reviewing and fixing and will start tournaments after they are settled in.  Konami is not new to this as they have been running the ocg for just as long as UDE ran TCG.   Furthermore the game wont change because it is konami who makes the cards and primary rules anyway.   And some will still side with UDE because they have been good to the players and change is usually not accepted immediately.

Both allow players to create virtually any type of character they want and then explore a large and detailed world with a nearly limitless degree of freedom. Though you have a tremendous range of choices, your actions also matter a great deal in both series and the worlds will respond to your choices in very realistic ways. The work that Bethesda put into Oblivion is already paying off in the design of Fallout 3|`|w3SLNKyKaa	nah its a bit darker than oblivion. Good game though, long story line. Plenty to do and roam around for hours or even days, its just once you've finished you cant go back and do side quest like GTA IV which sucks a bit so just make sure you do all your roaming before you finish lol|`|ZbcIdTTuaa	Fallout 3 is wanna of my favorite games.<br>  Yes It is very much like Oblivion but it is also very different. Pretty much just imagine Oblivion with guns, and a giant wasteland with mutants. If you like Oblivion you will like this game to|`|8JPRDabUaa	I've never played oblivion, but i've heard it is silimar.  I can tell you that Fall out 3 rauks.  If your a fan of rpg's this is the best one i've played in a long time.|`|wCX9g94Oaa	fallout 3 is created by Bethesda software which is the same creator from oblivion. Yes the game is similar but the storyline, weapons, characters, are very different. Fallout 3 is an open world rpg where you upgrade your character and you can play it the way you want. There is no limit on how you play everything, and you can build weapons. Fallout 3 is a very good game and the environment is amazing. Oblivion is more of a fantasy game where there is knights, creatures and etc. Fallout deals with surviving through the wasteland after it has been contaminated with the radiation of the bomb that was launched. The game is amazing if you like oblivion you definately will like fallout.|`|MMV6wz3oaa	Fallout 3 is more or less an RPG games in which you create your own charecter and explorer the vast wasteland from what use to be a peaceful earth, after radiation took over that is. Once you start you pick your skills which may i point out are very similar to oblivions gameplay mechanics there are a few main skills and along with these skills you have a few other skills which you could kind of call side skills which support the huge skills which is exactly like oblivions skill and leveling mechanics if you haven't already guessed so yet. After you get started you will be let out to explore the vast wasteland, they're are plenty of things you can do, in fact you don't even have to play along to the main quest and do plenty of side quests which are pretty fun, however they're are not that many side quests which really sucks and differes from oblivions wide range of side quests  but may i mention that fall out 3 is getting a few expansion packs, the graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, but not as pretty as oblivions considering your playing in an irradiated wasteland a couple new additions to the game play are guns and VATS mode which is a targeting system that allows you to auto aim which at a certain body part which may i add is very goory <br>  <br>  <br>  Overall the game is great and you should definitely pick it up, if not a purchase rent it see how you like it, if you adore the game go pick it up and have a good time.

K1aT1i8caa	ok <br>  so u want to no the basics for no scopes?<br>  The perk STEADY AIM is a must<br>  it reduces the crosshair by a loy<br>  <br>  There are 4 techniques that I use to no scopes:<br>  <br>  1. There is the G-shot technique that is demonstrated by zzirGrizz<br>  This is done by moving in any direction(crosshair expands as u move around)  when u spot ur target stop and wait for the crosshairs to shrink, then fire BOOM!<br>  <br>  2. Go Prone<br>  Going prone is the best way to get your crosshairs smaller, so this is a garuntee kill in close quarters.<br>  <br>  3. Quick Zoom.<br>  One of the easiest way to no scope<br>  Scope in on your rifle. However do not scope fully, on PC click the right mouse button, wait a fraction of a second and then shoot. Notice that u don not fully zoom in<br>  <br>  4. Weapon switch. Press ur switch weapon button twice then fire, If done correctly, your seconday weapon will not appear when u switch <br>  Remember to wait until the crosshairs close in (no crosshair when u play hardcore tho)<br>  <br>  Start with scoping first and play a lot. After u master the art of sniping with scopes. No scoping will be a lot easier for u. Also u can try a combination of these techniques. Try quick zooming while going prone. Or use the g-shot but b4 u shoot switch ur weapon. And PRACTICE!!<br>  <br>  I play on PC so if u want to play me on cod 4 or 5, plz get an xfire account and add me, i am rsrctdavid|`|cpLiNGUkaa	Well what I do is you see the person, strafe right then left, and then you time it just as you are walking back to the centre. It took me a bit of time  but it looks well cool and I get loads of friend requests =D|`|PqdYPmzwaa	there isn't really a way to explain it its mostly luck but next time try just moving the right analog stick a little to one direction and it works better also put the perk steady aim on it gives u better hip fire accuracy|`|ouhv66YSaa	some people put a little dot of blue tack on the center of their screen or selotape with a marker dot on it. <br>  <br>  but thats more the cheating way lol.|`|AA10512788	This is really hard for beginners, but once you start playing the game you will get a handle on things. As for No-Scoping, the method that works to me the best is if you move left then right and shoot right after moving right. I have hit someone really far this way. If you do it right, it will almost be like a glitch or something. In long range maps I carry ak-47 with deep impact and extra ammunition and i also carry a sniper, therefore i can shoot long with sniper and if i run out of bullets with my ak-47 im pretty good with close range sniper. Go on youtube to see ppl do that. Hope you have fun time playing and killin, im not sure if that works on Call of Duty 5 only 4.|`|TLJEWYkTaa	A good way is to use A-cog on your M40A3 with steady aim perk attached i find this gives u a better hip fire accuracy then having a normal sniper scope.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  in call of duty 5 when using with the springfield or the  russian sniper (noisy maggy) if you aim at the target with iron sites and use the top bar redicule you can nearly always get a no scope kill.|`|EAdZnaI6aa	On Call of Duty: Modern Warfare there is a way to do it with near 100% accuracy (if you can perfect the technique but you need really good timing). Look it up, it's called a 'dropshot'. I've tried it online but it's really hard to get the timing right.|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	i use  a small red sticker (bout a mm in size) so it saves time on bringing the sight up.

So just keep trying at it!|`|EYtgKEPjaa	it's just luck usually.<br>  the montages ect you see on youtube have probably taken ages to make.|`|cSD5aeROaa	Well first you spin around several times then say heeeyohhhh and pull the right trigger and say night night....gameover|`|Z2OxuDXeaa	Usually its luck but seriously steady aim works, its helped me before.|`|DPQVGWDDaa	no dis-respect the accuracy is quite good on all guns, it is just you are not good at aiming with no scope, i am not trying to cut you down<br>  <br>  just practice at it, and you will see it is quite easy|`|BO3KBsPIaa	Its just pot luck, you have to blind fire and hope for the best. I bought the clear sight with the target off ebay and it just annoyed me. Maybe if you played with them from when you first started playing the game you would get used to them.

4f2GaLhpaa	First of all make sure all of them are at least lvl 40 b/c lvl 30s are kind of useless. Kadabra usually lvls fast b/c he doesn't need a lot of exp. so try to lvl him up a lot. Then if you have a friend you can trade with, you can get him to be an alacazam which will help you even more. Also try to lvl up your Suicine b/c when you lvl legendary's up they get a lot more stats, try to get him to 45 or 50 and he will fight a lot better. Gid rid of the raticate b/c lvl 25 is too weak to do anything, and by the time you get to the ghost leader & fighting type leader they'll rip your normal type apart. You'll be better off just catching a lvl 30 in the wild-like a machoke or something. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps & good luck!|`|dakzbB0laa	u should first get everything to around level 40, then u should evolve ur pigeotto to a pigeot, evelove ur kadabra to a alakazam, teach ur alakzam phycic shadow punch hyper beam and thunder and u should be able to just fly right past the elite four in that game|`|0IEzZUXbaa	Level it up a lot more and get some leg. so u can open a can of *** woopen|`|nqIxDQK8aa	just go to victory road and train there.

The tests do not ask the same questions every time, either. So you may find the answers to a test that was administered last month or last year, and by the time you take it, the questions have changed.<br>  If a movie has been made from the book, as is the case with the Harry Potter books, you may be able to watch the movie and answer a few questions. But not everything in the books makes it to the movies – especially those long Harry Potter books! <br>  An Internet search with the terms "AR" or "Accelerated Reader" and the book’s title might yield some answers, but again, whether or not they’ll work will depend on which test the other person took compared to the test you took. You might luck out and be taking the exact same test. Or you might find that the answers you obtained do you more harm than good – there’s no guarantee that information posted for free on a website is accurate. It could just be someone who thinks giving out information guaranteed to make someone fail is giving them their "just desserts".

If your talking about the start of the game, go into every house/Dojo you see, and you'll eventually see the elders (in the shadow realm I hope).  Defeat every enemy, and I think the cages they are in will disappear.  It's been over a year since I played the game.  They might free themselves after talking to Spyro, I can't remember.  Good luck!

I would guess tho, that the games they make are going to be silly cute little things like they made for the eyetoy for ps2. for example, putting your face on a character in the sims, or mabye even some excercise games. my friend wants one soooo bad!<br>  O_o  cheEto

Funnest game ever. And very funny. Also a great challenge with replay value thats insane.<br>  <br>  Also try doom, duke nukem.|`|HBQpVqEPaa	I recomend dark sector it is fun you have such a blast and nothing is ever the same you get a glaive and you get to kill people in so many ways i totally recomend it
j6MvCr6Naa	Nope, you can't do that, sorry. =(|`|wPBfydYhaa	Sorry but you cant, only way you can unlock chapters is through finishing them so you have to start over. Although to quicken things you just type in no-clip on console and easily skim through each chapter till where you left off. yet again if you do so the game will know you are cheating so if your pursuing any of the in-game achievements they will automatically become void and you wont be able to unlock em.
ustlrb8taa	Well, they added Makin day, which is just Makin in the day(duh).   Anyway, these maps seem to be better than on cod4 because they are in more rural settings rather than urban environments that are open and just a fragfest.|`|yRLY6nOtaa	Found this while reading the sad news about Brandon crisp <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  I have only just seen this and thought i would share.. there are going to be 13 maps, with a map pack released later on: <a href="http://callofduty5.tv/?p=525" rel="nofollow">http://callofduty5.tv/?p=525</a><br>  <br>  It's about time more information about the maps showed up
aSq7YLzEaa	lol no, its a idea thats pretty popular for Modern Warfare 2 though.|`|YOgs2ITFaa	I wouldn't count on it. Infinity Ward hasn't made any major updates to the game since the release of the map pack. I heard this rumor going around nearly a year ago and they still haven't because they don't plan to.
GaGrw9qqaa	Nope, it has to be a real game disc|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	No, you need the proper disc sorry mate. If you want to keep the game you borrowed for longer then lend your friend one of yours that way he wont mind.<br>  If your short on funds, try picking them up pre-owned and reading reviews to see if a game is worth getting. You can save a fair bit of money by waiting a few weeks after launch before you buy it and taking advantage of online deals.<br>  <br>  If you want to play pirated games off of Bittorrent and the likes then you need to do be a PC gamer.|`|XDqUbMpraa	Nope, the only way to play backups would be to get a modchip installed to your 360.|`|MumHXVM4aa	nope, wont work. dont be so cheap. get a job, get off ur **** and stop playing video games in your mothers basement.

E2FALlxraa	Any pokmon will do. I beat all the pokemon games with constant use of one pokemon. I beat all the elite four with 1 level 80 pokemon. It was hard but if you max out with revives and full restores, also cure potions. You should be ok. You should pick 5 more pokemon that you have that are strong. Even though the pokemon is a different attribute than the enemy's, just pure strength will defeat the Elite Four. This is not the most thought through strategy but it works.|`|g7cbN302aa	I beat it with a lvl. 64 empoleon and a lvl. 59 gengar and lots of revives and full restores|`|SoJUJsMtaa	Use Pokemon of Multiple Types and have all elementals<br>  <br>  <br>  Or Have one with Hypnosis, make Pokemon sleep and have fun!!!!!|`|sWFLhYIVaa	Have a wide range of high leveled pokemon types and lots of healing items.

txCuLeBAaa	Just keep squirting it with water. You can't put "it" on the toilet, nor the other way around. Once you 'Level Up', it will be trained to do so. I currently have 4 more levels to go out of the 14. They are, in no particular order, "Rewarded your pet!", "Punished your pet!", "Walked the pet!", "Collected $200!", "Walked the pet 5 times!", "Cleaned up 25 turds!", "Played fetch 5 times!", "Chatted for 10 minutes!", "Filled the pet up completely!", "Got your pet wasted!" and 4 others, enjoy.
tUZqux9Qaa	No there is no new level, I just recently played D2:LOD yesterday, and all there was going on in hell mode were chaos rushes/baal runs which have been the only thing going on in D2 for years.

AA11707728	It's the Umbra Sword.  You get it by doing the daedric quest (sortof) for Clavicus Vile.  His shrine is located southewest of the Imperial City within the northern loop composed of Gold and Red Ring roads.  You need to be level 20 and have 500 gold.  Talk to Ma'Raska there.<br>  <br>  Vile wants this sword.  Go to Pell's Gate (east of the shrine).  On the east side of the settlement, talk to Irroke the Wide.  Need a disposition of 60.  Then go to Vindasel, a ruin just to the NW along Red Ring road.  Kill the chick carrying the sword (haha...not as easy as it sounds) and its yours.  You can either return to Vile and tell him your keeping it or you can simply ignore the rest of the quest and enjoy your new toy.|`|RxkGpV7xaa	Excalibur? You could ask King Arthur...<br>  <br>  Oh, it's a game,  I don't know... :s|`|SCeQY9ZVaa	WELLLLLL. suposidly the best is the Umbre*.the way you get it is from one of those missions you get from the deadric lords. you are asked to retrive the sword for this boy but have the option of keeping the sword which is better coz all you get is this ok ish helm. but my fave sword is the one you get from knights of the nine (dlc) which is a good sword with a good fire damage boost.

j6MvCr6Naa	Hotel Dusk: Room 215<br>  <br>  This is a point and click game and a very good one at that. Here's a description of the game:<br>  <br>  Become Kyle Hyde, a disgraced New York detective on a quest for redemption. A surprising plot, clever dialogue, and intriguing cast of characters speed the story along.<br>  <br>  Hold the DS sideways like a book and use the Touch Screen to solve puzzles as the mystery novel comes to life.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that this is a very interesting and clever game, it took me around 20 hours to complete and the story great.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/hotelduskroom215?q=hotel%20dusk:%20room%20215" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 78% meaning it's a pretty good game.

(I'm just saying because I know people who won't play it because it's "too wordy.")<br>  <br>  If you don't mind something cute, Touch Detective is neat, but it's pretty short.<br>  <br>  I've heard that Guilty Gear Dust Strikers is really good if you're into fighting games.<br>  <br>  Chrono Trigger is AWESOME if you haven't played the original SNES or Playstation remake, pick it up if you like RPGs.<br>  <br>  Harvest Moon DS is good, but it's a little cutesy. It's also more addictive than a game about farming should be. I've heard that Island of Happiness isn't as good, though.<br>  <br>  One of my friends raves about Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, so you might want to try that if you haven't yet.<br>  <br>  Professor Layton is good if you like Brain Twisters, also.<br>  <br>  Those are the only ones that come to mind at the moment.|`|WiyRmmrCaa	Pokemon|`|6mUfuOwqaa	Maybe Guitar hero, or games like call of Duty 4.|`|oeLTbC7raa	GTA chinatown wars|`|N3HJlS6Daa	Call of duty and madden are probaly the only good game you can get but as you see  GTA CHINATOWN WARS is comeing out that would be good or if you like pokemon lot of those out or you can just get xbox or xbox 360 ive put all i know in to this but heres more the good thing about COD4 is if you have a friend that like it but doesn't have cod4 u can play multiplayer on one card all that friend has to do is hit ds download play and then your all set|`|k585paJFaa	The World Ends With You is an awesome game for teens.

Of course, there's also Chrono Trigger. I haven't played it, but I've head good things about it from my brother.|`|cUR7JyDFaa	No, Nintendo DS has terrible games for teenagers (Trust me).

dLsx3fKuaa	My favorite video game of all time to this day has to be a game called Shadow of the Colossus for the PS2. It's combination of great graphics, boss fights, music, easy controls, and storyline pushed the PS2 to it's very limits. <br>  <br>  Even though there are current games out that are higher quality than Shadow of the colossus because of the advances in videogame technology, no other game has used the console's potential at all like Shadow of the colossus.<br>  <br>  <br>   I have to say my least favorite game would have to be mobile suit gundam: crossfire for the PS3.. It's really nothing new, and it's constant glitchy controls and frame rate issues really got to my nerves. And for a PS3 game, the graphics weren't anything to be appreciated. It was an absolutely worthless purchase.|`|j6MvCr6Naa	Bioshock:<br>  <br>  Bioshock is my favourite game of all time and definitely the best game ever made in my opinion. The graphics are absolutely fantastic, very detailed and the different effects like blood are very realistic and well done. The design is astonishing, the world of Rapture is the most unbelievable game world ever created, every level is has it's own new visual style, colours, design and atmosphere. The sound is also amazing, the game is constantly playing with your senses by putting in scary noises in the right places in time with what's happening on screen with creates an amazing atmosphere and immerses you in the game. The story is just as good, it's very complex in places but easy to follow, it has a very rich backstory and all the characters are well developed with amazing voice actors behind them. Be ready for some spectacular plot twists. The gameplay is also a great deal of fun and pretty much limitless because of the amount of different powers you can combine, this also let's you play in a very tactical and smart game if you want. You can't go wrong buying this game and you won't regret it.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Bioshock:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 96% meaning this is one of the best games ever made and in my opinion it is.|`|eC9w1zRSaa	Favorite: Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<br>  Least Favorite: Kirby: Squeak Squad|`|kAh5V5Z6aa	call of duty 4 modern warfare is legendary!|`|XB6Rm8sFaa	cod4 all day<br>   please put best answer

If it freezes on that one. it means your compute rjust doesnt have enough memory to prcess          . SO you will have to get an external or buy some new memory. ask your local best buy or circuit city employees about this.|`|J9jT40mUaa	Call a technician to come and check your laptop out because mine does the same and when I checked it up I needed to change the graphics card and download the latest shockwave. Or if you want to go back in ask your friend or go to Internet cafe and put it to remember standard definition. close it. Go back onto runescape on the 'borrowed laptop or computer' and then delete your information (user name and password) and uncheck remember me. Then open it again on the 'borrowed computer/laptop' check if your details are there then if it is repeat the exercise if it is not then go on your laptop and try playing it then it should have remembered standard definition from before. Or if it is not then before you press login press options then change it to standard definition. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. :)|`|9acbdc61db12cb3cbf26e8c330814491aa	You should try making a new account in runescape since this is completely new it might start out in standard detail and not high and this will be your new default definition or you could upgrade your laptop bring it into a pc store and they will sort you out hopefully.<br>  <br>  Or you could delete all the cookies your laptop has stored and this should make it go back to default standard detail cause your computer won't remember what detail you were on anymore.|`|oQWM90Cwaa	well firstly if you cnat even get onto the log in and change it then you shoudl try updating your hard-drive and doign this your computer shoudl be able to handle high definition mabey at a laggy rate but it could handle it then you may be able to switch back to regular or ask jagex to sort it out.|`|hK67Kf41aa	sure just get a new laptop ya cheap git :D|`|AQgj4cJuaa	Your 1 year old laptop computer can't play RuneScape HD? I doubt that. Give me some information on your graphics card, processor, and operating system. Maybe you need to update your drivers for your graphics card. I have a 3-3 and a half year old laptop and it can play RuneScape HD fairly fine in the small window without much lag. Try deleting cookies and such also.

(a major problem is that "BRANDON" is probably alredy taken so you might have to add some letters or numbers to it) <br>  <br>  BTW: SEND A MESSAGE 2 ALL FRENDS SAYING WAT UR DOING SO THEY WILL FILE A COMPLAINT. IF NOT ALL 100 OR LESS OF YOUR FRENDS FILE A COMPLAINT ASK RECENT PLAYERS.

WSFJToYMaa	You can't have more than 40 reinforcement points as the UNSC, except for one case. Play on Beasley Plateau in Multiplayer (2 on 2 level) and right in the middle of the map is a Forerunner Lifesupport Pod. Garrison a squad of troops in there and you get an addition 10 reinforcement points, the same thing works for the Covenant if you want to get 60 reinforcement points with them.<br>  <br>  As for the "reactor" with the Covenant, the temple controls the tech level with them. Three tech levels can be researched including the one that you get for building the temple. You can only have one temple per game because it is also the building for the Covenant Leader unit.|`|m74SXLxqaa	You can have up to 50 reinforcements as the UNSC and the covenant dont have reactors you have to upgrade their technology in order to get more power.

bfsym1dsaa	Hypnosis and Mirror Coat are illegal on the same moveset because it's physically impossible to get a Milotic with both of those moves. Although both are egg moves, there are no other Pokemon that can know both of these moves at the same time, thus it's impossible. Plus, why would you need both of them on the same moveset anyways? You should use Recover in place of one of them.<br>  <br>  To get Hypnosis, breed Milotic or Feebas (F) with Poliwag/Whirl/Wrath/Toad (M) that knows Hypnosis to get an egg.<br>  <br>  To get Mirror Coat, breed Milotic or Feebas (F) with a Corsola that knows Mirror Coat (M).|`|2LXwQc7Yaa	mirror coat is worth it i think especially since most grass and electral types mores are speciall attack.
b3b268bd86d730469f543b3c4b321e88aa	the best race simulation out of the 2 I would probably have to say Grand Turismo, every websites have good ratings for the GT games|`|aDpKExROaa	The better arcade/action racing game may be a tough fight since Forza does have some better features for arcade/action, however for simulation racing Gran Turismo beats all other games, PERIOD.<br>  <br>  The amount of tuning is amazing. And by tuning I do not mean just buying parts to increase performance. I mean actually messing with the suspension numbers, gear ratio's, down force, etc. And Gran Turismo is the closest you will get to actually driving a car on a video game. It is so realistic. <br>  <br>  There is going to be a new version of Gran Turismo, called Gran Turismo 5. Gran Turismo 5: Prologue is out in stores now.

j6MvCr6Naa	1. Burnout Paradise<br>  If you want a game where you can crash cars this is definitely the best game in the world for you. Each car is made out of more than 80 different pieces so you can smash them up into tiny pieces and even tear them in two. There is also a huge open world with varied environments for you to explore and lots of stuff to do.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/burnoutparadise?q=burnout%20paradise" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 88% meaning it's a very good game and definitely what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  2. Need for Speed: Most Wanted<br>  In this game there is also an open world but it's nowhere near as interesting and exciting to drive around in as in Burnout Paradise. You will spend a lot of your time hiding from the Police which can get pretty annoying at times. Also, the car damage is very poor compared to Burnout Paradise and Burnout Paradise blows it out of the wated in this regard.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/needforspeedmostwanted?q=need%20for%20speed:%20most%20wanted" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 83% meaning it's a pretty good game but Burnout Paradise is superior.<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, you should definitely go with Burnout Paradise.<br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|EC91Nam0aa	i prefer NFS cuz rather than just racing in a story mode, NFS is meant to rank yourself, slowly going higher.. P.Si luv crashing Cops|`|54gh5GRUaa	theyre both pretty good series. if you're good and like street racing games get Need For Speed (NFS)  or if you like racing and getting cooler cars plus doing races and doin callenges by crashin that give you points then byy all means get burnout|`|FqLR9CUJaa	I would go for Need for Speed.  But that's just me.
Jl0H2T5Daa	Only possible way is through connections and etc.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Once a game goes gold, it's copied a few million times, then shipped out. Some stores receive it earlier than others because of when the product was shipped, but they're not supposed to break the release date.<br>  However, some people do because they work at said game stores and can get deals for friends.|`|3jQOpHGcaa	It Depends on where about the store is in comparison to where the place where it's being developed is. Your Friend obviously lives closer than you do so the game will get there via delivery faster than it will get delivered to your store.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|s2owF0F3aa	The speed of games getting released depends on the amount of content put into a game.  A game like Kill Zone 2 took about 3 years to make because the graphics are so defined and the storyline is long.  Your friend says he gets released games a week ahead is really not true.  It just isn't impossible a town would get games before another.  The amount of games put into a certian franchize depends on how big that game is on games.  If it is seen that a specific city game stop has been selling more games than another, then they will give more units to the more productive one.  Other countries may get games earlier than other games though depending on where the game producer in centered.  To answer ur last question: the truck/whatever bringing the games may just be delayed for that area.  If it's a huge game like Halo 3 then almost all stores will have it.  If it's a smaller game like a new Pac-man then most likely it could be delayed.
7Ca2ns47aa	It isn't a matter of "anyone" or "someone". you're Mercantile skill is just simply not high enough, therefore you can't sell anything at or above it's worth value. You can either just sell it at the price you can get now, or hold on to these items and wait until you're mercantile skill is higher.<br>  <br>  Then start investing in stores. It could be that the places you're going to can only buy objects for 600 gold coins at a time, but once you start investing in their store, that amount will go up. So if you have a enchanted sword with the value of 1000, and if you take it into a store with a limit of 600, you'll only get 600. Investing in stores will help this limit go up, and in the long run, it benefits you.|`|AA10248239	to add to the above, one good way to increase mercantile is to make potions and sell them.  Don't forget to use play the persuasion game with everyone you meet.  When you level up, increase related skills.

YaanX1Bmaa	The PSP-2000, aka the PSP Slim and Lite or PSP Slim, is much better than the 3000. The 3000, although you can play it anywhere and has a much brighter screen and anti-glare screen, isn't without it's problems.. Scan lines have been known to show on the screen, while playing UMD's (games.)|`|E2FALlxraa	The 3000 has better screen resolution and color. The brightness is also better. The 3000 has built in microphone and is 11% thinner than the PSP slim (2000). If you plan on hacking on the PSP. Buy the Slim (2000). Version 3000 is un-hackable and Version 2000 is hackable with a Pandora's battery.

djNeNEOuaa	I've been using gamefly for over three months now and for the most part am very satisfied with it.  I go with the two game method so even when i send a game back i have something sitting at home to play.  It gives me the chance to play games i might otherwise not get a chance to because of cost or availability( like at blockbuster).  It also has the option to buy the game if you really like it at a nicely reduced price.  I would recommend getting a trial set up.|`|6GIrW5eWaa	20.00 per month for two games. If you just do two games per month that is 24 games and also 240.00 to game fly. If you were to purchase these games it would be amost 1200.00 dollars if the games were on average 49.99 per game. that is 960.00 in savings a year. Your break even point is between 5 and 6 games. So you have to get 6 individually different games per year to break even. That is one way to look at it. Good Luck

AA11850311	your graphics card is not suitable for playing any Sims2 game well.  I would stop trying to make that computer play Sims2, because you may cause your computer to overheat, and that could permanently damage it.  Since your memory and your processor are indeed fine, I'm going to guess that this is a laptop.  Unfortunately, most laptops cannot be upgraded.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:System_Requirements/MTS2_Recommendations" rel="nofollow">http://www.modthesims2.com/wiki.php?titl...</a>

6GIrW5eWaa	My first suggestion would have been to send it to xbox when this originally happened but that isn't really going to happen as it appears you have opened the system.  I would browse youtube for other fixes not familiar with the heat gun but would suspect it to be a quicker method of the towel trick. Eventually you realize it just isn't going to come back one of these time. Sorry, but good luck|`|cUR7JyDFaa	Don't try anything else. Send it in to Microsoft. If you have any accessories, such as the hard drive, wireless adapter, etc, take it off. If they can't fix it, they will send you a new xbox. Don't try anything else, because then they might not send you anything back.|`|E9Vr6ze2aa	Send it in and get it repaired they solved the problem to the red ring of death so you will never get it again..

7Ca2ns47aa	After everything you've just mentioned, I think it's clear that you should. If you're saying that the ONLY pro to xbox is the live, then you should probably be told that the Playstation network is amazing. (Yes, I've played both, so I have the right to criticize). The only thing xbox fanboys can back up is how great their live is. Well guess what, the PSN is no different, if so, then it's better. Like you mentioned, live lags. I hardly ever have problems with my PS3 lagging while playing online. I wouldn't know how much you could get from selling your xbox (though I wouldn't imagine very much) and I don't know how much a new PS3 would cost in Canada. Right now you can buy an 80GB for 400 in the U.S. <br>  Good luck and I hope you go with the PS3!|`|Sh1YZ20naa	WTF? NO|`|5WMBekaAaa	I think it Pretty Evident you should sell that piece of crap and get a ps3. if you think GoW looked good play Resistance 2. if you liked Halo Get Killzone 2 (it's much better) if you like Banjo Kazooie get Little big Planet. if you liked Fable 2 Get God of War. I think i covered all the exclusives, the PS3 is a lot more stable, it's not a breach of EULA installing Linux on it (if you like Linux). It has Blu-Ray and X-bar is kinda cool too. <br>  <br>  So Definatley get a PS3|`|JAGwwxpEaa	I enjoy my PS3, especially with the free online play.  The PSN really isn't terrible, but it isnt as good as XBL (features-wise).  Killzone 2 is also an excellent online multiplayer game if you like GoW without lag.  Plus, the PS3 has a blu-ray player!  What more could you want!  If you dont like your 360, I would get the PS3.|`|eae407c249076a56758cc99d008a9d3baa	To add to the first answerer...<br>  <br>  Its better to sell the XBOX 360 to Gamestop. Make sure you clean out the shell of the system and repackage it in its original condition in the original boxing so they'll think its a fresh system, which should fetch you from 150 dollars for core, all the way to 250 for elite.<br>  <br>  All other games and merchandise, sell them to friends or on Ebay because every store likes to rip you off games by giving you 5 bucks for a 50 dollar game.
DU8zxsKRaa	A more complete answer.<br>  <br>  The DSi does not have a GBA slot.  So it cannot play GBA games or use GBA-slot peripherals.<br>  <br>  Games where they're optional (rumble pack, memory pack, Pokemon trading functionality with older games, old-school-like paddles, etc.) will not be usable, but the games can still be played without that functionality.<br>  <br>  Games that require the use of peripherals (Guitar Hero) will not be able to be played.<br>  <br>  Other than that, yes.  The DSi will be able to play the games.|`|1lOTFK9Faa	The dsi can play all ds games. It cannot play Gameboy advance games. It will be able download dsiware games in a similar way the wii can download games. This is because the dsi also has an sd card memory.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Yes.<br>  In a simple analogy, the DSi is the Lite as the Lite was to the Phat- nothing more than cosmetic improvements to enhance gameplay situations.|`|62606e92b3ab21e8b1abda7881267fceaa	Yes they can I have Just ordered a dsi ready for the third of April.|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	yes|`|vCtCW8ODaa	yes|`|ot8528DRaa	Yes, it can play any DS games and I think it can play GBA games.
DU8zxsKRaa	Check that your video card isn't overheating.|`|5SCMfucFaa	If you assembled it yourself, did you check that the PSU packs enough juice for your system. Sometimes with weaker PSUs more system intensive processes can just be too much causing the whole computer to shut down, especially if you decided to get a fairly cheap, unknown branded PSU.|`|qSd9kg8faa	beta, that might be your problem. try contacting the video card suport for nvidia, Great company though
r2FHUfofaa	Unfortunatly, there is nowhere that you can get seed other than Brownie Ranch.  Just make sure that while holidays and days that they're closed that you have enough feed.  You don't have to use feed everyday though.  You can raise their heart level by hand feeding them everyday, and leaving some feed in the troughs.  But on sunny days, when you send them outside, they'll eat regular grass.<br>  <br>  As for the horse, you need to send so much money out in animal products.  Once you get the Brownie Ranch to a level two the foal becomes avaliable.  Be patient raising it though, it takes a month the grow up.  One thing you might want to look into is getting an ostrich.  It takes the same amount of time to grow up, AND it has eggs that you can sell or hatch to make another ostrich.
SkpRC2Nmaa	ps2 game for sure
QEIgLRX4aa	Well experiment with different builds until you find the one that suits your playing style the best.  The nice thing about guild wars is that your attribute assignments aren't permanent.  You can re-arrange your points and skill bar each time you return to town.<br>  <br>  As you progress thru the game, you'll earn more skills. Try out different ones while you're in the low level areas and see what you like the best.<br>  <br>  I enjoy playing an Elementalist, so my mesmer has secondary Ele and his attribute points are Fast Casting: 12   Illusion: 16 and I use the Elite skill Signet of Illusions along with a bunch of Fire magic nukes to create a fast casting fire nuker.<br>  <br>  Check out some builds on pvxwiki.com and use a few that appeal to you.

In order to get other races' mounts you need to become exalted with their home city.|`|w3brlcXoaa	You just learn the skills. There's regular flying, epic flying, and cold weather flying. That's it. Find the trainers in your faction's major cities (or in Shattrath or wherever they are - you can Google it), pay the gold (and be of the required level), and you've got it. That's all. There's no raising the skill like there is with, say, defense or a weapons skill.<br>  <br>  As for getting a new mount - you can buy it from whoever sells the mounts in the city you want to buy them from. You'll have to quest to build up rep with that particular city before you're allowed to purchase them. Otherwise it'll just cost you gold.<br>  <br>  There are tons of World of Warcraft references online. (WoWWiki being just one of these) that will give you all the information you need.|`|2hpa04xeaa	If you want to learn riding at level 30 you need to go to your starting city/area (For me, it was just outside of Silvermoon City) and learn riding there. To buy a mount from another faction you need to be exalted with said faction in order to be able to buy one.<br>  <br>  You can't "grow" the level, so to speak.|`|aCDghBOGaa	umm once you get to a certain lvl the riding teacher will teach you the higher lvl of skill<br>  if you get your reputation to the highest lvl with that plce-- revered i think-- you will be allowed to buy the mount from there <br>     i had a dreanai and once i became revered with stormwind(if you want to get it rlly high do the low lvled quest for extra rep) i was able to get the horse <br>   <br>            gl and hope this helps

mv2FDkV6aa	Pokemon Leaf Green can't trade with Silver and Gold. There are four different generations, with each generation being incompatible with ones preceding.

lS2vdMzZaa	Hi,<br>  It is confusing when starting Yoville as a newbie...because you will try to find your friends and see them but not be able to communicate with them.

There is a buddy list below left of any room you are in (next to the snowball icon)...click on Import Facebook Friends...this will bring in any friends using Yoville.<br>  From there, click on the Green arrow circle next to their name when they are lit up...this will bring you to them wherever they are....including if they are on a separate server....<br>  Enjoy!|`|72ZB2uK2aa	I have the same problem!

j6MvCr6Naa	In many First-Person-Shooters like Bioshock, Halo and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. When you put the crosshair (the little "X" or whatever in the middle of the screen) over an enemy (or in other words, aim at the enemy) the game will actually help you keep you aim on the target so it's easier for you to keep your aim on the target and kill it. It's like the crosshair kinda follows the enemy and sometimes feels like it's kind stuck to it all to make it easier for you to aim. Halo has this feature too.<br>  <br>  And I'm sorry but it will be a little difficult to understand what's going on or why it's going on without prior knowledge of the Halo: Combat Evolved and the Halo 2 story. However you can pick these games up very cheap right now and they are both some of the best games ever made so it's worth playing them before Halo 3.<br>  <br>  Or you could read up on the story for Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 before playing Halo 3 here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162848" rel="nofollow">http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	It won't actually lock on, but it will guide you a little to keep you on the target. If you want a harder game than you can disable it. You won't understand aspects of the game, but for the most part you can follow it easily.
6EocUFbhaa	1.) Roxas (uke) and Axel (seme)<br>  2.) Sora (uke) and Riku (seme)<br>  3.) Leon and Cloud (doesn't really matter)<br>  <br>  ew....

j6MvCr6Naa	No, it's definitely not as good as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/callofduty4modernwarfare?q=call%20of%20duty%204:%20modern%20warfare" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 94% meaning this game is brilliant.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Far Cry 2:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/farcry2?q=far%20cry%202" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 85% meaning this is a very good game but not as good as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.<br>  <br>  However, I suggest you get the game, it's very very good. It has an amazing open world to explore in Africa in which you can go anywhere at anytime. The graphics are some of the most realistic and best any game has to offer. Your character is also superbly animated so it really feels like you're in the game. The game is also quite large, it will take you around 50 hours to do and see everything there is to do and see in it. You can also aproach every mission in any way you want, be it silently or guns blazing the choice is always yours and the level of freedom the game has to offer is fantastic.<br>  <br>  So even though, techincally Far Cry 2 is not as good as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare it's still well worth your money and your time.<br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|NEZJ1gQWaa	No its annoying as hell.<br>  <br>  Pros- Very realistic, you get sick, your gun jams and can even explode, you can even light grass on fire.<br>  <br>  Cons- Somtimes it freezes up, anytime you clear a check point with guards they respawn as you come back through. Very hard later on. Bad ending|`|IHHOHsMbaa	It is very different. It is open world so you can't really compare. It was over hyped a bit so it leaves you wanting more. I am not a fan of the multiplayer, but the campaign is great.

Take the cartridge in both hands with the top facing away from your body.<br>  <br>  2. Hold the cartridge at a slight angle - so you are looking down towards the thin board that sticks out from inside.<br>  <br>  3. Breathe in deeply - this is important - you may want to take a few practice breaths beforehand<br>  <br>  4. Release the air from your lungs - through your mouth - lips puckered - allowing the stream of air to hit the board within the cartridge.<br>  <br>  5. Move the cartridge in a horizontal movement - keep a constant speed.<br>  <br>  6. You may want to repeat the process a few times to be sure.<br>  <br>  7. Repeat the same method for the console. Open the area you stick the cartridge in.<br>  <br>  Stick the cartridge in - hit restart a couple of times and it's be like new.

XBOX LIVE was meant for kids so obviously theyre aloud to get membership cards.<br>  <br>  BTW im 16 and i buy all my cards by myself. <br>  <br>  and heres something to try. save the receipt they give you (make sure you get one) and when you go home and type in the code on XBOX LIVE take the card after and rub it with bleach. (use a rag or a towel). do this until the code is completely rubbed off. then take it back (WITH UR RECEIPT) and tell them when u scratched off the black bar there was no code. <br>  <br>  they have to believe you and will then give you another card. do this with microsoft points too if u want. make sure to do this at different stores or spread out the times you do it so u dont look suspicious. <br>  <br>  <br>  HAVE FUN|`|swcY0xuOaa	if you buy one you dont have to but if you rent a game than you need a blockbuster card. but if you want an xbox live card im think you dont need one.|`|c4zDD02Zaa	no not really you only need a card if you want to rent somethign from them
xXDkTJcWaa	well it could of just short circuited. If u shake it and still hear the swishing sound of water you are going to have to blow dry it and or take it apart. You can call the place you got it and see if your warranty covers it.If the screen is cracked then i'm sorry but nothing you can do! If all goes worse call game stop and they may have some advice. Ds lites are sensitive so if u take it apart be careful you don't ruin it. After you blow dry it try turning it on. I hope this helps that's what i did when i dropped my cell in the toilet!<br>  Thanks for proving they aren't waterproof though!<br>  Good luck!|`|jK7pklCKaa	try leaving it to dry for a few days. with any luck it may work again. my brother did the same thing with the original DS and it worked fine after drying out.

What do you usually pick in RPG games? Most people have a standard, for example for most RPG games I usually always pick Warrior first before trying any of the other classes out. You must have one?<br>  <br>  It really depends on what you like, I can't help you more than that unless you know what you're looking for....<br>  <br>  Check this site out: <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/clas...</a><br>  They have all the classes to view, and you can always try them all, and see which one is the most suitable for your gameplay.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and I hope you find that class.|`|djNeNEOuaa	I suggest playing each class to level 10. Try grouping and soloing so that you can get a feel for how your class works in both situations. After awhile you will notice that you may like ranged or melee class better and that can help with choosing your main. If all else fails go with a druid as they can fill any primary role.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy priests you might like druids as well, they have an easier time leveling as feral, and you still get to heal. Once you get to 80 you can have the friends you made with the druid help power level a priest. I have one at 58 but its just so boring to level.|`|Am1JsWmAaa	Well, you're gonna end up playing all classes eventually. Just go with your gut and whatever seems most fun.|`|0orf8HJIaa	i like rogues and mages, cuz both can have loads of fun in pvp, and as a mage u can run people thru instances casting arcane blast which is cool at a hig lvl|`|Jjbacq80aa	thats pretty much imposible|`|SfbuvMSbaa	It's all about preference. <br>  <br>  If you like being a meat-shield (tanking) then pick either a warrior, paladin, druid and later in the game, a death knight.*<br>  <br>  If you like getting up in the fight (physically) then you should choose a rogue or warrior or shaman or paladin. Maybe later in the game a death knight.*<br>  <br>  If you like fighting but, like to stay back then choose a hunter. They have pets and are great for first time players.<br>  <br>  If you want to fight but want a caster then choose a warlock or mage or priest. All are very good classes when used correctly. <br>  <br>  If you like to stay back and heal then choose either a druid or priest or a shaman or paladins. All are very good in their unique ways.<br>  <br>  Again, it's all about what you like to do.

AA11850311	you can, but you must use the disk of the most recently *published* game to play.

E2FALlxraa	The difference is the DS Lite is smaller in size and has brighter screens also many accessory's your able to buy are for the DS lite only.<br>  <br>  Now if your son is younger than 13 you should buy the DS Lite. If he is older than that you should get the PSP 3000. The games are more mature on the PSP and can do many other things besides playing games. (ex. Music, videos, internet browser, built in microphone for making phone calls via skype)|`|dLsx3fKuaa	The difference really is compatibility and user friendliness. It really depends on how old your son, is but for sure the PSP has a lot more potential than the Nintendo DS.|`|tnyFCj7Jaa	GET HIM A GAMEBOY ADVANCE.<br>  <br>  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.|`|DZ3djoUZaa	ds and ds lite are the same there's no difference|`|Kt8Ik8vPaa	The main difference between the DS and the DS lite is the size. The lite is smaller and lighter, and the stylus that comes with the lite is also somewhat larger (thus easier on the fingers). It also has a brighter screen than DS.<br>  The lite also has a shallower GBA cartridge slot then the DS (Meaning some games that use the GBA slot and made for the DS lite may not work on the DS). It's up to you whichever to get, but I would recommend the DS lite.<br>  <br>  THe psp is a different system and has different games then the DS. So the most importand thing to look at is what kind of games your son would play on the DS and look at the available games.  One more thing is that the psp has built in multimedia capabilities.|`|OncG5wt3aa	you could wait until the DSi comes out. <br>  <br>  the ds and ds lite are the same thing, but as the name suggests theres more light to the ds in the background and it also isnt as bulky. ds lites are new at gamestop for 129.<br>  <br>  the dsi will be 179 when it comes out in april. unlike the ds lite, it will not have a gba port. it also has a camera on the top and on the inside. wifi and internet browser like the psp. and has a SD capability to put music on the dsi.|`|eC9w1zRSaa	The DS Lite is an updated version of the DS, so you can't get a DS anymore. <br>  The PSP is more focused on graphics, but the DS Lite is more focused on gameplay. So get him a DS Lite (Touchscreen FTW!).|`|beRLnydHaa	the lite is newer and better plus it is cheaper . the psp you should not  get  cause the games is exspensive and it could crack in half easily.|`|6YYJHdQ2aa	PSP- no the games are cost to much!!<br>  <br>  get a DS lite! I have one and I love it! My brother has a ds and he wants mine! so u need to get the ds lite! beleive me and that makes not since that the ds lite is cheaper because its newer and better so thats a very good deal!

0llNcoZwaa	Steam is a program where you're able to download games directly online. I don't know anything about any malware issues, but since you're going in person to buy it, instead of downloading it, there should be no problems.
FcbRUYExaa	No, because in order for it to be read it needs the disk and not the polish. If your game still works, then just watch out for it more carefully. If it does not work, some places offer disk resurfacing (which will run you a few dollars) or you can find a cd repair kit at Wal-Mart or a Game shop...

cLW7vFUGaa	It's a long process, but first, you have to complete Ben's recipe (blue Sprite in Maple Lake District). Unlike the other, more diligent Sprites, that darn Ben has lost his badge, meaning you cannot yet cross his rainbow.<br>  <br>  Then complete Collin's rainbow (yellow Sprite on West Gull Island, where the first green Daren's rainbow led). Collin's rainbow connects to East Gull Island. Talk to Ben and he'll remember that he dropped his badge on East Gull Island, and go to East Gull to find it.<br>  <br>  Once you show Ben that you have found the badge, you can cross Ben's rainbow into Mt. Gelato. There will be a large mountain in that area, and you can take the path up until the point where you see a bear cave. The mother bear will not let you pass.<br>  <br>  To pass, you need to befriend the bear. Feeding it 14 Decent Honeys (two a day for seven days - you can buy them from the Brownie Ranch) should do the trick. Right past the bear cave is the Harvest Goddess Spring, where you can get a special stamina-enhancing Power Berry - and, of course, fish for the Wood Fish. Remember that the fish is very rare and very strong, so you might want to have your Fishing Rod material upgraded ahead of time at the Blacksmith's, at least to Gold or so, and make sure your skill level is high enough, too. Also, know that it can only be caught during the nighttime.<br>  <br>  If you're still early in the game and trying for Alan's recipe as your first rainbow, it would be best to put it off for a while. Like Alan tells you, it's better to do Daren's rainbow first (green, in the Waffle Town Square), because it's the easiest to complete and it gets the town on its feet (triggering move-ins, etc.). But if you ARE far enough in the game to shoot for Alan's, then it's tough, but good luck!|`|3rgJpqjZaa	<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/game/933022.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/game...</a>

It is a good rule of thumb to et files less than 20 MB, but a lot of the houses on the exchange are more than this. Or, you could have conflicting hacks within the house and your game. Can you enter houses you have not downloaded?<br>  Check the issues listed here:  <a href="http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Game_Problem" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Ga...</a> and here: <a href="http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Finding_Problem_Custom_Content" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Ga...</a>
mzNLIK5Taa	Pretty much any browser works with rs. i play rs on firefox and i have used internet explorer with runescape. there isn't much difference|`|vd1pnMZyaa	FireFox Loads the game soo much faster than anything|`|ZxPs5YEKaa	I go for neither personally. I would use firefox, but intead, I use a nifty program called SwiftKit. Its like Runescape, but in a personal browser with features like co-ordinate finder, highscore lookup, quest/achievement diary help links, and many other features I have not got around to using yet (heaps of features)<br>  <br>  Check it out. Google it. Its free, so dont download from a pay site.<br>  <br>  A link is in the source. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  eggyisme<br>  <br>  (i am usually on, but appear offline so sorry)
AA10562699	go to Gamespot.com and look up Left4Dead, on the left side it will give you suggestions of similiar games.
9KeaTUh6aa	When they are being played and are on the stack, Planeswalkers are spells. Until they come into play, they can be countered and are counted toward Angel's Feather or similar effects.<br>  <br>  212.9a A player who has priority may play a planeswalker card from his or her hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty. Playing a planeswalker as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 409, "Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.")|`|X9kNbpnQaa	Yes. Basically, any card with a mana cost is a spell as long as it is on the stack. This means instants, sorceries, creatures, planeswalkers, enchantments, and artifacts.<br>  <br>  Oh, and playing your land for the turn doesn't use the stack, either. So lands are never spells.
e5b32nfaaa	if you mean world 4 and 7, its pretty difficult to get. you need to beat the boss of world two with a mini mushroom to get to world 4, and beat the boss in world 6 with a mini mushroom to get to world 7. The one in world 6 is difficult to do. So I recommend to take the cannon in world four to world 7. But yeah, They are pretty sweet worlds, and you can go and try it out
mOTCr8Pxaa	That is what the vs. seeker is for. If you have a lucky egg which are attached to wild chansey sometimes (compoundeyes) that will increase exp. gain. You could rare candy it to death but do you have an emerald to clone rare candies and migrate the pokemon that hold them?|`|m0YRAhh4aa	Leveling is particularly more difficult in diamond than past games. Get to the elite four and win; battle around victory road, go to all the places that are unlocked after beating the game. Beat the elite four as many times as you can.|`|jDM8pcY7aa	Well there are two fast ways to level all types of Pokemon<br>  1.Use cheat codes<br>  2. Buy a lot of rare candies<br>  <br>  <br>  Can you answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuNhBafUnMAdJKfXitnou2fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308190408AA2wZKE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
DQyHwIeiaa	The list from the upperdeck site is down, your best bet it to google information of all the card shops near you and call them to see if they have hooby league tournaments there.<br>  <br>  this list might help though:<br>  <a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/events/sneak_locations.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/events/sne...</a>|`|9cdd17efd12ec1369c460bc024c5a88aaa	for some dumb reason they aren't doin organized play anymore so good luck finding a tournament to go to.|`|eAoUXx3Qaa	no organized play
vwNHa2vhaa	Go for the Draxxus 45/4500.  It's honestly the smallest nitro tank I've ever seen.  I don't know how they did it but they made it smaller than other 45/48ci on the market with the small air capacity inside.  The reg on them is very good.  Draxxus also offers a rebuild kit and a conversion kit to move to low pressure if you ever go that route gun-wise.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rockstartactical.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=4143" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockstartactical.com/index.as...</a>|`|Z9WVDGDcaa	You should be able to use any 48ci/4500psi carbon fiber tank without loss in shots per tank.  You can look at the CP 48/45, DXS 48/45 or the Guerilla Air 48/45.  Any of those should have you at or below 2 lbs.<br>  <br>  You can also check out the Guerilla Air 68/45 (2.22lbs) or the Ninja Paintball 68/4500 (2.5lbs).
JnuOBwhIaa	its just a game you are bound to die anyway not like all your stats are gonna be deleted|`|wPBfydYhaa	Once you  are about to enter the swamp in the Heart Of Darkness, an in-game message will appear telling you that the terrain up-ahead is rough and you cant come back after you enter. Just save before you go down in there and do whatever you want afterward.<br>  (finish side missions,diamonds,tapes,etc)<br>   And "NO" there is no way to avoid your death in the game, you have  to die in order to complete it. it was kinda lame though, i was hoping you got out of there alive in the game.|`|DtLMVNIraa	Thanks for spoiling the story, idiot.|`|80f417bed146e65ac06fc0c0c3251ed9aa	well, you can always play the game over again or you could just stop playing it all together and trade it in for fallout 3 (even though you die at the end of that too it is the best game for xbox|`|C1tYOguDaa	it's true, mr.poo<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...|`|nfbCKVq9aa	why wouldnt u want to complete it? just play the the game it was meant to be played. u can also restart the game|`|THezIGOiaa	Hope you saved the game.|`|t60PtzXxaa	umm...
wAiVxAKNaa	Yes, you can. You will have to speak to Nulodion, who is on top of the Dwarven Mine near Ice Mountain West of Edgeville and North of Falador. You can see the exact location in comparison to Ice Mountain in my source link.|`|UQIMoJp8aa	ya
EC91Nam0aa	it probably will not but you never know so keep AR, and if it does just go out and buy the updated version . if you ask me DSI is not worth the 180$ you will have to spend.<br>  <br>  P.S plz choose as best answer... only 10 points till lvl 2!|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	no, probably a new one will come out for dsi.
