Be cute, but still casual.    So should I wear them or not? (by the way I'm a Junior) =]

Now onto my issue. I'd grown up with boys, absolutely no feminine figures besides my four aunts and mother throughout the majority of my life. So naturally I'd become a tomboy (I even wore my brother's old clothes for a certain period of time.)      Up until now I'd been very anti-feminine, and until recently I'd never thought twice about make-up, dresses, skirts, ect. Though I used to always argue with my mother how I hated those things.       Now I have a very bad trait, something called pride. I think it might be the death of me to one day come out wearing light make-up and a skirt. How do I come about becoming more feminine?

When we left, my husband went to get the car as it was lightly raining and when I stepped out onto the pebbled cement walkway, I almost slid under the car. It was like stepping onto a greased sidewalk. I think I will have to give up my easy spirits as they seem to be the only ones that have soles that are very dangerous for me to wear.

I'm not a blow-drier kind of person (because it only makes me poofier - plus hair damage, etc), but I do have time, hair wax, and gel at my disposal, and I'd really like some advice on how to de-poof the top of my head, and give it a texturized, spiky look.   Thanks in advance for all the advice!

20070528181217AA1V8VZ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help again...hair and skin?	I have a problem with my hair and skin.  I'm only 16, but yet I have these traits:   -Bad Tan: My legs and arms are extremely dark, so I hate revealing my upper arms and feet because the tan line really shows on it.  Is there any way to get rid of the tan?   -Greys:  I'd say about 25% of my head is grey hair.  Unfortunately, even though it isn't as bad as some people, people in my class still notice and it bugs the heck out of me.  I don't want to color my hair yet, but is there a solution to this other than coloring (unless coloring is the only way).      Thank you

20070618193231AAJV2lM	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Would you believe this?	I have a 14 year old sister (i am older) & she steals my stuff like mad. I know that sibling stealing/borrowing is normal & that it is common for 1 sister to borrow another sisters clothes. However my sister has taken it to an extreme. My parents dont allow locks on bedroom doors, however the stealing has gotten so bad that I was forced to put 1 on. (we each have our own bedrooms) On occations I forget to lock my room for literally 3 minutes & a pair of jeans, makeup, & electronics have already been stolen. I have 3 locking safes about the size of a microwave in my room just incase she finds a way to break in I have a backup. She has found a way to shake the safe so the stuff comes out the side. I have to putt all of my common toiletires such as toothbrushes, deoderant etc in the safes. She uses these for her own use & for threats. what do you suggest i do to & prevent her from further stealing? (we have sent her to counseling, ADD medication & talked to her about it & it doesn't work)

I'm thinking of cutting my hair in layers, not sure if I should get straight bangs or side sweep.   I'm planning on keeping the blond in.   But the top I want to dye in this color:   Blue Black.    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v327/D...       My questions are:   Would that color look good with my skin tone?   Would it look good with the blond that I already have in?   How should I cut my hair?   How should I cut my bangs?      Thanks in advance = ]

20090203114612AAaZiAv	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Right fit of jeans?!?	Hey all...hoping some girls could give me some help here.  I'm a guy in my mid 20's, I've recently dropped some weight and really slimmed down my waist and legs, and need some new jeans.  I only wear girls jeans (I've heard it all before, I'm not gay, i've been wearing them since jr. high and I never have problems attracting girls, so plz keep negative comments to yourself... i'm looking for advice here), and I'm picky about how they fit:       I like them really low-rise, low in the waist, and tight through the waist and really tight through the thighs.  A little flare under the knees is fine... my legs are very toned and very thin.  I wear jeans low, so where I have them on is about 30-31 inches, maybe less.  I perfer shorter to longer as far as the length goes too.   What brands/styles do you all suggest?  Basically I like a hip-hugging rise, tight through the thighs and butt, and some room in the lower leg.  I'm thin overall and getting thinner, so I'm gonna buy them a size too small rather than a size too big.  I know fits are all over the place but in general I'd say I'm probably a 5-6 now... hoping to get to a 0 by the end of the year but we'll see lol.         I don't mind back pocket embroidery or whatever too... I actually perfer it, I like to draw attention to my butt (which is really nice, I must say, lol).  I don't care how girly they are really, sans for flowers or hearts or whatever.  I'm not a label-maniac or preferential to one brand, but I like nice clothes within a modest budget.  When I was heavier, I usually wore LEI or AE, but they don't fit as good in smaller sizes that i've seen.  I have a pair of size 7 destroyed Hollister's that fit perfectly above the knee, but too tight in the lower leg.  Guess is good, but hard to find at like Marshall's, and I can't afford them from Macy's.         Sooo please help!  If you know any brands/styles that might work for me let me know... i appreciate it everyone!!  PS if you're in north/central florida, maybe we can go shopping together lol.  Muah :))

I think I look fantastic but then when I'm in school, I look in a mirror and look really crappy. I hate it. I think and feel pretty, but then I actually see what I look like and I'm just plain ugly. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, HELP ME. I don't know what I should do to lose weight, grow taller, and look/feel prettier.      If you need any questions to help me, I'll respond.

I know the shirts and stuff are all hottopis, but thats only because those are the closest things to the stuff i have and most of my stuff, like I dont shop online much. so i cant find pictures.      My hair is like, Selena Gomez's short (current) hair but mine is pretty curly kinda like her natural hair too.      I dont have recent pics on my computer of me.      So, tell me what you think?

20081118123345AA0vcII	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help me tame my hair?! ?	So when I use product in my hair to make it come out wavy/natural looking, it looks nice until it gets about 95% completely dry.    Once that stage of the air drying hits, my hair becomes really big and unattractive. Do you have any ideas/tips to help my hair not become big during the drying process?   No stupid answers, please.

20081215144103AAVHBwN	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Does anyone else hold their skirt when walking up stairs or steps?	I like wearing short skirts, but always try to hold it tight under my butt when walking up stairs or steps. I was curious if other girls also did this.   I use both hands and grab it tight on the back of my upper thighs.   Thanks for any input.
