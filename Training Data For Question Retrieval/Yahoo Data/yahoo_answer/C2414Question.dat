Love her eyes, love her smile, Just knowing her is worthwhile, To wait for that time of day, Just write and say... Life is will be never the same, All because I know your name, Something I know will be, A happy, awesome memory. In life, we always find, Something rare in time, Something so sweet, so true, And that something is you. Even know, I know, Where ever I go, She will be there forevermore, That I know for sure... I hope you like it... P.S. The first letter of every verse spells something...             Well,what to say... Hope this will do...  Anywhere I go, There is someone I know, Someone I can say, I'm glad I met that day. Love her eyes, love her smile, Everything is worthwhile, To wait a day, or so, Just to let her know... Like a flower, a rose of red, Her beauty is more then just said. A smile filled with grace, Chases those gray days. I will never forget, What I've said, what I've meant, No matter where yo are, I hold this memory at heart. Everyday from here, I will hold dear, Every moment, every word, Cuz you're an amazing girl. Well, I hope you like... P.S. The first letter of every verse spells something...

20080322035842AATICP5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why "The Secret" worked one time but it didn't work for this time?	it worked for the very first time i put it into the test, i was so happy and i thought, oh my god, this can really change my life.   But, when I asked for the second time, it did not work, it turn out to be horrible.   This is what I asked for, I asked for a happy birthday because my family is not here with me as I am studying here own my own. I did not tell any of my friends as I want to spend it own my own. So what I ask for was to be happy on that day and nothing could ruin it.   Instead, my day was ruin, I saw a person that I really dislike, the guy at a coffee shop was so rude and bitched at me and many more.   Why has this happened? Did I not use 'the secret' properly?

Normally, right before the picture is taken, someone slaps me really hard, and I wince from the pain.      Usually, it looks like whoever hit me has just patted me on the back, or is just resting their hand on me in a relaxed way, but it always looks like I am clinched over and squinting.      How can I prepare myself for getting hit right before someone takes a photograph of me? Why do people hit me, anyways? It's not the same person who hits me, either. It has been my dad, uncle, sister, a couple friends, and my grandpa as well.      Why do I always get hit on the same spot, my right shoulder blade, too?      Should I try to put some purple dye on my back, so if someone hits me, the dye will leak through my shirt and get on their hand?

20061202053045AA8lEGI	Arts & Humanities;History	Warum dieser Unterschied zwischen faschistischen(nationalsoziali… und kommunistischen Systemen?	Es ist doch offenkundig: In ihrer Struktur und Herrschaftsausübung sind diese Systeme sich mehr als ?hnlich.   Doch eins wundert mich:   Faschistische Systeme scheinen zwangsl?ufig - wenn sie l?ngere Zeit existieren wollen - expandieren zu müssen. Der Herrscher, der durch Terror an die Macht gelangt, muss sein System des Terrors zum Machterhalt aufrecht erhalten und - meistens das Volk durch Expansionismus von den Missst?nden IM Land abhalten.  (Beispiel: Mussolini-Italien, Hitler-Deutschland usw.)   Das ist aber anders bei kommunistischen/sozialistischen Systemen: Hier gibt es viele Gegenbeispiele, die inzwischen seit Jahrzehnten ohne Krieg sind: Beispiele sind Kuba, China (war bis vor ca. 2 Jahrzehnten ja auch noch RICHTIG kommunistisch), Nordkorea.   Warum dieser Unterschied? Wie schaffen es kommunistische Machthaber, das Volk bei Laune zu halten, ohne expandieren zu müssen?

My lady's presence makes the roses red,    Because to see her lips they blush for shame. The lily's leaves, for envy, pale became,    And her white hands in them this envy bred.    The marigold the leaves abroad doth spread,    Because the sun's and her power is the same.    The violet of purple colour came.    Dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed.    In brief: all flowers from her their virtue take;    From her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed;    The living heat which her eyebeams doth make    Warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed.    The rain, wherewith she watereth the flowers,    Falls from mine eyes, which she dissolves in showers.

Ok so I had an assignment to write a story through journal entries and it had to be a minimum of 15 entries and the main part of the assignment, is that the main character had to have a secret that they built up to sharing that was somthing that noone knew and they didnt want them to find out etc.    I totally built up to it, but I cant think of anything that is a good enough secret. The story is about a girl in high school (a junior) that moves to a new town. It is a little surf community. She never lets anyone come over to her house or drive her home etc and is always making excuses. She finally shared the secret with her bf, and now she is going to tell her friends about it as a personal gift to him because he wanted her to stop hiding and lying to people about it. I need something that would fit into this scenario. Thanks so much!?

Why do we put apples into pie-shaped forms?      The reason is simple, Dalrymple.   We fit what we get,   the rest we omit.      *****

It felt like I was frozen in time.    "Amy, we're ready." said Mrs.Cross-wood ( like fart-wood to me ) sarcastically trying to make me feel guilty for goofing off in class.     The chalk was safely in my palm now. It was one of her tough math problems, this time it was 57684 divided by 58674948.65 tough right I didn't even know that it is a divisible number sentence.    How can I think myself out of this, she wondered and then she got it.                             How is that? If this is a good piece I will give out the rest of the story.

All I remember was that it involved an Irish girl (in her 20's) who moved back to florida and She inherited her family's estate in ireland or florida... I believe florida and her grandfather died when she was a little girl and came to her as a ghost but she didn't remember the incident and then years later for fun they had a seance with friends and they conjoured up a spirit (who turned out to be her grandfather) but it was warning her of a murder that will take place and she lives by herself and her cousins comes to visit from time to time and then her childhood friend becomes a detective and tries to protect her... If I remember correctly, her cousin was involved with the murder. She also had a dog who she adopted for protection but it turned out to be a little dog but it always bark when a stranger is outside of the houseThe place in florida that took place was outside of orlando I believe (I hate not being sure!) If anyone can help I would be forever thankful. oh and the author is most likely a woman she could have an irish name too... and the book came out within the last 5 years and it is one of those "pocketbooks"

I love to embrace you.   You hold me and I feel   You tremble slightly    because I can tell you don’t   Want to hold me too tight for fear   You may either crush me,    or never let me go.      I love to make love to you.   Our bodies fit together   Like we were once the same physical being   Separated by eons of evolution   Brought back together by chance.      I love to talk to you.   Your words, whether agreeing or conflicting   Are spoken so harmoniously   Your musical modulations   Could serenade or lull me to sleep.      It had a last stanza but I didn't want to share it. And I hate the "make love to you" part, but some of the words in that stanza work.

The moral high ground is where they stayed.   Jack did tumble down, and he knew purpose.   He knew the paradox. He expected self-jettison.   There's no other way to preserve self-respect,   devoid of sentiment and sentiment and sentiment   and sentiment and sentiment and sentiment and sentiment   and sediment.

20090205133401AA0vrlO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A question from The Unbearable Lightness of Being (but it doesn't require you to have previously read it)?	As the title states, anyone can answer this question, even if you haven't read the book "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." The question comes from Part 5 (Lightness and Weight), chapter 16. The author, Milan Kundera, writes:      "Several days later, he was struck by another thought, which I record here as an addendum to the preceding chapter: Somewhere out in space there was a planet where all people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on earth and of all the experience they had amassed here.    "And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives.   "And perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one degree (one life) more mature.    "That was Tomas's version of eternal return.   "Of course we here on earth (planet number one, the planet of inexperience) can only fabricate vague fantasies of what will happen to man on these other planets. Will he be wiser? Is maturity within man's power? Can he attain it through repetition?    "Only from the perspective of such a utopia is it possible to use the concepts of pessimism and optimism with full justification: an optimist is someone who thinks that on planet number five the history of mankind will be less bloody. A pessimist is one who thinks otherwise."      What do you think?      My musings:      Personally, I thought this was incredibly interesting. I tend to lean more to the side of the pessimists myself. I think it would get bloodier over time. But at the same time I think, like insects that have developed immunities to certain kinds of pesticides, we would become hardened to the violence and become numbed to it's increasing devastation.      I wonder how we would come into such a world. Would we be born? And if so, of whom? Our parents? What if, knowing what they know now, our parents choose different courses of action than the ones they chose in this first world and our parents never meet each other in the second life? Keep in mind, for those of you who have read the book, that Tomas and Tereza only met each other because a very specific sequence of events took place at the exact time that the two people's lives happened to have crossed--which I assume to be the case in all happenings in life.       What about suicide? I would think that people would be killing themselves very rapidly. Whenever someone encounters a terrible situation, because they have the knowledge that they will have another try at life on the next planet, they might remove themselves from the world they currently inhabit.      What about religion? If another planet is what awaits us after death, what impact would that have on people's religions? Would it be a positive impact or a negative one?      Anyway, I could go on and on but I'm interested to hear what others of you have to say, so I'll shut up now and let the rest of you (who bothered to read at least some of this long post) give your views.

20090203032041AAIBhLM	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Armenian origin of surname?	I am a greek citizen living in Athens and my surname is Sourtaggias. The name is extremely rare, and in fact the only people who have it are my close relatives (five families). No one can trace the origins and the only thing certain is that it's not Greek. Speculations were almost always pointed towards armenian origin and maybe the original name was something like Surtangian, or Surtayian, or Surtajian...A common characteristic of that side of my family (my father's side) is that they have all light skin colour with almost blondish hair and bluish or greenish eyes contrary to my mother's side (which is typically greek) and she has a darker complex.    Would you be able to suggest an armenian origin or eliminate a possible link?  Thank you for your patience.

An analogy is made between hell and the castle. When Macduff and Lennox enter the castle, it is as if they are entering hell. Would this be irony or dramatic irony? The audience knows that Macbeth has already killed Duncan and that Macduff and Lennox are about to figure this out too--so would that make it dramatic irony since the audience knows something the characters don't?

20090205160011AAzEu3k	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this story?	An Iranian mother moves with herself and two daughters (Azadeh and Jaleh) to dearborn, michigan. she never really settles in, and hates the fact that her daughters aren't growing up "Iranian". After twelve years in America, mom is fed up. She's almost always grumpy and stressed-out. She leaves for the grocery store on one particularly bad day and has a heart attack at the wheel. She drives her car into a light pole, and dies.    The daughters (12 and 16) are put into foster care until Azadeh (16) becomes a legal adult. then, she takes Jaleh and gets into a college on scholarships.       That is basically the background for the story. Then, Azadeh gets hit by a car while crossing the road, and is pronounced brain-dead. Jaleh signs the papers to have Azadeh's heart donated.   When Jaleh eventually meets the family of the little girl who received Azadeh's heart, she finds out that they are as "un-Iranian" as a family can be. She know s that this is a racist statement, but she also knows that her mother would be mortified. the fact that her oldest daughter's heart is working inside an "American" girl would give her a second heart attack. The family invites Jaleh to stay with them, saying that she is almost like a sister to their daughter.   The rest of the story is just about Jaleh finally accepting that she has lost the roots of her Iranian heritage, but it must be carried on, even though she is living far, far away from The Homeland.

If it wasn't, do you wish it had been mandatory?

20090205162829AAwQEkO	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Why am I not able to earn anything?	I mean, I constantly hear stories about how people start earning even when they're just 15 or 16. One of my friends fixed wires for houses and earned (as he said) about 1200 dollars a month. One of my other friends started a band and earned whatever he could out of three albums he had. If I ask any other person, they usually have a side job. Why the hell am I not able to find anything? Give me some hints, please? I tried asking at every other store in teh area if they had a vacancy. I tried asking if they could even give home-based jobs (such as data-entry for maybe a list of people they serve or anything, idk, but data entry of some sort). What am I missing out here? What am I not looking at? Even the "entire" internet (wiht my skills) seems to fail me at finding a job, or a way to earn money, if put other way. Any hints or tips, really would be appreciated. Anything. (I am not in need of a psychiatrist; this question is at some two other places in the hope of getting _someone_ to answer.)
