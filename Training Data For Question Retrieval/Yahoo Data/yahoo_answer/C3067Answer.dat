5cb3203beddea06956c949059fe5dfebaa	I am getting married in May of this year and I was in the same boat as you. I was looking for a fairly inexpensive venue to have my reception. I stumbled upon the Ridgewood Woman's Club in Bergen County. The place is beautiful. They have white walls and hardwood floors.  The only thing is they do not provide food, but they allow you to bring your own food. The have a newly renovated kitchen and you can not beat the price.  For the price, you should still have money left over to cook your own food or hire a caterer. Good luck and best wishes to you and your husband.

AS3y7kDAaa	Are you talking Employment agencies? If so, here's a few listed below. ;-)<br>  <br>  Sakson & Taylor, an Aquent company (206) 923-8133 - 1109 N 36th St, Seattle, WA<br>  Cobos Group (206) 438-4606 - 1001 4th Ave Plaza Ste 3200, Seattle, WA<br>  ORM Staffing (206) 438-4607 - 5700 6th Ave S Suite 220, Seattle, WA<br>  <br>  Hope those help!|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	I used Account temps, but it would depend what you were looking for. A travel agent or employment agent would be entirely different.

5rn0fI5Yaa	try Staples Business Depot
bmtbuxn3aa	Your best bet is Southpark Mall. There is a Nordstrom and a Neimen's there. I believe there is also a Jessica McClintock. That's where I got all my prom and sorority formal dresses.
2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	I worked for Bank of America and the employees would talk about how well Wells Fargo treated their people and that they started with higher pay.  BoA was good, with management etc.. but pay was about $12/hr for a call center.|`|MMYY2cj9aa	Wells Fargo for sure. They actually seem to care about the customers, seems pretty reliable.|`|gXRpOzhGaa	Wells Fargo or Chase are the two. Wells Fargo just bought out Wachovia and Chase just Bought out Washington Mutual. So I think stability is for sure one thing you need to look at. The Bank of America is not looking too stable and they are not "acquiring" and they've changed names so many times themselves... Not stable.  <br>  <br>  The starting pay at Chase is in the 12.00 range, The Wells Fargo is about the same... if you are in College and you start out as a personal banker, you may get more depending on how deep your college level is and if you are going to be a personal banker or if you are going to do something in consumer lending. Really you'd have to guage that depending on where you are and the cost of living. I am not going to quote you on exact figures but, your stability matters more than what you can start out with and I know Chase by far is the biggest growing bank and they charge alot for fees and I know that the most important department at Chase is the retention department. They pay over 12 per hour. You might look toward Chase first, but if you want to work on the baysides then Wells Fargo is your best choice and they are very nice, the customer service is awesome.|`|9OHeder5aa	Wells Fargo or Chase... if you work for Bank of America I will forever hate you.

A2G9foewaa	Don't|`|pUF71f1laa	Austin is the first place I would suggest. It's  agreat city with plenty of jobs. You may want to line something up before you get here. Housing in Texas is cheaper than California put it really depend on what part of Austin you want to live in and what your lifestyle is. If you are a Homebody and like to hang close to home. Southwest austin can be a cool place to live. Downtown is also cool but it's gonna cost ya. Good Luck when ever you land. Just think of it as a new adventure.|`|AA11450869	I'd say Austin as well, although it depends on what type of job you and your husband are looking for. Dallas is also a great area and I don't like Houston (don't know many people who do).|`|A0o8soNeaa	austin austin austin  check out south of congress
Vyw9fsFkaa	yep,,, I live just south of houston, in webster, it's very nice. We are right off i45 30 miles north of galveston.. you could either live south of town in clear lake, wich is also a nice area with good schools and the economy here is good. You can find decent apartments for around 650 on up for one bedrooms,, "nice ones". in clear lake/webster. and you might want to check out the north side of houston... only thing north side is more expensive. the local economy is sustained by oil and gas industry. lots of companies here hiring. best of luck|`|j3aDDrGpaa	Get here as FAST as youuuuu can!!<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give ya
m45R3s5Daa	take me with you...lol<br>  i also live in california, the southern part.<br>  go to texas.com and check their web sites.<br>  there are lots of jobs there but i heard intel from california is opening 3 plants, in oregon, washington and new mexico.<br>  doesnt california suck with its new tax increases?|`|e0b85fef05a9315124fcd08558a3518caa	All areas of Texas are experiencing recession just like the rest of the country.  You don't say what you do for a living.  You don't say whether you want a small town or a big city.  It is hard to help you!!  <br>  <br>  Texas is VERY different from California . . . weather, people, cost of living, and so on.
ada347c9f8c191ef5503d5f59e329442aa	It used to be at age 65 in Ontario. But as of December 12, 2006, the provincial government passed a legislation to ban mandatory retirement.<br>  <br>  The only province that still practises mandatory retirement is Nova Scotia, but they'll put an end to that in July 2009.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

y5fCk3bYaa	Since you are young it will be very limited and you will have to work less than 15 hours a week! I nannied for this one family after school every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and that was good income because it was 10 dollars an hour and that is more than I could have made at any other job because of my age. You could also see if a family Friend who runs a business (like a coffee shop or something) will hire you. Other than that there isn't much because most employers don't start hiring until 16(at the earliest 15) because they want to know that you are mature, responsible, and are able to drive or get yourself to work consistently everyday. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
jpENdop3aa	Clean rich people's houses. If you go to church ask your church if they pay some one to clean and ask maybe if you can help or something. Or call around to different churches. <br>  I used to work at a convenience store and we had this lady come in a couple times a week just to clean the restrooms real good, along with that ask to clean the windows or something. <br>  Try the gas stations and just go in a few and see if the boss man will let you come in for a couple hours a day or whatever and let you stock the cooler. Or maybe your local grocery store will let you pick up trash or get the buggies out of the parking lot one day a week or something. You just have to go around and ask. Hey it may not be the job that you always dreamed about, but it will look great on your resume when you apply for that job at 16 or 18 years old. It will will look good that you would have previous work experience vs. someone that don't. <br>  Good Luck!
