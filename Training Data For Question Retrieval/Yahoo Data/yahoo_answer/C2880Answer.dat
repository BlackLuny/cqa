I'm home schooled too and you'd be surprised how many things there are you can do at home to help.  The little and simple things to do are things like:  Flushing less.  Unplugging or turning off things when they're not being used.  Only turning on lights when you actually need them and turning them off when you leave the room.  Never leaving the water running when you're washing/shaving in the shower or brushing your teeth.  Setting your computer to go into sleep mode whenever you're away for a few minutes(if your computer does not have this setting you can do that yourself whenever you know you'll be idle for a while - and don't forget to turn the monitor off too.)     Bigger and more important things:  Switch your light bulbs to CFLs.    Switch from warm/hot water to cool/cold water in washing anything(even when you're washing your hands having the warm water on is using energy to warm it up.)  Air or towel dry your hair instead of using a blow dryer and try to find ways to style your hair other then using a curler or straightener.    Instead of turning up your heat when you're cold use a blanket or jacket, etc. Use a ceiling fan instead of the air conditioner. Hand wash your dishes instead of using a dishwasher. Collect rainwater to use instead of using a hose.    For when you're out:  Use re-usable shopping bags(canvas/tote bags will work for that.)   Try to avoid buying things that have a lot of un-recyclable material.  Walk or bike to anyplace you can instead of getting someone to drive you.   Keep a cloth in your purse to dry your hands so you don't have to use hand dryers or paper towels.    Spread the word of what you learn to your friends that are interested in going green too.|`|74hsYOelaa	it doesnt matter how old you are or if you go to public school or anything. you can do it all. aside form driving a fuel efficient car. You can take shorter showers, unplug your cell phone charger when not in use, unplug laptop chargers, turn off any light when not in use, dont you hair spray, stuff like that.energy efficient light bulbs are cheap these days. have your mom buy some and replace all ordinary bulbs. there are countless things you can do to help preserve the earth.

There are some that simply don't want to explore for, drill for, and exploit our resources.  Nancy Pelosi is a good example.  The definition for reserve includes extracting known oil at a profit at todays prices.  Many places are off limits (practically everywhere there is actually a good chance to find oil).  The reserves are therefore artificially low.  When you increase the price marginally, the known reserves increased dramatically.  Easily recoverable reserves may becoming scarce but we have plenty for well into next century.  Hopefully long before then we will have developed viable alternatives.  Gas and coal would extend that much longer.  We would never run out.  It would simply become more difficult to find and extract.    You do make a good point though.  If reserves are running out as most alarmists suggest then the amount of carbon that we could emit will be deminishing.    The atmosphere contains 800 gigatonnes of carbon  water including the oceans contains 36,000 gigatonnes  1900 gigatons in the biosphere  Only 150 gigatons in petroleum reserves.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon    If the atmoshere contains 800 and there is only 150 in the petroleum reserves, if we suddenly released all reserves into the atmosphere that would be a 150/800 or 19 per cent increase; from 380 to 452 parts per million.  Obviously it wouldn't get that high since formation of carbonates would offset it.  It isn't particularly alarming is it.  I guess anything is alarming to an alarmist.|`|sSvPEf97aa	We've been running on 20-30 years of oil for the last 50 years.

4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	The common process that is used in recycling plastic is the inverse polymerization process where the polymers in the plastic are converted into initial monomers that were used in the manufacture. These chemicals are then purified and synthesized to form new plastic materials. Assorted polymers are converted into petroleum in another recycling process. The advantage of this process is that any mix of polymers can be used. A new recycling process generates heat from the friction of plastic materials which melts the plastics. This is then pumped into casting moulds. The great advantage of this technique is that all types of plastics can be recycled.
f8sUtNVGaa	To avoid attracting pests and vermin, and also to avoid contamination.  Recyclables, after all, can end up being sorted by human beings.  My husband and I run our city's Recycling Center and I can tell you it is very unpleasant sorting through malodorous, moldy, mildewed, maggot-infested recyclables that some of our customers bring us.  Bacteria and other pathogens can end up growing on food residue, and it can be a health hazard.    I suggest to all my recyclers that they simply put their empty jars, cans, etc. in their dishwasher with their dirty dishes.  If they don't have a dishwasher, a quick cold-water rinse will usually remove most food residue.|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Rinsing the containers (glass, plastic, tetrapaks) with cold water will use less energy and water than if the recycling machinery has to do it, because by then the residue will have dried onto the surfaces and be a lot more difficult to remove, and hot water would probably be needed.  It's called being a responsible and sensible recycler.|`|BzPKCy6Oaa	I wasn't aware of that.  Maybe it is just your recycling company.    Is it "green"?  Who knows?

Small animals breed quickly have short lives and to some extent can adapt, this was how Darwin first came up with his theory, he recorded many of (what he thought) were different types of birds on Galapagos but when he returned to England ornithologists told him they were all finches, he then realized they had adapted to different methods of survival in the harsh environment.    Fish are being discovered because we still don't know that much about the deep ocean apart from the occasional deep sea dredge expedition which usually turns up new species.  There are no new medium or large land based animals simple because most are long lived and slow to breed like the Lion, tiger, elephant and yes the polar bear. Actually the Lion and the Polar bear are good examples both are top level predators both have similar number in the wild (the lion possible more) the Lion is listed as vulnerable?  For the polar bear 25000 is not a larger number for a total population and the trend of researchers finding bears that are thinner than usual and bears over the last decade coming to human settlements to find food.  http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/Z...|`|04bSzgxgaa	of course they are.

pnCOR1UVaa	I strive to live a more sustainable life, it includes trying to use natural products when ever possible. I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" or living natural is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     I have found that many of the cleaning and hygeine products we use are full of chemicals that are known or suspected to cause harm to our bodies. Becaus they aren't considered food the FDA doesn't require them to put all ingredients on the labels. I use a website called skin deep to find out what is in many beauty products and look up the safety data sheets for many of the cleaning supplies. Also remember just becuase it is natural doesn't mean it is good for you, asbestos is found in the hills around my city, I sure don't want to be near it.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	It really begins with a new frame of mind. Reducing your waste to the bare minimum (not buying individually packaged items, using a filter instead of bottled water, using canvas bags instead of paper or plastic, etc.) and reusing all of that waste you can is a great place to start. Use less electricity where you can.    Also, try to find products that are safe for the environment and you. Most of the detergents we use are not only harmful to our environment, but are also harmful to us directly. Check your shampoos and cleaners for Sodium Laureth Sulfate - this is a very dangerous ingredient in MOST of our stores cleaners. Always read labels and know what you are using. Research the topic more and find out what to look for.     Once you begin this journey, it will take you in all kinds of directions.

If you make a waterproof box, with a coating of black paint or plastic inside it, and the top covered with glass, the evaporating water will condense on the glass.  Tilt the glass, and the water will run to one edge.  Have a trough on that edge, tilt it slightly, and the water will run to one end where it can be collected into another container.  The sea water salt solution will gradually become more and more concentrated.  At some point, you will need to remove the thick liquid to another box, where the sun can evaporate the remaining water and leave the dry salt mixture behind.

If it somehow manages to be too short after this, you could also include discussion of some ways air pollution can be reduced.|`|y0q61lW9aa	I did one a while back,maybe  2 years ago...n e way all I can remember is that there was some valuable  info on children's health problems in cities with high pollution. and areas around highway/byway traffic. google/yahoo it, there should be a list or something of the top air pollution cities.

Under the new law, both businesses and homeowners get a 30% rebate for the cost of the system in the form of a federal tax credit. If your system cost $45,000, for example, you would pay $45,000 and get a $15,000 credit on your federal income taxes the next year.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Yes, there are a variety of programs. There is a federal tax credit of 30% for a solar PV system. I got a state rebate through my utility of $10K for my system as well.|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	Yes in  California it is a good deal. The money you get back is enough . The electricity gained is about half what the normal family uses. Some get more ! The People are amazed the amount electrical bill goes down.It's to bad the rest of the country don't have it. Not enough solar power.  We need more efficiency in solar power to generate electrical power. So if your friends talk of inventing a source of solar power,seriously. Please tell them go for it|`|AA11562326	Yes, there are US Federal tax breaks for both solar thermal (usually, hot water) and solar electric (usually, photovoltaic).    Some states and cities offer additional incentives on top of that.  See the link below to look up incentives for your state.
8EO7DCogaa	yes and in ontario they are trying to make the farmers pay $125 for each cow they have because of the green house gases they produce. Prettty dumb if you ask me|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Yes, if it's all pasture.   You can't put a fence around your house and call it pasture if you have a cow.
sSvPEf97aa	It first started as a threat of "Global Cooling" in the 1970's.  When that didn't sell, then those pushing their agenda started to claim "Global Warming" (and yes, it was the same group of scientist who claimed both) as a way to push their agenda.  And "Global Warming" stuck as people are motivated by fear, and movies like "Incomplete Truth" and "The Day After" provided enough visual stimulation to make people believe they were in danger.    However it's all a con-job.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	In the sixties when everything else crazy began.|`|0eFSeap5aa	About 12,000 years ago.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Global Warming is made up and is just a scam for people like Al Gore to make money! Now real scientist have found so much to prove that global warming is not possible and that we are just coming out of a ice age. But if you all want to keep believing that its true and keep spending your money to stop it from happening you can because I as so many others are not going to do such a thing.|`|YoEsKORMaa	whenever monetary profit made it worth it.  We do not hear about any issue unless someone is making money by making us hear about it.  There are definite ulterier (sp?) motives behind anything that the government gets their hands into.|`|AA11264399	There was no specific point, but it's been known for decades that we were pumping billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and the effects of greenhouse gases have been known for a century or more.|`|VxRUuABEaa	Someone else already said this -but let me go into more detail.    Margaret Thatcher "created" it in order to combat the global cooling fanatics. She said that global cooling would not occur, due to the greenhouse effect, which would balance it out. Therefore, mankind would have no effect on the temperature of the Earth.     However, the radicals took a look at that and started screaming about global warming.|`|YZdTBWoCaa	It started before way Al Gore  was born !      A Swedish scientist by the name of SVANTE ARRHENIUS, first theorized AGW in the 1890's.  Try a google on him.|`|SIWh4UCyaa	The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824 and first investigated by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. The idea that the world was warming dates back to the 1930s when a few scientist began to see a rising trend in the temperature record.   http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctr...  Some hear have already mentioned the 70s myth, but as usual failed to say this was not supported by scientists, the general scientific consensus then was that we needed more data.  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cool...  From the 70s onward we launched satellites that monitor the Earth and the Sun, improved the techniques and depths of ice core and sediment core data. Computers advanced to handle the vast amount of information, even in the 30's the temp data was millions of data points.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	People  have been going back and forth on it since the mid-1800's.  I became aware of the annoyance in 1988 when we had a very hot summer and draught.  Never seen before or since.  Even then people were freaking out about "global warming."  Two years later, the summer of 1991, it rained everyday and the temperature never went much above 80 F.|`|3YppOvGyaa	Probably from the early 1990's|`|aV3bFchtaa	The day Al Gore invented it, which was the day after he invented the internet.|`|yB3Jek85aa	it was the day bush became president its all his fault
d3a1105e08dfce2874317467c67ac8c8aa	Hey, me too! Group therapy!    They make me wanna scream, they make you wanna shout. And I don't know what that's about! Maybe we'll finally get it right. You hate their creepy looks. I hate their almond smell and we both freak when they propel themselves inward from the outside.    Okay, let's look at all the bugs that we like. There's the ladybug, who helps the plants, there's the jitterbug, who does a 40's dance, there's humbug, to talk all wild, and Bugaboo, by Destiny's Child. We've got doodlebugs on the railroad tracks, and buggys, pulled by horsies, natch'! We've got that car from Volkswagon's shop, and "Bug"ota, Columbia. Okay, Bogo*TA*.    Does it have an orange anchor on its back? Well maybe it's an anchor bug on the attack. It's a predator of beetles. It puts them at a premium. At least that's what I got from skimming Wikipedia. So I guess there's good ones too. Enough for you? Enough for me! All *I* need is am"bug"uity. Let's not talk about bugs.    It's odd that I freak, how can I say this? I beat out the bugs, on a daily basis! I'm debugging programs, there's 1 in 10 lines... Lift eaves that feds drop, when tapping mine. And I squash a bug when I say goodbye to Wisconsinites. Wisconsinites bug me. Or I should say they "Badger" me?  (hahhaha, oh that was cheesy).    Well, hope this helps..somehow! :-)    I've sung this for you at: http://noise.dillfrog.com/audio/fawm2009...|`|U7oJrc3faa	I hate bugs too.  It's a feminine thing, dear.|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	get a bug spray
pnCOR1UVaa	We fill and close full landfills at a rate of about 1 per day. Without recycling that number would be higher. We would be paying more for some materials that are easily recycled. Resources like aluminum and tin, which have been widely recycled for decades would be more expensive, a lot more land would be destroyed to obtain the virgin ore and we would run out of it much sooner.     There are economists who believe if we continue to use resources at the rate we are currently, landfills will be the mines of the future.|`|uXQcDsiAaa	One thing leads to another... pollution,... planet dies|`|KweMUxUdaa	If you don't start recycling the horrific our dumps around the world will become over full and we in turn would have to dig new ones. Dumps can give off a type of gas that is not great for the environment (not sure what it is called).     Most things can be recycled, even your sandwiches bags that you may or may not use on a daily basis, you just need to wash them and than you can use them again. Any left over vegetables can be composted into dirt to put in your garden to grow better. The list of things that a person can recycle is huge, but most people don't want to take the extra time and effort to help make our planet a better place.|`|HKaMsKltaa	if u don't recycle u can kill us bad the plant!!!|`|4CsGde1qaa	The world gets dirty, we stink, animals die, grass fades, we become lazy, I can keep going you know.....|`|gz2JF00Saa	Have to take out the garbage more often.
kdahZzxbaa	Less air pollution causes less cancer and less lung related problems. Riding a bicycle or walking instead of driving is good for your health by giving you cardiovascular exercise. Buying environmental friendly household cleaning products is healthy because it exposes you to less cancer causing materials; same with environmental friendly paints, furniture, and organic clothes.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	"Going Green" has become a trendy catch all phrase for environmental awareness and social participation in reducing waste and utilizing more energy efficient products. When we use products designed to biodegrade we reduce the amount of space required in landfills. When we use vehicles that use less or no fossil fuels we improve air quality - which improves life quality. Every little step makes a huge difference. Hope this helped!|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Conservation is a key element of going green. Less consumption and reduce waste. If you live a "green" life you don't waste energy and you look for ways to save it. Using natural light when possible, energy efficient appliances and lighting etc.    Another element of a green life is to reduce pollution. That can be anything from buying organic cotton which uses no harmful pesticides to eating a local, in season, organic diet. Walking instead of driving. Using non toxic cleaning products and reducing or eleminating the harmful chemicals in your beauty products.
3lgodrqbaa	I am pretty sure that if they deplete, the Earth will take time to regain balance, and get back to the old cycle of natural climate. Unfortuantly if we wait to long and the global warming trends keep up, they may be inreversable though.|`|AA11264399	Probably, but a few billion people could be dead by then.|`|9XMJ4G1xaa	I feel it will stop getting worst and over hundreds of years get better so no hope for aanyoneborn be for 2210 or that wont be a problem if world ends on december 12 2012.
