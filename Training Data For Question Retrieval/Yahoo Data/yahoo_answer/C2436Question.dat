20090220033312AAjfMrE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Has anyone of you got the same feeling sometimes?	i realized that most the time when i read books, not something like textbooks but some classical novels/non-fictions etc. my mind starts to think on a better and deeper level, like i'd come up with thoughts that usually i wouldn't have which are all positive ones. even tho i'm not really big on reading, i mean i sometimes only read a whole book once in a while then it's hard for me to start another one any time soon after that. but still, i cud tell i considered things differently then. BUT in the days i don't read much i feel my mind came back to the original point where i just don't get those "inspiration" or whatever good which i got from reading.. i don't know why it's like that, and also i wanna know that if the time when mind seems have gained more knowledge and got more sensitive to other things is just Temporary becuz we read, and the good condition will just disappear if we dont keep on reading???

20090220034248AAVDQqm	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What can we learn of fear and death from this Jeffer's poem?	Vulture      I had walked since dawn and lay down to rest on a bare hillside   Above the ocean. I saw through half-shut eyelids a vulture wheeling   high up in heaven,   And presently it passed again, but lower and nearer, its orbit   narrowing,   I understood then   That I was under inspection. I lay death-still and heard the flight-   feathers   Whistle above me and make their circle and come nearer.   I could see the naked red head between the great wings   Bear downward staring. I said, 'My dear bird, we are wasting time   here.   These old bones will still work; they are not for you.' But how   beautiful   he looked, gliding down   On those great sails; how beautiful he looked, veering away in the   sea-light   over the precipice. I tell you solemnly   That I was sorry to have disappointed him. To be eaten by that beak   and   become part of him, to share those wings and those eyes--   What a sublime end of one's body, what an enskyment; what a life   after death.       John Robinson Jeffers (January 10, 1887–January 20, 1962)

Sie selbst beschrieb ja, gleich nach Ver?ffentlichung des ersten Potterbandes, dass sie an der Gesamtgeschichte jahrelang 'gezimmert' habe und dass sie schon eine lange Zeit vor der ersten Ver?ffentlichung fest gestanden habe... einerseits ist das ja eine sch?ne Vorstellung.   Ich hab damit aber zurückblickend ein bisschen meine Probleme.      Einige Dinge, wie sie im ersten Band geschildert waren, bissen sich in meinen Augen mit den Entwicklungen und Enthüllungen der sp?teren B?nde und auch der Potter-Welt, wie sie nach und nach 'erschaffen' wurde.      Sind euch Ungereimtheiten aufgefallen und wenn ja, welche?      Disclaimer:   Bitte friedlich bleiben. Ich hab nicht vor, an anderer Leute Weltsicht zu rütteln - und bitte ebenso, nicht an meine packen zu wollen ^^.       Bin gespannt auf eure Meinung zum Thema.

She is not amazingly beautiful at all & is mostly average, but good at art maybe. Anyway, after we get to know her, she ends up at a carnival- the circus is in town. She is enjoying herself, but is for some strange reason captivated/intrigued by a [circus freak or sad-clown] whom everyone is laughing cruelly at. She tries to talk to him and such, but he resists her. She keeps going back, and is persistent with him, and eventually he gives in. He is so hesitant at first, as the leader [not de   decided what role he/she plays in the circus] has forbidden socializing with outsiders. Nevertheless, the two get to know each other & fall in love. She meets all his circus friends & they all keep the relationship a secret... untll the 'leader' finds out....      Obviously its REALLY hazy & not definite at all...   but is it even worth writing a novel about?      Obviously, it wouldn't be everyones cup of tea- mainly for teens and young adults.

20090203122554AAdpmfg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The beginning of a mystery...?	Here is my beginning, but I would like to hear some opinion of it before I continue. All suggestions are appreciated.   THanks!      Icy rain poured down in torrents as the lone figure on the roof stood calmly, silhouetted against the evening sky. Cigarette smoke drifted slowly from his mouth as he peered over the surrounding countryside. The man’s head perked up as he heard a new sound breaking through the monotonous noise of rain falling on the cobblestone below. The sound of a lone cello player was rising from the ground floor, many feet below. In the warmth of the manor the cellist played her tune, sliding her bow effortlessly against her instrument. In other parts of the house, people moved and talked and continued their usual hustle and bustle. Everyone seemed quite normal, everyone was at ease. Everyone, that is, except two people. For there were actually two people on the roof, one in plain sight, the other hidden, stepping slowly, completely shrouded by the looming night. With barely more than a shuffle, the figure moved, edging along until right behind the man. Then there came a piercing sound that cut through the usual buzz of activity.     For one strange and horrible moment everyone in the manor stopped what they were doing, all thinking the same thing. What had they heard? No-one could put their finger on it, but for some reason there was something strange about what they heard. Not a clang or a bang, but what they heard sounded like… a scream. So the people all decided to abandon their tasks and find the source of the peculiar sound, but what they found would bring them no solace.    For lying on the ground in a pool of blood on the cobblestones was the man from the roof.  Up above, on the roof, mingling with the cigarette smoke and the smoke from the chimney, was the smoke of a pistol, rising away from the scene as pandemonium enveloped below. In a seemingly harmless manor, a man had been murdered, and culprit was now hidden, gone like a shadow in the night.

20090203124254AA0N8pH	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Need help in finding where this family lived 1891-1894?	Trying to find where this family lived from 1891-1894 ONLY. We DON'T need ANY years after this. Might be in some old city directories. Last name Siegel, Segal,. etc. There would be: Samuel,Louis,John, Michael, and Nellie and mother Anna. Would help solve a HUGE mystery if we can find where (after landing at the port in N.York in 1891). In late 1894 they FIRST showed up in Superior WI. The BIG trick is to find the same names in a same household from 1891-1894 in some other town from N.Y. to Wisc. (they all lived together). Most likely it would be some northern state. Any help wed sure appreciate. Have checked geneology programs..no luck so far. If we can find the town where they all lived together in those certain years, this is where something happened to the kids father and we can start looking.

20090220071308AAFksL2	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can we be analytical and live in the moment all at once?	"Experience"   by Peter Benoit         The forest's gloom has deepened now,   Its burnished bronze fast run to gray   Beneath the mighty cedar bough   Where veery song has passed away.   And soon Orion will once more   Kneel down at Eridanus' shore   And Phaeton's plight with tear endow   The passage into night from day.   Adrift in Mare Cognitum   I scarcely seem to feel the tide   Of all I found so wearisome   When I made pause to subdivide   And analyze the warp and woof   Of simple gifts beyond reproof   As harvest time's chrysanthemum   Amask in dew at morningtide.   If I ascend Olympus Mons   To meditate on twofold moons   Will tempest brewing in my pons   Be heightened by their perilunes   Or are these twins the Gordian knot   That know but language polyglot   The quintessential sine qua nons   Forever two as they were hewn?   A forest gloom is home tonight   And there is mystery in the air   To beckon to an acolyte   In thrush's warbling solitaire.   If Euclid's postulates must bend   O let me know the love unpenned   In language of the recondite   To hear Orion's quiet prayer

"Before the Dusk Has Settled Low"   by Peter Benoit      Before the dusk has settled low,   Before the hour has grown too late,   I pause once more to ruminate   On all the pangs of life below   On all the things I cannot know --   The mys'tries of Time's vast estate   Before the dusk has settled low,   Before the hour has grown too late.      And in my head and heart they sow   A question none can explicate:   How far doth reach the hand of Fate?   And how far have I left to go   Before the dusk has settled low.

20090220075719AAsz1ht	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please explain the appeal of the "Twilight" series?	My wife likes supernatural stories. When she was home recovering from surgery, she stumbled across the "Twilight" series, and she devoured all four books within a week. Then we went to see the movie.      Now, she swears that she just likes vampire stories and romance novels, and to her, this was both. But I'm very aware of how a lot of people -- adolescent girls, it seems -- absolutely gush over this series.      Can somebody please explain to me why?      I mean, it's a decent story, with all the requisite suspense and drama, but seriously, a lot of people seem absolutely obsessed with this series. That's what I don't get. What is it that sets "Twilight" apart? Because it's not obvious to me. In fact, I read the first book, and I had quite a few problems with the premise.       -- Why is a 100-year-old vampire attracted to a clumsy girl who by her own account is nothing special and not particularly attractive? Is it just because her blood smells yummy?       -- Why does Bella fawn over Edward? Is it because he's the "bad boy," or maybe someone she thinks she can tame? Or is she just swept off her feet by the fact that he pays so much attention to her?      -- Doesn't anyone else get tired of hearing how Edward is a big, hunky Adonis, the most gorgeous chunk of manhood ever to walk the planet, page after page after page? Not only does it get old, but how is a pale vampire this irresistibly beautiful?      -- And even as a man, I cringe at the suggestion that Bella "needs a man" to protect her and make her life whole and complete.      Honestly, I find the plot thin and the characters not particularly believable. Not that I expect vampires to follow the rules of the real world, but my point is, I don't get sucked in to the fantasy, the way I do with, say, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Here, I just find a sketchily drawn Damsel in Distress and the archetypal Hero who swoops in to save her.      Am I the only one who doesn't get the appeal of this series? Please, someone, explain it to me.

20090220050020AAAlDAb	Arts & Humanities;History	Are the mass killings and displacements of Native American population considered as genocide?	I can understand that the Jewish sufferings during world war two are considered as a holocaust and something that needs to be taught. I also heard that New York passed a law making all students learn that the terrible Potato famine in Ireland was a genocide directed by the British against the Irish. Certainly this touched the lives of many ancestors of todays American citizens and while still a tragedy, this seems more open to debate as whether it was truly a genocide. Another suitable topic also involving American ancestors would be the mass killing and displacement of native American population. I wondered if this is also mandated by law to be taught as genocide?       http://www.slate.com/id/2412/

Seems odd considering that all their adventures always seemed to start with them leaving boarding school and going to Kirren Cottage for the beginning of "summer hols" (summer holidays), suggesting that the previous book was set a year ago. They would often talk about past adventures, though Julian remained 12 years old for the entire series, Dick and George 11 and Anne 10. Even Timmy the Dog never got old.       And did Julian, Dick and Anne ever speak to their parents after the first book?      Ahh ... the mysteries of Enid Blyton.

20090220073910AADzroF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why do people like Twilight? It sucks!?	The author acts like a child, the story is unoriginal, the "vampires" have barely any traits of what a vampire is supposed to be, it is the same as any love story, it is anti-feminist, the main character has no personaliy, and it is, in many ways, terrible. What makes it so good as to have such a craze about it? ...and if anyone says "Because *character* is HAWT!!!!11one!!1" that isn't a real reason. The only way that could be a valid reason is if you ask someone "Why do you watch porn?". So why is it people like this garbage? I'm convinced most of you are just bandwagoners anyways.

20090220063333AAIqiCr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Science Fiction Novel, Opinions?	This is the synopsis of the very beginning of a novel I’m trying (but sadly failing) to get around to writing. What do you think so far? (If you can be bothered to read it).        The story opens with our protagonist trying to catch a glizzard (gliding lizard) in an alien landscape using only what can be found locally, which is all crap. Actually this is only by way of an initiation test for first year skreddle students. It would take too long to describe a skreddle, but it is a sort of wearable musical instrument that shakes, rattles, rolls and stridulates. The glizzard skins were traditionlly used as parts of the stridulator mechanism, but there is a perfectly good synthetic substitute. Unfortunately this costs more ergoscrip than our student can afford...       ...anyhoo, the story continues as we follow our student's attempts to learn classical skreddling, which is a musical performance technique entirely reverse engineered from fossil skreddle remains and mouldering old parchments filled with musical notations, the exact meanings of which are still a matter of heated academic dispute.       Eventually our student begins to believe that, musicologically, skreddling is massive leg pull and that originally it must have had some other purpose. He begins his own extra curricular academic research into its origins. What he discovers may just be the key to rectifying the critical shortage of the trace element selenium in the soil of the planet they eke out a living on. The selenium is being sequestered by a plant rather like sizal or saw grass only much tougher. It is far too energy intensive to cut down and process and grows in huge impenetrable belts which slowly advance along the length of the single equatorial continent, swallowing up the only fertile land ahead and leaving an infertile waste land behind which takes ages to rot down enough for the next wave of plants to be able to grow on it again.

20090220054714AAdZ2PQ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you live in the country? I want to live in the country, again.....?	A cannonball bombing your temple    but you stand up and court the pain    with composure,    giving your girth    to the wind.    The rollicking fast-forward maggots yield   to the not yet dead meat    of your thoughts.    You strangle the whelp    before he becomes a man    on the back of a forest horse that lives    in the sundown shadows,   beyond the city you are trapped in    with crumpled dollars for dinner    and no way over there,    beyond the perfect grass    and the fenced plot.    Will anyone hear you    if you beg your veins    to stop hosting this vile carcass    of unmotivated, ruminating body matter    without any crash or bang    left inside, only rumors   of what once   was or once   was not?

There are 4 of us in the group - 1 boy, 3 girls      We want to include a song about rape, but preferably a well-known modern song. It doesn't have to be specifically written about rape, but the lyrics have to be interpreted to be about rape.      One example i found was Sugababes, "Too lost in you" because it says stuff like "i can't sleep, i just think about the things that you do" etc. Hope that gives you an idea or two.      Any other ideas for the drama in general would be greatly appreciated!!      :) xx

See, her mother first left this world for her father, for the sake of love, but then she finds out that the father was a dark angel and left.  But Fairamay doesn't know this part of the story, and begins unraveling what really happened when he left.  And, there's a twist.  Her best friend, Iris, turns into a dark angel towards the end of the story, and she pretends to capture the father.  But the father is going to end up being bad, and allianced with Iris.         But there's my problem, I want Iris going bad to be more dramatic, because I want Fairamay and her to be best friends since they were little.  But how should I do this time frame wise, like should I start the story where Fairamay's already an adult and has flashbacks of their childhood friendship?  Or should I start with them as best friends and work my way up to adulthood?         And this also brings me to another issue, how should I start the story?

20090220071649AAMUV7a	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would this be a good way to write a chapter book?	Right now I am righting short stories that all relate to each other. And what I'm thikning is that each short story would be a chapter in my book. Is that a good idea because whenever I try to write a chapter book I always get stuck, and when I write short stories ideas kind of just come to me. Give me your opinion on this idea. You can do this to if you are a writer and want to try it. LOL      THNX!!!
