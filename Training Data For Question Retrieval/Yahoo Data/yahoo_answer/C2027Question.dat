Hi,      I am looking into getting a portable reading device and I am having a difficult time deciding if it is worth buying Amazon's SOLD OUT Kindle or just going for a couple hundred dollar cheaper Sony 505 model.      The Sony I am looking at seems to be comparable in quality to the Kindle.  The only MAIN issue I have with the Sony is that I'm worried about where you can buy the books.  Since unlike the Kindles you cannot just buy them on Amazon.com as far as I know.      So do you know where to buy the eBooks for the Sony?      So my main question is, is it worth it to buy a Kindle for about $400 or should I go with the Sony 505?      I will add links to the two as well...      Here is the Sony 505 I am interested in:    http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stor...       Here is the Amazon Kindle:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI7...       Oh and I would not be able to wait the 4-6 weeks to buy it from Amazon so I am stuck buying it from somewhere else for more expensive which is why the price of the Kindle would be around $400.      Thank you in advance!

20090128101942AAaid7U	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Nikon D40 vs D60? First DSLR?	RIght now im looking at the d40 and the d60 deciding which one to buy. The d40 with an 18-55mm and a 18-200mm (both non VR) is extremely inexpensive, for what it is, but for a little more i can have the d60 with an 18-55VR lens. Which one do you think i should buy?      I'm boring a friends d70 right now, and he says its closest to the d40. It's a reputable friend so i trust him.       The way i see it right now is if i get the d40, i think not too far down the road i will outgrow it, with it only having 6.1 mp and not too many features. Also, an 18-200 is pretty much useless without VR or a tripod because theres no way i could get up to 200 and take a shot, thats impossible. The d60 just seems like a step up. I, unfortunatly, have fairly shaky hands so the vr would be worth it i think.       I'm looking to do studio, nature, and macro shots,  but i would like to have the vr lens to do macro shots without a tripod for when im just out and see one. And i could save up for another vr lens. I also see that the d60 has a very beginner friendly display, showing what to use each iso for, a picture of the aperture when you adjust it so you know what your doing, but you can also disable it so thats a plus.       So what do you think? d40 or 60? Mind you, i am experienced in photography but not so much in the DSLR field (which is why the d60 looks good). I've been using 35mm film for nature and a nikon coolpix 5700 for all around shooting, and studio but i've outgrown it and dslr's are just so cool :)

20090128113023AA4lh9p	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Unlocked Iphone Says No Service in a place where there is service?	I have an iphone 3g v2.2 and it is unlocked using a turbosim/piggyback sim. I am using a vodafone uk pay as you go sim card. For some reason  I am experiencing a problem that has happened quite a few times - I am using a vodafone sim card but it seems whenever I go somewhere it says no service and then when i go to a town where I know I am able to get service, it still says that there is no service. I try taking the sim card out, turning it off etc. but still no joy. The only way it works again is to use a family memeber's phone (which happens to be vodafone) and put their sim into my iphone and it comes up with full signal. then i put mine back in and it works.    The reason that I know that there is signal even when mine says none is because a) other vodafone users in the same place have signal.                    b) when i put my sim card into a vodafone phone it show signal.      I do not know if it is a faulty sim card or what is wrong.   I am rather concerned though and as you can imagine having to go through the long process each time is not right. I hope there is a solution to this.      Thanks in advance.

Basically im looking for a mobile phone, unfortunately i hate shopping because perfectionism and indecisiveness always take over, i always do way to much research to make sure i get the perfect deal.It doesn't always end that way though, i usually say sod it and give up which is what im on the verge of doing.   Im basically looking for; (without all the mobile blurb that i dont understand)   *preferably a large touch screen with a qwerty keyboard   *access to the internet   *abillity to send and recieve emails   *entertainment is very important so i need access to and ability to download music (mp3) and games (java), radio, camera (3.2+) and video recording and playback, ability to download and watch movies/stream tv would be a prefered bonus too.   *bluetooth   *usb   *large memory and prefered memory card slot   *i think i need 3g for the emailing etc i really dont know and wi - fi would be nice.      Unfortunatly through all the internet and shop browsing i have undertaken the last month i cant find one that does everything i want but i guess thats always the way and if i have to sacrifice i usually dont bother at all.(sulky of me i know).   Anyways can anyone help this woman who hasn't a clue find her perfect phone?   Thanks in advance.

20090128111713AAFcbIu	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	What is wrong with my 360 and how can I fix it?	First off, I have had this for a little over a year now. A few months after I bought it, it started showing graphical glitches left and right. I figured it was overheating the GPU so I stopped playing it for awhile. That didn't help, and one day it just stopped doing it. A year later, these glitches show up again less frequently, but still annoying. Then a few days after the glitches begin to re-appear, my 360 starts freezing on me while playing games. Now that is getting annoying. Now, a few weeks later, I can only boot up a game for about 3 minutes before it freezes. I read that this is most likely the onslaught of the RROD, but I am not getting any such luck to be able to send it in, because it is not RR'ing. My options are finding out what is wrong and fixing it myself, or buying my 3rd 360 in my life.

I own a NTSC game for my PS3 and understand they play at 60Hz, so on a 50Hz SD TV would be black and white and the rest. I currently have my PS3 hooked upto a Monitor so it runs fine but I am about to purchase a Panasonic TX-32LXD80 which is 50Hz to play my PS3 on.   I don't fancy connecting my PS3 upto my monitor every time i want to play my NTSC game so wondered if there was a solution to playing it on the HDTV.

20090128122423AAuaXkt	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Why has the numbering/naming of my pictures reset to IMG_0001?	I have a Canon PowerShot SX100 IS.  I don't know if the camera numbers the pictures or if my computer does, but it started out with IMG_0001.  I got up to probably picture #700, but then it restarted again, so now I have multiple pictures with the same name/number.  It puts pictures in a separate folder in My Computer each time I upload, so it's not a humongous deal, but now I am trying to consolidate my folders, and I obviously can't have more than 1 picture with the same name.  I guess I could go through and rename them, but 1. that will take forever, and 2. I'd like to stop the problem.  I have used both an SD card reader, as well as the USB cable that came with the camera to upload pictures, so I don't know if that has affected it.  Does anyone know why this is happening, or even better, how I can get my pictures to start naming at say IMG_0700 again?

20090128124747AAMJzFd	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Which Playstation 3 Model should I purchase?	Hello everyone! I am getting a playstation 3 soon and I need help deciding which one to buy. I was thinking of getting the latest 80 gigabyte model or the refurbished 60 gigabyte model. I don't care about space so it doesn't really matter how much is on it. What I do care about is the backwards compatibility with ps2 games. With some more research I found out that both models have different Possessors. What is the difference between the possessors? All I know is that the 60 gig architecture is set up more like a ps2 so it can play ps2 games the best (that is if what I read is correct). Also there seem to be people talking about slowdown issues and other situations when playing. Can anyone shed light on my problem? I've never had a ps2 before yet there are a lot of games on the ps2 that I want to play so I figured I could get a ps3 that could play both. I don't know much and I need an expert too help me. Can anyone lend a helping hand?
