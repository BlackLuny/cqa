Steven Craig Feldman’s law records, which anyone can access on the California State BAR's Website, states that Steven Craig Feldman's law license was suspend for his failure to pay his child support, his BAR fees/dues, and his failure to take necessary coursework.

20090131180046AAWeKjU	Sports;Wrestling	Do you agree guys "no more tri-branded pay per views"?	I felt like I needed to make this thread. In 2007 I believe, the WWE made the decision to end single branded pay per views and turn them all into tri-branded, in hope to gain better ratings and pay per view buys. This means that on every pay per view, superstars from Raw, ECW and Smackdown appear on the show. Whereas before this, Raw had a pay per view every two months, as did Smackdown. This allowed more time for storyline building and most importantly, a spot on the card for the mid-carders and the rookies.      Since 2007, on every pay per view at least one of these names has appeared on the show: John Cena, Edge, Randy Orton, Triple H, Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Batista. While the tag team division barely gets a match on a PPV anymore. This in my opinion, lead to the end of the Cruiserweight Title and division as there was no room on the card for the little guys. Hell, the United States and Intercontinental Titles are rarely defended on pay per view nowadays, unlike before 2007.      I ask this: Has the ratings increased since 2007? Has pay per view buys increased since 2007? To my knowledge, the answer to both of these questions are a definitive "no". Guys like Ted DiBiase, Cody Rhodes, MVP, Kofi Kingston, Shelton Benjamin, William Regal and many, many other mid-carders and tag teams are left off the card because the 3 World Title matches, along with a few grudge matches involving main event superstars usually fill the entire card. Not to mention it no longer makes pay per views such as SummerSlam and Survivor Series seem special as they were seen as two of the big four pay per views due to talent from all brands appearing on 4 shows a year (SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series and Wrestlemania). This is no longer the case.      So I ask this, do you think the WWE should go back to having single branded pay per views. By this I mean, Raw has one pay per view every two months, and Smackdown along with talent from ECW has a pay per view every two months in which Raw doesn't have one? Or do you think things should stay the way they are, in hope of better pay per view buys and ratings increase?

20090131181328AAL7YC8	Sports;Boxing	Ronald "Winky" Wright vs Kelly Pavlik at Middlweight for the WBC WBO and Ring Magzine Belts.?	When I first thought about this fight I was going to make it at 165 catch weight,but then I remembered how horrible Pavlik has been above 160 and how WInky hasn't won a fight above that weight either. So I was curious about a showdown between the two. Personally I don't think coming off a loss Winky deserves a shot at the champion but anything can happen. This fight is so obvious but yet nobody has considered it. Pavlik is going to fight Marco Antonio Rubio for a mandatory challenge (WHICH HE SHOULD WIN). Then what ? Most people are going to say Arthur Abraham however outside of Europe who is going to Buy a Abraham PPV the Youngstown fans cant drive to Germany? WInky Has a bout with Paul WIlliams a fight I think shouldn't happen (For reasons that are irrelevant) where does WInky Go ? The Middleweight division is extremely low on Talent. I got a feeling that's why Pavlik's camp has opted to stay their instead of Moving to 165 with Jermain Taylor Mikkel Kessler Carl Frotch. Or even 175 with Roy Jones Glen Johnson Chad Dawson Antonio Traver Clinton Woods and "Super" Joe Calzaghe.      Pavlik - Obviously Needs to rebound after a loss, and 160 doesn't have a lot of creditable names to fight. WInky is the type of fighter that If Kelly can beat it would move him up as far a boxing status goes. I think if Kelly can push the action and Out-Work Winky for 12 rounds he can win a decision + Winky might start showing his age he hasn't fought in 2 years.      Winky Wright - Hasnt fought in 2 years and the ring rust could effect his performance as well as age. Winky is know to take rounds off and lose close decisions. However Winky has a great Jab and defence add that with the fact that Pavlik obliously has problems with boxers. I think If Winky can work off his Jab and use his defence to frustrate Kelly simular to what Bernard did he can win a decison.

20090131192852AADxd2T	Sports;Cycling	Computerless hybrid bike design?	I like the idea of electric assist bikes, but they're really expensive, and they all contain computers, something I'd like to avoid on a bicycle.      If you can stand a little reading, I'd like ideas and suggestions for my design.      Start with a normal bicycle.  But replace the chain with a shaft, and the external gears with hub gears or perhaps a NuVinci CVT hub.      Then, add the batteries, and motor in the front hub.      To minimize user input and simplify the design, put a spring loaded torque sensor halfway along the drive shaft. (Two thick disks with curved faces that fit together.  This way if the load is greater than the input, one disk can ride up on the humps of the other one, forcing against the spring)      That way, the torque sensor would expand and turn on the hub motor.  The further the sensor opens, the more electricity drives the motor.      From the users point of view, they would be provided with two adjusters and two handles.  The right adjuster would simply change the gears or CVT ratio, and the right handle would engage a rear friction brake.  The left adjuster would move the spring on the torque sensor so that the motor sensitivity decreases.  (In Off position, it would compress the spring up against the disk, preventing any movement and therefor keeping the motor off, while in High position it would move the spring away from the disk, letting the motor trigger at the slightest resistance.)  The left handle would turn the hub motor in to a regenerative brake, but only if the torque sensor is closed.        This also means that by setting the Torque Sensor to off, they could feather the brake and slowly recharge the battery.      I'm just playing with the idea, and I'm not professionally versed in this kind of matter, so any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.

I understand the reason behind the rule is that it is harder for the goalie to actively participate in team banter and get messages to his teammates from the crease.  So why make the exception for him?  It states very clearly in the rules that "no playing Coach or playing Manager or goalkeeper shall be permitted to act as Captain or Alternate Captain".  Doesn't this put his team at a disadvantage?  (They aren't my team, but hey, I'm just wondering here.)  I don't even know the Canucks stats, but how has his captaincy affected their ranking?  Just curious guys.  No hating on me please.  (I liked Luongo at the All-Star game, btw.)

Now i get rim stuffed vertically and off a drop step. I cant figure out what i did to do it. I can grab rim with both hands of a two step run. People tell me if i could figure out " how to jump" i could easily be dunking and i think its true.  last week i triead again and i came really close the ball wouldnt go in but i could grab the rim. I think i jump higher off two feet but people say i should jump off one, my coach say that two feet should work for me. I was wondering if anyone out there is bball and athletics savy enough to tell me the correct technique for jumping, because if you see me jump i really should have no problem dunking yet i cannot do it. Please help, this really frustrating.

I've purchased a used Remington 700 rifle and need help identifying the year of manufacture and which variant it is.      S/N: 223186   Caliber: .243 Winchester      Barrel is stamped on the left side with   "Remington Arms Co. Inc.   Ilion, N.Y.  Made in the USA   Pat. No. 2,473,373 , 2,514,981 , 2,585,195"      and nearer the receiver is stamped "Y P NN 6"  The two Ns are stamped with one higher and left of the other and the 6 is in a circle.      The right side of the barrel is stamped "REP > +"       The receiver bears the Remington logo and MODEL 700 along with the serial number. The serial number is also hand-engraved onto the underside of the bolt.      The furniture is dark hardwood (presumably walnut) with a checkered pattern on the grip and foregrip and a Monte Carlo-style stock comb and cheekpiece.  The butt cap is metal, silver around the edge and black on the end, cut with a diamond texture pattern.      There are no iron sights on the barrel, but there are two screws on top about 1.5" from the muzzle and another pair of screws about 5-6" from the receiver.  The magazine is a blind box with no floorplate.      Any help in identifying this firearm would be great.

Am I happy?Nope   The person who should have been kicked out from the game should have been McCauley, not Copeland. Didnt u see it?!!? McCauley tried to choke Copeland. CHOKE!!   He should have gotten suspended for trying to choke Copeland, just to stop him from getting 2 more points for the Tarheels, coz State had already lost!!      "However, the rivalry game ended in heated fashion when N.C. State's Ben McCauley delivered a hard foul to North Carolina reserve Michael Copeland on a layup attempt with 1.9 seconds left. Copeland jumped up and went after McCauley, forcing the officials to step in and Tar Heels coach Roy Williams to wander on the court to calm Copeland down.      The officials huddled with Williams and N.C. State coach Sidney Lowe before issuing technical fouls to both players."      Ya ya, they both got a foul issued, but MCCAULEY SHOULDA BEEN SUSPENDED ONE GAME!!          Tempers flare late in No. 5 UNC's win over NC St.:         "The North Carolina-N.C. State rivalry just got a little more heated.           Tempers briefly flared Saturday after a hard foul in the final seconds of the fifth-ranked Tar Heels' 93-76 victory over the Wolfpack.       With less than 2 seconds remaining, North Carolina's Mike Copeland took a fast-break feed from Bobby Frasor and leaped for an exclamatory dunk when N.C. State's Ben McCauley fouled him hard, sending him to the court.       Copeland jumped to his feet and briefly charged to confront McCauley before official Les Jones corralled him, dragging the forward across the court.       "I was a little disappointed that he was even going up for it," McCauley said. "I though that was kind of disrespectful at that point. The game was over. I wish it didn't happen the way it did, but I didn't want him to get an easy dunk. To me, I just thought it was a little unnecessary. Maybe I shouldn't have gone about it as physical as I did, but I mean, like I said, I just didn't want him to do that in front of our crowd and go off the floor with a dunk like that."       North Carolina coach Roy Williams and N.C. State's Sidney Lowe huddled with another official, and in addition to the intentional foul called on McCauley, technical fouls were issued to both players. Copeland was sent to the locker room early -- though he was not formally ejected -- and was replaced by senior walk-on Patrick Moody, who hit two free throws to close out the scoring.       Copeland said he regretted going chest-to-chest with McCauley, but wasn't about to apologize for trying to score a rare basket.       "I wanted to score just like anybody -- if you haven't played, you want to score," Copeland said. "I guess he was frustrated too. He fouled me hard. Nobody wants to get beat like they did. I was just about to try to score and he just took me out. ... I definitely regret doing it. I made a bad mistake. It was on my part. I should've just walked away and shot my free throws."       The senior forward was just 1-for-4 from the field for the season while playing a total 11 minutes in five games as he comes back from a serious knee injury. He tore a ligament in his right knee while playing a pickup game last May.       "They weren't going to give us a free layup," Tar Heels forward Danny Green said. "If he had just kept his head, he would have had two points probably."

I'm curious to know at what point do you cross the line into a different shaft material and/or what necessitates that switch? For example and clarification consider the following, if you play steel shaft irons, it's highly unlikely that your driver is a steel shaft.

20090131183621AAPHALl	Sports;Running	Running a MILE...how to get the most out of it?	I'm 18 5'8"ish and about 130 pounds      Ok, I never run at the gym, or for exercise. I work out a few times a week at the gym and I use those machines that work specific parts of your body.       I'm not fat, and I have my upper abs, but there's a slight accumulation of fat over my lower abs that inhibit the lower abs from showing. I have them but they can hardly be seen.       Because I don't run, will starting to run a mile every other day, then every day, then increasing to a few miles a day quickly burn of the few small "problem areas" on my body?      I thought it might bc my body hasn't had that activity for a long time, so although it only burns about 100 calories per mile, the increase in cardio would help me out...      I REALLY need someone's personal experience with running...does it take long to burn off the fat if I already am slim with a high metabolism?       And, how do I increase my endurance to running so that I may increase my mile quicker?

20090131175959AAYR9ZF	Sports;Running	Help with trackie first timer?	This is my first season of track (I am currently doing Indoor) and I haven't been doing as good as I wanted to. I have been working pretty hard...as hard as I can without track interfering with my education. But I am sick and tired of getting really bad times for mid-distance sprints like the 300m ,400m, 600m, and 800m runs, and I hate it when my coaches say at the end of the track meet, "Good Job, yes, you did a good job today, good job" despite the fact that inside I didn't really think I did a good job. For practice, I have been trying to over-do it, like for example when everybody is finished I go out and run 3 miles, and when I can't run I do a lot of core work. And it just drives me crazy when my other team-mates get really good times and places for their heats when I'm stuck with the fact that I didn't get what I wanted, even though I think I work harder than them and they're a little bit lazier than I. Should I be lifting my butt off and kinda linger from my core work? I have been trying really hard to get that strong core and six pack (which I haven't gotten yet) and I lift, but not as much as I should be doing. And another thing that boggles my mind and drives me crazy: a member on my track team has a six pack, and he did no work to get it. Absolutely none, as he claims. I am ticked off by that, because I should have that six pack by now with all the work on my core that I've been doing. What more can I do to better myself at this sport, specifically with the 300m up to 800m? I guess that is my ultimate question. In the end, I have this insane goal to meet up with my state records, as dumb as that sounds. Thanks for your help. In regards to my times, I have a P.R. 45 second 300m (that I can't freakin seem to achieve at the meets), a 1:59 600m, and 2:45 800m, as bad as they are. These times will get me nowhere, and I need to lower them and get first. Plus, I need help with my anger....a little 8th grader beat me by a second in the 300m (I am in tenth grade, 15 yrs. old) and I am really ticked off by that fact, even though it was a while ago.

20090131192619AAG89jE	Sports;Tennis	I'm a tennis player and my joints hurt. Why?	i'm 19 i played a year of college tennis and currently i'm coaching for high school. On saturdays we (me and the head coach) open the courts and let the kids play sets and have a practice that is pretty much only fun and not so much work so the kids can really learn to love the sport. anyways i woke up at 7 today and started hitting at 8 with my little brother then i went and rallied with a few other groups so i could help them out a little bit. I then played one of the high school kids in singles and i played pretty hard and i felt great. Then i took about a 10 minute rest and had some gatorade then another one of the kids wanted to play me in a set and even though i was a little tired i agreed. We played and played and it was much closer than it should have been. the whole time my legs started hurting and i have never been that slow in a match before. i finished the set around 12:40 then i went home, showered, then napped for a few hours. Now my knees are hurting in the joints and they have never hurt like this before. my elbow also hurts in the joint but it has been hurt a few times.   why do i hurt like this?   i played on hard court   i use nsix one 90 (this is why my elbow hurts i am pretty sure)   the weather was perfect probably about 70 or 80 degrees fereinheit   i wasn't running more than usual and i stretched well before.   i hit with luxilon.

I like many other NFL teams, but none nearly as much as I like the Saints.  Two of the other teams that I like are the Steelers and the Cardinals.  Now they'll be facing each other in the Superbowl tomorrow, and I haven't made up my mind who to pull for.  I think the Steelers will win the game easily, so sometimes I feel like I'll pull for them.  Then I think about when I was 8 years old, and I played little league tackle football, and we were the Cardinals; so then I think I will pull for them.  Now I'm going to ask the yahoo answers community; who should I pull for?

20090131194053AAZj772	Sports;Wrestling	Out of all 24 WrestleMania's, which are your top 3?	OK so I wanna know which is your all time favorite WrestleMania. Mine would have to be WrestleMania 17, with the Triple Threat Tag Team TLC Match for the WWF (as is was back then) Tag Team titles with The Dudley Boys vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Hardyz, and Steve Austin vs. The Rock for The Rock's WWF title and Austin siding with Vince after he won the title, officially launching the Attitude Era, and Brother vs. Son, Vince McMahon facing off against his own son Shane McMahon in a Street Fight, Undertaker putting his WrestleMania undefeated streak against Triple H, Chris Jericho defending his Intercontinental Championship against William Regal. After that, my second favorite would have to be WrestleMania 20 with the Interpromotinal Match between Brock Lesnar and Goldberg with Steve Austin as the Special Guest Referee, and Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat Match, and John Cena FU-ing the Big Show to become the US Champion, and Evolution (Orton & Flair) vs. Rock N' Sock (The Rock & Mick Foley), Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero for Angle's WWE title, Undertaker returning to take on his own brother Kane, and who can forget the moment when Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero hugged in the ring after Benoit won the World title to end the show Lastly, my third favorite WrestleMania 23. It had some great matches on it, like 2007 Royal Rumble winner The Undertaker going one-on-one with SmackDown World Champ Batista for the title, Shawn Michaels facing John Cena for Cena's WWE title, Bobby Lashley representing Donald Trump vs. Umaga representing Vince McMahon in a Hair vs. Hair Match, the unforgettable Money In The Bank Ladder Match, Giant vs. Giant Kane vs. The Great Khali in an Interpromotinal Match and many more.

20090131201903AAaZIzu	Sports;Wrestling	The current state of ECW?	Matt Hardy requested to be resign from his ECW contact and move to SmackDown! It seems WWE is making ECW a brand for new talent to be pushed to see how they go, and if they get over with the crowd. Over the past 3 years of ECW's existence, all the good wrestler were either released or moved to a different brand. ECW was full of potential when Vince revived it, but since then, It's only gotten worse. There are no more Extreme Rules matches, no more ECW originals or any good storylines or feuds. The only original left, Tommy Dreamer is way past his prime, hardly ever wrestles, never in any storylines and is planning to end his career and retire. The only "good" wrestler I can think of now is Evan Bourne, who is currently injured. But I see him being drafted to RAW or SD! in the near future. Is there any hope left for ECW?

20090131195523AAQb3Ux	Sports;Golf	Golf Ball does to high and no distance?	I'm a beginner golfer and really don't want to take lessons at this time but would like some tips. I have been practicing golf swing with medicus and it seems to have really helped with my tempo and swing plane. I'm making good contact but now I face an odd problem. When I hit the call it usually goes to high and not have any distance. I'm hitting a 5i about 115 yards. It's nice and straight but extermly high, the thing looks pretty but it's a 5i, I should be hitting that far with a pw. The same thing happens with my woods, if I hit a 5 wood it may go 100 yards and extermly high. How do I lower my trajectory some and get little more distance. If I could find a way to add about 20 yards to each club I think I would be happy. Could wrist hinge be the problem? I tried different ball positions and tend to make better contact with the ball back in the stance. Oh and also same thing happens weather it's off the tee or if I just hit off the ground.       Thanks for the advice in advance.

20090226081256AAsO1zQ	Sports;Basketball	Why do we keep on asking and discussing about the NBA great players?	Why do we always have to discuss about NBA's top players? We praise and idolize them when they are very good and we curse them when they did wrong or had a bad game. We already know that the likes of LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, etc. are the type of players that we are going to discuss even after their retirement (MJ type). Why don't we just talk and discuss about players who are average and su*ks (do bad or very bad at games) in the NBA. The type of players that will be long forgotten when they retired, the type of players that are not known because they only play little time, practice players who play with their superstar teammates just to make superstars better, and players that you will not remember playing in the NBA because they just rode the bench.      I do believe that they have their own contribution too to make their team better (we just don't see it). These are the guys that we should be discussing about because in due time, they will be erased on our memory...
