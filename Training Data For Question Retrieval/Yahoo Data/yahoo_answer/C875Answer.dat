gUr8xMskaa	Life's hard, I know.  I play the lottto practically every day it's playing; waiting for my big break to help everyone I know.  I continue to play, even though I know life's not supposed to be that easy.  Just a dream, something to look forward to.  You gotta find a way out of it--when life gives you lemons, make lemonade right???  You have to be strong! That's what your sister and cousin are thinking, do the same.  Life's full of ups and downs and sometimes you hit rock bottom.  You just gotta climb your way back to the top.  Get it together and go!

XxUsLqXRaa	If you're asking, are they allowed to take it against your will, the answer is absolutely no.  Credit card loans are all unsecured, signature only loans.  They cant take (or repossess) anything from you. The worst they can do is keep piling on the fees until you can never hope to get out of debt, and they can, of course, report all this negative information to the credit bureau.  There was a time in my life where I was so deep in debt that I no longer cared what my credit report looked like, but it came back later to bite me in the butt when I was better settled and wanted to buy a house.  With your fixed income, you may want to consider filing bankruptcy.  I don't normally recommend it because it stays on your credit record for 10 years, and it really is only a temporary solution if you don't learn how to curb your spending.  Also, it costs a good chunk of change just to file bankruptcy since you're having to pay the lawyer fees and what-not.  If you have a house or car that you're paying on, you would want to exclude them from the bankruptcy list.  Those things CAN be taken away from you by the banks.  You cant get out of those loans and still keep the items.  Your best bet may be to contact a reputable consumer counseling agency.  Stay away from any that offer a promise to eliminate all your debts and keep your credit clean because they will be scammers.  A GOOD consumer counseling agency will need to know what your income is, and they'll need an honest confession about who all you owe money to.  They will do all the legwork....they'll contact each one of your credit card companies and negotiate the debt down to a more reasonable amount, often removing all the penalties and interest charges.  Of course, you have to cut up the cards and not use them anymore, otherwise their help would be pointless.  It will still be a negative mark on your credit report, but not near as bad as a bankruptcy, or a delinquency.  You make one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, and they divide that amount up to your creditors until you finally have them paid off.  I dont personally know of any good credit counseling agencies, but I'm sure you can check through the Better Business Bureau and find one.  It would be a good idea to check ANY of them through the BBB anyway.  Those credit card companies can sue you, if they so decide.  Normally, they dont because the debts usually are not more than a few thousand, and they get to file it as a loss and recuperate some of it.  Try reading books like "financial help for dummies".  (Those "Dummies" books are great!)  Learn how to deal with credit card companies.  They thrive off the fact that most people are uneducated about what their rights are, and sometimes they win by using scare tactics and lies.  There is no better strategy than education.  It takes some work and some commitment, but if you want out of this mess, you'll do it.|`|gayccFaZaa	Get your doubts about Credit Card program procedure solved here. <a href="http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com</a>|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	No one can take a disability check.

Yes, it is alright that you are receiving $10 per hour!|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	It does seem like the fair thing is for them to give you at least the minimum merit raise. Have you brought this up with your boss yet at all? A frank conversation pointing out that you've never gotten a merit raise may do the trick, but I wouldn't "demand" anything if I were you.

d763cfa4bd42443881e4575d4dcd6085aa	Yes it does.<br>  <br>  35% of your FICO credit score comes from payment history.  That includes things like late payments, charge offs and other things.<br>  <br>  So have a 30 day late does significantly lower your credit score.<br>  <br>  Always pay your bills on time, especially in this economy.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Yes it does.  Most creditors dont report late payments until they are about 30 days old.  If you were to pull your credit report, and look at the detailed montly payment reports, you will see that late payments are flagged as such.  Each one impacts your credit score negatively.  And, unfortunately, it takes about 10000000 times longer to bring the scores back up as it does to knock them down.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	I believe so... sorry.

AA11284831	ACH stands for Automated Clearing House.  It's a system operated by the Federal Reserve Bank to facilitate the transfer of funds from one bank account to another.  Each account is identified by a routing code that identifies which Federal Reserve Bank the bank is under and an account number that identifies the depositor's account.<br>  <br>  Once a transfer of funds is released into the system it flows more or less automatically.  Normally the only time that manual intervention is required is on the receiving end if the name on the transaction doesn't match a name on the account or on the sending end if the receiving account number is incorrect.  Either issue triggers an item reject that normally requires manual intervention.<br>  <br>  On the receiving end if there is a name mismatch it is reviewed by a human to see if there has been a misspelling or other issue that would warrant accepting the transaction.  If there's a reject for an invalid account number, most banks automatically reject the payment.|`|72ZdY1hFaa	Mine alway has been my bank handles it like a payroll deposit

I thought the fund was safe years ago when I bought it!  After all, I figured what could be safer than preferreds issued by the biggest banks in the country?  Best plans of mice and men. <br>  <br>  After a lot of looking I can't find the answer to our mutual question. No one seems to know.  <br>  <br>  I think the reason no one knows is that it will depend on decisions that the government hasn't made yet. <br>  <br>  My opinion is that the government would stop paying dividends on common stock and probably cancel the common stock. But that it would recognize the preferred stock and the bonds as a debt obligation and continue to pay those dividends.  But that is just my opinion so please don't go by that.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

yw1MDI3zaa	LLC = Limited Liability Corporation, with an LLC, your personal assets are not held reliable incase your company goes bankrupt or lawsuits are filed, etc. plus you are only taxed once for personal income while although LLC are harder to gain capital. a Corporation requires you to pay your personal taxes as well as Corporate taxes. Also, an LLC is better than a sole proprietorship since in a case of an emergency or if you die your LLC will continue on as normal as compared to a sole proprietorship in which the company dies with you.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	What type of corporation?  C or S.  S is very similar to LLC in that business income passes directly to your personal income.  In both cases your personal assets are safe from business judgments.  Differences between an S corp and LLC are in the number of allowable shareholders (or members if LLC), corporate governance,  and reporting.  LLC is easier with more freedom, less regulation.  LLC is usually the better choice for an individual or a few partners but it depends on the business.  If in doubt get professional help.  You can change the structure in the future but it does take some work.|`|pVss9Zpkaa	Before you start your business you need to decide what form it will take. This decision will stick with you for the life of your business as it is not the easiest thing to change. Every business is different and the correct decision will depend on your goals and your circumstances. Professional help is reccommended, this can help you avoid costly mistakes. Dont forget to think about the tax implications.<br>  <br>  You will often see it said that one of the advantages to setting up an LLC (Limited Liability Company) rather than a corporation is that the set up process is easier. In my opinion if you use the right resources setting up a corporation is very easy indeed. Most of this can be done online.<br>  <br>  As far as protection is concerned the LLc provides all the protection of a Corporation meaning that your personal assets are protected for example in the case of a law suit against the business. In some cases in the case of a corporation you may find yourself paying tax twice, for the corporation in the first instance an on your personal remuneration from the corporation in the second instance. In the case of the LLC this does not happen.<br>  <br>  The paperwork, formalities and laws to be complied with under the Corporation structure are far greator than thise in the LLC. This means that with the LLC you have less paperwork meetings etc. but more importantly it means it is more difficult to make mistakes or break any rules.

Or you could go around your neighborhood and pass out fliers. Are you redcross certified? You get way more jobs if you are because you will be more trusted.

AxSQuCAraa	Actually it depends on what state you live in.  In Indiana you are only allowed to work certain times during the day but are not limited to how many hours you work in a week.  If you are only 16 you would be able to work from 4 pm to 10pm during the week and from 8 am to 10 pm (of course not all one shift) on the weekends.

The note includes the term of your loan, where to make your payments, your interest rate, late charge policies, etc.  The mortgage (called a "deed of trust" in some states) is the document you (and anyone with ownership interest in the home) sign at closing that acknowledges the placement of a lien (or legal claim) to the home as security or collateral for the loan granted to you.  This document also contains conditions you (and other owners) agree to uphold.  The typical mortgage document contains agreements to make your payments on time or suffer the consequenses of a possible foreclosure (you don't pay, you don't stay), keep the home in good repair, pay taxes and insurance on the home, use the home for legal use, etc.|`|32c69eb12f0e97a41a837168f091a222aa	same thing|`|26959a2082d4badc9dd0164daae5e30aaa	House note is a term that is rather out dated but means mortgage in most instances.
AA11176507	In some areas of the country Charter Communications offers a Sports Tier or View on their digital package. You have to have a digital cable converter; which they provide. As far as most cable or satellite providers, they most likely have similar packages available.

Yo por lo menos estudié marketing y publicidad. Recuerdo que todo el mundo me decía que no estudiara eso porque estaba muy saturada, pero yo no les hice caso, porque sabía que iba a salir adelante. Hoy día todos en mi familia me agradecen el haber estudiado esa carrera porque los he liberado de los problemas económicos. Son muchos los que anualmente se gradúan de las diferentes carreras, pero solo sobresalen los que tiene un plan en la vida Y LOS QUE NO QUIEREN SER DEL MONTóN. Como dijo Einstein: "SI QUIERES SER DIFERENTE DEBES HACER COSAS DIFERENTES"<br>  <br>  Yo no quería ser del montón, por lo que al graduarme empecé a buscar una forma de ganar dinero, pero no en una oficina de 8 a 5, sino desde la comodidad de mi hogar, por lo que empecé dando asesoría de imagen, marketing y ′publicidad a través de internet a las personas que me lo solicitaban y hasta el sol de hoy gano muy bien, todo desde mi hogar. Luego estudié mi maestría y doctorado aumentando mis conocimientos en la materia para seguir asesorando a mis clientes. Pero a pesar de que vivía muy bien todavía no estaba conforme con lo que ganaba, por lo que busqué otra forma de ingresar dinero y la encontré ?LA MEJOR! Y te lo puedo asegurar yo que no soy ninguna "desescolarizada" yo sé de lo que hablo.<br>  <br>  <br>   Imagina por un instante no tener un pesado y estricto horario de entrada y salida con un malévolo jefe gru?ón que te rega?a cada vez que llegas tarde aunque sea un segundo... Imagina poder ganar dinero desde la comodidad de tu cálido hogar, pasando amenos y agradables ratos con tu familia, agregando el enorme beneficio de poder convertir tus ratos de ocio en dinero... Imagina que llega el momento de hacer reducción de personal en la empresa en la que laboras y desafortunadamente es tu turno de marcharte pero cuando te lo comunican tú lo tomas con una incomparable tranquilidad por lo que tus compa?eros extra?ados por semejante (y en ese momento) y extra?o comportamiento te preguntan que como puedes estar tan tranquila sabiendo que te quedaste sin trabajo, tú solamente sonríes... porque sabes que cuentas con una magnífica fuente de ingreso desde tu hogar. No es esto magnífico. Todo esto hace un buen sistema multinivel (esto es importante UN BUEN SISTEMA MULTINIVEL) por el que trabaja con él. <br>  <br>  Entonces ya quedó clara tu interrogante. Qué mejores razónes que esas....<br>  <br>  En caso de que sea tu deseo permanecer en la precaria situación (sea económica, de trabajo u otra) en la que te encuentras actualmente entonces no es recomendable que tengas un trabajo con base multinivel, pero si quieres experimentar todos esos sensacionales y únicos momentos que te describí arriba (que espero sea tu caso) te recomiendo este negocio 100% sin riesgo para tí (el riesgo lo asumo yo) con una garantía de satisfacción total exclusiva que no da nadie más en este tipo de negocio y si tienes dudas escríbeme y con gusto te responderé.<br>  <br>  Erika Thomas<br>  els0308@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  ?Te gustaría obtener un Ingreso Extra a través de<br>  Internet?.

Determine your tax liability for the year.  Divide this number by the number of paychecks you'll receive during the year.  This should tell you how much you should have withheld every paycheck if you want to owe $0 at the end of the year (with $0 refund due).  Compare this to what's being withheld now, and adjust your exemptions gradually.  There's a schedule somewhere that shows how much is withheld for any given number of exemptions, but I haven't seen it.   <br>  <br>  I don't know if this is legal, per se.  Don't come up short at the end of the year.

Sometimes, the prices are outrageous and if you do your homework prior to committing to buy, you will find that you can buy the item in stores for cheaper, once you add the shipping charges to the final total.<br>  <br>  Prior to buying, check out the ratings of the seller.  If they have a 95% or higher rating, then that means they have a good reputation.<br>  <br>  Also, you will want to sign up with Pay Pal.  It's a safe, secure way to collect payments and make them.<br>  <br>  Don't ever place a bid unless you have full intent of purchasing.  You can be reported for not following through with a commitment.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure that if you do purchase something, that you leave feedback to the seller.  This is an expected courtesy.

With fees and everything else it's just not worth it. <br>  <br>  If you want to try it out though sell something not worth much at all and see if you make any money and how the fees work etc and see if you like it. They even help you search for recently sold items so you know about how much to ask for an item. (You simply type in the name and it brings up some figures. Example if you typed in A&F hoodie it would come up and say <br>  <br>  Sold price: 16.00-18.00 <br>  Sold in the last 90 days: 81<br>  <br>  So you would know that they are selling well and usually go between 16 and 18 dollars.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	NASDAQ (which stands for "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System") is an organization that assists people in trading stocks. <br>  <br>  Stocks (sometimes called "shares") are basically a piece of a company that someone buys. For instance, if you buy a stock in Google for $30, then you wait a few years while Google gets richer and its stocks are worth more, you can sell that same stock for $60 and basically double your money. That's how people can make money off of stocks - they buy thousands of them for hundreds of thousands of dollars, then sell them back for a lot more money than they bought them for. But it's dangerous - you never know if that company is going to keep doing well the next day, and many people lose all their money because their company shuts down and their stocks are worth $0.<br>  <br>  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on the other hand, is the summary of how all stocks in America are doing. If stocks are worth more, the nation is considered to be doing well and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is high (usually the news will put a + sign if the Dow rises, which is a good thing). If the Dow falls because stocks aren't worth as much, the nation is considered to be in a recession (when the economy in a steady decline) or a depression (when the economy is completely hopeless and hardly anyone has a job). In this case, the Dow will be steadily falling as the economy goes into a recession or depression. The news will put a - sign by the Dow Average to show this. <br>  <br>  I hope that wasn't too long and/or boring. :)

Offer to pet-sit, clean houses, dust and vacuum your house, wash people's cars, mow their lawns, rake their lawns, shovel snow, and/or help other students with their math/English/history/science homework (this is called "tutoring"). With your parent's permission, print out flyers and hang them up everywhere, with your contact information (careful with this - you might get some weirdos who call you!).<br>  <br>  Help more around the house, and ask your parents for an "allowance raise" for your efforts (preferably discuss this with them beforehand so you don't just seem like you're randomly demanding money).

If they have any job openings, ask for about a 10-hour-a-week job (that's 2 hours a day for 5 days a week).

fSu5c3l1aa	Yes it is our responsibility to pay income tax to the Govt.<br>  Reasons:<br>  We think we are shelling with our hard earned money, but there are more than 70% of the people who dont have any work to earn. Our IT Money can fetch them employment thru Govt's employment schemes.<br>  <br>  We dont think twice, before we spent at a Restaurant or a Cafe, think about people who go to bed food-less. Cant we do a bit for them.<br>  <br>  I fully agree with the intention of your question, on whether the Resources (Money we pay as tax) is going to the Right People and helping the needy.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately we cannot do much about it. Nevertheless, the best we can do is Pay Tax sincerely and without evasion, hoping that atleast a part of it will fall in the right hands and be used for the right purpose.|`|n8TEDVOFaa	No. It's a system on slavery.<br>  <br>  100% of income taxes goes to pay the interest on the national debt. We have this debt because the Federal Reserve (which is private banks) prints money, gives it to the government with an interest attached to every dollar. <br>  <br>  Roads are payed for by gas tax, schools by local property taxes, and the military is payed for with taxes on corporate profit and import taxes.<br>  <br>  Being mandated to file a tax return is unconstitutional. When you sign your tax return, you are waiving your 5th amendment ("nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"). Your tax return can be used against you in court, which is why your 5th is waived. I say that it is unconstitutional because waiving any of your amendments must be done voluntarily.<br>  <br>  § 7203. Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax<br>  <br>  Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting “felony” for “misdemeanor” and “5 years” for “1 year”.  <br>  <br>  Notice the third word "required", you will find wording like this in many places in the tax laws. Who is required? That is the question.

For example your local taxes like for fuel is monitored by the local state agencies which help for the devolopment for that particular state in india. but the income tax in india is monitored by the central agency known as the central government. <br>     Your view is definitely true but it varies with the view in india. In your country the tax that you pay is directly pulled out of your account but this is the not the case in india where the government does not pull the money from the peoples account but it asks them to sincearly pay their tax according to their annual income which is taken advantage by most of the people in avoiding those taxes through different means. <br>     This question will help them to be aware of their actions and if rectified will help their nation in crisis like the current one with world markets coming down.|`|9VvX0FXFaa	It is the governments duty to maintain social harmony.

Gem96NQyaa	It's because when you're taxing for public housing, that money then must be used for public housing, rather than, for example, building new roads or city maintenance.  Ergo, the people who build roads and maintain city facilities lose out on that money, and, if they work for the city, would likely be assigned to a project building public house instead, and no one new would be hired to build roads and maintain facilities in their place.  In essence, the old jobs were destroyed so the new jobs could be created using the same workforce.  Also, the old jobs don't get done (or ar significantly cut back) because the workforce is concentrating on the new jobs.<br>  <br>  It's not so much "destroying" jobs as it is shifting around money and labor so that those jobs are scaled back.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Creating wealth creates jobs...Bill Gates and the personal computer revolution has created millions. Imagine if Bill Gates had been taxed at a confiscatory rate as Obama proposes. Your PC would not exist!<br>  <br>  Creating wealth creates jobs... gov't make-work hand-outs and programs like "public housing" that re-distrubate income from the productive to the lazy and non-productive do not create wealth. They only create money transfer.<br>  <br>  Taxation transfers money to those who wish to GET only<br>  <br>  Google the quote by JFK..."Ask not what you country can do for you...ask what you can do for your country"<br>  <br>  |`|2LJV50vhaa	Easy---VAT  is one such tax,it was brought in under false pretences and the government lie has been perpetuated ever since.|`|AA11132354	The theory--not fact--is that taxation takes money that would be saved, put in stock or into new endeavors and that such actions create jobs.  However, NO PROOF whatsoever that that is the case.<br>  And that issue is separate from one of fairness.  Eliminating the capital gains tax should encourage investment in stock.  Right now when some one makes a killing on the stock market they are taxed at a maximum 15%, ;whereas the wage earned can be taxed at more than double that rate.  Capital gains are NOT added into ordinary income like wages and interest and dividends.  So those wage earners are taxed at higher rates than those making their living off the stock market--and McCain wants to totally eliminate the tax now.  Certainly not fair to those millions of us without any stocks or with a very small portfolio, who work for a living.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Lets say you make $100k profit. You want to invest that back into your business to buy machinery and hire an employee to run that machine so you can then go out to get more business. If you are taxed on that $100k at say 50% now you have $50k.  If the machine costs $40k and the hiring of the employee costs you another $10k you have no money to go out and get the business. <br>  If you were taxed at say 25% you would have an extra $25k to invest and create more jobs.  These jobs are continuous. The building of public housing is not a recurring job.  Also the public housing will be run down in no time and the upkeep for it will cost even more so the government will want more of your money.  |`|AA11426936	yes it does and no it does not,   too much taxation is bad and too little government supervision is also bad.   the original reasion FOE TAXIATION was for the government to protect the ***-sets of the rich   and it was suppossed to protect the rich from some one taking their ***-ets  then it evolved into  into every one saying less government   [ isn't this  the reason for the financial problem we have now] so again  the anser is YES AND NO|`|tMt5qBURaa	If people are highly taxed and it's in a time where prices are high and wages are low(like now) then they cannot buy things ie cars or just about anything which means businesses suffer and have to lay off staff to make profit howether that being said sometimes high taxation is good for when there is a minority that is so so rich and everyone lese is so poor ie the great depression. |`|4JQ3OkPuaa	People start businesses to make money.  The more money they make, the happier they are with their business.<br>  <br>  When the taxman comes around and steals huge wads of their money, they become unhappy with their business, shut down, and layoff all their workers.|`|01d98ba830f1caaefadbcb45f257a8e1aa	People are just afraid of the word 'taxes'.  Do they want roads and police and such or do they just want a little more money in their pockets?|`|AA11689813	The example of France, where taxation on employement is the highest in said to be democratic countries, is enlightening.<br>  <br>  First, a French employer willing to recruit an employee knows that he will pay nearly twice what his employee will get in his pocket.<br>  <br>  Second, owing to this higher cost of employement, goods get more expensive to manufacture - the same applies to services, of course - and so are they to sale... The process leads innescapably to a vicious circle. Less and less Frenchies are able to buy a brand new car - even the cheapest one - and sveral big French automobile plant are firing their employees and close their doors.<br>  <br>  Third, the money coming from taxes on employement is used to pay officials or else, and so it is hard, if not impossible, to cut on this kind of taxe when the need arises, as in time of economic crisis and recession, as example...<br>  <br>  Still in the case of France, the best example I found about this subject, a quick look at the news relating to labor in this country will tell you that today, the French minimum wage is no longer enough to rent a 1 room condo, and that there is growing number of French worker who become homeless.<br>  <br>  There is more to say, but the aforesaid is enough to sustain my explaination I surmise. |`|DAMZKbpDaa	Taxation raises the cost of an employee past what an employer is willing to pay. Job disappears. Or employer moves to a more tax-advantaged area.

There's nothing wrong with scripting your answers as long as they are genuine. Lastly be yourself. Employers not only want to know if you can do the job in which you are applying, they want to get to know you and get a feel for your personality. Be confident, professional, & most important...be personable. Your attitude and character can give you the edge over someone who may have more skills than you.|`|KF5pitm8aa	I told you drugstores were hiring :]<br>  <br>  Lucky for you, Wal-Greens is the fastest growing drugstore chain in America!<br>  <br>  Anyways, do you remember anything about the job description that was posted online? Did it say anything about possible hours (prob. nights and weekends)? Did it say anything about weekends? Anything about how many hours to expect per week?<br>  <br>  You basically want to mirror that description. For example, this is the help wanted sign that is on the front door of my drugstore, "Help Wanted: We are looking to employ reliable, hard-working individuals for several part-time cashier positions. Schedules are negotialbe, however, nights and weekend rotations are required."<br>  If someone walked through the door for an interview and told me, "I am looking for a part-time cashier position. I am a reliable, hard-working person. I would prefer to work nights, and can work weekends as well." . . . the would probably get the job on the spot, no joke. It really is that easy.<br>  <br>  You obviously meet all of their job requirements, since they called you in for an interview. Do not be scared to ask the interviewer questions about how many hours you will be expected to work a week, weekend rotation (or lack of, if you should have a set schedule), opportunites for advancement, etc. <br>  Since you have previous management experience, I would highly recommend asking about opportunites for management advancement. Some companies have the age rule that managers/supervisors have to be 21. In my company, the age rule is 18, thank god. <br>  I went from a cashier to a supervisor in 8 months, with no previous management experience, so you will probably advance quickly, if you want to. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

An IR LED is used to illuminate the eye. The pupil appears as a dark spot because it doesn’t reflect the light. A bright spot also appears on the cornea where the IR is directly reflected. An eye camera is mounted next to the IR LED to record the image of eye with these two spots. Software tracks the difference between the two spots to determine the eye orientation. A laser mounted to the frame helps with the initial calibration process.

Spend, spend, spend. Chief execs with large payouts. Let the bankers commit crimes. Let the super rich avoid tax and increase a benefit dependent culture with emphasis on cheap foreign workers on rubbish pay and bad conditions-Here and abroad- The Primark culture i call it. All it's left us with is unaffordable housing brought about by over-population increase- too soon rather than slowly increasing levels of immigration- 10 million immigrants since labour got in to power. What strain on housing? Immigrants themselves are complaining about it. They've worked hard for years and their pensions are now worthless- Ask many first and second  generation asians and blacks and jews  in inner city areas of pension age.  Also, we have no money saved- it's all debt. Housing is in short supply, because people in the country can't afford it- yet demand is high because we are so densely populated. It's not rocket science- that one. We will end up covering every bit of green land over and building on it to create a filthy stinking cesspit of waste for future generations - and still homes will not be affordable.

gvPXYXQFaa	I don't know about a pre paid credit card, but I have wanted to buy things and pay bills, etc, online in the past. So I got a debit visa card. It's not a credit card, it's like a normal visa card, where you just take out your own money. But it does the same things as a credit card can do. I have used my debit visa on e-bay before.

y1BjjH10aa	in the UK the law says that you are entitled to a minimum of 20 minutes break for every 6 hours you work (this may be paid or unpaid), and should NOT be at the end or the beginning of the work period.    Is that all you gasp? YES    So most people are better off than the minimum as they get half an hour for lunch (unpaid) and maybe one or two tea breaks (paid or unpaid), although not everyone will get these. If you do get more than this - be gratefull.      Take whatever breaks you are offered. If you work through them you will only be the worse physically and mentally for it, and it will tempt your employer to take advantage.|`|eG5W05Pbaa	yes i defo take it, it depends how many hours your wrking as theres laws that your workplace have 2 remember with the amount of breaks your aloud|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	lunch time is usually un paid. if you want a lunch you beter take it|`|50UbJp14aa	depends if you want to|`|AA11945637	yup|`|I1tnVvVGaa	when i got unpaid lunch, i would see if i could leave early instead of taking a break|`|AA10622097	We have 30 minutes unpaid, if you don't take it, you still don't get paid.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	only if they have brownise|`|AA12057913	yes i take it coz i need it - if u dont then u shud work less half hr or hour dependin on how long ur lunch is|`|fox5a3ePaa	Yes I have to im a truck driver and i have to take a break by law but I dont get paid for it|`|la9zji2Uaa	Yeah usually.

Whether you work during it or not... that's your choice (you can't be forced to do so).    Why should a business pay for you to go on break? It's nice when they do... but they shouldn't be forced to.|`|mQZDizMVaa	Hey, I looked forward to my unpaid lunch break. Gave me the chance to get out of the building to create a physical and mental distance from obnoxious coworkers, ringing phones, and it made a difference.     If I didn't take a lunch break it would feel as though I worked a straight 8 hours. Ugh!  I did that once - no more (but I got compensation by being allowed to leave early the next day).    I wouldn't work in any job where a boss would expect me to work through lunch. I need that break.  When he's ready to either fire, or lay you off, or the company closes, he's not going to say: "Keep so-and-so.  He/she worked through their lunch hour."  Do the best job you can-but don't sell your soul to any company 'cause they're not looking out for you. Reference: Lehman Brothers. I rest my case.    As for overtime? Nice to get a little extra in your paycheck-but it's gobbled up in taxes. Give me Comp time.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	there is no federal law that mandates breaks of any kind unless you are a minor, some states do but there are only 6|`|AHCelSY1aa	The only way it is illegal is if your boss requires you to work during this period.  However, they would also be held legally accountable under wage and hour laws if they are fully aware the staff was not taking there lunch and allowing it and willfully not paying them.  This would also include at no time did a supervisor or anyone in management actually reprimand the employee for not taking there break or insisting they take the one hour lunch.  What also plays a role is if whether or not you are paid hourly or annually.  Additionally, in a majority of states if you work more than 6 hours on any given shift a break must be given to you at minimum of 30 minutes.|`|tZbX0KDSaa	Yeah, but I wouldn't take too long.

I assume you mean a county occupancy permit since it obviously needs work.<br>  <br>  Worst case, or possibly best case for you, is that it will be auctioned off so the alternative is to wait and try to buy it at auction.  If that's the way you go I'd suggest you get the house inspected prior to bidding because the house would be auctioned as is.  No contingency clauses allowed.  Ask them to let you know when and where the auction will be held. Banks usually don't hold on to houses for too long.  You would probably need your financing in place, letter of credit, to be allowed to bid.|`|2e53e0edd43c14c6df942d701151ec61aa	Your agent seems useless. <br>  <br>  Do not make an offer at price you do not want to pay.<br>  <br>  Find a good agent who will write an offer at the price you are willing to pay and conditional upon passing inspections.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine took his father's advice. He made a low offer knowing he could always submit a higher offer if he was rejected. The first offer was accepted.<br>  <br>  You can make an offer without an agent. <br>  <br>  In most cities real estate such as houses cannot be sold without being brought up to code. It should be included in the offer that the house will pass codes.<br>  <br>  Are you are carpenter. Can you fix up a house? Finished houses sell for more because a lot of work was done on them.
382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	This sounds very odd!<br>  You should NEVER send an item until the money is safely in your pay-pal account, and pay-pal would never advise you otherwise. I would assume to email you received was not from pay-pal at all.<br>  Log into your pay-pal account and see what it says on the item page. If the money is not in there then send pay-pal an email explaining your situation and see what they say. I have emailed them many times and they have been very helpful. The only reason I can think of for your money not being in there is if it was paid by e check, which takes up to 9 days to clear. However, it would advise you when it is safe to post your item.<br>  This is a weird situation, and it is a shame it was your first time selling that it happened. Yes, the buyer should have emailed you and tried to sort out any issues they had with the item too, it is very unfair of them to leave you a neutral without giving you the opportunity to rectify any problems.<br>  I would be emailing or phoning pay-pal asap and sorting the money side of things out. Money always appears in your account and THEN you post. In future, please always only respond to emails from your pay-pal account, not your usual email address, as this is the way a lot of spam and fake emails get hold of your information and  so forth claiming to be legitimate from pay-pal and ebay.<br>  I hope you sort it out and it ends ok.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Well your first selling experience didn't go well.

Paypal have done this to me, also. It is a badly thought out security measure to protect buyers. You need to trawl through the eBay info, to find it.|`|E3DChHxbaa	noooo this will be a scam and fraud. there are so many fraudsters on ebay and they send you an email as if off paypal saying they will release funds after item is sent out, this is wrong, you always get the money 1st, then you send it out and you shouldnt have to wait at all.<br>  they are very clever at convincing you because you dont want negative feedback, most of the scams are around selling phones etc all wanting them to be sent to nigeria. also make sure you send out to a verified address, i was stung by having the money in paypal and it taken out again and i wasnt covered because i sent it to an un verified address
WwXrTQgaaa	What the hell? The moron just needs to sign up for Paypal or something.    If you go for this, make sure the funds CLEAR whatever bank they're drawn on. Also, I'd go the extra mile and actually call the bank they're cleared on. Make this perfectly clear in writing to the buyer up front before he mails or emails this corny, silly payment.

Write him back and tell him he can send a money order, sign up for pay pal or even do a bank transfer for cash. All of those things are easy to do. And absolutely do not let him have the item until you have cash money in hand.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	No! No! No!  Do not accept this.  Call him and tell him that since he is trying to scam you, now the price has doubled and it must be paid in cash, and once the cash is determined by a bank to be real, you will deliver.  I'm serious.  We all need to work together to put these scammers out of business and let them know we are on to them!

At least he has a conscious, most employers are calling it quites without notifying their employees before hand ... most employers should at least notify employee layoff 2 weeks in advance, to allowing the employees to prepare for unemployment or at least give them a chance to find another job before firing everyone and closing shop.<br>  <br>  It's happening to me as well. I work at a bank and just a few months ago, I worked a normal 40+ hour work week. These days, I only work 20-25 hour per week (my bank is one of the big banks going through problems). Funny though, just this past fall I was saying to myself, "I wish I had more time for myself"! These days I have plenty of time and lucky break for me, my parents taught me in the art of Saving.

7JZC3XsPaa	Two options, <br>  1. Open the file in Word 2007. Choose save as and re-save the file in the Office 97-2003 format. Your prospective employer is almost certain to be running Office 2003 - it is still the standard for most offices and corporations. <br>  <br>  2. You could advise your prospective employer to install the Microsoft Office 2007 compatibility fix. This will allow him to view Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents that have been created using Office 2007.

Good Luck!!|`|xue72D76aa	Did you send it as a .docx file?  If your prospective employer has an older version of Microsoft Office, he/she will be unable to open it unless they download and install the converter.  What you can do is open the file in question and hit "save as".  At the bottom there will be two lines.  The top is for the file name.  The bottom one is "save as file type" or some variation on that.  You can pull down the drop tab and select an older version of Microsoft Office (2004 for example).  This should save the file as a .doc file which is accepted by other Office programs.  Good luck with the job hunt!|`|09rf8Hrfaa	Well are two ways <br>  <br>  ?

kvP6bAySaa	Very poor idea - OK, you're bored - life isn't perfect!<br>  <br>  Take a longer term view - the pro's: being back in the UK (I wouldn't personally consider that a "pro"....but anyway), potentially being less bored.<br>  <br>  The cons: quite a lot less money.  Possibly ending up in a dead-end job, where you will be just as bored.  Possibility of the Manchester company going bust or laying you off if the economic conditions in the UK deteriorate further.  A definite "regression" in your career.  Future employers would possibly consider your decision to return to a lower paying job in your home country as an admission of failure or having no ambition.  Personally, if I was considering your C.V as an employer, the "working in Germany" part would impress me, but the "went back to the UK on ￡20K" part would probably make me stop reading and move onto the next candidate.<br>  <br>  I think if you do it, once the realisation kicks in that you've gone backwards, a year from now (or maybe sooner) you will be in "Oh my god...what have I done??" territory.<br>  <br>  At the age of 34 you would be much better off seeking a more challenging position in Germany if you're bored with your current role.<br>  <br>  (By the way, I have quite low monthly outgoings and I don't really lead an extravagant life, but I would seriously struggle to have any kind of enjoyable existance on ￡20K.  Its about ￡1200 a month take home pay.

cXtEx98Haa	I think rather than relying on answers from the Internet from readers who don't know details of your area and your house, you should determine who you are likely to list it with when you sell it and call the realtor and get his/her opinion.<br>  <br>  In spite of the fact that you live in an area that is mostly untouched by the huge slump in housing, I hear daily knowledgeable advisers telling people in these situations to do nothing, and I think that would apply to you.<br>  <br>  It actually sounds however, like you and your husband truly enjoy working on your house.  I think that's wonderful that you enjoy working together on your house which sounds wonderful.  <br>  <br>  Understand that I am no expert, but my opinion is:  <br>  <br>  More than four bedrooms is not often wanted.  That room would be likely be used as you are probably using it--family room, game room, study, etc.  <br>  <br>  Bathrooms in basements are an important thing.  I have that as top candidate.  You said it is roughed in.  Does that include roughed in plumbing for input and waste water.  Bathrooms in basements may require cutting into the concrete floor and finding where to connect your new bathroom to existing pipes.  Can be tricky.<br>  <br>  Any time you have free labor of a skill, that is a good thing.  That makes the "outback" a good candidate.  <br>  <br>  Best advice is talk with a realtor and pose the question just as you did here.  I congratulate you both on buying the quality appliances.  I am certain that is a good selling point.  As I said it sounds to me like you truly want to do one of these projects.  I think, unless the realtor tells you you're crazy, do the bathroom.  Remember, though to think about the plumbing.<br>  <br>  Good luck both there and at your relocated destination.|`|pgwao1luaa	Four bedrooms is enough you might want to consider putting a office or small reading room. You can make the recessed area a entertainment area, or nice shelves for a library. Why would you put a bathroom in the basement? unless you turned it into a big family recreation room. Adding a fence to the front or back yard is a plus also you will be amazed at  how much that will raise value of the house if you don't already have them. <br>  When ever you enter a home the first impression will be your walkway and entry way then stairs, fireplaces, anything at eye level will be important to fix. Windows and how they are displayed, what type of coverings. Good luck

You may be able to adjust that for a little more each paycheck and less refund or small amount owed.  See instructions on W-4 form at irs.gov.

Well on average right now if you not going to stay there longer than 5 years it is better to rent big time. Most young people do not know that and then they get way over there head because they then want to move and loose a lot of money. Visit Apartment Guide .com they have some good answers for you. Anyway look to pay for nice about 800-1300 for rent. Not so nice 550-800 a month. water 30-80 month, electric 60-180, gas 50-200, Tax not so much for this but insurance say 20-30- month. Hope this helps.

Very very important since your type of insurance will need to change|`|KHwvHgwAaa	The greatest pitfall in renting out property is the contract. You must make sure that your contract/lease is legally enforceable where you live and ensure that you cover all aspects of the property. This is why it is easier to use an estate agent as they already have standardised contracts. Also you need to consider who's going to manage the property, are you prepared to deal directly with your tenants?<br>  It is a legal requirement to inform your mortgage provider if you rent out your property as it's changed from owner-occupier to buy-to-let. Different implications for the bank. All in al, good luck.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear MD:   You are a sole proprietor and will use IRS Sch. C to report your income and expenses. With Sch. C, Sch SE is required (self employment taxes). Information from these forms flows back to your 1040. If you dedicate a portion of your house exclusively for your business you maybe able to expense some of your utilities, insurance, taxes etc. It is not uncommon to have a loss the first couple years in business but the IRS wants to see progress toward the profit side within several years.

ReQyHq4Baa	Try Orchard Bank, they give cards to people with bad or no credit, I hear.  But the interest rate is high.  You'll just have to swallow that because it's better than nothing.    Word to the wise, though, BE CAREFUL!  There are millions of people out there who are in over their heads in credit card debt.  You only need one or two credit cards, no more.  Please, don't get anymore.  And only spend what you can pay in full every month or only spend 35% to 40% of your limit.  For instance, if your limit is $300, which it probably will be, only spend about $100 or less.  And always pay more than the minimum balance - on time!      If you do all this your FICO score will go up and you'll be able to rent, mortgage a house, lease a car, get a personal loan without a problem.  I wish someone had told me this before I had gotten into trouble with credit cards.   Good luck!|`|fqycKwuQaa	there are two ways you could start credit one or them is taking out a small personal loan which you might need a parent or an adult to co-sign for you meaning if you do not pay the loan they will. Or you could apply for a credit card for bad or no credit which most likely will get you approved no matter what, but if you are a student you could get a student credit card which will offer you lower rates and no annual fees, check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com and go under bad or no credit or student cards. good luck|`|f9192016343611878eb18a743f6f0f5eaa	I have one credit card.It is valid thru 01.10, MAESTRO.|`|a3QAfhztaa	Not sure who to steer you to but just make sure to look at the fine print for credit cards. Make sure not to get a credit card that charges you any kind of monthly or yearly fee. There should be quite a few companies willing to give first time credit seekers credit cards with low limits.

qWaYbxcxaa	Horrible idea.    1. If you are under 59 1/2 you will be whacked with a 10% IRS penalty.    2. You will be taxed at ordinary income levels on the entire gross amount in the year it is withdrawn. State and federal income tax.     http://taxes.about.com/od/retirementtaxe...    3. There is NO tax deduction for gifting anything to non charity.    4. If you give him over $13,000 in 2009, he will have to pay a gift tax on amounts above $13k.  http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/arti...|`|SN5dYkafaa	The responders, so far, have most of it right. These are two separate items. Once you cash out an IRA, you can, of course, do whatever you like with the money.    The taxable portion of your IRA withdrawal will be taxed as ordinary income at your highest marginal tax rate and, if you're under age 59 1/2, a 10% IRS penalty will be imposed, unless an exception applies.     In 2009 you can gift up to $13,000 to any number of recipients with no gift tax implications. If you're married and elect to split the gift, you can give up to $26,000. There are no tax implications to this gift: It's not a write-off to you, and it's not taxable to the recipient. To qualify for this annual gift-tax exclusion, it must be a completed gift of a present interest. In other words, the recipient must have immediate and unrestricted access to the gift. To the extent you make a taxable gift, it will simply chip away at your estate tax exemption, currently at $3.5 million.     Example. Sam is single and gives $113,000 to his brother in 2009. He's made a $100,000 taxable gift as $13,000 qualifies for the annual gift tax exclusion. He would complete a gift tax form with his tax return and his current estate-tax exemption would be reduced by $100,000, to $3.4 million, assuming he made no other taxable gifts during his lifetime.    As far as time..., you complete and send in a withdrawal request form to the trustee/custodian who sells/liquidates the position and mails you a check. Should be no more than five to seven business days.    Hope that helps.     Disclaimer.

If you are below a certain age you will be taxed for the cash out as income plus a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.

Should take about a week i would guess.    If you give him more than $10,000 then you will get taxed on that excess gift also.

You get the dependency exemption and he gets the EIC if he otherwise qualifies due to nondependent children and special rule for divorced or separated parents.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Form 8332 does not affect the EIC.  The rules for the EIC stated that it can be claimed for a child who cannot be claimed because of the rules for children of divorced or separated parents, but could otherwise be claimed.  (Without those rules, Form 8332 would have no effect.)  If he could claim the EIC for those children if not for the Form 8332, he can claim them for the EIC after signing the form.

AA10007676	First thing for creating a website you need to register a domain or web address from an authorized registrar. It cost only around $10 per year. then you need an hosting to host your site's files. there are lot of hosting providers, you need to find a suitable one for yo. Then you need to create the website files and upload them to your hosting. You can find more details of each of these steps here http://www.shaplus.com/guide/website/how... .    Now the website is ready and then next part is to drive traffic to your website. Submitting to Google or yahoo do not cost anything.submitting your site to google is as simple as submitting a form, see this http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/...    But if your site comes in the first page of search results for the relevant query is the difficult part.If your site is popular and lot of people link to your site it will come by itself. You may need to take into account the google guidelines while building the site for better ranking http://www.google.com/support/webmasters... .    There is also paid method to come in first search results in Google, it is Google Adwords. You pay google and your site is shown as sponsored sites in a box at the top of  search results page|`|hyzP0uJWaa	"I want to know how the Goggle or Yahoo websites are earning money for there services  I know little bit, by the advertisement they are getting money,"    Correct. You can earn money that way too. Look up "adsense" on google.    "How I create a new website, how I register"  What you need to do after you have created your web site is look for what is called a web host. You can create your web site yourself for free, or you can have a professional web developer design it for you. Web hosts also offer to help you create your web site for a price.    "And if any money is need to pay for showing my website if Google Search"  No, your website will show up in Google if you have a large number of other sites linked to yours. Or, if you prefer, you can advertise your site through Google as well, which how much you pay varies all the time, like the stock market, depending on where you want your ad seen, the key words you want to use, etc.    Your web site should be built before you consider web hosts, and Google ads if you want to create it yourself. Why get charged money per-month for a site that no one will go to because it isn't finished?    If you prefer to create the site yourself, you can start making your Web pages without a Web host and expensive programs like Dreamweaver --Dreamweaver just makes it ALOT easier. Creating Web pages cost nothing!    You only need a Web host when you are ready for the world to view your Web pages. But you have to create them first!    To create Web pages, you need to know the language of the Web: XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. And that cost nothing. You can create a Web page in as little as two seconds at no cost in Notepad. And the best part is, knowing XHTML gives you full creative freedom over designing your web page: You aren't stuck with the limitations of a template. Besides, you still need to know XHTML even for Dreamweaver CS3 so you won't get lost if you ever need to edit your code directly.    For now, get an XHTML document started. Open up Notepad, Word, or Dreamweaver CS3. Paste this into a blank document :              Untitled Document              All of the content you want viewed must be placed within the body element of the document; meaning, between the  and tags.

And a whole list of inline elements you can create:  http://www.missingmethods.com/Programing...    After you've created your first web page (XHTML document), you'll want to preview it in a web browser (Firefox or Internet Explorer).    To do this, save the XHTML document under "My Documents" in a folder called firstWebSite.    Name the XHTML document firstPage.html (or name it anything you want with the .html attached to the end).    Go to your browser menu and choose File > Open and find firstPage.html.    (These steps are animated here:http://startwebdev.com/webdevX/XHTML/XHT...    If you want the world to view your web pages, you'll need to get a web host.

4MypYVHYaa	The lenders use your gross income when determining your qualification for a mortgage.    They take what your current debts you are paying on your credit report. This is called your front end ratio. Then they take what you will be paying toward your credit card debts and add your home mortgage to this and it is called your back end ratio.     They try to keep this ratio below 40% therefore you now have 60% of your income left for food, utilities, insurance, gas, savings and other daily things that are necessary for you to survive.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|yHl7RIuOaa	they use gross. Now if you have a bunch of wage garnishments they will certainly take that into account.

What you have coming into your account vs. what is going out.  (Insurance, groceries, utilities, etc.)  This all determines how much of a home loan you will qualify for because they want you to be able to pay back a THIRTY YEAR mortgage.  It's not like a car.  It's a long-term commitment. So they have to be careful.  It's wise to disclose every payment you have so they can accurately determine a price range for your new home.

But if someone is getting their email alerts on their Blackberry, I suppose that's a different story. And if it's an urgent email and you're only replying late in the evening, then that could be a problem as well. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could find a way to make sure you reply emails at say<br>  <br>  1. First thing when you wake up (for about 15mins)<br>  2. At lunch time, say 2pm everyday (for about 15mins)<br>  3. Then again at, say 6pm, (for about 15 mins)<br>  <br>  That should give you some sort of routine when it comes to answering emails and you can get back to people much quicker. <br>  <br>  It may also be of interest to you to learn to touch type, then you can reply emails faster.

It is likely to be so for a year more at least. So now is not a good time to invest bulk amounts if u need to withdraw it less than a year and a half.<br>  For five years, it is alright to invest in mutual funds or shares. But make sure u don need to withdraw that money for 5 years, coz only then its beneficial.<br>  My opinion, do a systematic investment planning. Its a fixed amount invested every month to a mutual fund. This can be done by auto-debit too. Remember, the minimum amount to invest every month is 500. <br>  This way, u actually save up in due time. With a payable interest varying from 8% to 20%, u can gain more returns in a span of period.<br>  Discuss with ur mutual fund manager and have him help you to allot the monthly amount with maximum benefits.<br>  There's a company called Franklin Templeton. They are one of the leaders globally and are good asset managers. Call them up.<br>  Always remeber, future is uncertain. Mutual funds are prone to risks. If I were you, I'd break the lumpsome amount and put it across 3 schemes or more for a period of 2 or 3 yrs each.

Maybe in the future, agree on an hourly wage beforehand, $5-$8/hr. seems reasonable for a 13 year old.|`|3mAgM405aa	Dale M's response is right on.  However, instead of negotiating beforehand for a set hourly rate, it has been my experience that you should respond to parents [regarding how much they should pay you for the babysitting] with a straightforward statement:  "Whatever you consider as reasonable ...".   That statement will very often generate a response in which a higher payment will be forthcoming, because unexpected events do happen during the babysitting period.  As you have described, that is what happened when the little girl threw up twice..., etc.<br>  <br>  Again, you showed a great deal of professionalism in handling this situation and you are deserving of something extra in your pay.<br>  <br>  So don't feel guilty when comparing what you earned for this babysitting experience versus providing similar services to your cousin for free.<br>  <br>  Enjoy and keep up the good work!|`|pE5E5L5naa	You know....

Especially in this current climate.  <br>  <br>  Your daughter's unhelpful pressure is really a product of your own prior superiority complex - many people 'who worked hard all their lives' previously considered benefit claimants as one homogenous lazy, thick undeserving group yet within that category were people who acould not work through no fault of their own or recently/abruptly unemployed like you.<br>  <br>  So firstly you need to change your attitude, being on benefits is no laughing matter as you know.  You have absolutely NOTHING to be ashamed of - the system is there to be the safety net you need just now (Unlike the hammock some of the unscrupulous claimants use it as) - this is not you or your family.  <br>  <br>  You have paid your dues and need that help - just til you fet back on your feet.  It will be very hard and especially as you are looking after everyone else and no-one is looking after you.  <br>  <br>  You also need to talk to your daughter who is living in la la land really - explain to her you have done your best and she is behaving in a very selfish and spoilt way.  You do not need to be emotionally blackmailed on top of all your other pressures.<br>  <br>  Instead use your time between jobs wisely - could you retrain?  Maybe now you could be entitled to free Open Uni course etc?  Apply for all jobs going but put yourself in for the long haul.<br>  <br>  You will get through this - you are capable and you should apply for all your ARE entitled to.

X6BrtJ9eaa	I think ￡40 per week sounds about right. The important thing is to make a note of all the names of the people you speak to and the date and times of the phone call, and exactly what you were told. You can also request that the calls be recorded, then if you are overpaid you can say that you spoke to  [name] and they said  [. . .]. That way they can't ask you to repay anything at the end of the year.<br>  If they reduce you to tears you can also report them if you have their name.<br>  I'm sorry to say that the child tax credit people can often be like this - my friend took 2 years to sort her tax credits out.

When you receive back after a period you can increase the capital accordingly.<br>  if you need to pass general entry then you need to open seperate accounts   debit to cpital and credit to pf  and esic.

QoVL5cDHaa	No. When a woman is widowed, she gets the widow's rate. How much would depend on the amount of her or her husband's contributions. A married woman gets a reduced state pension if she has made no contributions, based on the husband's. If she has made contributions, her pension would be based on her contributions.<br>  Once widowed, I guess she would get a pension rate depending on what would be beneficial to her, based on either her or her husband's contributions.

R73aJ9qtaa	Whatever city you live in, I would contact their department of housing.  File a complaint, and request a city inspector come check it out.  This way, the inspector will mark "failed" under the qualifications of what a condo should be like.  This will subject the association to repair it.  If not they will be fined, as well as get some sort of "1st strike" violation.  This will make Realtor less likely to want to show people these complex's.

If he wishes to stay then he must pay in advance etc etc as any other tennant.  You helped him out, ok, I get it, it was nice of you, continue being a true freind and be honest, you need the room.

He is your employee, not your flatmate's girlfriend, and you are a businessman/woman not a naive student who's never had to handle a difficult situation before! Tell him that he's outstayed his welcome, that when you said he could stay there you assumed he would have found his own place by now, that you only intended it to be for a week or two and you're sorry if you led him to believe otherwise, and that you would like him to be gone by [date]. What's he going to do, tell you to eff off? Hardly, since you pay his wages!|`|0PHR8cICaa	You don't have a choice about reporting - it IS a taxable benefit, and has been since he first started to stay.  As for the taxable value to put on it, that's a bit more difficult.  I suggest you talk to your accountants about this.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Woah!! You are on dodgy ground - You said he could stay.<br>  <br>  If no money is changing hands then you cannot pursue this in this manner...he could claim it was an offer and so no taxable points can be made.
RhEhzGbraa	If you have insurance, you need to immediately contact your insurance company and let them know about this claim.  Your insurance policy contains a provision requiring that you report this claim and cooperate fully with their investigation.<br>  <br>  Your insurance company will fully investigate the facts of this case--they will interview your relative and all related parties such as the person whose car was damaged, any witnesses, etc.  Your insurance company will only pay out on the claim if they find that it is legitimate.  If they investigate and determine that your relative was not at fault, your insurance company will deny the claim and the insurance company for the other party will then make a decision whether to 1) drop their claim against you or 2) press the claim further by filing suit against you.  If the insurance company for the other party decides to go further and file suit against you, your insurance company will provide the necessary defense.  <br>  <br>  The most important issue is for you to report this immediately to your insurance carrier.  If you fail to report this claim, your insurance company can refuse to provide assistance to you since you failed to comply with a provision of your policy that requires that you report all claims.  If you take too long they can still investigate the matter but it will be under a "reservation of rights" which basically still gives your insurance company the right to back out of a claim payment and leave you hanging.<br>  <br>  Please call your agent or company immediately and report this claim!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Report the claim immediately to your insurance company.   Tell them all the facts you posted here.   Let them investigate and decide if there is a real claim or not.    Let them do the work.   That is why you pay for insurance.<br>  <br>  You might contact the Department of Insurance in your state.

When you lend a car, you are not there and its easy for them to lie about it. I would call and work with the insurance company on this. Do not say they are wrong, ask them to provide to you the documented facts regarding this, and I would play on your relative and tell them, that you worked out a deal that if the person told the truth and admitted something may of happend, the ins company then would be willing to further do an investigation on the other person and their car. You may find your person was lying, now you get them to deal with the situation, pay you back for monies lost or whatever.

But remember, this is a business that will always be in demand and new office buildings are still being built and opening--find the leasing agent or property manager for these.
