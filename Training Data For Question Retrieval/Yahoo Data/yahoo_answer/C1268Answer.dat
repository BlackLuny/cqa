2vRXS29iaa	Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that uses the inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular element.[1][2] The intensity of this emission is indicative of the concentration of the element within the sample.

AA10655250	About 99 per cent of Australia's nickel is produced in Western Australia supplying about 13 per cent of world production. <br>  <br>  Production by WMC operations are at Leinster, Mt.

There are two important benefits; they contain valuable cobalt and, being closer to the surface, can be produced by open-cut mining. Laterite ores are however difficult to concentrate using more complex metallurgical processes such as the reduction roast and ammonia leach at the QNI refinery near Townsville, Queensland. The new technology being applied in Western Australia uses PAL technology (next) and others use ferronickel reduction in New Caledonia, Colombia and Indonesia.<br>  <br>  The Cawse project is located 45 kilometers north-west of Kalgoorlie and is operated by OMG.<br>  <br>  The Bulong project operated by Resolute is 35kilometers east of Kalgoorlie.<br>  <br>  WMC operates mines at Kambalda, Mt Keith and Leinster, Goldfields region, in Western Australia.<br>  <br>  Queensland Nickel Industries operates the Yabulu refinery near Townsville.<br>  <br>  Preston Resources will operate the Malborough Queensland laterite project 70 km north west of Rockhampton.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  See the links below for additional information.

I can't be sure what you're talking about because of your English, but I assume you're talking about cutting off a piece of a tree, and using it to grow another tree.  That's asexual reproduction because you're propogating the same tree with the same genetics, without using sexual organs.  It's a clonal form of reproduction.<br>  <br>  2. This is just a stupid question, assuming you've worded it as it was on your test.  I would have picked D also, because when you're talking about relation, I would assume a phylogenetic relationship.  A simple point mutation could cause that change there.<br>  <br>  If the question was asking which two pair the best, then the answer is A.|`|V66j18Whaa	i agree with the first answer.<br>  1.the answer is B,because in mitosis,the cell makes an exact copy of itself.the trait you explained is an example of vegetative propagation,where the same organism grows from a part of the original organism,which therefore is an example of mitosis.<br>  2.the answer was A because t corresponded to almost all of the nitrogen bases in s,except for one.so yeah,when the question asks CLOSELY RELATED,you should look for the number of corresponding bases.

GASTNilgaa	Somebody made a typo or writing error on the left hand side.  The inner integral should go from 0 to t.<br>  <br>  It's integration by parts (or the same idea as integration by parts if you have not proved it yet).  Let me elaborate a little.  Let <br>  <br>  A = the integral from 0 to x [the integral from 0 to t of phi(s) ds] dt.<br>  B = the integral from 0 to x of x phi(s) ds<br>  = x [the integral from 0 to x of phi(s) ds].<br>  C = the ingral from 0 to x of s phi(s) ds.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you were to prove A = B - C.<br>  <br>  How to do it?  Regard C as the integral of u dv, with u(s) = s and dv(s) = phi(s) ds.  Noting that du = ds and v(s) = the integral from 0 to s of phi(t) dt we have by integration by parts<br>  <br>  integral from 0 to x of s phi(s) ds = (D - E) - F<br>  <br>  Where D = the function s v(s) evaluated at s = x<br>  E = the function s v(s) evaluated at s = 0<br>  and F = the integral from 0 to x of v(s) ds.<br>  <br>  Note that D = B, E = 0, and F = A.  So<br>  B - C = B - ((B - 0) - A) = A.<br>  <br>  Analysis is hard enough without mind reading, isn't it?<br>  <br>  If you haven't proved the integration by parts formula, now would be a good time to investigate how to prove it.

GASTNilgaa	Yes, call those (1), (2), and (3).  If you add (1) and (3) you see that<br>  <br>  b + 3b + c - 3c = 0 + 2 so that 4b - 2c = 2.  This tells you that 2b - c = 1 so that c = 2b - 1.  If you plug this into (2) you get<br>  <br>  -4b - 2(2b - 1) =1 or that -8b+2=1 or that -8b=-1 or that b = 1/8.  Then c = 2/8 - 1 = 1/4 - 1 = -3/4, and I can use (1) to solve for a = -b - c = -1/8 + 3/4 = 5/8.

HTmj2BXDaa	The universe is almost unimaginably big and almost unimaginally empty and it is infinite (which is also a little difficult to imagine).   There are a lot of other things we know about the universe.  I think you should scale back a little and pick one thing to teach in 30 mins.  You could have the class pick a "sun" and have the other students orbit the sun to make a solar system (with planets, comets, meteors, astoroid belts, etc.  Then pick a "black hole" and have each student be an entire solar system and have them orbit the black hole to make a galaxy.  You should be able to find very cool pictures of galaxies on the internet.  Then have each student be a galaxy and they can move around as galaxies and galaxy clusters (and most galaxies are moving away from us and from each other).   good luck

o91grX4zaa	I guess you mean regular octagon? Suppose it has side length 1. Take two parallel sides and extend them as lines to infinity. Take the two parallel sides that are at right angles to the first two and also extend them to infinity. So now you have enclosed the octagon in a square of side length 1 + 2/√2 = 1+√2. So to find the area of the octagon just take the area of the enclosing square and subtract away the area of the 4 right-angled triangles not inside the octagon i.e. (1+√2)^2 - 4((1/√2)^2)/2 = 1+2+2√2 - 1 = 2+2√2. So more generally if you have the octagon's side length as x then just scale 2+2√2 by x^2 i.e. (2+2√2)x^2

Wz9tSKTaaa	OK, it sounds like you've been confused by something, but it's difficult to know what by.<br>  <br>  Blood types are matter of antigens (bits of sugar or protein on cells that your immune system recognises as your own or not) on your blood cells, and their opposing antibodies. If you have the 'A' and 'B' antigen, you will have neither the anti-A nor the anti-B antibody, and you will be type AB.<br>  <br>  The Rhesus factor is a separate antigen caused by a separate set of genes. Being rhesus positive means that your blood cells have the antigen, whilst being negative means that you have the antibody against it instead. Therefore it is dangerous to transfuse positive type blood into negative type people (though the danger is usually if done repeatedly, whereas transfusing AB blood into an O type would be potentially lethal the first time).<br>  <br>  Rhesus factors are particularly important during pregnancy, as negative mothers who repeatedly carry positive children find their bodies become increasingly hostile to them, so they need an extra injection during pregnancy to control this effect.<br>  <br>  'Type AB Rhesus Positive' would generally be shortened to AB+.

Probably sometime in the next two years an earth like planet will be discovered, but it will take another three or four years after that to confirm that it has life on it.<br>  Most likely there are lots of planets with life on them, but not many with inteligent life,and even fewer with technological civilizations.  My own guess is that there are fewer than 10 advanced civilizations in the Milky Way right now, and maybe just us.  <br>  The main reason I think this is that life arose on the earth almost as soon as it was cool enough, and maybe more than once, but it took 4.7 billion years, around one third of the age of the universe, for intelligent life to arise on the earth.|`|W2suykEtaa	numbers don't work like that.<br>  <br>  according to your view, there's just so gosh-darned many stars that there HAS to be extra-terrestrial civilizations, close enough to be listening in on this conversation...<br>  <br>  well, there doesn't and there isn't.<br>  <br>  get a grip.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	if you really mean infinite, there's another you out there that just asked this question, and another me that just answered it.|`|Fr7eC5uUaa	Considering how many planets terrestrial planets are estimated to exist in the universe (a very large number, dont bother with the word billions), it is fairly likely that we are 'not alone.'

1wNsBNmxaa	For some of us, life is pretty much a straightforward process. We are reasonably comfortable with who we are and what we are about. Even our personal struggles fit into some kind of meaningful pattern. Doubts and confusion may arise from time to time, but an underlying meaning or purpose sustains us.<br>  <br>  For others of us, life is not so straightforward. Coping with the fast pace and complexity of life may find us straining to pull up the energy just to make it through each day. Illness or family problems may cause additional stress. We may feel a creeping sense of weariness with life, a sense that life is just too hard and not much fun. Even though we desire it, we're not sure our lives fit into a meaningful pattern.If you are contemplating the meaning or purpose of your life, the Purpose of Life Inventory may be of value to you.

I think this covers most things that are 'supposed' to happen.<br>  Planetary alignments: There aren't any.<br>  Alignment of Sun with centre of galaxy: Can't happen because the centre of the galaxy is not in the plane of the Earth's orbit.<br>  Once in 26,000 year alignment of the solstice sun and galactic equator: Happened in 1998. Did anything happen as a result? Of course not. Alignments mean nothing in measurable physical terms anyway.<br>  Passing of the Solar System through the galactic central plane: Won't happen for 30 million years or so.<br>  Planet X/Nibiru: Doesn't exist. If it was the size the claimants describe and following the trajectory they indicate, it would now be visible to anybody with a pair of binoculars.<br>  Pole shift: Magnetic pole reversal takes thousands of years and may not start for thousands of years. There is no reason to link it with 2012. As for rotational pole shift, that would take a huge amount of force on the earth. Where is this force going to come from?<br>  Solar storms: The Sun is due to reach a maximum in its 11 year cycle in 2012. No reason to suppose the next peak will be any more energetic than normal.<br>  26,000 year precessional movement of Earth's axis: Doesn't 'begin', 'end' or 'wobble' but carries on smoothly and unnoticed by all.<br>  The doomsday cranks like to tell us that lots of other cultures predicted the end of the world for this date.

2vRXS29iaa	A Big Ball of Life<br>  the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere together in one picture The biosphere is all about life. Physical geographers use the term biosphere to describe our living world. This is where all of the trees, bugs, and animals live. The biosphere extends to the upper areas of the atmosphere where birds and insects can be found. It also reaches deep into the ground at a dark cave or to the bottom of the ocean at hydrothermal vents. The biosphere extends to any place that life (of any kind) can exist on Earth.<br>  <br>  The biosphere is the one place where all of the other spheres of the planet work together. Think about the interactions for a second. The land interacts with the water (hydrosphere). The land interacts with the air (atmosphere and climates). The land even interacts with forces deep inside the Earth and the energy coming to the Earth from space. All of those forces work together to create our living world.

P3OBb0vLaa	Fur, fang, and claw...I would say that it is the "reasoning" that will be our downfall as a species. A human is more powerful than many other species that survive well enough, but most humans whose human animal could theoretically survive, could not survive as an individual because the course of their life has led them to be incapable, not their evolution.<br>  <br>  I think that when we further develop genetic engineering, we will inadvertently get rid of strains of strength that we do not even know existed within our race-we will eliminate an embryo based on a perceived flaw, thus eliminating lineage which carried an unperceived gift.<br>  <br>  I can understand why people would want to make a super humanity, I just don't think that humans are capable of being God.<br>  <br>  Human beings are entirely able to survive as equals with the animal world, but we would probably end up creating mass chaos rather than entering "Eden." We would not know how to teach our children how to survive and we would cling to the remnants of civilization, like litter, and murder for material possesions rather than learn to hunt or forage.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	There is no question that technology has greatly extended <br>  our habitat range and lifespans over those of other primates.<br>  We may well have overstepped the hard limits of how many <br>  of us this limited biosphere will bear.<br>  When it gets down to 'the last muffin on the plate' intelligence <br>  will probably be a strong survival trait.|`|5VHEcfp2aa	I believe we are equal...although we are for the most part poorly equipped physically the reasoning we have greatly surpasses any animal...so I guess that would balance us out. In terms of the long run and reasoning as a weapon against nature it is all relative to the current situation us humans are facing. Sometimes our reasoning can be the sole reason for survival (ex. knowing what to do when confronted by an angry bear) and other times our reasoning is utterly useless against nature (ex. being on an open beach with no where to hide and a tsunami is coming towards you). So all in all our relevance of existence is equal to all other animals as the main purpose for an organism as sophisticated as a human and as insignificant as a mouse is to reproduce. <br>  <br>  I hope my insights have shed some light on this topic for you.|`|RfW1iwscaa	There is a section on this in the book: The Once and Future King.  I would say yes, it has helped immensely.  It helps us ask questions and solve problems that animals can't.  Reason has also helped us to adapt to environments harsh to our existence (tundra) and provide enough food to be non-nomadic.  The freer the mind is allowed to look at things, the stronger the civilization becomes.  Look at America for example.  It is true though that nature itself is still fearsome to behold.  But if it is merely a power play between humans and other living things, give me reason any day|`|TEucykbZaa	I believe that humans will be overrun by the power of nature because it is too strong and humans are equal to other animals however, nature is more willing to take these risks to try and overpower people today..

Paint and art on your guitar can be the one thing that separates it from every other guitar. This is important to remember if you want your guitar to stand out. Be sure to place the pickups in their proper locations. For example, you need 2 audio pickups near the center section of the guitar, with enough space over them for the strings. You can put the switch anywhere you want, although the most convenient location is directly below the strings. As for the guitar cable plug, that should go on the bottom side of the body, for the purpose of convenience. You don't want to be tripping over your cables in the middle of a concert.

You can do further research to discover the space needed between each individual fret, as it differs on the length you decide to make your guitar. The neck should be made to easily be screwed into the body of the guitar

xmvPyLYUaa	If two coins are tossed, there are four possible outcomes:<br>  (1st coin - 2nd coin)<br>  H - H<br>  H - T<br>  T - H<br>  T - T<br>  <br>  Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.<br>  <br>  a.  There is only one outcome where both coins are tails, so that makes 1 favorable outcome over 4 total outcomes:<br>  1/4 or .25 or 25%  (These are all equivalent.)<br>  <br>  b.  There are three outcomes that have at least one head, so<br>  3/4 or .75 or 75%<br>  <br>  c.  There are two outcomes in which the coins match, so<br>  1/2 or .5 or 50%<br>  <br>  d.  There are two outcomes in which the coins do not match, so<br>  1/2 or .5 or 50 %<br>  <br>  The biggest trick to this is systematically listing all the possible outcomes.  To make sure you have the right number, try this.<br>  If you are looking at a combination of two events, take the possible outcomes of the first event times the possible outcomes of the second event.  This will tell you how many total outcomes are possible.  In this example:<br>  The 1st coin has two outcomes (H or T).  The 2nd coin has two outcomes (H or T).  2 * 2 = 4 possible outcomes.  When you're listing the outcomes, remember that H - T is a different outcome than T - H.<br>  <br>  Another example would be rolling 2 dice.  Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are 6 * 6 or 36 possible outcomes for the two dice.  Again, rolling 2 - 3 is a different outcome than rolling 3 - 2.<br>  <br>  Be careful about events that affect each other.  For example, if you draw two cards from a 52 card deck, you need to remember that when you draw the 2nd card, you have only 51 cards to choose from (unless you put the first one back).  So the possible 2 card combinations would be 52 * 51, NOT 52 * 52.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your test!|`|75ff1a59d9ab1676b353a2ce6e8ae977aa	Alright, the key to probability questions is to account for all possible outcomes. If you flip two coins, the possible results are:<br>  <br>  coin1 coin2<br>  <br>  head - head<br>  head - tail<br>  tail - tail<br>  tail - head<br>  <br>  only 4 possible outcomes.<br>  <br>  you can see that only 1/4 of those satisfies a)<br>  3/4 satifies b)<br>  2/4 satisfy c)<br>  and 2/4 satisfy d)<br>  <br>  Now this was pretty simple because there are only 2 coins each with only 2 possible outcomes. Counting up all the possibilities can become very tedious if the situation is more complex. So a basic rule is useful:<br>  <br>  The probability of 2 (independent) things happening simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.<br>  <br>  For example, the probabiliy of heads for 1 coin is 50% (0.5 or 1/2) thus the chance of having 2 coins both coming up head is 0.5x0.5=25%. That answers a).<br>  <br>  Now for b) a common error is to think that if the chance of 1 coin being heads is 50% then if you flip 2 coins the chance would be double. This logic would suggest that there is 100% chance of having at least 1 head, and its pretty obvious here that that is wrong because both could be tails. The error is that the chance of having both heads has been counted twice.<br>  <br>  The easier way to understand this issue (especially if you have more than 2 trials) is to work in reverse; the chance that you have at least 1 head, is all the results EXCEPT when you have no heads (i.e. 2 tails). The chance of having 2 tails is 25%, thus the chance of having at least 1 head is 100%-25% = 75% (3/4).<br>  <br>  Extension of c) and d) is a bit more complex depending on the particular question. I would refer you to review the binomial distribution, which can answer a question such as what is the chance of rolling 2 at least 3 times if you roll a die 6 times.<br>  <br>  For this case, the chance that the coins match is the sum of the chance that they are both heads or both tails (25%+25%=50%) and thus the chance that they don't match is the rest 100%-50%=50%. Here indeed the probabilities just add, because the sets are mutually exclusive (i.e. no outcome is shared in the sets of outcomes both heads or both tails, unlike for b) were there are shared outcomes of both heads and 1 head).|`|mLXhUwUmaa	ok so here is what can happen<br>  <br>  both come up heads<br>  <br>  both come up tails<br>  <br>  one comes up heads and the pther comes up tails<br>  <br>  so the fraction will be out of 3 because there are 3 ways. <br>  <br>  a. there was only one choice were both came up tails so thats 1/3<br>  <br>  b. there were two times were at least one came up with heads so thats 2/3<br>  <br>  c. the coins match in 2 o the options so thats 2/3<br>  <br>  d. the coins didnt match in only on of them so that 2/3

Take a container that will hold the egg and fill it with water to the top. A container with a screw lid will be best, or something with a locking top.Get as much water in there as possible, and add some salt this will make the egg less buoyant. Place the egg in the water and add salt until it sinks to the middle. fill the container again and screw on the lid. I guarantee you if you do this you WILL NOT be able to break the egg.
kKSpHtDWaa	People care about polar bears because you are going to see them and a whole lot more.  Unless you avoid news altogether, you'd notice we're in Global Warming, which reduces ice floes.  Without these, polar bears can't hunt and so are forced closer to human places and people.  And honestly, nobody cares about what type of shark it was.  Great Whites are endangered, but they are not in immediate danger because nobody hunts them nor do they often encounter humans.  No one said that we prioritize over Great Whites with polar bears.|`|EcGlXaYlaa	While you are right about the great whites, the same should go for polar bears. <br>  'your never going to see them' - well I am never going to see you but do I advocate your demise because of that?|`|hPtfk5pOaa	Nobody knows the actual population of polar bears or even as an accurate estimate.

AA11357056	In retail, markup is usually expressed as a function of selling price. For example, when an item that costs $9 is sold for $10, the markup is expressed as 10% (i.e., $1/$10, or the amount that will allow a 10% profit based on the selling price)<br>  <br>  In accounting, the markup would be considered as a function of the cost. In the same example, the item would have been considered to have been marked up 11.111% (1/9) based on the cost, but the gross margin of $1 would still be considered 10%, as its also calculated based on the selling price.
G5QC5f5baa	The operation of a pneumatic timer is similar to the operation of a door closer. A force acting on a piston in a cylinder filled with air pushes the air out through a flow restricting valve. The cylinder can not complete its motion until the air has been pushed out. The time can be adjusted by adjusting the valve.<br>  <br>  The same sort of mechanism has been used to time such things as the operation of a camera shutter.<br>  <br>  For timing the activation of electrical devices pneumatic time delay relays were used for many years prior to the availability of inexpensive electronic timers. In a pneumatic time delay relay, a solenoid opens or closes the contacts through a mechanism that is delayed in moving into the actuating position until the air in a cylinder or diaphragm is pushed out through a flow restricting valve.

This ancestor is an ape-like human...or a human-like ape. This ancestor eventually diverges so that what we get is one path of evolution towards modern apes and another towards modern humans. <br>  It's a gradual process. Think of it as a gradient. On one end of the time scale we have an ape-like ancestor and on the other end we have modern humans. All in-between is a mixture of both.

Apes continued to give birth to more human like creatures, and where the line is drawn between ape and human can vary depending on who you ask. With any species that eventually evolves into another species, there is no exact line you can draw to divide one from the other. It's all simply speculation and is determined by what you call 'human'

Flonase is fluticasone, which is a steroid (and steroids can stunt children's growth).  However, being administered nasally there is very little systemic absorption.  This means not much is deposited into your bloodstream.

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is in the FDA pregnancy category B. This means that it is not expected to be harmful to an unborn baby. There is 1 caveat though:  Do not take Benadryl without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant.<br>  I fully understand your position of not wanting to harm your baby (as you said, it's your right).  As is the case with most medications during pregnancy, the benefits must outweigh the risks.  Allergy symptoms not withstanding, an unhealthy mom is very risky to a fetus.

While many people associate the term with off-road vehicles, powering all four wheels provides better control in normal road cars on many surfaces, and is an important part of rally racing.In abbreviations such as 4x4, the first figure is the number of wheels; the second is the number of powered wheels. 4x2 means a four-wheel vehicle in which engine power is transmitted to only two wheels: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive.<br>  <br>  Math: 4 times 4 is 16.|`|Ck1ySnqjaa	If the "x" signifies multiplication, 4x4 is 16.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it could be referring to a car that is 4 wheel drive.<br>  <br>  You could be referring to a matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns.<br>  <br>  I think you're referring to multiplication though, which would mean the answer you are looking for is 16.

With water, the oxygen atom (an electrophilic atom) retains most of the negative charge, while the hydrogen atoms are more positive.<br>  <br>  Since opposite charges attract, the negative oxygen atom at one end of the water molecule will tend to bond to the positive end of other molecules.

If you see lightning, you may or may not hear thunder, depending on the local air density and the distance between you and the lightning strike. I am not familiar with the phrase "count to three and then the storm will be over." Thunderstorms do in fact have variable durations. Super cell thunderstorms, for example, can last a long time.<br>  <br>  There is a method for determining the distance between a lightning strike and the observer. It is known as the flash-to-bang method. At the moment you see lightning, count the number of seconds that pass before you hear thunder. Divide the number of seconds by five, and that will give you the number of miles you are from the lightning.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	No the time between the flash of lightning and the sound of thunder helps tell you how far away the storm is because light travels faster than sound - I always heard the time in seconds was roughly the number of miles away|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Not necessarily, thunder is the meeting of the hot air against the cold air and lightening is electricity|`|bnRDldxbaa	No, its not quite right.<br>  If you start counting as soon as you hear the thunder, when you see the flash whatever number you got to will be how many miles away you are approx.<br>  Thats what i was told as a youth & my dad's a clever chap.

Of course in order to know what the nth term is you first need to know what the n-1'th term is...  and to know what the n-1'th term is you need to know what the n-2'th term is... all the way down...  which is why we have to explicitly set the zeroth term to something. This method of specifying a sequence is called "recursive."<br>  <br>  (an) above is the sequences of perfect squares recursively defined.  (using a pattern that you figured out - which by the way is the trickier pattern to see so good for you).  So don't kick yourself - you're actually smart for seeing the more complicated pattern...

Each color has a number.  They partly go in rainbow order.<br>  <br>  The first two colors are the first two digits of the value.  How do you know what the first two are?  They're not silver or gold.  If there is no silver or gold, then they're clumped together on one side.<br>  <br>  There's one more color to pay attention to.  This is a multiple of ten corresponding to the color code.  If the color  is red = 2, the multiple is 10^2 = 100.  Then, if the first value is not black you must multiply this by an additional 10 for the scientific notation.  Gold and silver are 10^-1 and 10^-2 respectively.  <br>  <br>  Lastly is the tolerance.  It is 5%, 10% or 20% (gold, silver, or no last band).  If there is a 20% tolerance, the resistance may be anywhere from 80% to 120% of the actual calculated value.  This is only important when considering accuracy, which you can find out for yourself once the circuit is made (if it matters).|`|b207128f6213ea5411a368f91e6bb3d1aa	Hold the resistor so that the lonely stripe (the one furthest away from the others) is to the right.<br>  Your resistor will have either four or five bands.<br>  If it's four, it's a low precision one and the first three are important, five is a higher one and it's the first four.<br>  The colours pertain to a number:<br>  <br>  Black=0<br>  Brown=1<br>  Red = 2<br>  Orange=3<br>  Yellow= 4<br>  Green=5<br>  Blue=6<br>  Purple=7<br>  Grey=8<br>  White=9<br>  <br>  For a four-band resistor you read the first two colours as the significant digits and the third as the multiplier.Think of the multiplier as the number of zeroes after.

To prove if p divides q implies p=q, we will use proof by contradiction. That is, we will assume that p is not equal to q. p divides q implies that there is a positive integer k greater than 1,  such that pk=q (because if k=1, then p=q which we assume is not true). But since k is a postive integer greater than one, this implies that q has two postive factors p and k, and thus q is a composite number, which contradicts our assumption that q is a prime. Hence our assertion that p is not equal to q is false, or in other words, p=q.|`|QYHGPHzBaa	as a pime number q can only divided by itself (or by 1).<br>  So since p can divide q, p must be either itself or 1.<br>  So p=q or p=1.<br>  Since one is not a prime number, then that leaves only p=q

You do this by multiplying both halves of the fraction by that radical:<br>  <br>  √2 / √3<br>  <br>  Multiply both halves by √3:<br>  <br>  (√2 * √3) / (√3 * √3)<br>  <br>  And by my first rule, we can merge the radicals in the numerator, and then simplify the denominator:<br>  <br>  √(2 * 3) / 3<br>  √(6) / 3<br>  <br>  <br>  #3:  It's like #1, except the square has already been factored out:<br>  <br>  √4 * √7<br>  2√7<br>  <br>  #4:  You can either simplify the numerator, then cancel out the √5, or use rule 2 above and combine the root into one fraction, simplify the fraction, then complete:<br>  <br>  √45 / √5<br>  √(9 * 5) / √5<br>  √9 * √5 / √5<br>  3 ( √5 / √5)<br>  3 ( 1)<br>  3<br>  <br>  #5, simplify numerators and denominators, then simplify:<br>  <br>  √80 / √25<br>  √(16 * 5) / 5<br>  4√5 / 5<br>  (4/5)√5<br>  <br>  #6:  use the old rule that says:<br>  <br>  (ab)c = a(bc)<br>  <br>  It doens't matter what order you multiply things together, so:<br>  <br>  5(2√3)<br>  (5 * 2)√3<br>  10√3<br>  <br>  <br>  #7 is like #6, except you have to also simplify the radical:<br>  <br>  (3/4)(3√8)<br>  (3/4)(3√(4 * 2))<br>  (3/4)(3 * 2√2)<br>  [(3/4) * 3 * 2)] √2<br>  (9/2) √2|`|ngfPNolpaa	1.  2sqrt3<br>  2.  sqrt{(2/3)(3/3)] =<br>  .....sqrt6/sqrt9 =<br>  .....sqrt6/3<br>  3.  sqrt28 = 2sqrt7<br>  4.  sqrt9 = 3<br>  5.  sqrt(16*5)/sqrt25 =<br>  .....4sqrt5/5<br>  6.  5[4*3] =<br>  ......5(12) =<br>  ......60<br>  7.  3/4(9*8) =<br>  ......3/4(72) =<br>  ......54|`|32hw3vCSaa	for the first question and i hope this can help you with the rest...<br>  <br>  √24 could be written <br>  <br>  √4*6 which also equals √4*√6<br>  <br>  4 has a perfect square but 6 doesnt so you could simplify that because a property of square roots is that you can factor them and multiply them together so it would equal..<br>  <br>  2√6
lhB213Imaa	Think of things that all organelles must do: Transfer materials, use or produce energy, and be properly located and assembled in the cell.<br>  <br>  To describe an organelle that burns body fat, you must describe where in the cell or in the body it would be.  You could say that the organelle is in adipose tissue (fat cells), in the cytoplasm near a fat vacuole.  Or, in a muscle cell.<br>  <br>  You should also describe how fat would be transferred to the cell.  Fat can be transported in the blood by lipoproteins.  They would have to bind some receptor on the cell surface, then transferred into the cell in a process called endocytosis.  The endosome carrying the fat would have to find its way to your fat-burning organelle.  It could be transported on motors that travel along microtubules, or it could diffuse in the cytosol until it binds a receptor on your organelle, then be transported into your organelle.<br>  <br>  Then you have to describe what the organelle does with the fat.  To "burn" it, it must be metabolized, or broken down into smaller units, giving  off energy in the process.  This would be carried out by enzymes such as lipases.  You could essentially describe an organelle that carries everything necessary to perform lipolysis (fat breakdown) beta-oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle in order to quickly break down fats into energy.<br>  <br>  The remaining carbon atoms of the fat must be released in some way, and the most logical explanation would be the release of CO2 (carbon dioxide molecules).

YupMCYHlaa	Elements that are unstable decay at a predictable rate.  To age something all you have to do is pick an element whose half-life is relevant to the range you want and count the amount of the unstable isotope remaining.  <br>  <br>  For instance Carbon 14 has a half life of about 6,000 years, so it can be used to date things back as far as about 60,000 years.<br>  <br>  To date older things, you pick an isotope with a longer half-life.  Uranium 235 has a half life of 700 million years, so it can be used to date rocks as old as 7 billion years.<br>  <br>  So if you figure the solar system was formed all about the same time, and the earth's elements separated at that time and began to coalesce and harden, you can use uranium to date the earth!|`|7sqpiGgoaa	fk!|`|xrgHNGj1aa	No don't be silly.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Formation of rain <br>  <br>  Rain is formed from water vapour in the surrounding atmosphere. Water vapour forms when the heat of the sun evaporates water from oceans and other bodies of water on earth, including plants through transpiration. The warm and moist air cools down as it rises into the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of water vapour that the atmosphere can hold. The temperature at which air can hold the most amount of water vapour is called the Dew Point. When the temperature drops below the dew point, some of the water vapour condenses into water vapour, forming clouds. Water droplets form on tiny particles called condensation nuclei, which are made up of dust, salt from ocean spray and chemicals given off by industrial plants and vehicles. During the formation of water vapour, heat is liberated, warming the clouds. This allows the clouds to rise higher and eventually become cooler again. The formation of raindrops is explained by the coalescence theory and the ice-crystal theory.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Rain is created when a cloud cools to a point that it can no longer hold the condensed water. It cools of course when it rises into a higher place, but any large volume of water vapour will be less dense than a corresponding volume of air, so water vapour tends to rise through the air.<br>  <br>  But a lot of clouds never yield rain. if they do not have enough moisture to get rain falling fairly quickly they will just hang around blocking the sun. If the amount of rain they produce is small, it is likely to evaporate before it reaches the ground.<br>  <br>  A large amount of water vapour condensing will release a lot of heat, and so create an up-flow of air that brings yet more water vapour up  into the cloud, and may even tap into volumes of water vapour over a large body of water. This can give very large volumes of rain.|`|AA12272885	I am not really sure what your question is.

8oCwrIR2aa	6,721<br>  <br>  If I read things correctly (the clearer one writes, the easier it is to get an answer), this contest has the following prizes: 35 cars, 100 $10,000 prizes, 1,000 laptops, and 25,000 "tim" cards for a total of 26,135 prizes.<br>  <br>  That's important because you have to know how many non-prize cups there are and you can combine the number of prizes knowledge with the odds of winning something at all to find that. If there are 26,135 prizes and enough non-winners so that the odds of winning are 1 in 9, then there must be 9 * 26,135 total cups. That's 235,215 total cups.<br>  <br>  So. 235,215 total cups and only 35 cars. Divide the number of cups by the number of cars to get the number of cups you have to win to have a "fair" chance at having won a car:  235,215 / 35 = 6,720 plus 3/7. So you have to round up (not down), to ensure the fair chance at winning one of the cars. That's 6,721.<br>  <br>  (A note for real life though: you have to remember that the word "fair" here just has a meaning related to statistics. A contest of this sort, by its nature, does not have any other connection to the word "fair"...<br>  <br>  I'm saying it could work out that you'd buy 200,000 cups and might still not have gotten one that wins a car.

Everything goes through the brain, but only as a junction between other points.

It does not normally occur in mammals because of their imprinted genes. However, using special manipulations to circumvent imprinting, laboratory mice have been produced by parthenogenesis. [Link]<br>  <br>  In a few nonmammalian species it is the only method of reproduction, but more commonly animals turn to parthenogenesis only under certain circumstances. Examples:<br>  <br>      * Aphids use parthenogenesis in the spring when they find themselves with ample food. In this species, reproduction by parthenogenesis is more rapid than sexual reproduction, and the use of this mode of asexual reproduction permits the animals to quickly exploit the available resources.<br>      * Female Komodo dragons (the largest lizard) can produce offspring by parthenogenesis when no male is available for sexual reproduction. Their offspring are homozygous at every locus including having identical sex chromosomes. Thus the females produce all males because, unlike mammals, females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) while males are homogametic (ZZ). <br>  <br>  Parthenogenesis is forced on some species of wasps when they become infected with bacteria (in the genus Wolbachia). Wolbachia can pass to a new generation through eggs, but not through sperm, so it is advantageous to the bacterium for females to be made rather that males.<br>  In these wasps (as in honeybees),<br>  <br>      * fertilized eggs (diploid) become females;<br>      * unfertilized (haploid) eggs become males.<br>  <br>  However, in Wolbachia-infected females, all their eggs undergo endoreplication producing diploid eggs that develop into females without fertilization; that is, by parthenogenesis.<br>  <br>  Treating the wasps with an antibiotic kills off the bacteria and "cures" the parthenogenesis!

f18e617fe0754473c97b4f67d099bfcdaa	Ceres was a Roman goddess of the Earth, agriculture and the harvest, and her name is in fact the Roman name for the Greek goddess Demeter. As such Ceres was regarded by the Romans as a generous and benevolent being who was concerned about the daily welfare of mankind. Of all the Roman goddesses, Ceres was the most important to the people. She was responsible for the progression of the seasons and with other lesser agricultural deities looked after the land and crops. As such she is usually shown in sculptures and art as a young woman in a long robe, often carrying fruit, flowers and wheat as well as a scepter.  Most of her worshipers were women in fact, and widespread worship of Ceres began at 496 B.C. during a devastating famine. She was not only concerned with the fertility and vitality of the land, but of human fertility as well.

Sometimes once you feel more comfortable with the teacher, then you will feel more confident in answering questions. Also, try to get closer to your piers.

qI3FeYQAaa	Scientists use antibiotic resistance genes as markers so you can "see" the DNA of an organism by looking at what antibiotics don't kill it.<br>  <br>  For example, if I'm introducing a plasmid with an engineered gene into E. coli, I want to be able to quickly sort which bacteria took up the plasmid.  So I join my target gene with a resistance gene (which is usually already incorporated into a commercially-made plasmid).  <br>  <br>  When I plate the bacteria, I'll put them on agar containing an antibiotic.  The cells that didn't take up my plasmid (and therefore the gene I want to express) also won't have the ability to fight the antibiotic and will die.  The only colonies that grow should have the gene I'm after. (In reality, it's possible the cell has an "empty" plasmid, i.e., one that re-annealed at the cut site without incorporating the insert, but that's a separate problem.)<br>  <br>  If you cut at a RE site that's in a resistance gene, you'll lose the ability to sort your bacteria.

fd27fff2fa1976727431aa39a7fc9c83aa	the fertilization of the central nucleus produces a:?<br>  <br>  Answer =a. triploid nucleus
Ftkr9jqYaa	An oocyte is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is part of the ovary development. The germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC) which becomes an oogonium which marks the start of mitosis. After mitosis stops (due to actions of retinoic acid and the mesenephros), oocytogenesis is completed, and meiosis starts.  At the meiotic stage, the oogonium becomes an oocyte.  The Primary Oocyte (which is diploid with 4N chromatids) undergoes ootidogenesis and folliculogenesis, during meiosis 1.  The Secondary Oocyte (which is haploid with 2N chromatids) continues ootidogenesis during meiosis 2, forming an Ootid, which becomes an Ovum.  The ovum is fertilized by a sperm to produce the zygote during conception.<br>  <br>  ANIMAL POLE - In most animal oocytes, the nucleus is not centrally placed, and its position can be used to define two poles. That nearest to the nucleus is the animal pole, and the other is the vegetal pole, with the animal-vegetal axis between the poles passing through the nucleus. During meiosis of the oocyte, the polar bodies are expelled at animal pole. In many eggs, there is also a graded distribution of substances along this axis, with pigment granules often concentrated in the animal half, while yolk, where present, is largely in the vegetal half.  In developmental biology, the term animal pole refers to the upper hemisphere of a blastula embryo. The animal pole consists of small cells that divide rapidly, in contrast with the vegetal pole below it. The animal pole draws its name from its liveliness relative to the slowly-developing vegetal pole. In some cases, the animal pole is thought to differentiate into the later embryo itself, forming the three primary germ layers and participating in gastrulation.<br>  <br>  VEGETAL POLE - The surface of the egg opposite to the animal pole. Often the cytoplasm in this region is incorporated into future endoderm cells.  In developmental biology, the term vegetal pole refers to the lower hemisphere of a blastula embryo.  The vegetal pole contains large yolky cells that divide very slowly, in contrast with the animal pole above it. The vegetal pole draws its name from its inactivity relative to the lively animal pole. In some cases, the vegetal pole is thought to differentiate into the extraembryonic membranes that protect and nourish the developing embryo, such as the placenta in mammals, and the chorion in birds.

EuN4zRCLaa	mJ is just a millijoule.  Multiply by 1000 to convert J to mJ.<br>  <br>  The problem is easy if you realize that the net force decreases linearly with respect to x from a maximum of 3.3N down to 0N over the distance the spring must stretch to reach -3.3N of force.  The average force over this distance is (3.3N)/2 = 1.65N.  The work done on the block over this amount of time (equal to the kinetic energy imparted to the block since there's no friction) is just the average force multiplied by the distance, and that will be your answer.  No calculus needed on this one.|`|94bf333408aff1bfa9de9e55cb6f2b78aa	1 J = 1000 mJ

X4EBNoNUaa	first set up what the equation looks like <br>  <br>  HA + H2O ----- H30+  + A^-1  if the HA starts at a concentration of 0.2 M and a small amount ( X ) ionizes it will give an equal amount of X H+ and XA^-1   so the Keq=Ka = [ H+][A^-1]/ [HA]<br>   Since the amount of H+ produced is given by the pH  the concentration of H+ and of A^-1 is 2 X 10^-4  ( antilog of 3.70)  so in the Ka equation you have <br>  <br>  Ka = (2x 10^-4 )(2x10^-4 )/0.2M -2 X 10^-4 :::: since 2 X 10^-4 is very small compared to 0.2M neglect it in the denominator and simplify<br>  <br>  Ka = (2 X 10^-4)^2/0.2  =  4 X 10^-8 /2 X 10^-1 = 2 X 10^-7<br>  <br>  The Ka is 2 x 10^-7 so this acid is about 10X weaker than acetic acid|`|471483d3eb70c05bcce5880d5a8a3c75aa	This cannot be answered with the information given...i dont think.

Mitochondria are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in a range of other processes, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell growth.|`|WzusAmjYaa	the powerhouses of a cell|`|9NwcErkiaa	Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, an organelle that functions to produce ATP (Adenosine triphosphate), which is your energy.<br>  <br>  For example in your muscle cells, there are lots and lots of mitochondria, so as to produce ATP for respiration (respiration rate increases during exercise)|`|rthJLzs3aa	check out the links given below......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cellsalive.com/cells/mitochon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cellsalive.com/cells/mitochon...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biology4kids.com/files/cell_mito.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biology4kids.com/files/cell_m...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.johnkyrk.com/mitochondrion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnkyrk.com/mitochondrion.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!!<br>  <br>  ~*A3N*~

When you take off you are in the same frame of reference as your take-off point.  Thus, you can consider the earth stationary.  Your ground speed in any direction relative to a motionless earth is how far you get in any time period.  Distance = Velocity * Time.<br>  <br>  Ditto for the train: What happens is the same as if you were standing next to the train, motionless.  The ball will hit you in the face, regardless of the speed of the train.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Like wjilope, I was a double major in math and physics as an undergrad, and the answer to your question is absolutely not.<br>  <br>  If anything, the opposite is true.  If you start with a physics degree, you can easily pass out of a few of the math courses (besides the ones that are common to both).  The opposite is certainly not true.  I con't think a math major could pass out of any physics course (besides the basic intro physics courses required for any science/engineering major).<br>  <br>  Although it's true that all of E&M can be summarized in Maxwells equations, the practical application of that to actual problems requires experience and some specific mathematical techniques that you aren't goint to get in any course in the math department.<br>  <br>  As for classical mechanics, you aren't going to learn Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics in a math course.  You aren't going to learn how to spot the symmetries in a problem and apply Noether's theorem to find the conserved quantities of the motion.<br>  <br>  Group theory isn't really needed in physics until you get to particle physics in grad school or a senior-level elective.  And though group theory is at the heart of the subfield, there is a lot more to know.<br>  <br>  And taking a differential equations class doesn't mean you know quantum mechanics.  As a physicist you need to be able to solve the Schrodinger equation for common potentials quickly.  Very few math undergrads could solve the SE for the hydrogen atom if you put it in front of them and gave them an hour.  Physics majors are so familiar with that particular diffeq that they know the solutions and the phenomenological consequences pretty much by heart.<br>  <br>  I sort of see where you're coming from--a math major could probably pick up physics very quickly.  In fact, a really good pure math undergrad could probably step into a physics grad program and catch up (with a little extra help from the profs probably).  But they aren't the same at all.<br>  <br>  As a physicist, I kind of feel the same way about engineering.  Everything they do is just an application of physics that I know a lot better than they do.  But they know a lot of specifics off the top of their heads that I'd have to take an hour to figure out--and probably make a mistake or two while I'm at it.|`|cEJwY5byaa	But a pure math degree does not prepare someone to interpret physical phenomena, nor does it typically involve a study of physical laws besides a few you cover as examples of applications.  Plus a physics degree will usually involve at least one advanced lab course where you practice designing and performing experiments and get hands on experience, and some prep for composing and submitting journal articles.|`|468c5dee5c181b1798b24ccd745a3804aa	not really. when i was an undergraduate i ended up with a dual degree in both math and physics, and i can tell you that the courses that i needed to pass for each were different. <br>  where i went to school (michigan) there was 3 kinds of math degrees: "pure math", "numerical analysis math" and " actuarial math".  the math degree i got was based on the course requirements for the 2nd of these three.<br>  <br>  and the course requirements for this particular math degree had almost no overlap with those required for a "physics" degree. but the things i learned in the "math classes" definitely helped me in my physics classes...<br>  <br>  so, i guess i disagree with the titular question..<br>  <br>  but you're right in the general sense that there is considerable overlap in the mathematical techniques used in the two fields....<br>  <br>  but one cannot really say that a math degree is the same as a physics degree or vice versa...<br>  <br>  cheers|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	A math degree is not a physics degree, and will not qualify you by itself to get into a graduate physics program.  Just because you've learned the math necessary to take the physics courses does NOT mean you know the physics.  Math is necessary for physics, but it's not all of physics.  That's like saying I can read English, so my physics degree is an English degree too.|`|m2pNTLloaa	I can only share a story from Advanced Engineering Mechanics (1st year of a 2 year Masters in Engineering Mechanics.  Engineers are heretics and not ashamed to bend the rules.<br>  <br>  Our prof did a derivation.  One of the students had a BS in Mathematics and stopped the prof half way through the derivation with, "You can't do that!"  The prof stopped and chuckled, "Why not?"  The student replied, "You can't prove it is always true."  To which the prof replied, "Never the less, it always is."<br>  <br>  Point:  For engineering, if you get too hung-up on rigor, you lose some very useful techniques.
koniJEZaaa	I disagree<br>  For my Physics degree, we are required to take 3 years of Quantum Physics, which includes relativistic Quantum Physics. There is no pure mathematics in there, and it requires Dirac notation and mathematics. Many types of special case partial differential equations are required for some of these areas of physics. There are very few undergrad math programs in the world the world that require much spherical harmonics, where almost any physics program will require you to get fairly deep into that area. <br>  <br>  Also, supposing that there exists a math program that includes every area of math covered by every physics program, it will not explain to you what is going on in nature. That is the very essence of physics. Math will explain what is going on in the models described by physics. Don't get me wrong, I consider myself a mathematician before I consider myself a physicist. I would never say, however, that my math degree provided me with everything that my physics degree has provided me with.|`|c0d2bbbf57c1acd5de34bb507783022daa	I disagree.

AA10299755	Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator, a motion that is neither driven nor damped. The motion is periodic - as it repeats itself at standard intervals in a specific manner - and sinusoidal, with constant amplitude; the acceleration of a body executing SHM is directly proportional to the displacement of the body from the equilibrium position and is always directed towards the equilibrium position.<br>  <br>  Small-angle approximation is a useful simplification of the laws of trigonometry which is only approximately true for finite angles, but correct in the limit as the angle approaches zero. It involves linearization of the trigonometric functions (truncation of their Taylor series) so that, when the angle x is measured in radians,<br>  <br>  sin x = x<br>  cos x =1<br>  tan x = x<br>  <br>  So it is only in the case of small angle approximation that the equation of motion for a pendulum can be solved exactly and give the solution of a simple harmonic motion.

i8LIR72Taa	For the first one, don't think about the coordinate plane yet. There's a 30-60-90 triangle with a short side half the length of the hypotenuse, 6 units, and the other side is thus 6 radical 3. <br>  <br>  When you draw an altitude to this side, you get two similar 30-60-90 triangles. So for the smaller triangle, the hypotenuse is 6, so the short side is 3. Which means that the other part of the original hypotenuse is 9.<br>  <br>  Solve for the altitude. Square root of 6^2 - 3^2. Works out to 3 radical 3. Now you have to lay the whole thing on the coordinate grid. You can have the altitude point left or right, with the small triangle up or down. So there are 4 possible locations for R.|`|ow8EGchmaa	I see you have 2 answers for your 1st question, but none for your second. I can't redraw your figure here, but hopefully you'll understand from the description. There are 6 angles and only 2 given. But the rest can be calculated from these. Directly across from the 60 degree will be another 60 degree. Likewise, across from the 45 will be another 45. Also, any three on the same side of a line will br 180. Take 180, subtract 45 and 60, and you get 75. Directly across from the 75 will be another 75. So all angles are known. Also, we have algebraic equations relating to angles we have found. Below:<br>  x + 3y = 45..........equ1<br>  5x - y = 75...........equ2.......multiply by 3<br>  15x - 3y = 225...........equ2........now bring down equ1<br>    x + 3y = 45.............equ1.....now combine<br>  ---------------------<br>  16x = 270<br>  x = 16.9...........answer<br>  x + 3y = 45..........equ1<br>  16.9 + 3y = 45<br>  3y = 28.1<br>  y = 9.4............answer<br>  <br>  Proof<br>  <br>  5x - y = 75...........equ2<br>  5(16.9) - 9.4 = 75<br>  84.5 - 9.4 = 75<br>  75.1 ≈  75|`|3WotTKDiaa	For number 2:<br>  Alright you can do this using system of equations easily if you know what that is.  If not heres a quick summary get two seperate equations and solve one for a variable, and plug it into the other one. <br>  <br>   So by using this, since you know that the oppoiste values have to be equal for example 45=x+3y is an easy one to get.  Another easy way to get equations is through segments from one line, meaning all the values on one side of the equation have to add up to 180.  So for example, 60+45+5x-y=180.  <br>  <br>  Then you would solve an equation for one variable, the first is the easiest (if you solve for x), and then you get x=45-3y, which you can then plug into the other equation to get 105+5(45-3y)-y=180.  This gives you y.<br>  <br>  Finally you would substitute the value for y into one of the equations(either is fine) and then solve for x.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped, if not ill try to explain it more clearly.

Tag the amino acids and measure their incorporation into protein.|`|R4UsXFKcaa	To best determine the rate of translation, the amino acids should be tagged.<br>  Nucleotides is not a good answer because they are involved in transcription only.<br>  Ribosomes would not be useful either because they are in the cell independently of the rate of transcription. (i.e. if the rate goes up or down the number of ribosomes stays constant)<br>  There are thousands if not millions of proteins in the cell, so tagging them would not be very useful. Besides tagging proteins would not tell you anything about the new proteins being synthesized.<br>  If you tag the amino acids, you would detect a greater concentration of radiation where the concentration of those amino acids increased. Plus, the amino acids would no longer appear as single amino acids but they would be linked to each other because after translation they would be part of a protein, and you could detect that.

You have to start by <br>                             changing the > sign to an = sign.  Then after that <br>                             you have to get <br>                            x by itself.  You do this by adding or subtracting.  In <br>                            this equation, you have to add 5x to both sides.  <br>                            This will cancel out the -5x because -5x plus 5x is <br>                            zero.  This will also get x on the left side of the <br>                           equation because -4 plus 5 is 1 (1x) and 1x is the <br>                           same as just x.  You end up with:<br>  x +2 = -3           The answer you get at the end will be x > ___ and to <br>                           get the answer, you have to subtract 2 from the left  <br>                           and right sides of the equation.  You get:<br>  x = -5                This is the answer.  If you are trying to figure out <br>                          what x is, then you have the answer (-5) but if you are <br>                          trying to figure out if -4x + 2 > -5x - 3 is true, then <br>                          you have to substitute x=-5 into the equation:<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  -4x + 2 > -5x - 3 for x=-5<br>  -4(-5) +2 > -5(-5) - 3         then you use the order of operations <br>                                       (PEMDAS) and this states that you have to <br>                                      use parenthesis, exponents, <br>                                   multiplication/division, and then <br>                              addition/subtraction in that order from left to right.  <br>                              In this equation you have to use multiplication.<br>  20 +2 > 25 -3<br>  22 > 22   Is 22 greater than 22?  No, because 22 is equal to 22.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So if you are trying to find the value of x, then it is -5, and if you are trying to find out if the statement is true, then substitute in -5 for x and then figure out if it is true.  In this case, it is not true.|`|KsoUiryAaa	x > -5<br>  <br>  Its the same thing as saying -4x + 2 = -5x - 3, just solve for X and then if you gotta make a graph out of it I would show you but I dont know how to online.

The regulation of diphtheria tox expression is mediated by an iron-activated repressor, DtxR, which is encoded on the C diphtheriae genome. The expression of tox depends on the physiologic state of C diphtheriae. Under conditions in which iron becomes the growth-rate limiting substrate, iron dissociates from DtxR, the tox gene becomes derepressed, and diphtheria toxin is synthesized and secreted into the culture medium at maximal rates
f18e617fe0754473c97b4f67d099bfcdaa	Infrared radiometers and spectrometers on the Mariner 10 and now MESSENGER spacecraft directly determined the surface temperature of Mercury. All objects emit heat, and analysis of the infrared radiation radiating back to space allowed a precise determination of the surface temperature. You can actually buy thermometers that work the same way. Before that radio telescopes listening to microwave emissions and ground based optical telescopes allowed astronomers to get a good idea of the surface temperature, in light of the fact that Mercury at perihelion gets over 11 times as much energy per square meter from the Sun than we do. Mercury has a rotation period of 59 days, which means for every two orbits around the Sun, the planet rotates three times. Because of that and the the complete lack of any atmosphere to distribute heat around the planet, the day side has the time to heat up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of a Mercurian day. At night, any one spot on the surface has nearly 6 weeks to radiate back to space all the heat it gained from the Sun.

SvmZlLdaaa	No. Animals must be closely related in order to interbreed. Whilst wolves and foxes are both in the same family, Canidae, they diverged millions of years ago and are too distantly related to be able to breed. Wolves belong to the genus Canis, whilst the various fox species are placed in several different genera, including Vulpes, Dusicyon and Urocyon. Mating could never take place naturally in any case - aside from the problems created by the size difference, a wolf would be more likely to kill a fox than try to mate with it. Even if you used artificial insemination, or in vitro, these animals are simply too different to combine - a wolf sperm would not be able to fertilise a fox egg, and vice versa.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	No, it's a Wox (male wolf  + vixen) or a Folve (male fox + female wolf).<br>  <br>  Woxes and folves howl in my dreams.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	It is unlikely.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	It's because every organism has pairs of chromosomes, which may have different information (alleles) on them, even though they have the same genes.  This is because one of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father.  Many deleterious mutations are recessive - meaning they only appear in the organism if both the chromosomes have that allele.  The occurrence of  mutations is usually rare, so for most, the fact that they get one allele for the mutation (e.g., from the father) does not affect them, because they get a normal allele from the mother.  However, if there is a lot of inbreeding, it is more likely that one individual would get 2 copies of the bad allele, because both mother and father had one of them, because they are closely related.

2YkEQrmvaa	The father could be A or AB, and he could be + or -.<br>  <br>  The ABO blood type is controlled by a gene with 3 possible alleles, A, B, or O.  A and B are co-dominant (meaning they are both expressed), and O is recessive to both.  Since we have 2 copies of each gene (one from mom and one from dad), a person can be AO (expressing O blood type), AB (showing AB type), BO (showing B type), or OO (showing O type).  You are OO.  Dad could be AA, AB, or AO  (since he only passes on one copy, and you pass on the other).<br>  <br>  As for the Rh factor (the + or -), either you OR dad (or both) could have passed that on.|`|b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	The father most likely has one of two similar blood types.  He carries either two alleles (an allele is a variation of a gene) which are both code for type "A" blood or he carries one allele for type "A" and one allele for type "O".  There is also the possibility that the father had AB+ or AB- and passed the "A" allele on to your son.<br>  <br>  With regard to the Rh factor ( + or -), it depends on what you are.  You could be either ++ or +-.  If you are ++, it does not matter what the father is, the child will always be +.  If you are +- and if the father is --, then there is a 50% chance he is the father of your child.  However, if the father is either ++ or +-, then the chances remain at 50% that he is the father.  Basically, using the Rh factor, when you are positive, is not an accurate way to determine paternity.  <br>  <br>  Regardless, the father did at least have type A blood or type AB and, most likely he had A+ which is a very common blood type in both whites and blacks (I don't know your ethnicity).|`|UWs26GMAaa	The sperm donor must have blood type A or AB.<br>  <br>  It would be impossible for the sperm donor to have blood type O or blood type B, since the mother has blood type O. <br>  <br>  I'm unsure about the rh factor though.|`|b81ce9bea72f88ed096c4cb11fd67926aa	either his dad has type A or type AB blood|`|mpCDEoriaa	he is adopted or switched at birth, good luck with that

KSK22vHUaa	Well, the highest power you have is x^2, so you'll have 2 x-intercepts.<br>  <br>  To factor this, get everything to one side of the equals sign by adding 26 to both sides:<br>  <br>  3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0<br>  <br>  This is the point at which you'd use the quadratic formula.  3 is A, 5 is B, and 2 is C.  Plug them in.<br>  <br>  Now, factor:<br>  (3x+2)(x+1) = 0<br>  <br>  Set each binomial equal to zero to get your x-intercepts:<br>  <br>  x = -2/3 and x = -1<br>  <br>  To complete the square, your x^2 has to have a coefficient of 1.  So divide everything by 3:<br>  <br>  x^2 + 5x/3 - 8 = -26/3<br>  <br>  Now, you want all the x's on a side by themselves and all the other stuff on the other side.<br>  <br>  x^2 + 5x/3 = -2/3<br>  <br>  Halve the coefficient of x, and then square it.<br>  <br>  (5/3)/2 = 5/6, and squared is 25/36.  Add 25/36 to each side.<br>  <br>  x^2 + 5x/3 + 25/36 = -2/3 + 25/36<br>  <br>  Now, the left simplifies to a squared binomial:<br>  <br>  (x + 5/6)^2 = -2/3 + 25/36<br>  <br>  And simplify the right:<br>  <br>  (x + 5/6)^2 = 1/36<br>  <br>  From here, you can solve for x by taking the square root of both sides, which will leave you a positive and negative root on the right.

They are living microorganisms which, when ingested, have beneficial effects on the human body. The most common form of probiotic is Lactobacillus Acidophilus.<br>  <br>  It is estimated that there are several trillion friendly bacteria comprising over four hundred species in the average human gastrointestinal tract. By body weight, each of us carries around approximately four pounds of intestinal microflora!<br>  <br>  They counteract damage done to the body due to antibiotic use and stimulates the immune system to function better when you are relatively healthy, but when you’re sick, they can also contribute significantly to relief of health problems ranging from indigestion and diarrhea to colon and liver cancer.<br>  <br>  Lactobacillus Acidophilus is also involved in the production of B vitamins (niacin, folic acid, and pyridoxine) during the digestive process.<br>  <br>  Some of the ways probiotics appear to improve health include: alleviating lactose intolerance, reducing and preventing diarrhea, defending against infections, enhancing the immune system, reducing inflammation, preventing allergic reactions, and reducing chronic constipation|`|YR78bGIaaa	good bacteria kill the bad bacteria|`|kKTCCFsEaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Bacteria can aid in digestion and provide humans with nutrients as well as protection against other pathogenic strain.<br>  We host millions of bacteria in our intestines, and some of them pose commensal (non harming nor beneficial), parasitical (harmful for us, but beneficial to them), or mutualistic (beneficial for both us and the bacteria) interaction with us.<br>  For example the famous E.coli, they benefit from food that we ingested and we provide them with an environment to propagate. In return they provide us with nutrient (ie. vitamin K). <br>  These bacteria (normally found in our GI tract and hence the name normal flora) also protect us against  invading pathogenic strain by competing for space and nutrient in our body. More over these normal flora also aid in growth and maintenance of immune system in human.<br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Eugene

AA10927246	It depends if you are using the American or European system.  Here in the U.S. a billion is equal to 10^9 which has 9 zeroes.  Under the European system, a billion is equal to 10^12 which has 12 zeroes.<br>  <br>  10^9, Europeans say "thousand million" or "milliard."<br>  <br>  Although we describe the two systems today as American or European, both systems are actually of French origin. The French physician and mathematician Nicolas Chuquet (1445-1488) apparently coined the words byllion and tryllion and used them to represent 10^12 and 10^18, respectively, thus establishing what we now think of as the "European" system. However, it was also French mathematicians of the 1600s who used billion and trillion for 10^9 and 10^12, respectively. This usage became common in France and in America, while the original Chuquet nomenclature remained in use in Britain and Germany. The French decided in 1948 to revert to the Chuquet ("European") system, leaving the U.S. as the chief standard bearer for what then became clearly an American system.<br>  <br>  In recent years, American usage has eroded the European system, particularly in Britain and to a lesser extent in other countries. This is primarily due to American finance, because Americans insist that $1,000,000,000 be called a billion dollars. In 1974, the government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced that henceforth "billion" would mean 10^9 and not 10^12 in official British reports and statistics. The Times of London style guide now defines "billion" as "one thousand million, not a million million."<br>  <br>  The result of all this is widespread confusion. Anyone who uses the words "billion" and "trillion" internationally should make clear which meaning of those words is intended. On the Internet, some sites outside the U.S. use the compound designation "milliard/billion" to designate the number 1,000,000,000. In science, the names of large numbers are usually avoided completely by using the appropriate SI prefixes. Thus 10^9 watts is a gigawatt and 10^12 joules is a terajoule.

EGPeQxpLaa	I've chosen to answer this in a serious way.<br>  <br>  Right, both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft are certified to fly into large birds without too much damage. Some military aircraft are actually armoured and are much tougher than this. Also both are supposed to have flight critical systems (electrics and hydraulics) duplicated (or triplicated) and separated, as far as possible.<br>  <br>  So if a fighter sliced a helicopter then survival for each would depend on the actually damage done. Clearly a fighter can't fly with one wing missing but it could fly with, say 1/4 of the wing missing. A helicopter can't fly without its rotors but it may service a big slice down the fuselage.<br>  <br>  Many aircraft have survived and landed safely with remarkable levels of damage - also many have crashed with "trivial" faults.|`|V0rr15amaa	not possible<br>  <br>  that would be a nasty collision that would destroy both|`|yQdA5rHnaa	it could, but then they would both crash due to catastrophic damage.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	If the plan is to bring down the helicopter deliberately, it would be a better plan to just attack the helicopter from above, where it is hard to defend, and drop a lump of metal or something into the rotor arc.|`|jMqaBDdWaa	Something much like this has already happened: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lvEGohPmxk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lvEGohPm...</a><br>  <br>  However, helos usually keep fairly close to the ground, so the fighter would probably crash before the pilot could regain control.|`|jCeylLsIaa	if it were flying at he speed of light, it would easily slice through anything...but without sustaining any severe damage...i don't think so...they couldn't even slice through a wing of another jet fighter without sustaining damage.|`|iWKn0wSiaa	I think they would both pretty much get destroyed.

3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Americans apparently are also becoming more familiar with the terminology of genetics. In a 2001 NSF survey, 45 percent of respondents were able to define DNA. The percentage of correct responses to this survey question increased in the late 1990s, a trend that probably reflected the heavy media coverage of DNA use in forensics and medical research. More recently, a 2003 Harris poll found that 60 percent of adults in the United States selected the correct answer when asked "what is DNA?" (the genetic code for living cells), and two-thirds chose the right answer when asked "what does DNA stand for?" (deoxyribonucleic acid)
