In the Southhills there is Greentree, Mt. Lebanon, Baldwin and Brentwood.  The nicest (and most expensive) areas are Fox Chapel and Nevielwood.  I live in the North Side, and while it's cheep, it's not the best area.  I've been looking for homes in Ross and West View.|`|GicN1B2raa	In the city: Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and Brookline.<br>  Suburbs: Monroeville, Murraysville, North Huntingdon, Plum, Edgewood, Penn Township,Cranberry Township, Wexford, North Hills, Ross, West View & Fox Chapel
74c68c1d283e701d72453e9651b449f7aa	Yes, that would be a very cool thing to do!  <br>  <br>  It would probably be worthwhile to buy a cheap used car somewhere and sell it when you are done, as public transportation is terrible in most parts of the US.  I wouldn't bother with an RV as gas is so expensive, as are RV parks.<br>  <br>  Try to find smaller freeways that are not part of the interstate system, as they will be more unique.  For instance in California, take the 101 or the 99 instead of the 5 - that kind of thing.  There are a ton of great state and national campgrounds so that would be a cool way to spend part of the trip.  You could also pop into Canada and Mexico as well.  <br>  <br>  I would aim to spend seasons in the following areas to get the best weather:<br>  <br>  Spring: Midwest and South<br>  Summer: Victoria BC, Pacific Northwest, Northern California, potentially Alaska if you feel like going that far<br>  Fall: Northeast and East Coast, Eastern parts of Canada<br>  Winter: Southwest and Mexico<br>  <br>  Although of course if you're into skiing that could change your winter plans a bit to include BC, Utah, Colorado, and parts of Northern California.<br>  <br>  Have fun!!!

This way if we don't like someplace we can move on - or if we really like someplace we can stay there for a bit. <br>  <br>  We do try to plan a couple of days ahead -- it can be really stressful trying to find an open hotel room for that same night!<br>  <br>  Did you ever notice the best and most memorable parts of a vacation are the 'accidents' - the things you didn't expect to happen or plan for?|`|tPVuwMRtaa	We do both & save $ with our awesome travel club.

Ok, go into the travel agent, ask them if the tour operator that has booked your package can upgrade your hotel to the one you want, is all they have to do is phone up and ask, it will cost you extra to go in a higher grade , this all depends if the other hotel is fully booked or not?, also the tour operator can charge a minimum of 25 per a person to change this.The travel agent should not charge you anything themselves as they will get more commission out of you the more you spend so be aware?  Also for the future, when you book any holiday make sure they are ATOL bonded, if not you could lose alot of money.    Hope this has helped.

545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	Don't worry Gi - you used the word correctly, according to it's only English definition.    I agree with several of the comments here - Russian women have variety like any other nationality. But I find that in metro areas, Russian women tend to take better care about their bodies, their appearance, etc. They always strive to be "hot", no matter what their physical shape.    As to stereotypes, I have heard the "all Russian women are hot" stereotype, as well as the "all Russian women look like truck drivers" stereotype. My personal stereotype (before living there) was both - some were hairy truck drivers in bland green dresses, and some where hot redheads who were very "gymnastic"..|`|FD8I4zthaa	Russion women are like any other nation of women.

I was pleased to find that while there are some stunners, for sure, most of the girls are pretty, but normally so.    I have to say, I didn't see ANY big ugly hairy whores.  :-D    Actually, I'm very happy to say that I've never seen any big ugly hairy whores in any of the (many) places I've been.

VyUaWvkpaa	Harlem is quite safe these days.  You are unlikely to run into any problems if you go and visit during the day.  It's a little rough around the edges for sure, but not un-safe.  Anything near or around 125th street (Sylvia's, the Apollo, etc.) are fine.  Streets can get empty around 2:00 so I would of course use caution then, but you really shouldn't have any problems.  Check out Showman's jazz club on 125th and Morningside and Presidential Pizza on the same block.  116th Street is Little Senegal and has some fantastic food.  Morningside Park has been cleaned up in the last few years as well. St. Nick's Pub is also a great place for music.     Generally, things north of 145h street and south of Inwood (Washington Heights) are known to be a bit dodgier that central Harlem at night, but even so, during the day you are unlikely to face any more problems than anywhere else in the city.  Most white folks who say it's unsafe or don't enjoy their time there only do so becaue they aren't comfortable being the 'minority' (IE. not completely surrounded by white people).  For better or for worse, Harlem is gentrifying, so go see it before it's all gone! Have fun!|`|oOR511mFaa	Its not as bad as it use to be.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Well walk around Harlem at night and find out.     ........|...  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  Here comes the truck delivering me 2 points!|`|EOZsYlZkaa	Just like most cities, there are good and bad areas. Harlem has experienced a "gentrification" period in recent years, with wealthier people buying up the old brownstones and renovating them. Harlem also still has some of the best jazz clubs in the City. I would walk around Harlem alone, on the main streets/avenues in the day; I would not walk around Harlem or any other area of NYC at night alone.

EmIm5EWdaa	Up to you if you believe me but this is how the system works. No matter what your fiance says or does at the interview she will be refused a visa. The man's job in Hanoi is to find reasons to refuse, the more your fiancee says the more reasons he will have to refuse.Please bear this in mind , it is a 100% certainty that the answer will be no.This does not mean she will not get a visa, when he gives her the reasons no you have 28 days to appeal, through the appeal system is the only way to get a visa.Your big problem is convincing your fiancee that this is how it now works, the less she says the better, and a couple of trivial things wrong is good, it makes it so much easier when you appeal [ appeals done by fax to the UK] than if she has gone on and on. I don't know your personal circumstances if you wish to e-mail me i could maybe help more.|`|69747adf3b6a9d2b152eabc1282fee2daa	So what is your question ?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Your fiance (? fiancée) will have to show that your relationship is genuine, and that you fully intend to, eventually, get married and live together in the UK. The questions will all be aimed at proving that, but you cannot make a list of specific questions - it will all depend on how the interview goes.<br>  <br>  You definitely should provide her with a letter giving all your relevant details, and stating your intent to marry the girl.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.

3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	Afghanistan is home not only to several religious sects but also to a host of different ethnic, linguistic, and tribal groups. Rivalry and even armed hostilities have traditionally been common between and within many of these groups. Historic and geographic factors have led to the creation and preservation of diversity. The relationship between tribe and ethnicity is complex, and by no means do all Afghans, even all rural Afghans, consider themselves tribal members. In addition to social diversity, many different phenotypes may be found in the population, including blond-haired, blueeyed Afghans; those with darker features and epicanthal folds; tall, olive-skinned, mustachioed tribesmen; and those who combine these features. Although it may be tempting to associate certain physical features with certain ethnic groups, scholars recognize that because all human populations are capable of interbreeding and do so with great regularity, there are more physical differences found within ethnic groups than between them. Canfield has observed that in Bamian, "some Hazaras [who are thought to have "Mongolian" features], especially those from the chiefly families, do not have clearly defined Mongoloid features. Instead, some have heavy beards and lack the typical Mongolian eyefolds and high cheek bones. Conversely, some persons calling themselves 'Tajik' have rather strong Mongoloid features. I consequently doubt that the relationship between phenotype and ethnic identity is very close."    Afghanistan's rugged physical environment serves to isolate residential communities and to create microenvironments. Members of the same ethnic group and tribe who reside in different locations must adapt to their own microenvironment, which may result in different kin?based groups within the same tribe and ethnic group using different modes of production. For example, the Durrani Pashtuns that Tapper studied were primarily agriculturalists, while the Sheikhanzai Durrani Pashtuns, who were the subject of Tavakolian's research, were primarily pastoralists. Many Durrani also live in cities, where they may have lost their tribal identity.|`|bn0oXqDcaa	At the moment it's quite torn with the US troops and Taliban clashes. there are the sunni's and shia's in Afghanistan.

Fact is, whether Sunni or Shia, Afghanistan is ONE with its many different people.|`|YTLePvkVaa	Afghanistan is 85% Sunni and 15% Shia. The Shia Afghans are from the "Hazara" minority in Afghanistan.

eDjiOWKtaa	con artists are people who use their own self-confidence as a means to swindle people... aka scammers.    in the Japanese context, there are 3 kinds of con artists:    Shirosagi (white scammers) - those who use people's fixation with money against them in order to take advantage... like pyramid scheme top-dwellers and fraudulent sales or collections agents.    Akasagi (red scammers) - those who use people's personal feelings by distracting their potential victims and find ways to gain financially... like Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the movie "Heartbreakers"    Kurosagi (black scammers) - vigilante con artists who only victimize red and white scammers.|`|5EPwDjt8aa	There are many types, but the most common ones can be found on the internet.  People sending large checks for small purchases and telling you to cash the check, take out what you are owed and send the rest back to them (the checks are always worthless).  There are women who promise to marry you online and ask for money when in fact, they are already married and have no intention of marrying you.  A con is when somebody promises something to you in exchange for something from you, but even though you do as you promised, they don't.  Even children can be little con artists.  Have you ever heard them promise to go to bed if you let them watch the rest of a t.v. show, only to stay at the set long after their show goes off?  That is a con job and I guess anyone is capable of being a con artist in one way or another.
WT7Gub0Xaa	There will always be arguments.  Thing is these days the world is a smaller place.Both countries have the same threats from the upsurge in islamic militancy and therefore need to work together in terms of security.

Americans seem very reluctant to accept that  fact or that the cold war finished over 20yrs ago,and that Russia is no longer a second world country.  Russian people are not really botherd.but they do see many Americans as having some sort of superiority complex.

For all you know, there is no one else to be with her (my mom) than me. But my wife will still have her parents to congratulate her when she wakes up.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	I was placed in a somewhat similar situation years ago which involved taking care and looking after my sick mother over that of my family's.    She was confined in the hospital for almost a month.  The doctor had already informed us it could be her last admission.  She was suffering from renal dysfunction.  The only daughter, the responsibility of taking care of her fell heavily on me.  At that time my children were in high school.  What made matters worst was knowing my husband was having an affair with his secretary.  In my absence, it would certainly give him more time and opportunity to be out of the house so often, leaving the children to themselves under the care of a househelp.  I didn't like that.     I was torn between people I love and hold dear.  Then, I made a decision I have never regretted doing.  I stayed with my mom and took care of her the way she took care of me when I was a child.  We spent our last Christmas together in the hospital.  I was sad I wasn't with my own family on Christmas eve but being with my mom for the last time more than enough compensated for the loneliness I felt.    My children understood that.  They came to the hospital on Christmas day though.  Mom celebrated New Year's eve before she fell into a coma and died January 03.|`|sTFa6dutaa	if i were the wife, i would insist my husband be with his mom. i'd ask my sister to make a video of my delivery so my husband can see it later. next time i give brith, he could be with me.    if i were the dying mother, i would be very happy that my son is with me and i thank his wife for allowing this.

The beauty of the City may not be immediately evident, but there's a whack of architectural wonder dotted all around the place, and of course, it's been said on many occasion that the greatest beauty of Glasgow is in the welcome you'll get there from its citizens.  And don't listen to the mis-informed idiots who may even reply to this who've read about our history on the back of a napkin and will tell you all about the gangs and the deprivation in Glasgow.    Blue sky - you won't get too many of these in any of your options.  Loads of greenery - Glasgow is known as the Dear Green Place, with over 70 parks.  Beautiful old buildings - what can I say, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, architecture copied by NYC, Alexander Greek Thomson...    Don't take my word for it though - head on over and see for yourself!

c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	Bavaria - the countryside where I live in - is probably more liberal than you would expect. Bavaria is a big state (in fact, Germany's biggest), and we're used to doing things our own way and we're famous for not caring about the federal government. Some people call us "little Texas", and maybe that's what we are. The famous German writer Goethe (or was it Schiller?) named us "a stubborn mountain folk", but whoever it was, he copied from an ancient Roman writer who wrote the same. We're not really conservative here; when I was a young voter, it was Bavarians who first voted the Greens into regional parliaments. Here in Bavaria, we're not much concerned about federal politics, unless it concerns us; and I think and sincerely hope that in this year's federal elections, Bavaria will take revenge on those politicians who cheated and mistreated us and the German people. Be ready for a surprise. Bavaria is big, and we have common vote here. We ousted the long-lasting conservative government in our state by just a few percent, but we did it. Who says we can't oust the federal government?|`|y18plL5Daa	Bayern is really different from the rest of Germany, and similar at the same time. We hold on to our culture much more than "normal" Germans. I am from a small village named Erlbach.  It is very different from the rest of Germany. We only have around 1200 inhabitants here in Erlbach so I know everybody in my village. We do have a pub but there are greater drinking possibilities in Vilsbiburg. Vilsbiburg also has great architecture and it is not far from Erlbach. Vilsbiburg is a cozy town!  In Erlbach (my town), everybody wear dirndls and lederhosens all of the time. We are very bound to our Bavarian traditions.......If I want to go to a bigger, more stressful city I go to Landshut. Munchen is a good city but it is not the real Bayern! It is good if you want to go shopping or clubbing but it is more an international town than a Bavarian town. If you want to see real Bavarian life you should come to a smaller town or village, like Erlbach or Vilsbiburg. Come to Bayern instead of "Germany"! You will feel at home and more welcome.|`|lYkvps54aa	it a german city. i traveled round the whole of germany for 3 weeks and the one thing that i did notice, when you visit towns and cities in the east of the country, you definitely see the difference between the east/west divide. it just seems to get grayer the further east you go. as for munich well its german through and through, its Germany's jewel in its crown.    hope this helps, even though it didn't quite answer your question     : )|`|2pIPYEleaa	If you visit Munich, you visited Bavaria.

Many of them consider themselves Bavarian as opposed to being German - Bavaria was one of the last states to join Germany.     However...outsiders visiting Bavaria will find it very 'German'.

And I certainly have living in Bavaria (chiemgau province).  I took a high german course here and to be honest HIGH GERMAN is VERY VERY different to BAVARIAN dialect.  It's the howdy and Y'all of let's say Texas.  its MUCH more laid back in language and lifestyle to the north of Germany and a tiny bit laid back compared to Austria.     Its casual, friendly, clean and beautifully green.  Obviously people in the city work differently as opposed to people in the countryside....but that's everywhere.  People in city (time is money attitude)....people in the country (sit down stay awhile).  Hamburg is a great Northern city offering a great music scene and big red light district type atmosphere.  Frankfurt is very finance.  Munich is business/art scene. Berlin is Big Art Scene (more laid back than Munich).  Salzburg, Austria is old world with a high end lux scene.  Have fun and don't forget to learn some bavarian before you go:    Pfeti (may god walk beside you...used after a convo.)  Servus (at your service...used before and after a conversation...this also works in Austria)  Gruss gott (greet god...used before a convo.)    Viel spass!!! (have fun)|`|zEoRcL91aa	Berlin is the capital city of Germany, Munich is the capital city of Bavaria. Bavarian sounds much closer to Austrian than to any other German dialect. Berlin, where I live is different in terms of culture, dialect and general day-to day living. Since Germany as a country has only been around for the last 150 years or so, it is no surprise that there are these differences.     When tourists visit Germany they tend to pin Bavarian culture onto Germany as a whole. I find the 'east' far more interesting. There are also less tourists and you can have the opportunity to practice German a lot more.    In the east there was a more Prussian influence(google Potsdam), as Brandenburg and Berlin were once a part of Prussia. The most foreigners live in Berlin and Hochdeutsch (what kids and foreigners learn at school) is spoken in Hannover/Hamburg regions.|`|2OsFIZghaa	When you compare the north of the US to the south of the US. There is a difference, too.    For Germans it is sometimes annoying to be seen as Bavarians only. I do not like Weisswurst and I do not dance like them either.    But, since the US Soldiers have mainly been in the south of Germany, it was not avoidable.    Munich is a nice town, large and town like.

Metro Station (both of them like 30 seconds away); I did a little bit of research and it looks like the best, clean safe and fun hostel in the area is El Misti Pousada & Hostel Rio de Janeiro http://www.hostels.st/en/brazil/rio_de_j... which is only 2 minutes away from the same metro station; the reviews on TripAdvisor (http://tinyurl.com/ckj34a) clearly say so, compared to the other two hostels which I mentioned above;  The hostel is considered a mixture of party and flashpacker hostel; so if you are just looking for a cheap and safe place that would do the job for you! Some reviews even claim that is one of the best hostels in South America so definitely worth checkin out. I know this website for more Rio de Janeiro Hostels http://www.hostels.st/en/brazil/rio_de_j...     Enjoy Rio, the "carioca & alegria" lifestyle!     Regards,   Johann

pcHp7Dgkaa	Work is tight but if you're flexible about what you do and where you live, you'll get by. The employment situation isn't nearly as bad here as it is in other countries - unemployment is still only 4.4% and a good many of them are the hard core of permanently unemployed. Melbourne probably isn't the best place in Australia to be looking for work at present but there will still be bar and food service work and other things like that.     Fruitpicking is always seasonal, but that's one thing that won't be badly affected by the economic downturn - if the crops are there, they need to be picked and people still need to eat.If you're prepared to follow the crops and work hard, you'll find work.     Don't come though if you don't have enough to tide you over for at least a couple of months (in total - not in one hit) if you can't find steady long term work.    If you already have your working holiday visa and decide not to come, make sure you cancel it so that you can get another one later. If you just leave it, you probably won't be able to get another when things pick up.    Oh, and I have no idea what Sali is talking about - I think she's a bit confused about how Australian visas work.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	if you are British under 25 years of age, you are allowed 3 months tourist visa + one year if you find a job in Australia.

My sister and a friend got mugged in SF after going to Monster Park (fromerly Candlestick park) for a game. To save money, they didn't park in the stadium parking lot. they had parked in a neighborhood nearby. It was known as a bad area. As they walked back to the car after the game, someone pulled a gun on them and they were robbed. Luckily, no one was hurt. About all you can do is report it to the police. And talk it over with her, it is very tramatizing and she needs to get those scary feelings out. I frequently go to SF for shows and dinner, but stick to the nicer side of town or go with friends who know the area well.|`|AA11258995	I got mugged once a few blocks away from my house.

This entails no change in trains.    With a change in trains it would be the 2 train from 241st St, Bronx, then change at Fulton St to the A train to Far Rockaway - about 38 miles.    The above are somewhat documented.  The ones below are a guess because the routes cover quite a distance from end to end.    The next is the F train from 179th St, Queens to Coney Island-Stillwell Av, Brooklyn - about 27 miles (a guess).    Next would probably be the 4 from Woodlawn in the Bronx to New Lots Av, Brooklyn - about 23 miles (a guess).|`|DnOC8Zdhaa	the a train has one of the longest routes from brooklyn to the bronx. the R trains also, because they start in brooklyn, loop around manhattan and go into queens.|`|pn9muy1jaa	The A train goes from 207 street / Washington heights to Far Rockaway Queens, that's the longest route in mileage

PHpVr8raaa	It was closed for renovation from October 1997 to December 1999 and reopened on January 1, 2000.     EDIT: During those 27 months, exhibitions were held outside the center, in various French and foreign museums. It was called "hors les murs" (= outside the walls)    The renovations, conducted by Renzo Piano cost 88 million euros. They reorganized the space which enabled to increase the surface area by 8,000 square meters (86,000 sq.ft)

I highly recommend you go to Skala. The beaches are beautiful and the night life and dining is great. When I went to Skala, I wouldn't say there were tourist left and right but a lot of people that are from the British Virgin Islands go and vacation there and even live there. From Skala, all the cities are within an hour away. When I went to Skala, I stayed at a 4 star hotel called Louis Aposolata Hotel which was BEAUTIFUL and located right on the beach. Sami, I didn't think there was much there but Skala is a must :)

uqb7dkBbaa	Average lunch in a Brasserie runs around 15 Euros per head if you drink tap water. For a dinner I would say between 25 Euros to 30 Euros if you want to have something decent, but as said above not in the tourist areas, most of the restaurants there are either bad and expensive to middling decent and expensive. Or extremely good and extremely expensive. Paris is the capital city and like every capital city much more expensive than the rest of the country.  For an average good dinner but not extremely expensive I would say try one of the numerous brasseries and take a menu. Cheaper are the chains, like Bistro Romain (very average but not expensive).   Bon Appetit.|`|RtMZ3Ym2aa	Bad to admit but when we went we ate at the local Italian! The bistro restaurants are very expensive and I did not enjoy the food at all.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	Paris is expensive anyway, more than the UK, but food are delicious, take away is reasonable, resturants are expensive.|`|NCNYmOPCaa	No the french rip everyone off !|`|CyP7VMHHaa	That's hard to answer. It's like asking what to expect to pay for a meal in New York. You can pay $10-$12 at McDonald's or you can pay hundreds of dollars at a high-end place. It depends on the location and the type of restaurant.     In general, Paris is expensive. However, you can keep your costs down somewhat if you don't eat in areas that are frequented by tourists. For example, a view of Notre Dame often means mediocre food at premium prices. Stick with a neighborhood cafe or bistro away from the crowds.    When I was there last year, a simple sandwich and a Coke ran about $10 a person. A dinner in a neighborhood bistro with a beer cost $44 a person. If you are from the US, then exchange rates have improved since then. The same meals today are probably around $8.50 and $38 respectively.    You can also keep costs down by buying baked goods from a bakery instead of eating breakfast in a cafe or in your hotel. A cheap lunch can be had by purchasing some bread and cheese from a local store and eating in a park. I've done that several times.|`|LOWWquKkaa	In September, going again in two weeks.|`|U0N0CfEBaa	You're on the internet, I would be there are a number of Parisians on the internet who go to bed and wake there every day.
urHPuzMsaa	Your question is not very clear. Do you want to know what air and hotel would cost or how much once you get here? You have to know weekday or weekend because the prices on weekends are much more than weekdays. You can price out vacation packages but they cost more than if you price air and hotel separately. Go directly to the airline and hotel websites for the best prices and deals. You can change your dates around to find the best prices. I can't tell you because I have no idea where you are traveling from to get here.    You can figure between $150 and $200 a day per person spending money for food and entertainment. Keep gambling to a minimum and that should be fine.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I agree with danham44. There are many packages that you can buy. If your traveling by Airplane it would cost you about 100 dollars or more. But you do still have to pay for the booking for the hotel even if your staying 4 nights or 5 nights. If you know you can afford it, then it should be easy to manage.|`|Jevw5cbqaa	Its actually pretty cheap if you by a package. Around $400-600$ with hotel and flight included.|`|zcZGRPc2aa	depends on where you are leaving from, what type of room you want, flight options. I book all my vacations from hotels.com and usually for a 3 night 4 day stay I pay 800 for 2 people at the luxor in a spa suite. so it just really depends on what you're looking for. go to hotels.com and type in your dates, and how many people and it will show what packages cost based on hotels/room/flightoptions    oh yeah the answer above mine is totally wrong about getting the best deals by going directly to the hotel/airline sites. I check every time and they are ALWAYS higher.

nF9DZ0sOaa	A brief geography lesson, because it will be helpful.  If you look at a city map of Corpus Christi, you will see that it is long and skinny, spread out along Corpus Christi Bay.  North Beach is at the north end of the city (near Portland), then Corpus Christi proper, then Flour Bluff and Padre Island at the south end.  The main streets are (beginning at the Bayfront) Ocean Drive, Alameda, South Staples, South Padre Island Drive, Holly and Saratoga.  These all run parallel to each other and to the bayfront, and will contain most of what's worth seeing and doing in Corpus Christi except, of course, the beach, which is on Padre Island.  North Beach does have a small beach, but it is man made, the sand being dumped there from the ship channel dredging operations.    How much you pay for lodging depends on where in Corpus Christi you chose to stay.  If you stay on the bayfront, or on the Island, you are going to pay significantly more than if you stay somewhere inland.    In the city, on the bayfront, the two Omni hotels are very nice, and the view over the marina is wonderful.  The Omnis often have packages that are reasonably priced, so a visit to their website is worthwhile.    Away from the bayfront are numerous hotels.  Your best bet is to try Expedia or Travelocity.  Those along South Padre Island Drive (S.P.I.D.) are probably all going to be pretty decent.    On Padre Island, just across the street from gift shops, restaurants and a really terrific mini-golf place, is a Best Western that is fairly new.  Again, a visit to the website would be useful.  There is a Holiday Inn right on the beach...see their website.    Great places to eat:  near downtown is the Water Street Seafood Company, which is kind of the gold standard for seafood.  Landry's is literally in the marina...it's on an old paddle-wheeler, and the food is fine.  On Padre Island is Frenchy's and Snoopy's...both good seafood places.  There are a ton of chain restaurants on S.P.I.D.    Stuff to do:  beginning on North Beach; the USS Lexington Museum, the Texas State Aquarium, watching ships come into the channel.  Go over Harbor Bridge and visit the art museum, the museum of science and nature, and the replicas of the Columbus ships.  Drive the full length of Ocean Drive and eyeball the mansions along this favored stretch of real estate.  Downtown has several clubs:  the Executive Surf Club is the one I'm most familiar with, but there are many others.  Take the Captain Clark sunset cruise out into Corpus Christi Bay and see the buildings in downtown light up after dark.  Stroll along the seawall, or rent a surry and pedal along it.    Shopping is pretty much only so-so; mainly malls and chain stores.  The restaurants we've already talked about.    Fishing:  the jetties along the seawall are very popular fishing spots.  Down on the island are numerous fishing piers, or you can surf fish.    Drive down to the Island, and visit Mustang Island State Park for some of the best shelling in the area.  The water and beach conditions vary widely from day to day, so expect anything from crystal clear and tons of shells, to piles of stinky seaweed.  It's best to call ahead and ask.    There are lots of other things to do in the area:  if you are into cute shops, drive over to Rockport.  While you're there, Charlotte Plummer's is the place to eat.    Everything I've talked about has a website, so make Google your friend.  The Corpus Christi Visitor's Bureau website is a good place to start (link below).    Enjoy your visit!|`|yWRTrnR2aa	The Bayfront Inn is a great place to stay (not to be confused with the bayfront plaza).

FBZIxc3paa	My first trip to New York was in December from the UK, and even though I'm not keen on flying, I just want to go back again and again!  I had to keep pinching myself that it was real.  I was there for 5 days and managed to see most of the sights like Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Rockerfeller Centre, Soho shopping, Central Park with snow! and Macy's shopping was fantastic!  I found the people very polite and friendly, and even felt safer there than I did in my own country!  I've fallen in love with the place and can't wait to go again if I get the chance.  I slept most of the way on the plane, which was very comfortable, with free drinks and snacks and great choice of movies.  Don't let the flight put you off visiting such a fantastic place, believe me it's well worth it!|`|92Dci9i3aa	not what i hear|`|TWoe3D51aa	Been there twice, not much of a fan.

I'd seen it in so many movies, visiting it for real was almost like being IN a movie.    If you love cities, you'll love New York. There is almost no end to the things you can do there. Even if you just ate at a different restaurant every night, you would die of old age before you ran out of restaurants to eat at. It's astonishing.    People who say New York is dangerous are basing their opinion on what the city was like in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. It was apparently really bad then, but it's a much safer place today, believe me.    If you're terrified of flying, there are certain courses you can go on to help alleviate your fear. It's worth it.|`|019e9ad03907f75846fcc35e167f393faa	So many negative answers !I found New York a blast definitely worth the long haul flight I would go again tomorrow given half the chance.

1op04gcFaa	i do not think that people hate the ones who think differently than them, or that they love the ones who think the same as them.  it is not the question of hate. at least it should not be. everyone is entitled to their own opinion and to expressing their opinion. BUT to express it in a way that does not offend or hurt anyone, at least not on purpose.  i may not always agree with you, but i will listen what you have to say and why you think that your opinion is the right one and my the wrong one, or vice versa.  that is the whole point. to listen. to exchange views. to learn from each other.  the world would be such a boring place if everyone would think the same way.   not only that. if there was no disagreement in opinions, where would we be now? how would we develop and learn without questioning other people opinions along with ours.|`|QVuxRg9Haa	because they are ignorant ...  they think that there thoughts are the best ... they doesnt even listen ..    seconed thing is el nargsia ... everyone thinks that none should tell him thats he is wrong|`|jqkgmCT3aa	Because most people weren't raised on respecting other peoples' point  of view|`|ravzJTVOaa	rigid or insecure people cannot listen to views different from theirs .  we have to listen to all kinds of views to learn new things , to receive new knowledge or information.  we should welcome receiving opinions that agree or disagree with our views or else we are imprisoned  to our views .    the German song is nice .  thanks for sharing it with us .  i like to hear new songs of all languages  .|`|oKE6EyJXaa	Human nature !!

Think about the movie: "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", the father was closed minded and thought the Greek culture was superior and therefore said every word came from Greek roots. Basically, people who hate ones with other views just haven't had enough knowledge of other cultures, they are closed minded, or they are just too proud of themselves. Hope this helped.    My favourite song of the day...would be ANY song from the Korean group Seeya. (Although I don't understand Korean, I still love it ^^)|`|EYRlLHwLaa	People are insecure.  To some, to even consider another point of view is to admit that there is a possibility that your viewpoint is wrong.  Many people can't handle that.  It is easier to put your hands over your ears and call anybody with a different opinion an idiot.  It is a much more intelligent (and mature) approach to consider every opinion so that you can fine-tune (and, if necessary, adjust) your own.

ravzJTVOaa	i think it is a very successful way for young ones to know , choose , and accept each other .  recently , a girl from a good family who has completed her education had a kind of arranged meeting with a distant relative .  he had graduated from the AUC , got a job in a reputable good paying company .  both needed a decent , well brought up spouse .  a relative of both arranged a meeting for the girl and the guy within the context of the family.  they met , liked each other , and got engaged within 3 weeks , ma sha allah .  the chemistry worked , the families accepted the union bec they were compatible .  there is no prescription as to what to say or do in the 1st meeting .  it is a gathering like hundreds of meetings , but it isnt by chance .  the conversation is natural for both sides bec they have social skill.    this kind of arrangement is the best for conservative , religious families that dont allow girls to mix with boyfriends .|`|0KR4wyoQaa	I personally don't like it.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	personally i don't agree with it ..    but it seems to work for some people ..|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	i didn't married on this way and i think if i wasn't married by now i will never take that step but let me tell you it works with many other people that means it work.many families don't accept love relation or "hey dad there is man i know  he want to marry me" in some families it will end in tragedy way so in this case that kind of marriage is very good to them beside its not that bad or not 2 dogs in cage they are only different type of peoples who accept to get married by this way and i can tell that most of this marriage is successful one you can say its chemistry or i think cause both of them want to get married i mean in many love stories the man married very young so after a while he think he didn't live the life he suppose to live but in that case 2 people want to get married so they stand together in front of anything to make it successful one.        ============================  @im different:lol ididnt thumb u down but any how u know gurlz always 3andhom 7asasya mn word cage so its not good to say it as we put animals on cage so instead use under spot for example any way as u said lkol ka3da shwaz and yes it may work for other as i said i know with my personalty it will never work for me but i cant denay it works for some people very well and also let me tell you the love you know is totally different than the love which grow after marriage as i married my husband after a great love story but believe me the love which grow between us after marriage is different and better than the one before marriage so i this relations they love each other but a different kind of love its not that hot one we see on movies or we already have it in our life but its more responsible love like the one we have after marriage its love also but another kind dont worry one day you will know it    ===============================  @im diffirent:ur thought in love is true also i can neglect it but every one love with his own way msh 3arfa 7atfhmny wala la2 bs homa aw el no3 da mn el nas hwa da el 7ob 3andhom 3la fekra ana msh bdaf3 3anhom but de fekrtk enta 3n el 7ob we de tare2tk 3'erk la2 fe wa7d ygeb l mrato warda we fe wa7d tany y2olk kilo kbab 27san ya3ny etfrg 3la film 27la el 2w2at we sahr el lyaly bgd they both translate it very well|`|e4ba687fef0f0cf91aee345fda8cb98caa	marriage is a social system depends on partnership, so gawas el salonat is such a kind of marriage, and most probably successful more than marriage on love base.  the reason is : two partner didn't expect much from another so if someone do sweetie thing the other will be very happy|`|0pM85b5Baa	I don't like it personally and it doesn't mean it's bad.     my reasons: This is the traditional way for marriage in Egypt. Now it's not suitable for these days. The results of not updating our traditions and filtering it, is one of the highest rates of divorce in the world {Specially in Cairo and Alexandria} it's more than 50% now. That means we should think much and change much, it's not only the economical effect, it's the old stoned minds of parents who wants just to keep traditions more than religion or logic.

Nowadays, the society is opener than before and the girl and the guy could meet every where, in university, in club, in work.   so , among all these channels , a well educated, successful  man cannot find a suitable bride, his charming princess . i think that marriage depends on emotions and feelings , how can i love someone if there are many eyes supervise me. besides, the situation will be  very embarrassing for the girl if the man doesn't like her. (and also for the man if she refused him)   i think that this kind of marriage is like a man who go to the market to buy a kilo of tomatoes or fruits , he sees lots of kind to choose the best one. usually, the standards in this marriage are the family reputation, education, and financial situations and not love ,feelings, and personality.   how they will discover the bad things in each other?, both act and try to show the good side of them before the two families.  the problem that sometime the girl doesn't accept the groom and her parents accept and they enforce her to marry him. does any man accept to marry a girl against her will?  I refuse it completely|`|AA10956234	I must say it clearly,     Both types are good btw,     Type A:  People who accept what they can get from life, who doesn't have many dreams or goals to achieve, people who just want to live a good life and that's it, and those people when married by this way "salonat" and if they liked each other then i think they will have successful marriage, bcoz they will not think about "what if?" or "It would be better if i marry this or that" , and i think they will make a good family,     Type B:  People who care about the meaning of life, they need to feel happy, they don't want to woke up one day after marriage and say "why i married this man? I'm totally different and we can't understand each other, I thought he is not like that" , people who can suffer from life problems but are always having dreams and feelings, they don't like to live in a " Heaven cage" , this people will lose many things in their life , but i think they will gain freedom, but sometimes freedom is not everything, bcoz if you are flying alone then you will not feel happy, anyway, people like that will not be happy in this way of marriage,    It depends if you are type A or type B, if you are type A then I think it will works, if you are type B then better to avoid such way except when you feel you are getting old and in this case you will change to type A :) lol|`|deTJcdv9aa	ok Arranged marriage,, isn't that l when two people get married at the first time they meet is on the wedding day??? coz that's what some siri lankans and indians do?? gawaz salonate? isn't that when  a Friend of the family says i have an arees or aroosaah for you??  well i think that is an excellent idea as our fathers and grandfathers generation did it, and there was diversity in family's rather then having mum and dad are both from the same faculty of uni, both are from the same city, both are the same in everything...  and the rate of divorce was extremely low because this method...    so yeah when it does happen just be yourself  and one time meeting is never enough, and if u do get rejected its not an embarassing situation at all,, we are all different, i shouldnt get offended by rejection of this method,,  it is better then getting married in the first place then getting rejected after woods.|`|1ScInnZRaa	I think that they are sad.

PSiNv7gUaa	Sea World is a BLAST.  They opened a new water park last spring called Aquatica that features slides and such like a regular water park, but they also have live animals--including a clear tube slide that goes down into a tank of commerson's dolphins, so it's like you're swimming with them.  :)  Sea World also owns Dolphin Cove, where you can not only swim with dolphins, but also interact with stingrays and snorkel with fish on an artificial reef.  You can get great deals on trips to Sea World and its sister parks on seaworld.com.    Only 45 minutes away is Kennedy Space Center, it is definitely worth the drive.  It didn't seem like something that would interest me very much, but I thorougly enjoyed it and wished we had more time to spend there.  And just a short drive from the space center is Cocoa Beach, with the famous Ron Jon's Surf Shop.  Also if you are willing to drive a little ways, there are numerous places for airboat tours.    There are several dinner theaters, they are rather expensive, but fun.  I personally LOVED Medieval Times.  There are smaller tourist spots like Gatorland and Ripley's Believe it or Not, numerous mini-golf courses and water parks...

That's a pretty fun place to go when you wanna do something other than Disney World. Sea World also has its own water park called Aqautica which is a really fun experience to enjoy. You can take a bus/taxi to Tampa to go to Busch Gardens Africa which is also a lot of fun because the whole park is themed Africa and there are tons of roller coasters and other rides over there too. It also has safaris with real live animals, just like Animal Kingdom. Across the street from Busch Garden Africa is Adventure Island. Adventure Island is another water park which is cool to be at. Note: If you decide to go to Tampa then you'll likely pay some good money on transportation which is about 60 miles from Orlando (about an hour and 15 minute ride).
IstwJtBraa	Put it in a frying pan with a cup  and a half of water,  red onion, garlic, parsley, green cubano pepper and simmer for one hour.  There is a spice called completo here if you have it but if not no problem.  Serve over white rice and the juice you cooked it in as a sauce.  Boil up some Yuca and serve it with it.

seKDGZp8aa	Hi there,    I'm going to give you a top 10!    1. TV Tower and alexanderplatz- for great views over Berlin  2. Reichstag - German Parliament  3. Brandenberg Gate/potsdammer platz  4. Victory Column  5. Checkpoint Charlie Museum  6. 1936 Olympic Stadium  7. Kurfurstendam and Ka De We - Major shopping area similar to London's Harrods  8. East Side Gallery - Very long stretch of the wall  9. Berlin Catherdral  10. nikolaiviertel - old town of Berlin    If you manage to do all those you can be cultured and touristy. The thing with Berlin is that there is SO much to do depending on your interests. If you like history...Berlin is the place to go.    As for hotels...Mitte is a good place to be. If you are a student/arty I recommend the districts of Kreuzberg, Prenzlauerberg and Friedrichshain. Try to avoid areas such as Lichtenberg and Marzahn during the night...some of the people there don't take kindly to foreigners.

If there's a city in Germany, or even, say, central Europe, you definitely MUST see, then it's Berlin. What you make of it, that's up to you. You can see all the holocaust memorials, visit the German Reichstag, the "embassy quarter" or the Marlene-Dietrich-Platz; but you can also go out at night and feel relatively safe and mix with the people who are around in such infamous districts as Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain. You may even use the subway at night without fear of being hurt, but smoking while waiting on the platform will cost you 15 euros (been there, paid that).|`|uTgvbYzLaa	I have.

vRIZxndwaa	Hi, I just got back from Cancun 2 days ago from England, I seen lots of little stray kittens even in the airport when I was eating my sandwich one was near my legs a white coloured one. Dont feel bad my friend you did look after the kitten and you did your best, the kittens are clever they have good survival skills inside them from God and they will be okay, another generous person like yourself will come along when you go and will look after them. Just enjoy your holiday what is remaining off it and see if you can speak to some local shop keepers who would look after the kittens but dont worry, like I said you did more than enough and those kittens are so grateful that you was there to help them, God bless|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Ask at the front desk of your hotel for info on a local animal shelter...big cities in Mexico usually have one.  Or ask where some vet offices are...go see the vet to see if they know of someone who could adopt them  If you are thinking of bringing them back on the plane...they would need their shots and an international health inspection record from a local vet.  I believe they need to be 8 weeks or older and you would need the proper carrier.  Would also need to call your airline and make arrangements and pay the fee.  See site below for an animal rescue organization in Cancun you could call...or get a Spanish speaking person to help you call.  This place may be your best source of help.  they may have English speaking people on staff, since they have their website in English. I hope you can find a place for these two babies.  I am an American living in  Mexico and 1 1/2 yrs ago found and rescued two tiny kittens thrown out in the st to die.  I adopted one and my friend adopted the other...they have turned out to be adorable, sweet cats.  I hope you can get help thru this animal rescue organization.

IstwJtBraa	Depends on which side/part of the country you want to stay on.     This is a big country and if you started in Pedenales you couldn't make it to Punta Cana in less than 12 hours.    Personally I like the North Coast.  Look into Cabarete if you are young and sports minded.  If you are a bit older check out Hotel La Catalina in Cabrera.  Not all inclusive but a nice place with different things to do and at the foot of the mountains but close to the beach and great vistas.|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	In punta cana, A resort called gran bahia principe bavaro|`|f645ec028c19d84089f57f1c03e81a74aa	Casa de campo|`|OXxKTM6vaa	RIU Mambo, Bahia Mamon Puerto Plata is AMAZING. research it x|`|qNfp0EhCaa	My husband and I went to Excellence Punta Cana on our honeymoon, it was AMAZING!

2EVoNHHbaa	While Adam is correct in his description of the tour, I'm going to take the contrary view and say that if you have the opportunity for a tour, take it, at least once in your life.  There's something special about standing in the same building as the presidents of the United States, where over 200 years of history has been made.  Even if you can't see them, you'll know that the President and his family are probably there, as well as a host of government officers working to support him.|`|AA10250756	Contact your congressman's office and see if they can give you the special tickets so you don't have to stand in line for a very long time. Then it's worth it|`|NnMzREtNaa	Yes, I've taken one and it is a short but memorable experence. For more, check out my WikiHow article:     http://www.wikihow.com/Act-on-a-White-Ho...|`|4i59X44Laa	I have been several times, and yes I will go again.  It is the only place that I can think of that you could go and be in the same place as all Presidents of the United States have lived, except George Washington (it was not completed soon enough for it to be his office and home.    This is my help from Washington, D.C. United States of America.        Please pick an answer as best answer, even if it is not mine.|`|1f88iwfMaa	Personally, I don't think so. The tour is self-guided, and you basically get to wander through the Blue Room, the State Dining Hall, and a handful of other ceremonial rooms. You don't get to see the upstairs residence where the President lives or the offices in the West Wing. You're also not allowed to take anything in with you like bags (that includes purses and handbags), cameras, video recorders, etc. The only thing you can have on you are your keys, wallet, and cell phone (just don't try to use it to take a picture).    To me, it's a lot of hassle to see a few relatively unimportant rooms.

Jm3vMKx3aa	There are several electrical outlets in Europe.  On the Islands of Great Britain and Ireland a different plug is used than in continental Europe and you will need the adapter fitting to the outlet as shown it the attached source.  Be aware of the fact that Europe is using 230 volts 50 Hz instead of 110 volts 60 Hz. You need to check the manual of your electric devices whether they operate on multiple voltage. Most battery chargers or power adapters have a type plate showing 100-240V/50-60Hz. In this case you will only need the plug adapter. Other items like dryers or curling irons may only operate on 110 volts, then you will need a step-down transformer in addition to the plug adapter.      Source(s):  http://kropla.com/!g.htm|`|zYGZ6zpuaa	Yes most run off of 220 if I recall also the prongs are different, buy an adapter before you go.

e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Harajuku fashions change so quickly that if people thought of it at all they would likely think, "Why is Gwen Stefani dressing like we used to a couple years ago?". The only way you can really keep up with Harajuku is be there every Sunday to see what is cool that week. The Harajuku look is more about attitude than any given fashion-given that Gwen Stefani is not a Japanese schoolgirl she can only ever mimic the look. However I don't think there is anything wrong with her paying attention to Japanese pop culture and trying to make a buck off it. After all, she is a performer so she needs an image. I'm sure there are plenty of country-western stars who don't actually drive pickups or chew tobacco, etc.-Stefani is no different except she's got the Harajuku thing going.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	I don't think any Japanese Harajuku girl pay even a bit attention to Gwen or Harajuku lovers of foreigners anytime. They are only taking care of themselves. Japanese don't care about any weeaboo/wapapeese overseas because they have no interest on.

ToTEecHlaa	Italians don't eat our breakfast! They eat sweets with their espresso. I was there for an entire year without eating my precious hash browns and bacon!   They also don't have cinnamon gum. Where I was (Sardegna) they had never seen toe separators (for painting your toenails). They also don't have pudding. There is something kinda similar but you eat it hot. Absolutely no Mexican food.   It's kinda hard to think of all of these things off the top of my head. I'll add more later if I think of anything good. Oh, and they always wear shoes (flip flops or sandals of some type) indoors, and never blow-dry your hair in bare feet! :)   Hope this helped!|`|kgBPU4xxaa	While there are things that are relatively rare, the hard part of this is finding something that would be popular here. Someone suggested maple syrup, which I have actually brought back for people here. They think it's interesting, but don't find much use for it here. It is available in the store in my small town though as is peanut better. The stores don't carry much of those products because they doesn't sell.     One thing that people here did seem to like was cranberry - orange muffins and cookies. The cranberries are not at all common here and the things made with the cranberries they weren't too sweet for Italian tastes.    Most of the time when I go back to the US, people don't ask me to bring back something that's not available here, but focus on things that are cheaper in the US - like electronics & cameras.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	Pop Tarts.  Sauce mixes  Maple syrup  Ketchup in large fridge door containers   Baked beans  Dr Pepper|`|5anP962Yaa	We have been watching American movies here and we have always heard about this famous "peanut butter", that all the American kids seem to eat for their afternoon snack. In Italy it is translated (the films here are dubbed) as "burro d'arachidi". I had no idea what this "burro d'arachidi" was until I went to the States and saw it for the first time.  I think we still don't have it in Italy...at least I have never seen it.    I don't know if it would be successful though... You know, we have Nutella to spread on a slice of bread and THAT is very successful!

South is also pretty good.   They are expanding the LRT further in NW Calgary at the moment, I'm not sure when they plan to finish however.       Personally, if I had to move back into Calgary itself I would not move into NE or SE but SW or NW wouldn't be a problem.       I prefer the smaller cities/towns that surround Calgary however.   The commute isn't too bad and I like smaller centres.|`|qP58qlVraa	NW and SW are both good, not the NE though or SE.......|`|MkaCSI72aa	The North Western part and the South Western part generally have the better neighborhoods. I've lived mostly in the SW area(Areas like Shawnessy, Somerset/Bridlewood, Evergreen) because they're more family oriented, very safe, and are close to large shopping areas and transit.

It is next door to the visitors's center where all the buses are that go back and forth from the historic district and it includes a free breakfast and a free visitor's guide. You can purchase a meal package and save money eating at the wonderful restaurants in the Historic District. After that you might want to change to a hotel close to Busch Gardens.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	If you like water parks, WaterCountry USA is excellent. Also shopping is good at Prime Outlets. There are several plantations worth a visit including Carter's Grove, Shirley, and a modern estate in an old style Evelynton--all worth it. Eat at Bonefish if you haven't, and Seasons for the ribs in the restored area. The underground museum is excellent, and if you like folk art go to the Amy Rockefeller Museum.
xboONMOEaa	Glasgows not as bad as it sounds. Its been 6 months since i moved to Glasgow and to be honest i had pre judgements before moving. Glasgow is a very multicultural city so it will be easy to fit in. I live in the Pollockshields area of the city. In the city centre, Art and culture are important in Glasgow life where galleries and museums are in abundance - most with free admission. A choice of over 20 includes the world's first Museum of Religion and the renowned Burrell Collection in Pollok Park. So i think you should enjoy Glasgow as its historic and beautiful overall!!!|`|tAZe8XJsaa	I'm from Glasgow, and I am suggesting you don't move here. Nothing to do with unfriendliness, though.

You can get into the city centre very quickly, it's within walking distance (about 10/15 minutes), or there's plenty of buses, or the subway which only takes a few minutes.      The Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum is located in this area, too.  There's also lots of different types of people, as lots of students stay in the West End, so you'll meet lots of different nationalities.      I used to live there, and I loved it.  There's tons of pubs, restaurants, shops, parks.  The only downside to living there, was the amount of money I spent, lol.      I don't know whether you're maybe a student, and will be looking for a flatshare, or whether you're looking to buy/rent a place on your own.  If you're looking to buy, or even rent a place by yourself, it can be quite expensive.  But, there's other areas which are still in the West End of Glasgow, just not right in the area of Byres Rd, Hillhead etc, which is what most people call the West End.  If you find a place just outside this area, it will be cheaper but you'll still be very close to it.      It's not as bad as some people are making out.  I've lived here all my life, and now live in an area which is classed as being quite bad, but I've never come across any trouble.  Most people here are really nice and friendly.    Good luck with your move, I hope you enjoy Glasgow.|`|eXbgLXgCaa	well, its safer than the USA anyway. every place has good and bad and Glasgow is no exception. the best place in Glasgow is Breasden which  is 10-12 minutes from the city centre. but if you like to be closer to the centre then, its the west end you for you. I do rent flats in the centre but I have none available just now. you should be able to find some but you will need good reference these days or big deposit. good luck|`|I1MGSW9Yaa	To be completely honest, it depends on your finances.  If you're willing to take a train or a bus to the city centre (5-10 minutes), the south side of Glasgow is lovely - places like Rutherglen, Pollokshaws, Kings Park, etc. are really nice.  The West End is nice as well althought it is exceptionally pricey to buy/rent in the area, but on the upside it is very central and you can take the underground anywhere in the city centre.    I'm from the States and you find good and bad in every city in the world.  I would suggest that you get in touch with a property agent, or visit a site like http://www.gspc.co.uk or http://www.rightmove.co.uk to read up on Glasgow and its surrounding areas.  You could do a property search and get a feel for the types of housing available in each area.  If you choose to get in touch with a property agent, explain your situation and ask what they recommend - they will be more than helpful in helping you decide.    Good luck!

sH4RU2GVaa	Usually only one and you might want to check with your flier to check for weight limit also.|`|eulMjLtPaa	It depends on the airline, but the standard is one bag plus one personal item such as a purse or laptop bag.  Your guitar would not count as a personal item.      Plus, they both must fit either in the overhead or under the seat.      And there is no weight limit for carry on, unless you are flying on a puddle jumper.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	The airlines all have similar restrictions.    Airlines restrict you to one carry-on item plus a small personal item, such as a purse or laptop bag. Carry-on items must fit in an overhead compartment or under a seat. A guitar won't fit in either, so you can pretty much forget about that. There is usually also a weight limit. Forty-four pounds seems common. If it is a regional jet or propeller aircraft, then there may be additional limits because of the size of the aircraft.    You can check the website for your airline to confirm this.|`|Wqjaz2cgaa	It short the answer's no.  The standard carry-on allowance is one bag plus one personal item (eg laptop).  So you'll have to check in your guitar.  And your carry-on bag shouldn't be more than about 14"x18"x8" in size (the exact size/weight restrictions will be on your airline's website).  Also never check-in a guitar in a soft case, because it's likely that it will suffer some damage in transit - definitely use a hard guitar case.  You can pick one of these up 2nd hand pretty cheaply.
Jm3vMKx3aa	First of all why are you generalizing?  Europe consist of 47 different countries with different requirements for issue of a student visa.  Second, if you have a pending criminal case in the US and are in India it can be assumed that you have left the US illegally.  Third, don't expect to set your foot in any European country.

AA10254694	I was born at Camp Zama.  My parent had a Japanese housekeeper for $16 per month.|`|pEOkDa1Kaa	I've not worked in army or something but this is just info:    ZAMA(Eng)  http://www.city.zama.kanagawa.jp/www/gen...    Zama is suburb and you can go to Shinjuku and Yokohama in 45 min. by train.  So you can enjoy going around Tokyo and Yokohama (there's China Town etc,) and also you can go opposite direction to go to hot springs area.    By the way, Japanese housekeeper costs a lot it is usually around $20 per hour.  If $16 per month was true, it is because the army paid most of the wage.

Jm3vMKx3aa	It depends on your citizenship what type of documentation you may use in lieu of a passport to travel form North Wales, UK to the Republic of Ireland:    You may use your driver's license if you are a citizen of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.    You may use your national Government issued ID card if your are a citizen of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.    All other citizens will need a passport (and a seperate visa unless visa-exempted).    If the destination should be Nothern Ireland all aliens would just need to hold the documentation which they have needed to enter the United Kingdom.    If the departure should be North Wales, Philadelphia, PA, USA, all travellers would need a passport and maybe a visa depending opon their citizenship.      Source(s):  http://www.klm.com/travel/ch_en/travel_i...|`|4uB0bbhnaa	depends whether it is Northern Ireland or Eire|`|QV6swGUMaa	should be ok with a driver licence.|`|78Xb7enMaa	You should check with the airline/ferry operator. Some will accept an official photo I.D instead of a passport.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Not at present, no. A photo card driving licence is fine.    In the future, there will be passport controls introduced, so you will need a passport to travel between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. But that hasn't been brought in yet.    You don't need a passport to go to Northern Ireland of course, as that is part of the UK.|`|jV99kgWbaa	No, you don't need a passport.    UK citizens do not need a passport.    You do however need ID to get onto a plane whether it is flying to Ireland or Scotland or even within England or anywhere else in the world.|`|Ggq0bjOgaa	No, we went to the Republic of Ireland without one but North Ireland is in UK anyway.|`|NGQ8GaI1aa	It depends on a number of things    1. How you are travelling.   If you are flying, airlines nolonger accept drivers license at the boarding gates. It must be a passport or EU travel card.    2. Your citizenship  If you are not flying then a UK or Irish citizen can travel with a drivers license.  If you are not a UK/Irish citizen then you need a passport or equivalent    3. Part of Ireland  If you are travelling to Northern Ireland then you are staying within the UK so no formal document is required.    There is also the loophole that you can travel freely to Northern Ireland as it is in the UK and literally walk across the border into the Republic of Ireland as there are no border controls anymore
818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Yes you may.  You will need a passport...see 1st site below for  all application info.  You will also need a letter of parental permission...see 2nd site and read section under "Entry Requirements...the paragraph on MINORS.  EDIT:  i don't know why some people think you need all kinds of other I.D. when you have a passport...NOTHING else is required if you have a passport...which you must have.  If you carry additional I.D. with you, keep it in a separate place from your passport.  That way, if your passport is lost, you have the other i.d. to use when you go to the embassy or consulate to replace your passport.  But, additional I.D. is NOT required.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	if you got a passport, drivers license and a plane ticket|`|3xJqb2HMaa	You can travel by yourself but you will need signed documents by your parent or guardian. Most of the time, you can get those by going to your local courthouse. You will need a passport to take with you, and a few other forms of ID. It would be smart to bring an additional picture ID with you, a drivers or a state issued, and something like a social security card or a birth certificate.

s2IOyj8iaa	The cheapest and most convenient way is by train. They run every half hour from the international airport directly to Robina. It is the Gold Coast air train. The cost is approx $30 / The shuttle buses are more expensive and take longer as they have to go around dropping people at homes and hotels . Your trip will take an hour and a half . which takes you through Brisbane the first half hour and on to robina.  A cab would cost a fortune and sometimes there are delays on the motorway which would end up taking you a lot longer than the train. Have a great trip. You will love the GoldCoast robina is nice about 15 minute drive from the beach. No need to book the train they don't take bookings there's always room just walk straight over to the station and buy your ticket there. They don't run through the night The first train in the morning maybe around 6 am|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	That's an easy one! The train goes right through the international terminal at the airport, go on the train for as far as you can until they tell you that you need to get of because the tracks stop at Robina. And from their you can either get them to pick you up or catch a bus.|`|qW4GVjROaa	Get the airport train to the city, then change trains and get one that goes to Robina, they leave about every 20 minutes|`|OYYYNCyCaa	if your flying in from the USA there is no way your plane will be able to land at the Gold Coast Airport.    there will be cabs to get you from Brisbane International Airport at Eagle Farm to Robina but the distance is around 85 - 90 klms and the cab fair would be very expensive    there is buses that will take you down the coast a lot cheaper     any chance you friends can come and get you at all

b8tgCAQJaa	On a cell phone, use the "plus" symbol, then the country code. The country code for the United Kingdom is 44.    So if your English friend has the number 07890 123 456, you need to use:    +44 7890 123 456 (note that the first zero is left off the number)    (This works for calls and txt)    On a land line telephone, it's a bit different. You will need to dial an international dialling code, followed by the country code and then the number (without the zero) as shown above. If you don't know the international dialling code, contact your phone company and they will tell you.|`|aiKLvwGTaa	To add to Rich B's answer, you can also use 0044 rather than +44    So the number would be 00447895123456 or equivalent|`|aqLLbzJQaa	It depends on where you are in the world - as you haven't said I can guess your in America so you need to dial 011 44 then the number but leave off the first zero.    so if the number you have is 07123456788,  then dial 011 44 7123456788      ...

EjhJliKmaa	english is commonly understood in urban centers and smaller towns all over the philippines.  filipino, a tagalog based language, is the national language and together with english is the medium of instruction.  cebuano(bisaya) is the most spoken first language in visayas and mindanao.  most filipinos are roman catholics but there are significant numbers of protestants and muslims.  filipinos are cheerful and thoughtful and easy to get along with.  always have a song ready as the karoake is an  important part of any get together. although not expected, bring a pasalubong(small gifts) as token of friendship.   instead of toilets ask for 'comfort rooms' or 'cr' for short.  always say 'salamat' for thank you.  'magandang umaga' for good morning  'magandang hapon' for good afternoon  'magandang gabi' for good evening  'ang pangalan ko ay_____' for my name is______.  "sori' for sorry|`|rVUvopaLaa	you said the Visayan region?  where about in the Visayas?    In case in Cebu or in Cebuano speaking areas try this;    Maayong buntag - good morning  maayong hapon - good afternoon  maayong gabii - good evening  maayong udto - good noon    there are other areas in the visayas speaks different dialects like the hiligaynon or popularly known as ilonggo, waray waray, boholano but these dialects have different variations on its own.  hence speaking tagalog the national language is the safest way to do where majority knows.      as answered ealier filipinos generally understands the English language you don't need to worry about however they are pretty familiar with the american english.    for customs and etiquette please be conscious about these;  whenever you eat something make sure to offer or share what you have to others like the person sitting next to you. i know this is kind of weird but to have to do this even if they don't look famish     always greet them as you'll be judge according to your courtesy.    be an ambassador of good will to all men.      as much as possible don't talk about yourself don't flaunt. maintain a low profile. don't make them feel that you came from a highly develop country.      dress up appropriately particularly if you're goin to met a lot older than you.  be considerate also of the environment you are goin e.g church, parties etc of course you know what to do.    as they say be a roman if you are in rome. just observe how they do things and from there you can work on how to make your way too.     be diplomatic which means be interested of what they do, eat etc etc.  filipinos love to show off even how weird or unorthodox it may appear just be interested about it.      they love giving gifts.  don't be offended to accept even if you don't actually need or like it.  just accept it and recycle it later when you get the chance.      in the same way they also expect gifts sometimes not exactly gifts but token.  not necessarily expensive but at least you gave something.  meaning you appreciate their hospitality.      they can be inquisitive don't be offended if they start asking questions sometimes even personal or will make you uncomfortable.  under no circumstance you can tell them "it's none of your business"  otherwise that will be the end of your visit. just be prepare on how to go about this.      this one is funny:  you can legitimately or fashionably be late.  that's totally acceptable being late in the Phils.  don't get upset if someone is like an hour late.  one hour late is considered on time.     finally you need to be a street smart particularly in dealing with a complete stranger meaning other than your host.      good luck!|`|t2YUn4FYaa	when u want to say thank you to an older person say salamat PO. if their younger just say sa-la-mat.   as a sign of respect to older people when greeting them take their hand and put it to ure forehead.

Do not forget to check your country's foreign travel advise & follow it.

But there are a lot of great answers there as well. If you have the time you can check to see as many previously related resolved qs here & read up on the answers as well.    I suggest that you also read up websites about how is life in the Philippines & I know we have a lot of expats, foreigners & Filipino spouses of foreigners living in the Philippines in this fourm that will surely help you out. For normally Filipinos are like that, helpful.    You can also send me any specific q regarding your inquiry & I will try answer as best as I can. Enjoy your stay.

Filipino's also point with their mouths by pursing their lips in the direction if interest.    I don't know much about Cebu but if you're going to Davao it would be good to learn Bisayan rather than Tagalog, however on that note most people will know both & also English as it is an official language in the Philippines.

Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!

Superpowers don't want intelligent people in satellite states, so they go for Islamist, because clever people would know that they are being used and put a stop to it.    Recep Tayyip Erdo?an was sanctioned by W.Bush BEFORE he was even elected. And he is the puppet that is used to turn a clever secular democratic Turkey into an Islamist satellite.

i7oHTo9haa	No. Jordan is in the Middle East they are just not extremistly crazy like some of the other Middle East nations (Syria, Iran.)    Why you trying to draw a parallel to people in Middle East only being peaceful as if they are in America? Middle East SHOULD be peaceful with the West that is the role model to be.  Jordan is not the only role model there are other Middle Eastern countries that are not crazy and just want to live in peace, Saudi Arabia, Egypt to name a couple.    We look at other places that shout death to Israel or America as the crazy ones. WE have our country and they have theirs and that's good we should all be peoples of the planet and friends.    If anyone has issue with being friends and respectful we defend whole mideast so don't even go there.

km9cQNAXaa	Why not simply borrow the latest edition from your local public library and return it after your trip<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|eulMjLtPaa	2006 will give you good general information.  For the updated one, I recommend Frommer's:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frommers-York-City-2009-Complete/dp/0470285621" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Frommers-York-City...</a><br>  <br>  Handy hint:  Don't read it on the street.|`|MFcbRot8aa	You can take the map out on the street. If you need help or directions don't be afraid to ask. We love to show off our city to tourists.<br>  Some general hints to getting around town.<br>  even numbered streets go east, odd numbered are west bound<br>  even numbered ave are north, odd numbered ave are south bound. For street addresses 5th ave divides east from west ie: if you are looking for  25 E. 57 st it will be on the north side of 57 st between 5th and Madison.<br>  The subway or walking is the fastest way to get around town. it is no fun sitting in a cab in traffic watching the meter change. Get a metro card an all day pass for unlimited rides on the buses and subway is  around $7.50<br>  Please do not stand in the middle of the sidewalk, sidewalks are our free ways you are likely to be run over by a pedestrian.<br>  Most important tip!!!  Wear your most comfortable shoes!!!!<br>  Enjoy your visit|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	your 2006 edition should be just fine.<br>  <br>  when you get here, just check out the local magazines like<br>  <br>  TimeOut New York<br>  The New Yorker<br>  New York Magazine<br>  The Village Voice<br>  <br>  and the daily New York Times to look for stuff to do around town...

ou6JBxNLaa	for a start Dubai is the capital of the united arab emirates, start there and watch out for the laws they are really really strict so don't get in any trouble otherwise they will either lock you up or deport you, you can get arrested for swearing so watch you language ! ha ha|`|MGHTJx0Waa	Its really wild you can do almost anything, no shagging on the beach!!  don't think your at home respect the religion. Hotels are fantastic. yes you can go on the beach in your bikini. I am sure you can get cheap hotels but visit the good ones there fantastic.   Cheap hotels are on sites listed below
a6JZjRG1aa	Does anybody know how to arrange this kind of a service?  + yes, there are such people, pretty many i would say but not too many...    Any idea on how much it would cost?  + should negotiate with each possible employee in person, i can only give you general guidelines...    Both for the fee to the translator and my own expenses  +well, it's about 100-700 per day for translation... 700 charge those who "know the places" but there is a chance they may doublecross you and that's for short visits usually... 100 may charge someone with a car and English knowledge... however those people may not know special financial or business terms... or have no experience...    I'd like to stay in 2 star hotels (something like a Super 8 or a Days Inn---clean and safe, but not fancy)  + well, stars are relative here... somebody says "foreigners can't stay in 2 star hotels for safety reasons"... well, that depends on how good your guide is in "connecting people"... generally yes, it's about 400 yuan per night average... but you can take one room with your guide, to keep an eye on him and to lower the expenses...    I can leave out of Beijing or Shanghai. We'll probably cover about 2000 miles by the time its done.  + visit those cities web-sites, there are many "helpers" there... email, phone call and you will know the conditions and the language level...    Is there a surcharge because of the travel or a discount because I'm getting a week or two at a time?  + talking about discount you are unconsciously putting yourself into "lower service" position... you will get exactly what you pay for... sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the person...    How much do you charge?  +Click on his nickname to see if you can send him an email... whoever it is he won't discuss prices and services on public...    If I make this trip, it will probably be in Apr or May.  + don't travel in May because it will be "the golden week" and you won't find the people you want to meet... Apr is better...|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	can't stay in 2* hotels? never heard of that.

The cost of the translator depends on the quality of the translator. It's from 100-500RMB.    2. Foreigners can't stay in 2 star hotels. The government doesn't allow that for safety purpose. You have to stay in 3 star or above. It's not that much. Around 200-500RMB depends on the size of the city.    3. I am in China and I have a Car. I have been a translator for 5 years. Let's discuss to see what I can do for you.|`|AbHCvJjraa	RMB 250-300 a day,that's about 40USD per day, is a common price. But if you ask for a very professional, 1000RMB is also possible.  I'm in Guangzhou|`|AA10843420	Translator: RMB 300 for an average service, 600 for professional service (knowing the investment and financial terms)    Car: RMB 500 daily in Beijing, might be 200 in other towns    Accommodation: Yes, you can stay at Super 8 (RMB 260) or Days Inn (RMB 300-350), even local chain hotel Homeinn (RMB 220).    Try to avoid May 1 Holiday (Golden week tourist) which will last three days this year.    If you make this trip a package, you could get a discount.

05fd5181d7362a6331c4066aec75df3eaa	If you only have 3 weeks to do this trip, you will be driving nearly 8 hours a day every day in order to get there and back, you will never have enough time to see all the places that you have listed already.  My suggestion would be to go to Chicago first.  There are many things there to see and its a good crossroads.  From there, your next stop should probably be Minnesota...Lots of Lakes and plenty of places to stop and do things.  Mall of America is in Bloomington, which is a suburb of Minneapolis.  From there, head up to the badlands and yellowstone and such, but dont waste too much time.  There isn't as much to see in those states as you might think.  You will get bored quickly.  I'd hump it to seattle from there.  Spend a week or so in Seattle and surrounding areas then spend the last week getting home, maybe making one stop or so on the way home.  I would leave seattle and head towards the center of the country.  I-70 in Denver will bring you all the way back to PA.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Hey, I've driven from California to Alaska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Maine, and Florida (with my dad and younger brother). So I think I've been through pretty much everything you are going to go through. Definitely go to Chicago. Here is a list off the top of my head:    Madeline Island (WI), Lincoln Museum (IL), Indy 500 Racetrack (IN), Mall of America (MN), Crazy Horse (SD), Black Hills (SD), a potato factory (ID), Jewel Cave (SD), St. Louis Arch (MO, if you go down that far), Columbus (OH), Hershey Factory (PA, if you haven't already been there), Pompey's Pillar (MT, kinda a joke though), Jackson (WY)
4wTdQ01jaa	RIDES!!! There's a show (well it might not be there anymore) based on that pirate movie called WaterWorld, a Jurassic park ride in the water, I think there is a JAWS ride, they have tours of the studios, concerts, (I saw Hannah Montana & the Jonas Brothers :D) Restaurants, Arcade games, and lots more! And yes, they are open in march.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The studio tour is very good.  There's War of The Worlds and Desparate Housewives, to name a couple good things on the tour.  The rides Jurasic Park and and Revenge of the Mummy are great fun.  Jurasic Park has an 80 ft raft plunge.  Revenge of the Mummy is a scary and thrilling roller coaster ride.  The Universal City Walk has many restaurants, theatres, concerts, and other entertainment.  As for the restaurants, they have the Hard Rock Cafe, Bubble Gump Shrimp, and Tony Roma's, which are my favorites.  Lots of fast food places, too.  Univeral Studios is a great place to visit.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	There are 3 different areas and activites you can enjoy at Universal Studios. There is the theme park where you can enjoy rides like Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park - The Ride,  the Terminator 2 3D or The Simpsons Ride.     The other activity you will enjoy is the Universal Studios tour which is a tour of the back lot and they will show you how movies are made.    The third area is the Universal City Walk. There you will find over 30 Unique shops, great places to eat, 6 cool clubs including the House of Blues and 19 theatres. Here is more information  http://www.socalthemeparks.com/universal...

In America you are NOT allowed to touch other ppl, here ppl just touch you, brush next to you....etc...|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Well I am neither a Saudi nor living there but I know that Middle Easterners are generally warmer & more hospitable people when compared to "Westerners". They are considered a very high context culture..meaning that the message people are trying to convey often relies heavily on other communicative cues such as body language & eye-contact rather than direct words. In this respect, the "personal space" is merely relative when compared to other cultures.   Non-verbal aspects of communication are vital & so are the unspoken words.:-)|`|AA12350023	actually I think I feel the opposite.. When I chat with a Saudi, they dont get up and close, they do sit offish.. well I dont mean far away, but a persons space between us.. I do love chatting with people, so im not an unsocial person, but I dont get that vibe when chatting.. Maybe cause im not really bothered anyways.. I love people around me chatting..

OxwWclcmaa	Well I'm a student at the college in Galway and although I find it a great place to study and live I think I'd choose Florence.                  Galway is a beautiful place to visit and from historic, cultural and educational points of view it would certainly be a good option for your friend's semester abroad. There are lots of places to visit although the weather can be horrific!                On the other hand I've spent time in Florence and always plan to go back. It's such an awe inspiring place with it's art and architecture. Seeing as the culture is quite different and with the opportunity to learn a new language I think Italy would be the more exciting choice|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Kind of a strange combination!  I would probably pick Galway, because it's a place I've always wanted to go to, and I've been to Florence.    Wow!  couldn't pick two more DIFFERENT locations in the world!  I think...    Not having been to Galway, and not being sure what kind of society they have fore students, I can tell you that Florence is really cool!  I knew people who studied there, and they loved it!!!!  But I'm sure you'll find plenty of people who will say the same of Galway...I think it's a much quieter, more primal place.  I also imagine it's very isolated...far from the rest of Europe, and, unless there's a good-sized airport, possibly difficult to travel from, if that's a priority, but since everyone flies these days, a decent airport is much better than an isolated train station.  A lot depends on what your friend wants to get out of it...|`|X7fJjXFuaa	go to florence. you won't regret it. it's the birthplace of the renaissance. there are tons of museums and art and it's beautiful and interesting and you really should not miss out on it.|`|8LXMdnbCaa	i'm from italy, i must say florence. i really like ireland, i'm writing on it, but before going there, you have to visit florence, you will understand...|`|uv3JDruHaa	pshhh, Florence|`|PiGqg0EMaa	FLORENCE|`|826IxsmMaa	Well, they are both beautiful places artistically with the landscapes and art   Florence: it's verrrry hot! but the architecture and art is absolutely beautiful, so if you're looking for a museum/gallery holiday.. go there definitely    Galway: Depending on where you go, it's quite quiet and relaxing but still gorgeous. There are loads of irish "landmarks" in galway which you could visit.. but its more peaceful than action-packed    i'd choose florence personally|`|A2RR611caa	I've never been to Galway, but Florence is THE place to go. The scenery is beautiful and there is so much to see there. It's clean too. But everything there is more expensive than it is here... :]|`|rftGDlRgaa	Is she from Fairfield University?    I went there, and Florence and Galway are the top two programs.    Go to Florence.  It's a gorgeous city and it's also very easy to travel to other destinations in Europe.  It's not as easy to do that in Galway.  The kids I knew from Galway didn't have required attendance, so they would often take weeks off at a time to travel.
818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	No the rules are not going to be delayed or abandoned.  There has been plenty of notice time given.

Gq0t3ERIaa	There are a lot of water parks in Orlando, including two that are on Disney property. Sea World has one, but I've never been there...yet. Right next to Sea World is Discovery Cove. You can swim with Dolphins there!  There are also a lot of miniature golf places. Disney has two.  In Downtown Disney (West side) there's Disney Quest. That's an indoor Virtual amusement park.  You can go out to Cocoa Beach. That's about an hour away. Of course, maybe it doesn't take that long. My husband got lost!  NASA is out there too.  Clearwater Beach is on the Gulf side and it's farther. It takes about 90 minutes, could be longer if you hit a lot of traffic in Tampa.  There's so much more... Maybe get a vacation book on Orlando.|`|AA10855383	Oh my goooood you will have sooooo  much fun there is so much to do.    Sea world water park  Diensy Blizzard beach (water park)  And Wet N Wild    The theme parks    Yoi can go to daytona beach or st pete beach..... or cocoa beach    And Clubs!!! Downtown disney.. there is one called Dollhouse and they have a rotating dance flooor it is soooo cool and then BET Soundstage club, and u can buy a party pass and get into all the clubs at 1 price. Same for City Walk but i think u gotta be 21.    Oh!! Club Firestone, they have latin night on fridays!! They play NOTHNIG but Reggaeton too i luuuuuuv it. And they have dancers on stage And Another latin club called Club cocos  Club Destiny, Blue martini    you are going to have a blast.    Malls: Go to Florida Mall, and I also like Fashion Square Mall, and then they got boutique stores off the street, so if u need clubbing clothes they have loots of stuff. There is a place on Colonial drive (like you going to UCF) called New York Shoes, they are hurting because of the economy so they have alot of stuff on sale, dresses skirts, shorts, shoes, etc i recommend u to check it out they have looots of stuff, like brazilian jeans and cute items|`|8RZcg7Ltaa	Head up on Club Firestone - while an excellent club it is also the most dangerous club in Orlando.     Someone was shot there just Sunday night, people have been followed and it is not a safe place for someone just looking for a fun night out.    Other ideas  Van's Skate park - North IDrive  SkyVenture - Indoor Sky Diving  Aiguille Indoor rock climbing - (35 minutes north of Disney)  The beach is great|`|AR8kgyTIaa	If you cant get far try to go to Downtown Disney.  There are some clubs like Bongo's and others which tend to be fun.|`|5ONFjMLHaa	If you want to stay away from the whole disney vibe period, go to downtown.  I know a lot of places down there (like rock bars and stuff) are 18+ and do a lot of fun things.  There are also clubs in downtown and a lot of other fun stuff to do.      Rock clubs:  club firestone  backbooth (personal fav)  the Social    Other clubs:  Tabu  roxy  makos  the dragon room  parliament house (you can go and catch a drag show)

LDEynZrcaa	Once, twice every year. I am in the precious stones trading.    The friendliness and hospitality of the Russians is unmatched by any other nation.  And you should see the parties. You didn't party yet, if you didn't party in Russia.    The other places I go are Alaska, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Colombia.    Alaskans are cold, simple and boring.  Sri Lankans are to pushy.  South Africa? better not to say it.  Colombian are nice and friendly, but fraudulent and dangerous sometimes.    My best and friendliest trading partners were, are and will be - always the Russian people.|`|z4Yrn96Paa	Russian people can be very nice.  I have adjusted well to Russia and am very comfortable with the people.  The culture is different, more Eastern, but that makes it interesting and unique.  Russia has given the world some of the finest writers, artists, poets and musicians.     Here is the blog of a young Western student who is having a blast studying in Russia http://nothingbutperfection.blogspot.com...|`|WT7Gub0Xaa	I have been to Moscow and found it to be superb, just expensive.

Not sure about the rest of Russia ( its a big place ) but i would recommend going to Moscow in the summer, but not the winter.|`|bwa9hhSpaa	Its meant to be a nice place for views but the people are meant to be really rude.   Most russians i've met have been mega rude so i guess if you dont talk to them its a nice place|`|Vv465eJMaa	The people are autocratic and intolerant.Racism is prevalent.No room for alternative view points.  The mafia control most accomodation and so you will get ripped off as a tourist.  Poverty is extreme for many including the old.Drug taking and dealing is rife.  The police are no different to the mafia,they are brutal and corrupt.  Moscow has the greatest poverty,beggars abound,but that city has the world's largest amount of billionaires.  People disappear in Russia,and democracy takes a backseat to money and agression.|`|P2UHQQehaa	yes, I have lived there. It's a beautiful country, full of rich history, wonderful customs, AMAZING food (pelemeni, blini, bapka, etc.), VERY hospitable people, and gorgeous sights. On a negative side, it's very EXPENSIVE to live there. but overall, a great place to visit!|`|7d48e6abd580c57363e61e29019f56b3aa	I have lived and worked in Russia and several of the former Russian republics over a period of 15 years and I have found the people, not only to be friendly but extremely generous and hospitable.  Its difficult to describe Russia in a few words because its such a vast country.  There are mountains, forests, deserts, cities and tiny villages - take your pick|`|Q9BNAK7waa	London nw3 is a complete idiot, his brain must be stuck in his *** from birth, Russian people are nice and its a great place with a unique culture.|`|t7pDjDo1aa	Whether it is a nice place or not depends on what is your conception of niceness. If you are looking for a tourist paradise, if your idea of tourism is just consumption then Russia is not the best place to go to.   Russian psychology is very much different from the Western one, although appearance of the ethnic Russians hardly different from general European standards.  It might confuse an inexperienced visitor.  Firstly, it is deeply embedded in our culture that if a person keeps smiling without a reason he is an imbecile. No one wants to look like an imbecile, do they? That is why so-called rudeness is profound misunderstanding of the elementary basics of the Russian culture. Secondly, it is true we dont care a lot about political correctness that, I understand, could be insulting especially if you accustomed to that system of small white lies. Again, sincerity can be rude or is it? Anyway, it is compensated by inner generosity and peoples warmth once you get them to know. Thirdly, our history taught us to take any laws with a pinch of salt, lets put it this way. It means that we are flexible and open for negotiations in any kind of situation, if you understand what I mean :). So, if you are ready for something absolutely different, if you are ready for adventures  welcome to Russia!|`|458UdQNvaa	I've been to Moscow and St. Petersburg twice. I love it there and I'm going back this summer. The people are just like in any other big bustling cities you will go to. I love the atmosphere and the rich history that you find around every corner. I've never been ripped off. I've never seen anyone get stabbed by the mafia or whatever. The weather in July is perfect. There are so many things to do and see. I would highly recommend it to anyone (except maybe handicapped people because it involves a ton of walking as would any huge european city would).  just my opinion.
xUDPwUdIaa	Tel-Aviv is the best if you are non-relligious.  Great city with just about everything you could possibly want.  Only problem is it is expensive.  Rishon Le'tzion is nice too. its got everything but its a little quieter plus its not a far drive from Tel-Aviv.   You need to contact Nefesh B'Nefesh or the Jewish agency for Israel, as they handle people making Aliyah.  They will also be able to tell you if you are eligible for the "Law of Return" and answer any questions you could possibly have.|`|8AzKTFwoaa	Tel Aviv if you're young. Check out Eilat or Tiberias.|`|YfUuV87kaa	Jerusalem|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	I also prefer Tel aviv, its a city that never sleeps, its very vibrant.There are more job opportunities in Tel aviv.Transportation is more efficient from Tel aviv.  Jerusalem is more suitable if you are religious.Its a bit cheaper then Tel Aviv.  You have to go to the Israeli consulate , zionist federation and find out your rights and status.    Good luck!!!
9xoYJFEdaa	Depending on your budget.    Seven Hills is not a greatly affluent area of Sydney so it is best to plan to commute to work.    Parramatta as suggested by some others is OK but it is med/high density and not a quality area.    There is some lovely suburbs around the hills District (Castle HIll / Pennant HIlls/ North Rocks) that are all close to a highway M2 (20min drive to Seven Hills) and you would be half way between Seven Hills and Sydney City.    I hope you enjoy Sydney when you get here|`|sZFA4XXZaa	You're better off sticking to the West then. The best place is around the Parramatta area. There are many shops and restaurants and is home to one of Australia's largest shopping centres, Westfield Parramatta.

Parramatta used to be a bit of a rough area (30 years ago) but now it has improved a lot. Parramatta has heaps of shops, restaurants and facilities and you can get to city by ferry.

2BEMSGPdaa	In Manhattan as a rule the streets run east to west. the east numbers  like 05 east 42nd are east of 5th ave  And the west   are west of  5th ave. The avenues run north to south and with 12 th ave on the West at the Hudson river then 1st ave on the east  at the Harlem river. The numbered streets like 1st street start down in the village. And 180 street is up by the GB Bridge. That is a general guide. There are some other avenues like Lexington and Park on the east side.  You can get maps that show all the streets and some of the numbers on those streets. When you go to Queens county you are on your own. There are streets there that stop and start at will.|`|iN27E3WCaa	You can look at addresses to see which way you're going.  If you're on the east side and you see the addresses getting smaller, you're walking towards 5th Avenue.  If they're getting larger, you're walking towards 1st Avenue.  The same goes for the west side - if the addresses are getting smaller, you're walking towards 5th, and if they're getting larger you're going towards 11th.

0ade3e7cd57068acc68ab5f9a56565e1aa	You can absolutely talk with people from American to Japan.    I use Skype to talk to my family, which I strongly recommend.  You can use any messenger program that's on the internet, too.    A cell phone will be very expensive, as will calling from a typical phone.  If you want to call to a landline in Japan, you can try calling from an internet phone in the U.S. to Japan.    Of course, if the person in Japan has access to an internet phone, it will be even cheaper to call to the U.S. (because the cost is based on the country you call to...not the distance between them.)|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Are you really American?

The only jobs for English people there are really the travel Reps, like the Thomas Cook ones... so you could try checking their website.    If you're wanting to work abroad you're probably better off trying for somewhere like Spain (Magalluf in Majorca, especially) where a lot of English people work, and the best way to get a job there is to go there and ask around the bars/restaurants/hotels.|`|7vD4dBK4aa	im sorry my friend but the crises ihit turkey to (if not as hard as other countrys) well becasuse you are foreign you may want to look in to the toirism  industry (because of your english)|`|rFseGB3Taa	you can easily find jobs with your english.  you can't be rich with the job but enought to spend the summer in turkey.  carpet shops, jewellery and leather stores and some of the hotels are looking for english speakers all the time.  you may not need any work visa if you are looking for summer job but legally you need to get working permit.|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	find bar work

Pr3QIlweaa	(First answer!  Wahoo!!)<br>  <br>  You'll find that the trip from Indiana, through Windsor, to Montreal, is pretty straightforward.  (I used to drive from Toronto to Chicago pretty often.)<br>  <br>  There are loads of chain hotels that are reasonably-priced, such as Days Inn, Comfort Inn, etc.  Of course, you'll pass a number of independent hotels/motels, too.  The fewer amenities, the lower the cost, generally.<br>  <br>  Once you get across the border at Detroit, you'll be in Windsor.  (Make sure you have proper i.d., vehicle registration, insurance, etc.)  There is a casino in Windsor.<br>  <br>  We use Canadian dollars (of course), and the exchange rate is pretty good for you right now.  So your dollars will go farther than at home.  (Although everything is probably more expensive here, than in Indiana.)<br>  <br>  Measurements are mostly in metric, so you'll be travelling in kilometres per hour.  (I'm old enough to remember when American-made cars only had mph.  But now I believe they all have both, so you should be fine.  Basically, 100km/h is about 60mph.)<br>  <br>  You'll likely take hwy 401 east through Ontario, on your way to Montreal.  That is a "400 series" highway, thus it is multi-lane, with a max. speed of 100km/h, and generally safer than smaller highways.<br>  <br>  The drinking age in Ontario is 19.  <br>  <br>  You'll pass some smaller cities, such as London, Kitchener, & Guelph, on your way to Toronto.<br>  <br>  Toronto is, of course, the largest city in Canada, and the 5th largest city in North America (behind #1 Mexico City, #2 New York, #3 Los Angeles, & #4 Chicago).  Too many things to see and do in Toronto to list here.  College kids can find their own fun, easy enough.<br>  <br>  Leaving Toronto, or just going by, you'll likely stay on hwy 401, on your way to Ottawa, and then on to Montreal, in Quebec.  <br>  <br>  Ottawa is Canada's capital city, and where Obama recently visited.  You do have to leave hwy 401, and drive north a bit, to get to it, though.<br>  <br>  The route to Montreal is pretty easy to follow from that point.  The 401 basically becomes the highway that goes essentially directly to Montreal.  <br>  <br>  Driving straight through, it takes about 4 hours from Windsor to Toronto, and about another 4 hours or so to Ottawa.  It's another 1.5 to 2 hours or so from Ottawa to Montreal.

zBWefnYHaa	With the 5 out of 10 pass you can indeed travel on 5 days, all day as long as you do not run out of trains.<br>  It is even better than that. Once you have started your pass you can also take overnight trains that start the evening before that day.<br>  Conditions do apply, but mostly, if your train leaves after 7 pm you can use your pass for it.<br>  See the FAQ, first link. It is down in the second or third part, but read all questions that seem interesting, a lot of information there.<br>  <br>  For the combination of towns, I think that is very ambitious, but if you want to be on the train from 7 pm till the following day midnight, you can cover a lot of distance.<br>  <br>  Generally Greece, and so Athens, is very long distance from every other town/country you are likely to visit.<br>  It either takes a ferry from Italy or a long rail travel through the Balkan countries, both taking more than a day. And you have only 10 days total.<br>  I put a link to the German rail planner, (in English) in sources too.<br>  I tried Berlin to Athens, that is 42to 48 hours, and would take 3 days on your pass. Add a sidestep to Florence, and you have run out of pass time.<br>  The ferry from Italy would not cost pass time and from Athens you could take a plane back home, that way it might be just possible, but it is a lot of travel and very little time to sightsee.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's not possible to visit all three places on 10 days.

eulMjLtPaa	You don't know how the chlorine and sun will change the highlights.  I'd wait until after you return.  <br>  <br>  If you must do it before, wear a hat and use a hair cream before you swim, then rinse it out thoroughly after swimming.|`|7toznquyaa	Not a good idea.  The sun, sea water and chlorine will reak havoc on your hair. <br>  <br>  Wear a hat, or use a sun protection product.. and wait til you get back to do the highlights.

eD7qRBKHaa	Sea World will only take you a day.  So your other main options are Universal Studios (two parks) and Disney World (four parks).  You can book packages with either one of these and stay on-site.  Since you are just starting out, I would recommend buying an Orlando guidebook.  If you are planning to go to Disney, you probably need a guidebook for it - I recommend Birnbaum's.<br>  <br>  Also, I highly recommend this website: <a href="http://www.allearsnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allearsnet.com</a><br>  It is for Disney but has info on the others.  It is excellent to help you start your planning!|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	yes you can book tickets with packages check the Walt Disney World website for more information!<br>  Plan as you feel what you want to do. Research into all the parks, and places and see which ones you want to do with you time!<br>  I suggest you visit: Magic Kingdom, its a great classical park! SeaWorld, so you can see some sea life animals, its very cool. And Epcot if your alittle older and want to see all around the world<br>  Again, it all depends in what interests in you!<br>  Have fun!|`|tv0xUCoGaa	Hi Friend,<br>  <br>  It is good time for visit to Orlado. In Orlando, Disney theme park, American Waterfront,  Arabian Nights Dinner Show, Disney Beauty and The Beast, Blizzard Beach all are more enjoying places.<br>  <br>  For more information about Orlando Disney theme park you can visit our website.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|M7qU5MdOaa	Do seaworld, Magic and either Epcot or Aquatica.  I personally would recommend aquatica.  It's more relaxing.  Magic Kingdom will be the most tiring and will have to deal with big crowds.  Seaworld is easy...will be albe to see everything in one day.  After that, you should be very tired so go relax at the waterpark Aquatica.  The fourth day go to Downtown Disney and do all your shopping, relax and go for a nice dinner.  Remember don't try to do too much with just four days...you'll get exhausted and not be able to enjoy yourself.  You need at least 10 days to see all the big parks in Orlando.  So, don't get greedy and try to cram everything in four days...you'll be wasting your money and not be able to enjoy yourself.  Keep in mind you're there for a vacation...have a good time.|`|XurzYq7raa	I used to work for one of the Seaworld parks and I've lived in Central FL my whole life, so, here's a native's perspective. There is so much to do and it is easy to get overwhelmed. Seaworld can be a very educational and low key day compared to going to Disney. Plan to pay for parking at all of the theme parks (around $10 or more, depending). It will be hot and sunny, and it usually rains in the afternoon during summer. Pack sunscreen, a small umbrella or poncho, comfortable shoes and light clothes. You can book tickets online and it's a better deal if you book for group rates. Check the websites for 2 Day (or more) passes that may allow you to use them at different parks. To save some money at the parks, bring a backpack with a big bottle of water and some snacks. If someone tries to tell you that you can't bring it in, say it's for health reasons. You can refill at water fountains throughout the day. If you go to Universal or Islands of Adventure and you don't mind carrying it , buy the souvenir drink bottles and/or popcorn buckets. The refills are CHEAP! Be sure to get a park hopper ticket if you go to Disney World. Since you're only going to be there for 4 days you can run like a mad person and hit all of the parks. Keep a look out for fast passes, too, so you won't spend as much time waiting in line. If you want to go shopping while you're there, hit the outlet malls! Prime Outlets are my personal favorite and they're not far from Universal, Wet'n'Wild, and International Drive.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you to have an awesome trip!

fPbjSNEHaa	At the moment with the recession there are less vacancies and more people looking for work. It has become very competitive in some fields and unless you have the exact skills employers are looking for you will find it tough. Finding good recruiters is also tough as well. You really need to broaden your options, look at jobs outside of London too.|`|HjtdSH7Taa	yh most ppl r nt hiring now and mainly 2 non-british ppl...due 2 da reccession nd a whole load ov uva fingz...lol<br>  around 3months 2 a year or longa
Y47WgY4Laa	There are plenty of IT jobs available in London, but competition is high. You would be up against a lot of highly qualified, experienced people so your success will depend on your CV, past jobs, etc.<br>  <br>  Have a look on sites like www.monsters.co.uk to get an idea of what is available, or if there is a company you would particularly like to work for then check out the Careers page on their website.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
v2Pab3pgaa	Its cold as hell here with absolutely nothing to do!! Stay home!|`|08haRGQxaa	It's kind of cold out here. And besides sports, there's not as much to do as you would think.|`|rqb9WOFIaa	It's really cold and you better wear a down jacket. You can ice-skate at the Millennium Park.
1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	There are several LDS church historical museums in the area, and the restored hotel (forget the name), is awesome - there is usually a LDS movie playing there.  It's free and very good.  And of course, temple square itself is always very interesting.  You could also get a tour of the conference center.  It's a very neat building.  And of course, there are some very nice shopping malls nearby...
