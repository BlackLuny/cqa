I would get a camera that uses AA batteries then use rechargable NiMh batteries. That way, if your camera goes dead during an important time (like your trip to Paris...) you can always buy AA batteries (available anywhere) to use until you get your re-chargables recharged. If you use a camera with a special re-chargable battery, you are out of luck.  I shoot a Canon powershot series camera for just that reason. If you use regular alkaline batteries they will get used up really quick, but NiMh batteries last about 4 times as long.  Plus the batteries can be used in other things as well.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	Have you actually tried using Rechargeable batteries (AA)? Each one says NiMH on it.

RpCwfcRzaa	Most colleges block Xbox Live and the PSN because the pull down the service for everyone else. Make sure your college doesn't have a rule somewhere about not using these services (which they almost always do). They want you to focus on your studies- not Xbox Live. If you try to they will find out and you could put your school career in jeopardy for trying to get past it. It's not worth messing up your future for.|`|sbuaUe4maa	if you have the ethernet cable going to the xbox, and your laptop, why do you have a wireless router?  if you got a router, that had, the input, and then 2 or more output's on it you could set up the net work that you are talking about, but other than that, you dont even need your wireless router, that was just a waste of money in my eyes, you dont even use it.  unless you dont have your laptop hooked up and are usingg the wireless network.  then it's good.
RpCwfcRzaa	It comes with the headset, wireless controller, Ethernet cable for Live, a 60 GB hard drive in the new ones, standard/HD cables, and of course the console and power brick.    The headset is wired. A power brick is what the 360 plugs into and the other end plugs into your outlet. It powers the console.    lol, you keep adding to your question.   1.) 60 GB is more than enough room. I have the older one that has a 20 GB hard drive and after 3 years and tons of games, I still have space on it.   2.) -It means that the audio/ visual cables come with standard and HD plugs for your TV so you can still plug it in with the red, yellow, white set for regular TVs or the blue, green, red set if you have an HD TV.  - This only applies if you have a HD set. If not, you don't need to use it.|`|Rgqhr3zRaa	power brick is just what you plug into the wall     head set is wired     60gb is great i bought the older model (20gb) and it works fine (1-2gb for demos less than 1gb for videos and if you want to download a game to your hard drive which lets you decrease load times and makes the game load faster 5-6gb)    a wireless controller     dont worry about the HDMI stuff unless you have a HD tv    also keep you xbox 360 on its side cuz it will scratch you disk in time standing up and keep it well ventilated
R8yKGv18aa	I have Rock Band and my nephew has Guitar Hero. Nothing was broken out of either box and there are almost identical. I'd pick the cheaper one if I were you.|`|eE31DEFiaa	1. for guitar hero if you use the guitars each will need a wii mote   2. you can download free song and some that cost money on Guitar Hero  3.  4.  5. around $200 usd for Guitar Hero WT(one guitar,drums,mic,game)  6.I haven't tried rock band I didn't like Guitar Hero WT the music wasn't very good to me... but everything else graphics gameplay was fun  7. the guitar was cheaply made the 1 from Guitar Hero WT and Guitar Hero3|`|jALife8Faa	1. How many Wii remotes do you need to play Rock Band and Guitar Hero?-   Each guitar requires it's own remote for World Tour- and the microphone requires it's own remote.- Should have 4 remotes for everything.  Rock Band only requires 1 remote- for the mic.    2. Can you download free songs?  Yes- ON Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour- None of the older versions of either of them allow DLC.     3. Since we have a small tv, which is better if you are singing and you need to see the lyrics?  They are both the same- the songs scroll at the top of the screen- No difference except the way the notes look    4. Which game has better graphics?  They both have the same graphics.     5.How much to buy the whole band set?  Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour band sets both cost 189.99.  If your looking for the cheaper band set- Rock Band 1 is only 99.99.  However- you will not be able to download any songs.    6. Which do you like better and why?  I like Guitar Hero World Tour.  It has some of the same songs as Rock Band 2 and some better ones (IMO).  However- the biggest reason for getting the World Tour band kit is that the instruments are compatible wiht Rock Band 2.  This is the only way you can intermingle the instruments- Which means you only need to have one set of instruments (World Tour) and you can play Rock Band 2 with them- Saving you space and money- and you still have both games to play ;)    7. If you have bought either game have you had any trouble with the instruments (anything broken before or after you took it out of the box)?  I have had no trouble from any Rock Band 1 instruments- - I haven't bought RB2 yet.  I have World Tour- no problems yet- But some have had problems wiht the drums- hopefully the new sets will have the glitches fixed.|`|of4Ieho2aa	ok  this is for rock band2    i have it the (special Edition) one   1.1 for rock band just for the microphone   2.yeah on rock band  3.well the more people that play the more smaller the lyrics get  4.rock bnad  5.$189.99 (special edtion) i have it   6.rock band cause you get into it ,,you get in the mood like if you were a real rockstar ///you go wild(i do)  7.nope so far so good  great Instruments                          .....my experience i love this game i still play it  .,//guitar hero world tour is like one thing only the tour but on rock band 2 you can go on tour too and is fun all people can play it-=-

It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...

Canon EOS Rebel XS Digital Camera incorporates a number of high-end functions and technology found in Canon's professional SLR models, including an improved autofocus sensor, and an advanced Live View function. Plus the proprietary DIGIC III image processor ensures that the fine details and natural colors of the images are optimally recorded, and also manages the camera's efficient energy consumption and high-speed signal processing performance.     The 10.5 megapixel APS-C size CMOS sensor employs large microlenses over each pixel to reduce noise and enhance sensitivity up to ISO 1600. The camera also incorporates the Highlight Tone Priority and High-ISO Noise Reduction functions (previously found only on Canon's Professional Digital SLRs) and the camera is equipped with Canon's Auto Lighting Optimizer technology, which corrects image brightness and contrast automatically to prevent underexposure with backlit scenes.     The EOS Rebel XS is capable of continuously capturing 3 frames per second for bursts of over 500 images, or untill the memory card is full, to help photo enthusiasts capture split second action at just the right moment. Plus, the camera is equipped with a host of useful creative controls, including shutter speeds ranging from 1/4000 - 30 seconds plus Bulb, and wide range of exposure modes from fully automatic to fully manual.     The 2.5-inch, high-resolution LCD monitor makes it easy for users to review images and scroll through the menus, and also features a broadened color gamut and a wide viewing perspective in all directions. Furthermore the EOS Rebel XS camera features Live View - which allows users to frame shots through the LCD screen rather than the viewfinder - this is particularly useful when shooting at odd angles or in situations when looking through the viewfinder is impractical.     The Rebel XS DSLR utilizes Canon's EOS Integrated Cleaning system. This involves a Self-Cleaning Sensor Unit that shakes dust particles off of the low-pass filter in front of the sensor, along with post processing with the supplied Digital Photo Professional software. Here the camera maps any spots that may remain on the sensor and subsequently subtracting dust spots from the final image during post processing.     The camera utilizes Secure Digital (SD & SDHC) memory cards, making it the perfect upgrade for users who are already using SD cards with a point-and-shoot camera, and it is fully compatible with all Canon EF and EF-S lenses, as well as EX-series Speedlites, an optional Battery Grip, and remote control and viewfinder accessories. In regards to its overall design, the EOS Rebel XS camera features a substantial yet streamlined profile, with curved edges, contoured surfaces, conveniently placed controls and comfortably constructed rubber grip and thumb rest that all contribute to fatigue-reducing hand fit. The camera body is constructed of a rugged yet lightweight combination of stainless steel and polycarbonate embedded with glass fiber, and the chassis exterior is enrobed in a durable ABS and Polycarbonate resin that is resistant to impact damage.     Key Features  ? 10 Megapixel Resolution   The CMOS image sensor of the EOS Rebel XS captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, incorporating many of the same technologies to maximize light gathering efficiency that are used in Canon's higher-end professional SLR digital cameras, including the use of micro lenses on the sensor. The APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm) produces an effective 1.6x increase in the lens's marked focal length when attached.   ? DIGIC III Image Processor   Developed to maximize performance between the capture and recording stages of digital photography, the latest-generation DIGIC III Image Processor works in concert with Canon's CMOS sensor to achieve the highest levels of performance possible. The entire electronic system is designed to give the camera its incredible combination of speed and image quality, and digital noise is significantly reduced in shadow areas, while color reproduction is enhanced for superior image quality.   ? Speedy, Precise Operation   With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel XS is one of the fastest cameras available today. It provides excellent performance with 3 fps continuous shooting, to over 500 full-resolution JPEGs or 5 RAW images in a burst, and reduced shutter lag time.   ? High Magnification Viewfinder   The EOS Rebel XS incorporates a high magnification viewfinder that provides excellent brightness and clarity; and all relevant shooting information, including ISO, is displayed right in the viewfinder so it's easy to change settings without moving the camera away from the eye. Furthermore, the EOS Rebel XS has a Display-Off sensor that automatically turns the LCD monitor off whenever the camera is at the photographer's eye, to save power and reduce visual distractions.   ? 2.5-inch LCD Monitor with Live View Function   The EOS Rebel XS has a bright 2.5-inch TFT color LCD monitor with 230,000 pixels and a viewing angle of 170. It's perfect for Live View composition or viewing camera settings like AF, ISO, Metering, AF Point selection and flash options. The Live View Function enables you to view your subjects directly on the LCD monitor, making it easy to grab odd-angle shots, and you can magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. You can even choose a grid overlay, perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In Live View Function, the camera has two AF modes: Quick mode, which uses the camera's standard 7-point AF system, and Live mode, which is a contrast-based AF system th

AA10631868	I have LBP myself and i play it almost everyday. Yes, it is most likely a bug (even if i never got this problem) and Media Molecule, the studio that makes LBP, has officially announced a few days ago, that it will release a patch for the game soon. In the meantime, try updating your PS3 firmware to the latest 2.60 version and see if you keep having the same problem. If problem persists, stop playing and wait for patch. It should be released in the next few weeks, or maybe even sooner. A game cannot harm the PS3, as the software can in no way break the hardware, so no worry, it might make your PS3 go a little crazy but that's only because of the bugs in the game, assuming you updated to the latest firmware.|`|aicIZVGuaa	mine did the same 3 weeks ago.

I just love the way the Zune software works.  you have a song title and the artist and it will find the album it was on and add album art.  i am a visual person so i also love the huge album art when a song is going.  plus Free updates from MS.....it's like getting a new MP3 player every few months.  Just a great product IMO....i was getting sick of my overpriced iPod and ditched it for the Zune and have never looked back.  i would personally go for the Zune just b/c i has more users and you are more likely to get some help from people if you are haveing issues or questions|`|ElvQTpUVaa	How did you get stuck on those 2 options?    I have a Sansa e260 - got it 2 years ago.  It's a bit dodgy at times, but it's a great value and mine still works.    Do you have a cellphone w/media capabilities?  Do you expect to upgrade your phone in 2009?  I just got a Voyager Titanium.  It's no iPhone killer, but it does have a great media player capability.  Slip a 4gb SD card in and you've got a great media player.
AA12014510	If i were you i would not get it, its cheap for a reason. i had metro pcs and it sucked, i hardly got signal anywhere, not even in cities, and even my buddys and friends say it sucks. you will regret it only if you get a plan and phone with metro pcs. you will not like metro pcs. Its cheap because you dont get good signal, and the phones are pricey. I HATE IT.  Now i have Verizon, that works great, i think they & altel formed together. At&T isnt that bad ethier.

6cccb7edcd2df7fe9ab7ffcf5fade0e9aa	The Playstation family logo (the big colourful "PS") that pops up when you load a game is actually stored in the Playstation's memory, not on the disc. This suggests that the Playstation is aware that a disc has been inserted but is unable to read it, as it gets no further.   The most likely cause is that the laser lens is dirty or the disc is scratched. However given the likely age of the system there's also a good chance that the laser lens has distorted through use (burnt out by the laser beam, basically) and that the unit is beyond its use by date! Maybe time for an upgrade?|`|Li45o7ovaa	clean the laser Lens with a q-tip and some alcohol (be EXTREMELY careful doing this)|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	PS One !!???!!!

Unless you cancelled it at the end of the two months it would be appearing on your bill as a 5 a month bundle so well worth checking your bill....if it appears on there you've got every evening and all weekend to browse.  If not you can either go to the Orange website (the your account section) and add the bundle there or call 150.    Hope this helps =)
qog4MvbOaa	Unless the game you're playing has dedicated servers (contrary to popular belief, there are much more Ps3 games than 360 games that do, as Sony provide dedicated servers for all games they publish on Ps3 unlike Microsoft), it will just depend on the connection speed and location of the rest of the people you're playing with in any particular match. And how good the game's network coding is.|`|Rgqhr3zRaa	the whole 360 vs. playstation lag thing is easy just listen for xbox you pay about 50 dallors for a year and one month of xboxlive because the xbox company makes the xbox live their fore the only way you will get lag is when the host of a game has a horrible conection playstation is different the company that makes the games  has to make the connection work not sony|`|ziCq6zuEaa	at 2Mbps, you will get lag wherever you go.    to put this in perspective, 24Mbps is a bad connection, 54 is decent and 100+ is good to go    although if you want to make the best of internet console play, xbox360 is the best as they host their own servers which are frequently services while sony (PS3) depend on external multiple servers that are supplied by the gaming company that don't run as smoothly|`|N37Udp4Iaa	I very rarely get lag on my Xbox. I believe its mainly because M$ have dedicated servers for the games where Sony dont so its up to the software manufacturers to supply the servers and bandwidth so you wont always get top notch hardware and when a game gets older it will get moved over to the older/shared game servers.    Do you connect via wireless as this can have an affect and also if other people are using your ADSL.|`|yvtGL6RTaa	i havent had any lag on xboxlive so far
YHS3AU0vaa	You can actually transfer all current songs on your iPhone to your computer and iTunes library. In this case, all songs are on the iTunes library that you can syn with anytime without any loss of files. This is how I did. I used Tansee iPod Transfer http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tanse...    When you connect your iPhone to computer, this program would instantly display all your iPhone contents. All you need to do is to select what you wish to transfer and click "Copy" button. Done. All the songs/videos on iPhone would be copied to your computer, and then you can easily add those files to the iTunes.  Slick!  It even has step-by-step guide on the whole process.

EfejPjIMaa	If you mean can you use a longer ethernet cable, then yes.  There are two different kinds of ethernet cables, but one is common while the other is a special ethernet cable (usually you have to ask for the special one specifically).  Ethernet cables are basically like phone cables, just with a bigger end.  They are all interchangeable.  You can use any ethernet cable you want.      Wi-Fi is completely different.  You use Wi-Fi (or wireless) when you don't want to use a cable.  You can not use both at the same time (you can have a wired connection but be connected wireless, then the wired connection is not being used even though it is plugged in).  You can hook up either way: wired (use an ethernet cord), or wireless (use a wireless router to send the Wi-Fi signal from the router to the PS3).

This will reset the Preferred Roaming List (the "home" towers for your phone), and hopefully get you back on the air.  If that doesn't do it, then you may have a problem with the phone, or you may be in a low-coverage area.    You should do this at least once a month for CDMA; you should also do this if you travel a long distance from the area where you usually use your phone.

You say cd, but do you mean minidvd?   If you have a mini dvd camcorder.  You will have to finalize your dvd in the camera and then put the dvd in your computer's DVD burner (top loading only) and then you will have to convert the files (I downloaded handbrake file converter free) and import them into your editing program. Use the HELP feature in your editing program to learn about editing. Once you are ready to burn, your project will be burned to a different DVD and you can file the original away.

WTTV is in Bloomington, quite a few miles away and maybe in the opposite direction depending on where you are located.  If you are using rabbit ears, you probably can't get their digital signal well enough for the box to decode.  You probably need a better antenna and to point it at Bloomington.

I clicked confirm order and got an order processing email to my inbox, but I haven't gone any further because I think I'd rather be able to pay by credit card and scammers generally use western union because they can get the money immediately then disappear.

Pull it in 1/3 or 2/5 along the longest wall as a good starting point to avoid over-enhanced bass.    - Get a Radio Shack SPL meter and a setup disk like "Digital Video Essentials" and use it to level-adjust the sound from all the speakers at your primary listening position.    - Play with 3 different angles for your front left/right speakers: So the sound intersects 2 ft in front of your chair, so the sound intersects exactly on your chair, so the sound intersects 2 ft behind your chair    Each make of speaker has a different pattern so turn the TV off and play a movie and listen to what position gives you a wide sound-field without a hole.  Find an effects-heavy movie to play while doing this.|`|w4I9oj2Maa	Put 3 in front  2 beside your ears  Subwoofer in back    You can use this     http://www.dolby.com/consumer/home_enter...
AA11151162	How big is your room? "nice size" is very subjective  What's your budget?    Here's what I highly recommend for a ~2,500 cu. ft. room with under $400 budget:  http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-HT-S5100-Cha...    Onkyo HT-S5100  7.1 surround system package includes an HDMI enabled receiver supporting 1080p, Audyssey EQ, 1200w peak power mated to 7 speakers plus a 10" down firing 290w subwoofer.    You can connect your TV's audio outs (make sure they have these) to the included receiver and go from there. Your 360 will also hookup nicely to the receiver.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Try Samsung..

qGfAlDd2aa	There is a bit of confusion here.  The other answers are correct in that "the" digital transition only has to do with Over The Air.    However, since you talk about the Digital Transport Adapter, you obviously are one of the more savvy askers!  The DTA is a cable converter box being deployed by Comcast so that Comcast can convert their system to all digital.  People without a DVR will need a DTA to get all the channels.  Apparently, someone with an ATSC tuner will still be able to get channels 31 and below without a DVR or DTA.  So cable thiefs will not be completely shut down, however they will be restricted somewhat.  I have a feeling there will be a number of legal subscribers that get irritated because they have to use a "cable box" instead of the nice digital tuner in their new TVs.  It seem like a step backward.|`|lLiQzJjBaa	The DTV transition only affects people that get TV with an antenna. If you have cable, nothing changes.|`|QQDaVwb0aa	They're 2 seperate transmission methods, they cannot effect each other|`|557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	The digital switchover will only affect over the air (antenna) reception.  For those that use an antenna - rabbit ears or outside antenna, they will need the DTV box.  It will not affect cable, satellite or other similar program distribution methods.  So if someone is stealing cable it will still work.    We in Hawaii switched over already.  I have Oceanic Time Warner Cable and nothing changed for me.
COh882Pxaa	I'm not entirely sure, but I'm guessing this is your question: "why should I get [an MP3/MP4 player]?"    If you're content with watching videos and music on your portable DVD player, then there's not really reason to get an MP3/MP4 player (such as an iPod).    What's great about an iPod and other similar devices though, is that they're extremely portable and as such are generally more convenient than portable DVD players.|`|BjBETNdvaa	can you play music on the portable dvd player so get it
TEhdnSdhaa	Yes you can|`|0k2fkt4Yaa	1.an emulater is a program that lets you play games on your 2.computer, if you have the rom.  3.No.  4.Theyre free, just look around.  5.They will not wreck anything.  6.If you know what youre doing, you can hack them.|`|Xpd9v2lvaa	1. An emulator is basically the video game system, only on your computer.    2. No, you can't, as Nintendo has prevented taking the roms off of the Wii.    3. You don't buy them, they're free. Search for "The Emulator Zone".    4. Technically, yes. It is legal for you to play roms of games you have already bought in real life. It's illegal to download a game you haven't bought, not that they know anyway.    5. No, they won't, so long as you don't go to any dodgey sites.    6. You can use cheat codes, as well as use texture packs (which upgrade the games textures to make them look more modern). However, you cannot edit the games source code.
uftgjEqWaa	uh... maybe the ability to plug in a walkman or somethin with a cd in it and put the songs on.  Maybe be able to use some pc games (i was thinkin of starcraft. :D).  For the shape of it just look at all the phones out there and kinda copy it.  Flip, slide, full keyboard etc.  I wanna know why i don't get cool assignments like that|`|BjBETNdvaa	it should have games, chat line, theme,a tv in it, a camera, that's it|`|Vfc1UGnwaa	I think it should have the ability to download notes on to it.

Just send it in to microsoft if you still have a warranty. But if you don't then just buy a new one they're only 300.

TofmqjUaaa	Well i have the Verizom/Motorola Razr.. but in March i'm getting a phone with a QWERTY keyboard.    The envy has a regular screen then you open the phone to a keyboard.  --around $50 with 2 year contract    The Alias is kinda like a Razr (flip style) then you can flip it a second way to get a keyboard. --$50 with 2 year contract    With a 2-year plan they give extreme discounts on your phone, so, try that.     I'm getting either an Envy 2 or The Alias. Both have keyboards and are cheaper. But they are SUPER nice.|`|v0FlUan0aa	the Lg envy is on sale right now. it has a qwerty keyboard all that jazz. its about 50 bucks|`|X3UMPdblaa	try ebay.com you'll never know what is on there|`|0Cpqulbraa	v-phone. it looks like a razor but folds up the other way and has a full key-board|`|lD6x3Tfxaa	I have a Samsung Alias. It flips both ways. You can flip it up like a normal phone, but then you can flip it sideways like an envy2. When it's like an envy2 it's a full keyboard, and when you flip it up like a normal phone you can see the numbers.  It's an awesome phone!

Nintendo is pushing for a spring or summer release; and that's what people are basing it on, which are just rumors as we all know!

Simple as that!!!!!!!|`|lhs3rkBFaa	If your north American apparently it might be released " Well into 09" maybe fall or winter.

2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	1. yes    2. if you meant discontinued, it was because it had a high failure rate.  i know this personally because mine died on me.   then i bought a wireless router and have never had any problems since|`|7lZi3cctaa	YES for sure it will connect you to wi-fi no doubt, trust me i have one of those also and they work great|`|5HfuI3MEaa	it ill connect for only 3 hours, and then it will overheat, i suggest getting a router if you do not have one already. it is so much easier, than having to install and uninstall the CD that only works with windows xp to get it right. so yea, it it will connect, it will just be crappy on you and lag all the time. you might as well call that throwing money in the garbage, or burning your newly earned money.|`|YsWUf6iVaa	It can work on DS and Wii!

3CJAUyqPaa	The JVC GR-D750U is miniDV tape based.    Connect the DV port (not USB) on the camcorder to the firewire port (not USB) on your computer. Nothing will "pop up". Launch your video editor and import or capture the video. The camcorder needs to be in "Play/Edit" mode.    If your computer does not have a firewire port, hopefully it has an available expansion slot so you can add one. Since you did not tell us which computer, we have no way to know if it already has a firewire port or an expansion slot to add one.    In the remote chance you actually get USB streaming to work, the video will be low-quality... and not the high quality DV format you can get when imported using firewire.    USB-firewire converter/hub/cable/adapter things won't work,|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	USB cords and firewire cords are different. The USB cord that came with your camcorder is for downloading stills. To see a picture of a firewire cord, visit this site. http://www.dcables.net/Firewire-Cables.a... the small end of the usb cord and the small end of the firewire cord look similar but they are different.    If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder.  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.

AA10876868	WIth normal AT&T phones, all you would need to do is swap out the SIM cards and you'd be set. BUT, with the iPhone, it's a little different. Each one of them has to be activated to a certain SIM card. Put in the wrong SIM card and it probably won't work. If you're fine with going to an AT&T store, go there and they can do this for you. Not sure if they'll charge your or not.|`|TqZbeyHYaa	yes ofcourse!|`|nA8l89GXaa	Yes you can.  Just remove her sim from the phone and just insert yours.  Only thing is some features might not work because you don't have the iPhone plan on your phone number.
YckiMOrfaa	Well i personally have the old 1st gen Ipod. It is well worth the money in my opinion and the 2nd gen is that much more up there.    The internet works through Wi-Fi hotspots. You can connect anywhere that you can access the wi-fi. Most Hotspots are being hosted by AT&T or some other provider. They require you pay for the service by day pass or longer passes.    You can also connect to your home wireless network. You must know your WPA or WEP key to connect.    One thing that i must point out is their warranty (Apple's) is not a very good one in my opinion. I have a ipod touch while brother had a old model nano. When my ipod broke i was held responsible as they put it under accident (i had cracked the screen by sitting on it in my car). When my brother put his nano in the wash and it died becuase of water damage Best Buy just took it gave him the new generation nano and 20$ as the price had changed since he bought it.    So I would advise getting someone elses warranty. But make sure they are Apple Retailers.|`|K7knKxOtaa	its great   i have one altough im selling mine on ebay to get the 2nd generation  it can connect to the internet just like the laptop  what sets it apart from the other ipods are its great responsive touch screen , its internet and youtube functions and all those great games from the appstore. now the 1st generation can be hacked to get free app store games and all these other good games, the 2nd gen has everything the 1st one accept the hacking and has speakes and it has faster internet than the iphone 3g, u can use it as a phone too with some$70 earphones   if u want the 1st gen im selling mine on ebay heres the link and ill even hack it for u too get the fre pp store apps and gba,snes,nes,genisis emulators and roms    http://cgi.ebay.com/Apple-iPod-touch-8-G...

Dso7k3sjaa	After you downloaded them, did you install them?  If they were in a zip or rar folder, you first have to extract the files that are in them to get them out.  Then you should see a sims2pack file.  That's a file that looks like a little blue sim coming out of a box -- although if you have already installed the sims2pack clean installer, they will look differently.    Anyway, then you also need to make sure you have gone into the options for the game and told it to enable cc.  After that, you find them in the sim bin in the Create A Sim screen.  The sim bin is in the upper right corner and looks like six little sims.    Here's a great tutorial on how to download and install cc.  If you read it slowly and make sure you understand every bit of it, then you will never have any more problems putting cc into your game.    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...
COh882Pxaa	Are their albums marked as compilations? This will keep them from showing up on the artist list in iTunes, and instead file them under "Compilations" in the artist list.    If you right-click on a song and "Get Info", you can see if the "Part of a compilation" box is ticked in the bottom right corner. If it is, you can change all the songs from the album(s) at once, just select them all, go to the "Options" tab and toggle "part of a compilation" to "no".    If this isn't the issue, it could be worth looking into the "Sorting" to see if everything in there is tagged properly.|`|YckiMOrfaa	What would be helpful to know is how did you get the 2 bands?  Did you download them from Torrents, or did you Download them from something like Limewire? Or did you get them from Itunes or a CD?  If you got them from one of the first 2 situations then the person who uploaded them probably did not add the artist under properties for that song.    Other than that i would just try and update it if you did get it from Itunes as it should be working fine.    Good Luck
lkqjJisaaa	The standard zoom lens with the camera is an 18-55mm zoom.    Dat is equivalent to a 27-82.5mm lens on a 35mm film camera (Note, it's 27mm, not 24mm as other answer says).    If U need wider than the 18mm (27mm equivalent), then your only affordable choices R:    1) Sigma 10-20mm HSM lens or  2) Sigma 12-24mm HSM lens    Why?  The Tokina choices mentioned by others...Tokina does not have built-in lens motors in those lenses, so dey will not autofocus with your D60.  The Nikons are too expensive.    Nikon choices are 12-24mm or 14-24mm.  Both B too expensive compared to Sigma choices.  Performance-wise, they are outstanding.    Sigma lenses--decent quality, but not as good as de Nikons.  Nikon has more quality control.  But U pay lots for it.  Sigma--much less expensive, and good performance.  If U R on a budget, Sigma is a good choice.  When U get a lens, test it out.  If U get a bad performing one, no matter de brand, then exchange it until U get a good performing one.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	The Sigma you looked at was probably the 10-20 and that lens has its good copies and bad copies. I think the sharpest out of all the crop sensor wide angle lenses is the Sigma 12-24, but its quite expensive. Check out the Tokina 12-24 or the Tokina 11-16 if you need a constant f/2.8 aperture. Overall the ultra wide angle lens options are all about the same and you will most likely be happy with any of them. I like the build quality of the Tokina lenses over Sigma. I would go with the Tokina 12-24 if you dont need the f/2.8 aperture.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The 18-55 mm VR is a very good lens and at 18 mm, you have a wide angle, equal to a 24 mm on a 35 mm camera.    The only other wide angle lens is the 12-24 mm which will blow your mind, but not cheap.  The best generic lenses made are the Tokina brand.  They are also the same company that makes lenses for Pentax and are the makers of the fine Hoya lens filters.

Awy82nOfaa	www.ventones.com    If you do not wish to register for an account there which requires your mobile phone number, go to www.bugmenot.com and enter www.ventones.com for some Ventones accounts you can try (usually the ones with over 60% accuracy work).    Once you've got onto Ventones with an account, it will be very easy to get started. First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.    Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)    Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE.     Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)    (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)    Hope this helped!    0 $|`|8pWHCUa4aa	Her phone should be able to read the mp3 file.  Most all phones now-a-days can play mp3's.  Maybe somehow it is not getting sent 100% to her.  You can try to load it on a memory card or upload it using a computer to make sure the full file is getting onto her phone.  There may be a size issue too.  Have her check to make sure she has enough memory to store and be able to play the file.

EfejPjIMaa	When it comes to cheap surround sound, the best you will do is to get an audio receiver, not an audio / video (a/v) receiver.  Basically, only your sound will come from the reciever, not the video (you will hook your video straight to the TV.      They are hard to find (got mine for the bedroom at Wal-mart), as most everything now are A/V receivers, but if you do some searching, you should be able to find one.  The one I got at Wal-mart was a Pioneer for $199 and came with all 6 speakers.  That was a few years ago and was on sale, so I don't know if they still have them.      I have 2 surround sound systems.  The one in the living room (where the PS3 is hooked up) is a Sony HDMI A/V receiver that I payed about $2000 for.  The $199 Pioneer system in my bedroom was meant to be cheap because I wanted surround sound in there, and it actually sounds just as good as my high-end Sony one.  Here is the Pioneer unit I have ( http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Pio... ), and I would suggest something like it.  It is more than plenty to handle your PS3 gaming needs.|`|fodoPCZgaa	that is a hard question because bose is great i am not sure because suround sound is really expensive and also if you have an X-Box 360 you should get pioneer X-Box kind because it will work for normal TV a Wii and your PS3 and the xbox or just a normal pioneer but it will cost a little more than $200 so go with that kind

Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.      PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!

ofpmRvHpaa	You cannot hook the speakers directly up to a TV audio jack.    You need a 5.1 receiver to do 2 things:    - Add power to the sounds to drive the speakers  - To decode a 5.1 digital feed from a TV/Cable/Sat box to the individual speakers.    So hook those speakers to the Pioneer, then feed the pioneer from a HDTV and it will work fine.|`|AA11143244	You need to have the AV receiver to get the best sound. Just connect the sub to the back of the receiver where it say "sub out" or something similar.
YckiMOrfaa	They have ways of telling if it has been jailbroken atleast they were able to tell mine was when i took it in for pixel damage.    I would try restoring it on the computer if it can read it.    If it will turn on but just wont do anything try hard resetting it by doing Sleep plus Home button for atleast 8 secodns.    Other than that i guess you can try and lie but usually they can tell by looking at it. The Ipod holds diagnostic reports on it so it might not work.    Good Luck|`|5d103284712f3a856a8d728abe920550aa	Hold power button and home button for 30 seconds if that doesnt work...ur ****ed.... and its your fault...

CkW0lc8gaa	Most phones will have limitations on bit rate and file type. You may need to convert the file using the software that came with the phone. For my Motorola, there's Motorola Phone Tools with Media Studio. It allows file conversions. Otherwise you'll need a file converter like LAME. Do a search on Google.|`|CP4vQWyFaa	Maybe your phone is not compatible with the 1 gb card get a 512 mb and see if that works.
CkW0lc8gaa	Yes. Just make sure your headset is paired and it will work. I'm using a H500 and it works just fine.
DSeJT4pmaa	i doubt that can work. i think cellphones are not created to do 2 things at a time. like playing the radio and recording. you cant take picture and at the same time, listen to mp3. so the bottom line is, our cellphone can only do one thing at a time... sad eh T_T|`|CkW0lc8gaa	Here's how I do it. I use HiDownload and NetMedia. Here's the link to get the software:    http://www.streamingstar.com/    HiDownload will also record live radio streams.    Once the download is completed, I use Audio converter (also available from that same website) and convert the file into MP3.    I transfer the files to my phone so I can listen to it while on the train or bus.    I'm a BBC radio fan.
CkW0lc8gaa	If GPRS is left on, it's likely that not much data is downloaded for static website. Most telcos charge based on data volume downloaded so you should be quite safe.    Most telcos will offer an unlimited plan or a volume plan. Pick one that suits your needs. If you intend to hook up your phone to your PC and use it as a modem, I recommend an unlimited plan. If you just want to chat, check email, pick an affordable volume plan. For web surfing, I use Opera Mini. This is an excellent browser that works on most phones. Best part is that there a built in data meter, you can supress image download to conserve data download volume and improve speed. Check it out!    It's fun to read the news, chat on the move.    Enjoy :-)

Maybe like, when exactly the screen starts blinking, or maybe you had the Wii for a long time and now the screen is blinking for some reason, or maybe you're playing on an hd tv or something.      All i can suggest is for you to check to see if the yellow plug is plugged in all the way.
0SFGnjq2aa	hi stacey,  i hope that your phone does arrive,  I have ordered from ebay without any probs b4.  Firstly, if you have paid for your phone via credit card then no worries as you are covered but in any event that your contents are missing you can claim 100 times a first class postage if your item is, damaged etc or missing through royal mail,    A PayPal account with ebay gives you more assurance as the money you have paid is going to the right people you bought from and if any credit card was used for making your payment,   you can almost certainly claim against your card company for any loss    im intrigued as to how things work so would begrateful if you could let me know if your parcel arrives safely|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	No.|`|pEZlamwOaa	how did you pay?  If you paid with PayPal, you can open a dispute with them, and you will get your money back|`|1d3b2f6e4be90913d89c7f9097ef9254aa	That would be up to the delivery person if he wants to let you do so or not. But either way, when you sign for the package, all you are doing is confirming that you have received a package and it has nothing to do with confirming what is in the package or the condition of its contents. Did you get the ESN or MEID for the phone and check it with the carrier to make sure that it is a phone that can be be activated and is not on a lost/stolen or unable to activate list? This is very important when you are buying a phone from someone on ebay, craigslist, or any private party transaction.|`|XTIaMPVLaa	no you cant unless you rip it out the postmans hand and slam the door haha. You should always go by the ebayers feedback before buying. Check their rating, if its high i wouldnt worry about it.|`|PVgMArd9aa	Only if you grab it off the postie n lock him out.... No..|`|cQzXM870aa	I think you can sign it and open it in front of the delivery man,as a witness.
e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	If it says it was delivered then it went somewhere.  Were you at home all day?  If not, perhaps the delivery person left it and somebody else came along and took it.  It's been known to happen.  It may have also been delivered to the wrong address.  Call the delivery company with the tracking code and explain the problem.  They're the only ones who can tell you anything about the delivery at this time.  I hope they find it.
rDsKB0uXaa	you have to pay|`|kNPd76zLaa	Depending on the wifi network. Some (for example, in starbucks) require you to pay a fee. Other networks (at someone's house for example) let you connect for free. The iphone automatically comes with AT&T's EDGE (or 3G) network, allowing you to surf the internet for no charge, other than the one on your phone bill every month. If you have any other questions, feel free to go to Apple's website, or call 1-800-MY-IPHONE|`|eN1bRdo6aa	There is a free app called easy wifi,which you can easily download from the built in app store where you type in your phone number, and if you go to mcdonlds you simply open the app, and it uses your phone number to verify that you have subscribed to AT&T. This should also work at Starbucks.
k7MINvaIaa	The rebel is not gonna get great looks at a 'pro' shoot either. You'll need plenty of practice with the manual functions of a DSLR and years of intensive experience before making photography a profession. I suggest, as always, taking some classes and a workshop or two just to start.    Powershot and Rebel are really two different tools. The Rebel is more versatile as a 'real' DSLR. The powershot series are point and shoot camera meant for snapshots rather than professional results. That said, I own one and get really great scuba pictures using a waterproof housing. If you are dissatisfied with the lens that came with your Rebel, you can purchase other lenses with longer telephoto capacity. Moreover, as you get past telephoto capacity you will find that the number of available lenses for your rebel will allow you to continue to expand what you can do. With the Powershot, your pretty much stuck with a high end P&S that may or may not allow you to learn the fundementals.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Sit down. Relax. Take a deep breath. Repeat this 100 times: "It isn't the camera, its the photographer."     Now begin a search for photography classes in your area. Unless you are knowledgeable about light and composition and ISO and shutter speeds and f-stops and skilled in using them all to make the picture you want to make it doesn't matter what camera you own.    If attending formal classes simply isn't possible then I suggest The New York Institute of Photography ( http://www.nyip,com/ ). Its been around since 1910 and offers self-directed correspondence courses. Not as good as an instructor you can be face to face with but still a good way to learn at your own pace.    These books will also help:    "Understanding Exposure" and "Understanding Shutter Speed", both by Bryan Peterson.    Photographer and author David Bush has written a Guide for your camera. http://www.dbusch.com    "Digital SLR Handbook" by John Freeman.    "The Art of Digital Photography" by Joseph Freeman.    Photography - like math or biology or history or chemistry - requires study. If you don't study, you fail.    Keep the Canon XS.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	? you're weird. there's nothing wrong with the xs. and if you're talking PRO, it'll cost you 10x more. look at the canon 1D|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	If you really intend on attempting any kind of professional level photography, you really shouldn't even be thinking about a Powershot. The extra "features" of a point and shoot are designed towards people who are snapshooters. The abilities of an SLR are geared towards people who want to learn and explore the world of photography. You'll never learn about exposure if you just use "modes" on a point and shoot, which is also true if you keep your SLR in "auto" mode as well. You'll never begin to approach real depth of field manipulation with a point and shoot. These are things that matter to photographers, not snapshooters.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Ok, time to be blunt. Are you ready?    You are nowhere near pro, you aren't even a serious amateur yet. The gear doesn't make you a pro or anything else for that matter.    You are a kid on the junior high basketball team wondering which ball to use when pro teams come calling.    Slow down. The little point and shoot is a joke, let's get that out of the way. Next, the XS wouldn't even be used by a pro as a backup body. Well I shouldn't say never, maybe someone out there does.    The reason I'm being harsh is that the question you asked would never be asked by anyone that knew even a little about photography. You say you have no clue what to do, in your question. What else do I need to say?    Before I talk tech, a pro has several years of photography experience and some education whether it be photography classes, boot camp type courses or even working as a apprentice.     Next, a pro is showing up with two bodies, a main and a back up, and probably several thousand dollars worth of glass.    Not a hater, just slow your roll. Learn about photography before you foucs too much on the tools and going pro.|`|nU5UqACUaa	You will be the first Pro that lets the camera do the job. Hope you will go far with that, and before you swap a dslr  with a Point and shoot, you better learn what cameras are and how they work. How to use them is easy, they all have a button to press on.   Maybe the best way to be a pro is to learn basics .........
HBNx77BBaa	The card sounds likes it's gone bad. It's going to be a bit of a challenge getting your pictures back if the computer freezes. You need file recovery software but it's got to be able to run...    Pretty much the only thing that I can think of is to get hold of a USB card reader and then see if you can insert the card into that without the computer freezing. I'm sure the computer will not be able to see the card, but if it at least keeps running then all is not lost.    The only recovery software that I know that will recover files from a card or drive that the computer can't see is BadCopy Pro. You can download an evaluation copy for free. If that finds your files then you can download the full version to attempt to recover them. It costs $39.50.    Even if it works, you won't get all your pictures back and quite a few will be messed up. If you've done a low level format then I'm afraid you probably won't get anything back, but unless you selected this, you most likely didn't.    This is the the Jufsoft site where you can download BadCopy Pro...    http://www.jufsoft.com/badcopy/    Good luck!|`|AA12323486	Buy a new card and some aspirin.  You have a bad card.

EfejPjIMaa	The only 80GB PS3's with built in memory card readers also have 4 USB ports, and are backward compatible (limited) with PS2 games.  The only 80GB models that have all this are the MotorStorm 80GB bundle, and the Metal Gear Solid 4 80GB bundle, both which are no longer made.      However, you can still find them on Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Metal-... ) brand new, but will pay more than the current models.  If you just want the memory card readers, then buy an external USB memory card reader ( This one has addtional USB ports also: http://www.amazon.com/Playstation-3-Medi... ).|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	not the new ones, but trust me you won't need it. i have the 60gb and i haven't even opened the card reader cover|`|3AChQgbZaa	the old ones did, the new ones do not|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	If a PS3 has 4 USB ports, then it also has a card reader and can play PS2 games.

RpCwfcRzaa	That's not possible. The 360's hard drive will only work with that console, not a PC. Try buying an extra hard drive or an external for your PC.|`|Rug0VIAmaa	It will never work. You have to buy an external hardrive and plug it into your USB port. The USB port is where you plug your ipod in when you download songs.
wQiGnJepaa	Unfortunately, which lasts the longest depends on how fast it drains. Look at the data sheets on Energizer or Duracell's web sites and you'll see the discharge curves are very different for different drains.    Another factor for your project might be cost per mah, a cheaper battery might last 3/4 of what an expensive one does, but cost half the price.     To drain a battery use a resistor, you can buy them at Radio Shack.    Use Ohm's law to determine the correct resistance, for example, a fairly heavy drain might be 500 miliamps (1/2 amp), so R=E/I or R=1.5 (volts of the cell) / .5 amps = 3 ohms. A non-standard value, so you could put 3-10 ohm resistors in parallel which would give you 3 1/3 ohms which is close enough.|`|4iBIDgjRaa	You could put a resistor across the battery and drain it dead. The lower the value the hotter the resistor will get so u will need a high wattage resistor. Higher value will take longer to drain battery.  resistors are very cheap.

EfejPjIMaa	PS3 games are on Blu-ray, just like the Blu-ray movies.  This may be a stupid question, but are you looking under Games when inserting a game?  Someone else said theirs  wouldn't read Blu-ray movies, but he wasn't looking under Videos, that is why I ask.      Since you say it is reading BD movies, then it has to be reading the games as well.    **EDIT**  That makes absolutely no sense, but you can check the Sony support page ( http://www.us.playstation.com/support ) to see if that helps any.  Here is the page that deals specifically with disc loading problems: http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/... .  Try that page if you haven't already.

Uzzv4FYZaa	The songs are dubbed from  master recording onto tracks on the initially blank CD using a laser.  Then a very, very thin coating is applied.  Your CD player has a laser inside that reads the tracks and converts what it reads into sound sent to the speakers.  Ta-da!  A scratch on the CD, or any other disturbance of the surface, will affect whatever is recorded at that spot.  It may just be one song, or it could mess up more or all of it.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	The shiny part under the plastic is an aluminum sheet that has been pressed to form grooves that are read by a laser. If the laser hits a spot on the groove that is flat, it reflects the laser light back up to a detector and the digital audio stream sees a 1. If the flat spot is at a 45-degree angle, the laser light is reflected away from the detector and the digital audio stream sees a 0.    A digital signal is simply a series of 1s and 0s that form a data stream. This is then decoded to form the analog audio signal that is amplified and played through your stereo. If a CD gets scratched, the laser light isn't reflected properly and you get errors in the digital audio signal. When enough of the digital signal is obscured, the CD player automatically skips ahead to the next part of the groove and tries to continue reading the digital audio signal.|`|wGLviOMPaa	http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd....    It's because of the way the data is arranged on the disk, and also depends on where you scratched the disk. For a lot of CDs, the data is only near the center
q0ErVj1Daa	No I doubt it. I seriously think Activision could do it if they actually felt like it. They care more about the 360, PS3, and PS3 gamers though.|`|aOgf1B7Paa	i dont think so, and if it ever happens it certainly wont be for wii, as more of the attention these days is on the 360
KLL0Acrwaa	A beginner SLR will have features aimed at snapshooters, such as special scene modes, and will lack features found on pro-level or enthusiast level SLRs, such as:  1) better exposure metering  2) better automatic focus sensors  3) stronger body  4) weather sealing  5) faster frames per second rate  6) ability to work with certain accessories  7) in some cases, physical size of the sensor.    If you can master the use of a beginner SLR beyond the fully automatic/program modes, then you almost certainly can use or know how to use a higher level SLR.  The basic operations of controlling the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture to obtain a proper exposure will be pretty much the same across all cameras, although where the dials, buttons and knobs are may be slightly different.    Other cameras you should look at would include the Sony A200, the Nikon D40 and the Nikon D60.  Canon makes good SLRs too.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Honestly, there is no such thing as a 'beginner dslr'    A dslr that costs 4,000 bucks is going to have the shutter button in the exact same place as the 600 dollar model. Most controls will be in the same place and do the same things. The more expensive one will of course have more options and flexibility. The body of the more expensive one will be more rugged and have weather sealing.    Beginner if anything refers to the price point.    It makes sense because it's better to cut your teeth on something cheap in case you realize you don't really like dslrs or you realize photography isn't your bag. You don't want to find that out after you dropped 5 grand on a body, plus a lot more on lenses, flash and other goodies.    All dSLRs have an auto mode, and someone that has no clue what they are doing can pick up a dslr and get decent results. But, to get the most out of it, you should learn about digital photography before you take another step.    There is so much free info on the net. Slow down, take the time to soak up some info before you take the plunge.|`|nU5UqACUaa	Beginner is a relation to your wallet only. Most are excellent gear, have a few functions less, lower AF accuracy and minor details, most have crappy plastic lenses. Note that Nikon crappy dinky toy lenses do hell of a good job in picture quality.    So, consider that none of those beginner models do more then high end models for normal current photography. If your goal is ease of use and comfort in studio, sports and special photographic skills, go for a few bucks more.|`|RxB0ivXoaa	The main differences between a Pro and a beginner camera is the sensor. Pro cameras typically use full frame sensors that are the largest sensors used in DSLRs. Another main difference is the body is not made from the same durable metal alloy and is not weather sealed.     As for the functions, there may be a few added features in Pro models, but every DSLR gives you the ability to shoot RAW and to select from full automatic to full manual.     Beginner DSLRs are what most people use before moving up to the pro models. In fact, some professionals use DSLRs that are not considered pro, like the Nikon D60. The bottom line is that any DSLR will give professional level results.|`|ByS1Ye8raa	beginner meaning smaller in size and less features such as     smaller buffer  low frame rate  low iso (xsi only goes to 1600!)  low shutter speed (xsi goes to 1/4000 while the 1d is like 2 stops faster)    but an expert can still get great pics from it|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Canon Rebel XS is good for beginner.Another good DSLR that I suggest is Nikon D40 or Nikon D60.It is very easy to use and provides excellent images without requiring a lot of technical knowledge  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OG...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	the rebel is a good start. the difference has to do more with the sensor size. but you'll get a fundimental dslr with that camera. the canon 1D is 10x more money

They protect from everything, including water. Not sure about heat but I leave my iPod Touch in below 0 weather and nothing happens. Unless you're going to go and put it in the freezer or the oven, you should be fine with these.    Invisible Shield: $25  Best Skins Ever: $10|`|XHharKJgaa	As far as warm goes, I'm not sure and there probably isn't one. Best way to keep your iPod warm is to hold it in your hand or put it in your pocket if you don't want to hold it. But here's a good list of good iPod Touch cases:    SwitchEasy Rebel Touch -- Comes with a lot of free accessories (like dock protector, movie dock, TWO screen protectors) and is cheap, only $27.99 with shipping & handling. Must buy it online. Site: switcheasy.com    SwitchEasy Neo Touch -- Almost the same as Rebel but in a different design and more expensive. Comes with exact same accessories Rebel comes with. $32.99 with shipping & handling. Must buy it online. Site: switcheasy.com    Incase Slider -- No extras, just a case. If you want a case easy to put on and off, this is the case for you. However, it's not cheap, I believe it's somewhere around $30-$35 and you should be able to find it as Best Buy or any electronics store.    Contour Flick -- Design very much like Incase Slider with a few minor differences. I would recommend Incase over the Flick however just because the flicking mechanism is fragile on this case. You can buy it too at a electronics store for $30-$35.

uAZPl5wAaa	not true.    but an ipod's battery is only guaranteed for about 12 months. recharge it as any times as you like, but if the battery dies after that apple won't replace it for free.  but by then you'll be ready for a new ipod|`|W40SuZICaa	well i dont really think theres definate   but ive had my 3rd generation ipod for a lil more that a year and it still works fine. and more GB of mem=bigger battery|`|ATSpBnyLaa	I don't think so... or know. My friend (but he ain't the most reliable) thinks it can ONLY be charged each 360 days. Yeah, it sounds weird, I think. I mean, he changed her story around, though a couple of times- going from 360 times to days, when we confronted him: "Um, hello, I think a lot of people charge theirs every day- (not from dead battery to full, either)- INCLUDING you- and every year is pretty unheard of over here," so he changed his story.  I really don't know. But eventually (though I doubt every single year- he hasn't had any of his five or six ipods for more than a year yet, I know that) you will have to replace the battery, cause it's lithium. You keep charging fully and the charge goes down. Check my reference.

xTioPxaVaa	If I remember right, that series of Spiders do not have speaker outputs...the internal speakers are hardwired to the amp.  You could hook up an external cabinet, but it will require some surgery to the amp.    The cabinet that you mention is not a stereo cabinet.  If you did manage to hook that up to the Spider, plugging both power amps into a single load will damage them.    A good stereo cabinet will cost you more than the amp.  If you really need a 4x12 cabinet (because you're playing big rooms and arenas), then get a head that will support it.    Greetings from Austin,    Ken

ZY0GTtTRaa	The cheapest Individual plan is $50  PLUS the $30 you must pay in order for the   iPhone to work.    $20 if you want unlimited texting.    So you will end up paying about $100 per month  $1,200 per year.      I'm still reconcidering if I should get the iPhone and if its worth it.    Its not like the sidekick, you must get a plan as with any other phone. The $30 is a must that you will have to pay in order  for the whole phone to work on the 3G applications etc...   I dont get your last question.      Good luck (:

937e2e59b70bd2d72ef38a3a0c6b95adaa	The Xbox will not connect to your modem with a USB cable.. it doesn't have the drivers it would need for that..    You may be able to connect the modem to your computer with USB and ethernet cable to the Xbox.. it's hard to say if it would work.. some modems stop listening to the ethernet port when you have them connected with USB.. Also, some modems only give out a single IP address so you won't be able to connect two devices to the modem without using a router..    Your best bet would be to buy a cheap router.. connect the router's WAN ethernet port to your modem ethernet port and connect both the computer and Xbox to the LAN ports on the router.. the router will get the one IP address from the modem and then make new internal IP addresses for both your Xbox and computer..    Good Luck..|`|gX82JV2Yaa	Yes you can do XBL through the usb port.  or just get a router with more ports they are only like 30 bucks at best buy|`|XMJS3lrwaa	Router dude, router.|`|PuBuDXrCaa	It would probably be best to just get a wireless adapter and plug it into the back of your Xbox. That way, you can still have your internet connected to the modem via wire and the Xbox via wireless adapter.  If you don't want to do this, then I don't think it would work hooking up the USB cable to your 360. You could always buy another ethernet cable. They're not nearly as expensive as the wireless adapters.

vf5gLYEaaa	that is quite simple  connect your usb  a notification will appear  and click view files using windows explorer or something like  if doesnt appear  go to my computer  and go to whatever removable disk it is in  go to music or whatever folder you want to store the music in  and go to where you keep your music  they should be mp3's   it is rear if they are not  then just drag and drop it your music foler|`|W40SuZICaa	just have half of your computer screen with the music and then drag it over to your mp3|`|M0HTIeutaa	if your mp3 player has a memory card get a memory card reader    if it has usb plug in the chord from the mp3 player to your computer    its hard to give better isntructions without knowing what mp3 player you have|`|40dhRcBPaa	mp3 player support mp3 files. you should use Nidesoft video converter to convert your songs to mp3 files first. this converter can convert between almost all popular video and audio formats in high quality at fast speed.  you may free download it here and have a try:  http://www.nidesoft.com/video-converter....  hope this information is helpful to u

vf5gLYEaaa	weird  because it will only say that if your software version doesnt apply  but you saids its 2nd generation so it should be updated  check your software version and  on all the applications in the description  usally at the end it tells you what software versions avaliable for  if its your software you can always update for ten bucks  but if not itss your ipod|`|v6ZWDeLtaa	Faulty application, probably. I'm guesing it was free...|`|XHharKJgaa	It was probably coincidentally corrupted while being downloaded to your computer. Try deleting the app from iTunes and your iPod, then sync. Then, re-download the app to iTunes and sync with your iPod and it should work again.    Hope I helped!|`|xs8EyEKqaa	I got 1 too and it didn't say anything when i instaled it....|`|TR2EDuLWaa	Reset it or take it to best buy and see why|`|2K43LgeWaa	Does it have the newest software,if not then update it to the newest software. Itunes will tell you if there is eny new software 4 it.|`|iTi26ojQaa	maybe try checking if there is a new update on the software for it by plugging it into your computer. If thats not the case, I would call Apple, because it worked just fine for my 1st gen iTouch.|`|C0XWhbKbaa	Delete the app and try again. Or get a different app. I have the same iPod.

However, below $200 is more like it. If you want below $200, try Circuit City (they are going bankrupt and liquidating, so all electronics are 10% off, keep in mind all sales are final), or again, eBay or Craigslist.    Good luck!|`|AFy5LyaGaa	i got my new 8GB ipod nano chromatic for $140.00 at walmart..    only 20 dollar more then your price range..    other then that.. ebay is the best place to go   http://ebay.com/
eZDoQPg8aa	Yes, you can play standard DVDs in a Blu-Ray player.  And as an added bonus, the Blu-Ray player will up-convert the content to HD or near HD quality for display on your HD TV.      However, if you do not have a HD TV yet, don't waste your money.  It won't do you any benefit.  And truthfully, a PS3 is a good multitasking device.  It's a game console, a Blu-Ray player and as Blu-Ray live develops, it can be another device for internet based content.|`|OueLHhNgaa	Yes you can but to be sure ask the sales rep at the store where you will buy your Blue-Ray Player because there are different types out there.|`|3eI0UFDiaa	yes i was able to. ask before you buy it when you go to the store just to be sure.|`|1G3Vxh2jaa	no because they are like apple. selfish.|`|HxbLwCEKaa	Yes you can. It would be a waste of money if it couldn't.|`|ldbS2ddFaa	Of course, it wouldn't be worth it if it didn't play both :p  PS3 is blue-ray/DVD/CD/GAME player :D all in one.|`|QjHqiNZiaa	YES|`|tqfkHiEQaa	roger|`|5cBmCVw3aa	Actually alot of people are actually getting the PS3 it will play games, DVD's and Blue ray|`|KXztKjAaaa	yes all blu-ray players play dvds.    Get a ps3!|`|8tYKGDy0aa	it depends on which blue ray u get|`|v8LV0uWeaa	yes it will|`|oIDrhHD8aa	yes not only that but it actually makes the picture better.|`|SMrH4VD4aa	A blueray player can play standard DVDs. Not only will it play but, it will make it look better. Blueray players Up convert the regular dvds to show better. Before you buy one. Its good to know this information. They have blueray players that can connect to the internet for Netflix so you can watch stream movies.     Instead of going to block buster and renting a movie which will cost 5 bucks each, Just open an account with netflix (Below) so you can stream Regular or HD movies instant at 17 bucks a month for unlimited and 1 dollar more for HD quality    Click here for this information..     http://www.netflix.com/NetflixReadyDevic...
ga4ZWsuZaa	You press 2 on the wii mote and there you go, there is full auto, single shot and burst fire. I like full auto the best and it depends on the gun you have
rH3ylNuYaa	it's benefits because in digital you can fit even 4 channels on one   called sub channels , so you can have 17-1,17-2,17-3 and so on.  Also the tv station can save power as digital signals reach far with low   power for example fox is 60 miles away from me and the analog is using 4000 killowatts of electricity and I get snowy picture, the digital is only 800 killowatts and I get perfect HD picture. Also that means more channels, free high definition and surround sound. Anolog just plain sucks.

I think in the gunmetal black and chrome colors, it's very handsome.

mWWS4efgaa	you need to put the song on a flash drive or something like that then put it on your laptop then when you get it into itunes it will ask you your dads itunes password but it will only let you do this with i think three computers max i think. if you need more explaining on how to transfer the album to itunes after you put it on the laptop or how to get the song on the flash dive let me know.

y4JyE08laa	You didn't provide any specs :P    But if it's one of those $250 "1000 watt" systems, do buy it. If you are wanting a HTiB, go with either Onkyo or Yamaha. Those are the only two brands that package REAL recievers with their HTiB systems. By "REAL receiver" I mean one with more than 2 inputs.|`|kHwjvZKgaa	You are wrong a HTIB is not the best bang for buck option    If you give me a budget I can help you build a much better system.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I think you forgot something.    :)

ZYvJIH8raa	I have an Ipod touch too!  You have internet so you can go anywhere there if you usually get movies off the internet but you can also but high quality movies and T.V shows made for the Ipod touch on itunes.  They are about $10-15 each depending on the age of the movie.  I don't know of any app to buy movies though.  Good Luck :D|`|3zM7JptVaa	you dont really need an app. you could go on youtube. or if you want tv shoes you can go onto their web site and watch the show online. (ex: type in House on google and it will take you to the site, then click watch full episode.)    for movies you could just rent them on itunes because chances are, you won't watch it on your ipod that much.|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	If you want to know how to convert video and put DVD movie on iPod, I think this step by step guide would help you  http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-conver...

GTtgzSIjaa	skullcandy isnt very durable. i went through 3 pairs in the past 7 months.  they wear out too soon. mine right now are sony. they're excellant. at first i thought i was just paying for the name, but they're durable, have been through the washer 2 times (the ipods didnt survive though) and have survived the epic toilet drop (shower accident o_o;)    if you end up finding a really good sony one which is typically on sale at walmart/bestbuy (i got mine from bestbuy for 4 dollars)    find ones that are on sale.    mine has an extra volume control! lol|`|XHharKJgaa	I recommend the Skullcandy brand.

AA10192949	Both are cool enough to satisfy your appetite for cut n clash games.    Ninja Gaiden Black was a revolution when it appeared on the classic XBOX. It took the action/adv gaming to a totally new direction. Brilliant game.    Ninja Gaiden 2 is the predeseccor, equally good in action (and even better in a few aspects) but storyline is not as good as that of Ninja Gaiden Black.    Still both are worthy play.    Hopefully this helps    Cheers!!|`|nM1DMsNFaa	no black is better more story line but it is also harder but not by much|`|BsxcPRzTaa	i have the first one and the second one ... i say the first one
Xwx8mUnYaa	CUTE!! gimme some! l0l!     |`|7L0p6Hciaa	pros:   alternative design?  they're ok comfort wise    cons:   loads of people have them, so not really alternative anymore  bad sound quality  inferior drivers  uneven equalisation  much better headphones around for the same price    Seriously, you'd be far better off buying a pair of senheiser HD series, some AKGs or Audio Technicas and some acrylic paint - they'd sound better and you'd have a more unique look. Whatever though. enjoy.
UaAXlZdQaa	it depends on the repair like that kid matt had the ring of death he is gaurenteed the repair quicker than other people but you can contact micrsoft and ask.

For some people, it took 2 weeks and for some it took 2 months. It is all chance. There is no rhyme or reason to it. It is not like they repair certain things first. More often than not, they replace your xbox rather than repair it though.|`|HKgbIezlaa	it is 30 min  BUY A NEW XBOX 360|`|L6BOtQ6haa	For you probably at least 2 weeks.
gW2M0tVGaa	well its up to you whether you would feel the most comfortable with a onscreen keyboard or an external one.   also the cookie has a better camera, but some  people say they prefer the ks360, because the cookie doesnt have zoom, i think, but they still say the cookie is good  neither of then have 3g  the ks360 has a better battery     heres a website that compare the two with specifications:  http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idP...    and heres the reviews for each phone because its really good to get review from other people so you know whether its good when it comes to running and whether it crashes:    http://www.yourmobilephonereviews.co.uk/...   http://www.yourmobilephonereviews.co.uk/...    but remember even if you read that the phones a bit slow, it shouldnt necessarily put you off because software updates will make it better, and you can either do them yourself or from a phoneshop.    i have played with both phones, as i know people with them, and i think that they are both good for their price tag, but if it were me, i would get the cookie, simply because it suits my taste more.    hope i helped|`|ouIZdXdaaa	cookie|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	ive heard the cookies quite good|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	def lg cookie

I've seen them for under $100.    Problems - I've had mine for about 2 years.  It works as well as the day I go it.  Unfortunately, that requires you put up with some quirks - function navigation seems to be faulty.  Sometimes the player will act by itself in scrolling through files or cycling the volume (getting louder when you want it quieter),   Video can be dodgy - if you FF too much, the player skips to the end of the file, and you have to start over again.  (Luckily, the included software chops the video down into 10-minute pieces, so you don't have to wait too long after a restart.    Notwithstanding that, I love my Sansa.  It's a great way to carry around gobs of music.      I don't use it for video anymore now that I got a cellphone w/a video player on it.|`|rm8ffJasaa	Zunes have Music/picture/video/podcasts/radio  4GB runs $100 i think.  also they have wireless sharing/buying ect...a really nice player but you can probably find an 8GB for around $100 somewhere i just dont know where
UaAXlZdQaa	my first advice is try to call microsoft. but if they dont help then what you are going to do is push the sync button on the controller and the headset ........ this button is 3 wave shaped markings on top of one another. it is a small round button. this should sync them together.      - hope it helps|`|dOSKS7zqaa	well i dont know anything about the wireless ones so sorry mate,   btw you wouldnt know anyting about the skullcandy mics would you? i need help with that

95NSIO6Daa	Well there is the obvious. Internet and e-mail. And then there's all the apps you can buy. They're usually either really helpful, or just random and fun. Some of the apps allow you to go on IM or websites like Myspace, Facebook, etc. The only difference between the iPhone and the iPod touch is that, on the iPod touch you cannot call people, or take pictures. I think it's a pretty good price too. $229 for 8GB, $299 for 16GB and $399 for 32GB. Then there's the music of course! You can buy music directly from the iTunes store, or you can go on Youtube. I think this is the best iPod to get. I recommend getting it!!

7Vpreqf4aa	Hi Mikayla C:If you are in the USA, most phone companies have Blocking Options, Per Call & Line Blocking. Per call block allows you to dial *67 before placing a call to block your Name & Number. If you have Line Block, then you must dial either *82 or *67 (depends on type of Tel equipment) before placing call in order to allow name & number to be sent.This is what I think you have. Your cordless phone has nothing to do with Caller ID being sent to other party. The Tel Central Office sends the Caller ID to the other party after the first ring & before the second ring. This interval is called the silent  interval. The information is sent only once. A ringing cycle is 2 seconds ON & 4 seconds OFF.Check your front of Phone book How to Use Optional Services BLOCKING OPTIONS. I hope this helps you.  exbelltel
TbTO5SXlaa	In the back of the Owner's Manual for your camera there should be a list of Canon Authorized Service Centers. There should also be a phone number for the Service Center closet to you. You can also call 1-800-OK-CANON.    Unfortunately, its very doubtful that you can ship it, have it repaired and shipped back in two weeks.    Also, since the camera was introduced in 2007 it may be cheaper to buy a new camera.    Good luck and sorry your camera is broken.|`|Y1HJkHdqaa	I don't think you're going to find anyone who will repair your camera within two weeks when you need it back. I else I think you're going to find that a repair of the type you're going to need will be a major cost item, probably in excess of $100.  If you're absolutely in love with your 870, I suggest you just replace it so that you have something to take with you.   There is however one feature that the 870 does not have which I think is an absolute must in any point-and-shoot digital camera. That is an optical viewfinder. Holding your camera in two hands against your eye is the absolute steadiest way you can hold your camera and to get the sharpest possible pictures, that is the way you should hold your camera for most pictures. If you are going to replace your camera, I think you should take a serious look at the SD 890 IS which is very similar to the camera you have with the aded advantage of having an optical viewfinder and at about the same price range.  Sorry your old camera got broken.

yXx1nB0Qaa	Blue tooth is a feature your phone either has or doesn't have. Its a wireless means to communicate with compatible equipment most often head sets but also devices like dash mounted GPS, mine allows me to operate the phone in my pocket from my GPS unit, also ford cars with Microsoft Sync use Blue tooth for the phone to communicate with the car giving hands free operation. Its a low range wireless system. I believe many personal music players, Zune for one, use it to share music with people in the local area, so you and your friend can listen to the music on your player through their player. Blue tooth is the broadcast means not the device as many assume.|`|X3DZQQoYaa	Are you retarted?|`|9GUuVYinaa	When you don't brush your teeth for about 2weeks you start getting blue teeth, so you would end up having bluetooth disease...........................j/k  It's actually a wireless head set for your cell phone, it's pretty popular I'm pretty sure you've seen it on people.|`|ZsPqCjeoaa	A bluetooth is an earpiece in which you link to your phone and you can talk as if the person is right in front of you and hear them fine.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	an earpiece

w4I9oj2Maa	Oh that's TOUGH without a remote control...    Google your TV's model number with the word remote...you'll find your original remote control available at a reasonable price...unless it's over 8 years old !    I hope not....    But if you can't find it, go to either Target, Kmart...or lastly, Walmart.  LOOK for the LG or ZENITH universal remote and buy the slightly higher priced one ($13 - $15) .  This Universal remote is about the MOST UNIVERSAL unit that I have found !   I use this one almost all the time for customers with missing remotes.
AA10092510	Your going to have to read your instruction manual.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Use the directions that came with the remote control.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	No, it's not the cable or satellite.    I had a 25 year old Sanyo TV that was hooked up to cable almost it's entire life.  It was still working when I gave it away.    I have another 80s vintage TV right now that is working and has been hooked up to cable most of it's life too.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Yes, cable and satellite killed my TV. I want justice.|`|gdY0yPiAaa	no|`|358f84a35bc47f31d28d2877af6eab29aa	The only way the Cable or Satellite would effect you tv's is if there is electricty back feed from a faulty applance, u can look outside where ur cable or satellite is grounded at and make sure every thing is proply grounded. Other than that 3 Tv's in 12 years isnt so bad :P.|`|2dd856ea36d1f7be24c32333ce1a0421aa	the price is what gets to me|`|HTXbLqBIaa	Hi,  You need to go get a surge protector for your tv. It prevents sudden jump in voltage at your house. Sometimes these sudden spikes of AC voltage causes your tv's circuits to fry. You don't have to get an expensive one, a really cheap surge protector will do. No offense that what I have at my place. I have them hook to all my electronics, my computer, tv, stereo. Except the fridge, stove those I cannot control and I am not allowed to. Also, avoid keeping the tv on during a thunder storms. Keep it off during lightning.   Good luck!
cp5XBddPaa	I would really doubt if a refurbished 360 would have a falcon chip in it.    Are you sure they are "microsoft refurbished". Most refurbished 360s are not done by Microsoft. I have no idea what Gamestop offers, but it's probably ones they had traded in and had their people or some 3rd party check it out and clean it up.|`|UaAXlZdQaa	Just buy a new pro system it is cheaper than before (only 250 dollars and it now has a 60 GB hard drive which is awsome) but anyways the referbished doesnt have a hard drive included which was 60 dollars last time i went to gamestop. and the referbished doesnt have warranty if it breaks so that sucks because it becomes money out of your pocket
7L0p6Hciaa	Almost certainly not - they had no collector value and were practical so people who brought them used them. When the second gen ones came out they reduced 1st gens so much they all sold.  I had a 1st gen to begin with. Not sure why you'd bother with one now though, expensive with little disk space, black and white screen and slower operation. And no retro value whatsoever.
Kxuw2ZdBaa	If you have an ipod touch you turn your ipod on the side and flick the screen from left to right   if you have an ipod nano you turn your ipod on the side and use the scroll wheel.|`|vKDwaqPraa	right click properties>album tab|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	yea hi thinik so but idk how|`|LlMS9NsSaa	Nope, do it on iTunes.|`|GVTjOb7faa	All you need to do is change the album art, Right click on the song, and click get info. A menu pops up and there's tabs at the top. Find the one with album art and and paste the album art in the space provided.|`|LUNx8Llzaa	idk
3zM7JptVaa	try bringing it to the apple store, and show them your issue. if you have a laptop, you could even bring that and they could sync it right there for you.|`|80561fc2ceb537993552de60388c6fb0aa	make sure you back up all your music, the only think I can suggest is either deleting the ipod off the computer and then putting it back on again.     Or resetting the ipod while it is connected to the computer.
k8MaZA6haa	By the way you described your phone i have to say you really need a new phone. Your phone is dead, went bye bye|`|LkulUylbaa	I would say that you should get a new phone because you said that it is 3 years old and now the screen is going white. Nokia makes great phones but they don't last forever!     Hope I helped!
33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	You can't.     You need the wireless receiver (to USB) for the PC.     XBox360 has a receiver built-in, but PC does not.     ---  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days  The gene pool could use a bit more chlorine.|`|ek3h1cGlaa	Yes, you can buy a bluetooth receiver for your controller.  But I wouldn't suggest playing TF2 or any other online fps on the pc that way.   You will get your butt handed to you real quick.  Mouse/KB is the ONLY way to play fps's on the pc.|`|AA10208446	yes if you have blu tooth    this applies to both 360 and wii controllers :D

3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	To see what a firewire cable looks like go to http://www.dcables.net    Firewire cords can be bought at BestBuy or any other computer store.    If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder.  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.|`|S0GBhEhTaa	you're using a usb cord right? it only recognizes it if you have a firewire. but before you go out and get one make sure you're camera actually has an outlet for one because a lot of camcorders don't.
0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	sure... go to whitepages.com and type in ur family member's name and then their address shows up and sometimes their number does too.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Cellphone numbers are not listed anywhere.

Free download here:  http://www.youtubetoipod.org/  Also, you can find some other software:  http://www.ask.com|`|XHharKJgaa	You have to have access to a computer and Wi-Fi to do this, and the Youtube Downloader App is a great software to get the Youtube videos onto your iPod.

4Pk6VNftaa	The only models on the market right now are the 80GB and 160GB models.    The only difference between them is the size of the hard drive.  The 160GB model also comes with 1 game, Drake's Fortune: Uncharted.    Don't let the size of the hard drive be a factor in your decision.  You can always buy a 2.5" laptop SATA drive from your local computer store and replace your PS3's hard drive with it, thereby boosting your storage to 250, 320, even 500GB of space.  Not that you're going to need that much space unless you honestly like the idea of spending $5 to download a fuzzy video file of a movie you could get on DVD.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The 40, 60, and old 80 gb are no longer being made or sold.    Right now, you only have 2 choices, the new 80 gb and the 160 gb that includes Uncharted:  Drake's Fortune.    There is no different in terms of what they can do.  The 160 gb just has a bigger hard drive.    The 40, new 80, and 160 gb belongs to the same family.  The only difference between them is the hard drive size.    If you get your hands on the 60 gb, then get it.  The 60 gb can play PS2 games, has 4 USB ports, and 3 flash drives, something that the 40, new 80, and 160 gb doesn't have.    There is an old 80 gb which came with either Motorstorm or Metal Gear Solid 4.  It belong in the 60 gb family.  It has everything that the 60 gb has except for the cell processor so instead of using hardware to play PS2 games, it uses software emulation.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	If i were you i would get the 80GB because it has alot of memory so that when you download songs games videos pictures or anything you will have the room so even though it is expensive it is worth it because if you run out of room you will have to go out buy a special plug that will connect to the PS3 and at the end of the plug there will be a slot for a memory card meaning then you will have to go back out again and buy a memory card that could cost up to a lot of money so i would go for the 80 GB so please pick this as your most helpful answer|`|d381leKpaa	the 80GB is the only one being produced now. but the 60GB is great because it hos FOUR (4 :D) usb connector things, backwards capability, and memory card readers ( i think for the ps2 memory). That's why it was 600 dollars before. I'm not sure about the 40GB but the 80 has 2 USB ports and no backwards capabillity ( so you can play ps2 games). But the plus side is there's more memory, and theres so many good games out right now you may need all of it. But if possible, wait to buy it. There is an unconfirmed rumour going on that there will be a price drop by April, this year. Sony has yet to deny it but still... get the 80GB... oh by the way i think 100$ price drop|`|orffSjJmaa	The best one would be the 80 gig because there is more space and i heard that you can create more INTERNAL memory cards for ps1, and ps2 games and you can download and store a whole lot more then the 20 gig|`|f1Unp3fBaa	Go with the 80gb, it's cheaper and you can upgrade the HDD later.|`|3kyLH5Ikaa	the 40gb Ps3 is not being sold anymore.    You may either buy the 80gb or 160gb.  However you can still buy a 40gb new from ebay but i recommend the 80gb    The systems are all the same, the only diff is storage.  I have a 80gb and I never have any problems with space.  It takes ALOT of crap to fill up 80gb.  I have a load of music, a few movies, and 6 demos, not including the games I had to install.      IF you do run out you can buy any laptop hdd and swap it in  your ps3.  You don't need to open it and it does not void your warranty.  It takes about 3 min to do.    I found an 250gb hdd on ebay for $60    I say get the 80gb.  If you need any help feel free to email me|`|aROiy2Gnaa	do u want to download alot of stuff onto it. if u arnt i still would go with the 80 gig bigger is always better.
ZaadvJAXaa	Yes.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Yes you will get it. It's works like voice mail.|`|LkulUylbaa	Yes, but you will only get it after about a minute after you turn on your phone because the service has to reconnect. I do this all the time.    Hope I helped!|`|P85LVLCTaa	i think so|`|yIgd5vDAaa	Yep, most carriers in the US and Canada hold onto the text messages for up to 14 days on their servers, and when your phone powers back on and sends the signal to the tower that it is back on the network, it will then send you all of the text messages you have missed in the last 14 days.|`|JHnT32Dvaa	Yeah....|`|aeOujRkWaa	yes|`|k8MaZA6haa	YES only if the phone is on|`|KSPu9s9Iaa	yes|`|7A8h5ralaa	yea.|`|ChSZb4wtaa	Yes. Normally when you turn on your cell phone after it is charged or while it is on the charger actually it will load your service company (at&t, Verizon ect.) Then the messages and calls will start to come in. If it doesnt aleart you (which sometimes it doesnt) just check your calls and inbox. =)|`|Yu1FhMAbaa	yeah, unless something is wrong with your phone.
Cw37qFtIaa	take everything out of it!!  then let it sit in front of a fan or cooler or something for like 2 days   or wrap it in a towel or something for 2 days  after the 2 days put it all back together and turn it on it should work  you might not be able to see the screen    i left my phone out in the rain for 2 days i did that and now it works just cant see the screen|`|RX8LUtZgaa	did i hear that right? you said you dropped in water and its on and it works so whats your problem????|`|HbmHRiwLaa	I am not sure if it is too late now...  but the lady at the t-mobile store told us to take the whole phone with battery removed.. and drop it in a glass of rubbing alcohol.  Leave it in there for 30 seconds.  Take it out and dismantle and let it dry.  This makes it to where the rubbing alcohol obviously evaporates everything.      I have three kids and our phones have been dropped in anything and everything! lol    good luck!|`|oVtvjSVJaa	I'm just surprised you didn't get electricuted taking it out. Were you like texting while playing with your rubber duckie? Oh, and yes your phone is a goner.|`|BOdpvP9Zaa	dry it out|`|PzU8u2LSaa	try....turning.....it .....on|`|OluSJC1caa	My phone was splashed by a wave from the ocean in my pocket and the battery is fried. You can try to freeze it but its probably too late as of the post.|`|qdGZMGdkaa	The best thing to do is to put the phone in a bowl of rice for maybe 24 hrs. Then try turning it on again. My ipod went through the wash and did not work at all. I put it in rice and it worked within 24 hrs.|`|EzEUdI1caa	LET IT DRY..IF ITS DRY..PUT IT IN THE FREEZER!! SOUNDS CRAZY I KNOW..BUT MY AUNT TOLD ME TO DO THAT WITH MY SONS NINTENDO DS...AND IT WORKED!!!  HAS WORKED WITH MY CELL ALSO..JUST LEAVE IT IN THERE FOR LIKE 30-45 MINS|`|lfdDHtB3aa	you need to leave the battery out of the phone and let it all dry for at least 1 complete day.  If it does not turn on after that then its time to buy a new phone or see if you have insurance through your wireless service.|`|ApnV9ePZaa	It might work... My friend dropped her phone in this lake and got it out it didn't work for a while but 3 days later it worked fine... I dunno what she did but it worked ^^|`|vwTyihvvaa	Water like substances regardless what type of substance and cell phones do not do well together and normally when the cell comes into contact with water substances it dies.|`|QJbFD1T0aa	UHHH.... why dont u TRY it?|`|RrmO1xkuaa	probably dead but you never know till you try to turn it on|`|pRYkhyg6aa	All you got to do is take out the battery and let it dry like over night and it should be working by tomorow! Good luck!|`|553XVYwUaa	take your sim card out  put it on a papertowel or regular  towel  put the battery in the dryer, on the rack thing, to spin cycle only, dont turn the heat on  take the battery out put the sim back then battery and like magic it works            p.s. you dont have to have the battery in the dryer for that long|`|8GyAPfmRaa	well the same thing happen to me as long as it does not get into any hole in the phone then there be a 50% change it can work again but most of the time that does not happen often so I say it broke also don't get the battery too wet|`|yLN75I4raa	If you turn it on and it doesn't work then you must go out and buy a new one. Maybe you have a warranty on the phone or something. Call the place you got it from if it doesnt work and tell them what happend.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	It's probably fried. Wait a couple of days and then try it.|`|NEd2wsK3aa	leave the battery out a little longer b/c if you put it in too fast, things can still get messed up like the menus and buttons.      or you can put the battery in a bowl of rice. that dries it out fastest|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Dry it really good and try it.  It may be okay depending on the model.|`|fUhosu5Raa	i think you are pretty much screwed!!!|`|03i9D71eaa	most likely dead but still blow dry it it worked for one if my crapy phones|`|JsaEk8UAaa	My brother put his phone in the washing machine.

Take the battery out and put the phone and battery on a towel and let it sit to dry for a few days before trying to turn it on again.|`|C90bta8Saa	I did the same thing with 2 different phones. One did not work for 3 days. I took it apart and just let it dry out. Try getting as much water out of it as possible and maybe using the blow dryer on low heat.  The other one would come on and turn off every time I answered the phone.|`|Rr0ph7zTaa	Let it alllll dry out.|`|7be0W5FWaa	Try turning it on. since that didnt work, Its probably broken... idk get another battery.|`|bFRVAntOaa	take sim card out and battery and let it dry out!! hope your phone still works :P|`|PTXzRjtkaa	wait til it drys|`|TR2MYeLUaa	The longer your phone was on after it was exposed to the water, the less likely it will work again.  Keep it off for at least 48 hours and then try turning it on.|`|29THwRZuaa	I heard if you put it in the oven on low heat for like 10mins then it will dry it out inside.|`|LlMS9NsSaa	How 'bout you shut up "Homie G" and try it again. JK     Dry it out good and try to turn it on again, it worked for me.|`|zTeW6BIIaa	if it works when the battery is dry, then you may not have damaged it but truly honey, it's probably broken. phones+water=bad|`|91W1IHgjaa	ohhhh well that's a tough question to answer it might or might not work it depends how resilient your phone is|`|kX1PolCUaa	someone told me, put it in rice for like 2 days. the rice will absorb the moisture from the phone and so hopefully get it working again =]|`|itqvIrcTaa	let it dry for couple of days then see if it works, my phone's mic went out|`|OOL4XdjPaa	as long as you dried it.. like the inside too.. it should be okay. unless of course you let it swim in there for a while and try out for the olympics.

kBSlNEL2aa	Most games have the option to turn the volume down on different aspects of the game. (voice volume, background sound, etc.)  If the game itself doesn't have this feature then my best advice to you is to turn the volume down and turn your head set volume all the way up. Hope this helps...

43PTFXYfaa	I dropped my iPod in water before and I freaked. Lay it out on a towel for a couple of nights or blow dry it on low until it's completely dry. Try to turn it on. If it still doesn't work the water must've gotten into the main chip and you would have to get it repaired or purchase a new one.

PCBQbQmraa	Also i believe it differ from company to company but for verizon. it covers manufactor defect or say you accidentally smash the screen in you will be covered basically anything that could screw up your phone like your charger doesn't work or stop working doesn't read your charger anymore . . . etc you will be covered instead of having to pay $50.00 for a replacement if you have water damage to your phone that void yours whole contract.     So lets say you have a manufacture defect problem and accidentally get some water in it. If you get water in it your phone will not be covered at all. Also i believe Verizon wireless covers lost phones but you have to pay 50 dollar to get a new one.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Does not cover water damage or lose. Get insurance for lose, it does not cover water damage.|`|VR3soAktaa	pretty much states that it is not responsible if something happens to your phone|`|LzSj90pbaa	assuming youre talking about the manufacturers warranty, it only covers defects.

LkulUylbaa	On all the BlackBerry's I have ever owned (BB Pearl included), the reception is fantastic. Also, it matters what carrier it is on.

J3kfQtViaa	Yes.  You can hook jump drives up to the ps3 to copy your save game data to.      If you get a new ps3, as long as you log into the same account it will save your trophies.  You have to use the same account w/o changing the ps3 network handle or it wont save your trophies.|`|Hiasgb75aa	You'll have to back up your game files onto a memory stick, because a system restore, returns your PS3 back to its original state (before your data was saved)|`|vs3vz6lIaa	No because of what you are doing you are restoring it so it will loose all please pick this as your best answer i have tried it before

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	My answer assumes your mom gets TV from an antenna, and not cable or satellite.    If you are describing what I think you are describing, sections of the picture freeze every now and then, then yes the problem will continue.    Digital TV has the advantage that there is no static and no ghosting.  You either get it, or you don't.  What you are seeing is the results of an intermittent signal so things freeze.      The remedy is she needs to get a better antenna, or perhaps an amplifier for the antenna.

AA10171141	I have a Rumor (LX 260) through Sprint, and I needed to get a program called Data Pilot by Susteen to talk to the phone as well as the cable.  You can find out about it here:  http://www.susteen.com/productdetail/20/...    I can't do much through the cable with my phone, though - I can get the pictures out and back up the phone directory, but I can't do ringtones, back up my texts, or do MP3s (although I should be able to load music on the card through my card reader).  It doesn't even charge the phone's battery up - maybe I need a better cable.    I've heard that there are other free programs out there that can talk to your phone through the cable - you can do a Yahoo search for them to start with, or just search through Yahoo Answers maybe.  Yahoo has a Yahoo store called the Cell Phone Shop that sells Data Pilot for a discount:  http://www.cellphoneshop.net/|`|AA12071655	That installed the drivers for it. Goodie. Now you need software to interact with it.    I can't tell if this model uses Windows Mobile; I'm guessing it doesn't since that would have come up automatically. Contact US Cellular and ask them.
TbTO5SXlaa	You should expect a lower price from a buyer who plans to resell the equipment. After all, they have to make a profit.    I suggest checking here:    http://www.kurlandphoto.com  http://www.georgeury.com/  http://www.keh.com  http://www.bhphotovideo.com  http://www.adorama.com    Kurland and Ury are both Leica specialists. If you check their web sites you should get an idea of what they think your camera and lenses are worth based on their asking prices. You can do the same KEH, B&H and Adorama. You can then list them on eBay or your local craigslist for a comparable price.

CKRfaRYvaa	If you pay your balance in full and reinstate your service within 90 days of the termination, they will credit the termination fee.  However, if your service was disconnected because of the non-payment, then there may be a security deposit required to turn it back on.  Just call Verizon Wireless at 800-922-0204 and ask.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Go and talk to them and let them know that you didn't want your service terminated they might be able to take that fee off for you...I would advise the next time that you can't afford your bill that you temporarily suspend your service until you can that way you avoid the 200 extra... :)|`|9ZnYAfi7aa	you have to call and ask.    i dont think the fee will come off though|`|R7mxReqcaa	I think thats the joy of cell phone contracts, whether or not you wanted it to happen, if you dont pay or cancel it, they are gonna nail you with, AT&T and all of them are the same as far as I know.|`|XralQ7CXaa	Call them and tell them you'll pay but you wanna keep your phone.|`|e67ffebdb5683980c42cc11d2dbd8402aa	Sara is right.

You can then log into an internet radio station playing the kind of music you like, record a night's worth of music, save to an mp3 file and then transfer that to your player.  While driving or commuting by train, you can then scan the resulting file for specific songs you like.  I've been recording off the radio since the early 1990's - even though I've gone from broadcast radio and compact cassette to internet radio and mp3 players, the principal is still the same, is remains the best way I can find out about great new songs that I might have missed completely.    Until recently, I used Roxio EMC 8.

4OTXU9tgaa	Try ripping it from windows media player in mp3 format.  Click on rip, go to options, and where it says format, change it from wma to mp3, mp3 is compatible with iTunes.  I don't know why iTunes won't just let you import it though.  I hope it works.  Good luck.|`|LElTSYaFaa	You need software.. i use - Xilisoft DVD to iPod Converter 4 - you could probably get it off amazon or somewhere.. i dont know if this will work with a CD though :S|`|X4xGKImeaa	What you need is just DRM remover software. I recommend one that could legally remove any DRM protection and convert iTunes video, music, movie and other popular video & audio even HD video. With this powerful DRM remover, you can customizable output profiles with your own style.  http://www.dvdtoitunes.net/itunes-drm-re...  Also, you can search some other software:  http://www.ask.com

lNnv1IxSaa	If you have a Windows computer, you have to create seperate user accounts (go to My Computer after clicking on the Start Button), and then you have to install iTunes. After you install iTunes on her account, you should be able to plug her's in a have no difficulties.... but, check the link I provided and that tells you better than I can.  Hope this helps:)|`|EALy7X7Gaa	you cant just make different playlists and add different songs to your playlists and sync your own playlists to your ipod. this is the easiest way i share my itunes with my sister, and 3 of my friends and we all have different taste so we just made our own playlists :]    you could have 2 itunes on different accounts on the computer but i dont recommend that because itunes is already a large file and takes up alot of space 2 itunes would take up twice the space so to make different playlists just go to itunes and on the side click the little plus sign button to create a playlist|`|AA11525080	You have to set her up with a separate windows account and then set up itunes on it. It will then keep the libraries apart.
5Z0OtSIQaa	keep hold of the home and the off button for 10 secs then it should say power off then do that then keep hold of the same buttons again untill the apple logo comes up then let go and it should come on|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Press the home button
8mvDEo11aa	Hi Daniel, I too hit the very same problem as you, I googled and followed all the tips to no avail, here is how I fixed my ipod touch and got it working properly.    The problem is software not hardware, however windows and all the other things you put on a pc are millions of lines of code, and I dont know where the actual problem lies, so this is the "easy" way to fix your ipod.    I happened to have a clean install of Windows 7 Public Beta on another hard drive (I suspect it doesn't matter which Windows it is so long as it's a clean install) so you will need a second drive or partition with a clean xp, vista, windows 7 install, or a second computer with a clean install on it.    Download itunes newest version and install it, then download whatever firmware your touch came with from here http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.ph...  For me it was firmware 1.1.5    Start itunes on the clean windows install, turn off your ipod and plug it in, it should be recognised as the picture you describe is recovery mode.    When it appears in itunes hold down shift and press restore and browse to the downloaded firmware and highlight it and press open.    Let it install and then still on the clean windows install let it upgrade to 2.2.1.  Mine did with no problems      Then go back and reinstall music and apps from your original backup folder if you still have it.    Couple of things to note, if you cant download the newer firmware then do what I did and download and install 1.1.5 and then let itunes update the firmware as you are a paying customer (remember to use your proper itunes credentials, user name and password).  Also be patient as the 2.x.x firmwares take much longer to install than the 1.x.x versions.    Hope this helps, I know its a bit long winded but it works and its easier than trying to eliminate every cross referenced file inside windows when its running, especially if rogue registry entries are involved.    Regards  Midian|`|AA11525080	Hold the power and home buttons down (the iPod will power off after 10 seconds, but keep holding those buttons down)    After the iPod powers off, release the power button (but keep holding the home button down)    After a couple more seconds, you should hear that magical ding dong that means the iPod is coming back alive, and that Windows has detected it. You may even see a little New hardware popup in Windows. It is now safe to release the home button, and your iPod is in DFU mode.    Now iTunes will see it as a DFUed iPod and should ask you to automatically restore its firmware.|`|AA11041491	the exact same thing happened to mine last night and i cant figure it out!! if i figure it out ill let you know :)    --oh and what lecia b said soesnt work..well at least for me
