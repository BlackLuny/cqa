l8yfpyy1aa	Your light-colored cotton clothes should make it OK through an additional wash cycle with a small amount of detergent and chlorine bleach.  It has to be chlorine bleach, I'm sorry to say, to kill mold and mildew.  The rinse and dry cycles should take out any bleach odor.    Wool and rayon would be totally ruined by chlorine bleach.  Colored cotton garments would lose some of their color.  Synthetics might develop off colors or spotted areas.  If you value those garments enough, take them to a dry cleaner.|`|AA10097817	Avoid using the bleach, and throw out the garbage bags, if you haven't already.    Try hanging the clothes out in the sunshine for a couple of hours. Let the sun kill the mold and mildew spores.|`|dv3hlHRhaa	Find a really nice smelling detergent (that you like) and same with fabric softener.  Let them soak in the washer for awhile before you start the cycle.  Also you might try Borateem or Arm and Hammer washing soda or Oxyclean to help freshen them.  Good luck|`|VSWl45cKaa	As long as it is non-chlorine bleach you should be OK. Where you can use warmer water (or even hot) do so as long as the tag inside each garment says it is OK.

Try bringing them to a dry cleaner's and see what they can do.
dv3hlHRhaa	The best way to sanitize your dishes is with a dishwasher, but if you do not have access to one and you are concerned with sanitizing your dishes, add a little clorox cleanup to your dish water and let them soak for a few minutes and then rinse and air dry them. It is more sanitary to air dry than drying them with a dish towel.|`|JDnkZl8oaa	a little clorox is all u need|`|AA10097817	Just a bunch of hype. No need to sanitize your dishes. Let your immune system have something to fight once in awhile, or it's going to forget how to work.
EsIRe7sDaa	*Use "high efficiency" rated laundry detergent. This is recommended for front-loading washers because it is low sudsing. The suds that build up in nooks and crannies cause the mold problem.    *Reduce the amount of regular laundry detergent you use if you cannot buy the high efficiency detergent. Use only about 1/4 the amount you would normally use. Unfortunately, this will sacrifice the quality of clean you will achieve.     *Add 1/4 cup of vinegar to your powdered detergent. The acidity will reduce the amount of suds produced.     *Use bleach in at least one load every couple of weeks. If you live in an area where the water is too mineral rich to use bleach without staining, run the washer empty with 1/4 cup of bleach. Even if you use bleach just for sheets or towels, it will make a significant difference in the mold problem. Always use the bleach compartment so that it will be significantly diluted before touching your wash.     *Wipe the door gasket with a diluted bleach solution once every couple of weeks and dry thoroughly.     *Leave the front-loading washer door ajar between loads to allow air to circulate.|`|JDnkZl8oaa	wipe it off with bleach|`|6ec3e671c1caa676236ae9f150894d76aa	Try a load of bleach and hot water.

Be quick, as vinegar is a little corrosive to rubber, tends to dry it out with prolonged contact|`|dv3hlHRhaa	One important tip is when you are finished using your washer, leave the door slightly ajar so air can flow in and out.  This will help future build-up of mold.  As for the present mold problem, try Tilex mold and mildew remover with a cloth or sponge...but be sure to rinse well after using this.  Also try Oxyclean mixed with hot water.  Good luck.|`|cvU3MOqMaa	use a solution of bleach and water. Spray it on there and let it sit for a while then wipe it down. Spray on a thin coat and leave it.

ZknaSxX7aa	It is inherent in the nature of Corningware and Arcoroc to shatter instead of breaking into large pieces. It has to do with the structure of the material used to cast them from; it seems to be under some kind of tension, which causes it to break into shards like Pyrex.|`|AA10097817	Been there, done that, with corningware. Sometimes there's just a bad one. No telling why or what happens. I finally boiled water in one (in the micro) then placed it in cold water. It did not shatter. So I did all the rest of the cups. One shattered, the rest were okay. I've had no shattering incidents since.
HXlxJU2Yaa	Here's some tips:   1) establish a location for everything. Then follow the "put it back where you got it from" rule.   2) build a "landing strip" at your front door where gloves, hats, umbrellas, keys, etc go. It's also a good spot for mail (incoming and outgoing). This keeps so much clutter out of the rest of the house.  3) Keep the kitchen sink free by unloading the dishwasher as soon as it's clean. That way dirty dishes can go right into the dishwasher--out of sight!  4) Wipe down the sink after shaving or brushing teeth--while the residue is still wet and easy to wipe off.  5) Make the bed as you get out of bed.    I think cleaning when you get him is too much to expect--you're run down at that time of the day, you deserve a break. Instead, work the house chores into your activities after dinner like folding/putting away clothes while watching TV, filing bills during commercials, that sort of thing.    The goal is to make "cleaning" a habit. Once-a-week cleaning means your house is clean once a week--constant cleaning means your house is constantly clean.|`|AA10526402	I find that if I eat dinner first thing when I get home and then immediately start straightening up, then I can get it done.  If I find my way to the couch after dinner though, then the cleaning doesn't get done.  It is usually a drag to start cleaning, but once you start, it is ok...so just force yourself to start and maybe set small goals, like "tonight I will at least sort the mail and clean the counters"...then you might do only that, or you might get motivated to keep going.  I definitely prefer doing a little each day and then not having to clean like crazy Saturday morning.|`|f106f574855f6526410e30fbb7976b07aa	After 23 years of military service and another 3 getting shot at in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor I now take on the most dangerous job I have ever had, house keeper. Would it surprise you to know I bring a considerable amount of discipline and regimentation to the job?  So here is what I do. I use my scheduling software on my home computer, The calender in Microsoft Outlook works fine as will any other similar software application. I set the computer to tell me what room or function is the primary duty for the day and even tasks that are often forgotten are scheduled for monthly or annual attention like cleaning behind the fridge. I am ready for a white glove inspection at any time and the wife loves it!  I am a stay at home dad these days so my life is a bit different but I still think scheduling and reminders for your after work duties could solve your problem as well. This can be as simple as a dry erase board on the fridge.   Good luck, and take back your week end!|`|ifwuOwIfaa	Well start small. Like maybe 50 pounds or so. then in a few weeks of 3 sets of 5 reps each you can probably move up to something a little bigger. I would suggest trying to pick up a car.  Give this a little longer maybe say two months at 3 sets of 5 reps.  Then only if you feel ready, try picking up the whole house (be sure to use a spotter though, they are heavy. think safety first). Then you can probably pick up the house every day. And  try to switch your routine up too. Maybe every third day try squatting the house instead of bench pressing it or curling it.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Ask yourself,  "If a friend came over right now,  would I be embarrassed with how my place looks?"|`|EmgiGg17aa	Easy if you are concerned about your weight.

The key is to promise not to go over 45 minutes so you won't get burned out.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Why don't you just pick up after yourself as you go, there's less to do when it's time to clean up. Being slothful is not my idea of good habits and I've taught my five kids this, you can go over there houses at any time and it looks like they just cleaned.|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	I always make sure the sink is empty (wash everything or put it in the dishwasher) before I start dinner.   I also have a mail-catcher right inside the front door, with hooks for everyone's keys, coats, purses and even the dog leashes, and a shoe rack right there so none of that clutter makes it farther into the house.   If I do any cleaning when I get home, I do it before I eat dinner, or while dinner is cooking- once I eat there's no way I'm going to get my butt up and clean!

UlG5WW4Xaa	If the outlet or wires are sparking yes it can cause a fire and is a hazard.  There is a short somewhere either between the wires or a problem in the construction or setup of the plug.  Just because the plug has three prongs does not mean it is properly grounded.  If the box (what the wires come to and the plug is mounted to) is metal the box may be grounded but the plug may not be, vise versa, or neither.  Many older houses are updated with three prong plugs or even GFI (ground fault interrupter) plugs, but there is no ground wire connected to them which is what make both safer.  <br>  <br>  Have the sparking plug looked at by a licensed electrician.  You can test the others without any danger to yourself or special knowledge.  You can get a cheap little tool (~$5) that looks like a three prong plug with three LED lights.  They light up depending on the setup of each plug.  They have a sticker on them that tells you what the different light displays mean.  You can check your whole house without extra expense from the electrician to see where other problems might be.  <br>  <br>  Make sure they all light up as being setup correctly with a proper ground, and get that sparking one fixed.  The electrician may check all your other plugs for you for free, if they're nice.|`|tDZMJue9aa	a wire is touching somewhere i would have a licensed electrician check it out|`|6O4WTiPQaa	Yes, shut power off to it, then use a tester to verify it has no power going to it.

vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A friend who has pets and kids bought a Eureka boss smart vac ultra 4870 and she loves it. She said it was recommended by consumer reports magazine and rated right up there with higher priced vacuums. It outperformed the Dyson animal.

wKt2WljZaa	Why they smell????<br>  Like us, plants can't move from one place to another. So to reproduce, they have evolved to attract insects for the transfer of pollen. Scent is one way flowers have developed to attract specific insects or animals for pollination and nector. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why they smell good????<br>           The fact that flowers smell good is simply nature’s way of making sure the cycle of life for the plants continues with no interruption. The black art of the flowers is that of animal seduction and manipulation, and we are the ones that are seduced and manipulated. Humans do not use flowers for food, so why are we attracted to these floral scents? One reason is that ripe fruit emit aromas that are either identical or structurally similar to those of the flowers. The plants rely on homologous chemicals partly for economy, partly to confuse animals consuming their fruit: the animals exploring flowers for edibility become inadvertent pollinators. Another reason is that our primate ancestors were occasional insectivores (and descendants of insectivorous shrews) that were very interested in these very pollinators. Flowers smell nice to us because they attract all these yammy insects: it is the association with food for which we are biochemically programmed. Dogs and cats have a powerful sense of smell, but you would not find them enjoying the first irises of the spring. Neither are the cows interested in the fragrance of the violets that they mulch. The only two groups of animals that are truly appreciative of the fragrance of flowers are their pollinators and the predators of these pollinators. Our keen interest in flowers (that goes beyond their smell) betrays our primate lineage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do all of them smell good to humans????<br>           But don't fall into the trap, Not all flower scents are appealing to humans, a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals, often called Carrion flowers including Rafflesia, the titan arum, and the North American pawpaw (Asimina triloba). Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and most such flowers are white.|`|ldWncRayaa	pollen i think? but who really nows and who really cares? not me|`|ozwLZwXeaa	-------Mother Nature--------

AA12139345	You didn't say what kind of caulk you used.<br>  <br>  If you used a latex or acrylic base caulk, you can clean up with soap and warm water.  <br>  <br>  If you used a silicone base caulk, you're going to need a solvent to remove it.  Check the caulk tube for directions on how to clean it.  Keep in mind, some solvents will 'bleach' clothing, and strip furniture finishes/paint.<br>  <br>  You might try a multi-step approach, to safely clean siliconized caulk from your hands.  WD-40 will help break down the caulk, then you can clean the WD-40 off with a little dawn dish detergent, or Windex.  If the caulk does not respond to the WD-40, you can try acetone (which is often found in nail polish remover) - careful though, this is one of those solvents that will 'bleach stain' your clothing, so use paper towels, or a disposable rag to clean up with.  Then apply some lotion to your hands afterwards, because the acetone will dry them out.  DON'T use nial polish remover, or acetone, on your clothing, any painted, or finished surfaces (such as furniture, or doors, trim, etc) as it WILL strip the finish and/or paint.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Turpentine.|`|zrthZOCdaa	I ALWAYS USE A GREEN SCRUBBIE PAD|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Use mineral spirits, then soap and water, followed by some hand lotion.

At any rate, there is definitely a carcass somewhere. This happened to me one time when I forgot about a bag of potatoes I had stashed under the sink. so consider sources like that as well.

You can purchase a fungicide that could be used to control soil fungus thus eliminating the gnats-Good Luck!|`|SndrZbn8aa	I've found that when a plant of mine gets spider mites spraying the plant's leaves, stems, and even just a bit of the soil with a soapy solution works great. Just mix a couple drops of dish soap into a bottle of water and spray. Definitely get this plant away from any other house plants you may have! I don't know if your plant has spider mites though usually you'll see some webs on the plant itself with those. The soapy mixture should work with these bugs. Spray once a day and see how it goes. Is there anyway you can call the company or see them in person? Kinda crappy they sold you a plant like that and won't return you emails.

This temperature is measured at the thermostat. <br>  <br>  Try this to make sure things are working correctly. The next time your blower stops, turn your thermostat up to max, wait 2 minutes and see if it comes back on. If it doesn't then you have a problem, if it does, then set the temperature on the thermostat to what you want the room to be and problem solved, it will cycle on and off like it is supposed to.|`|5494ccbcf30f4e172be5b32c91bdc62daa	it could be your heat sensor is dirty, located inside the furnace to the left of the ignitor usually it is kind of l shaped and if it gets crud built on it the furnace will act that way ......try and scrape the sensor gently with a knife or sandpaper, three out of four times this is the problem

FLAtdWrmaa	You don't say where you live:  correct answers are usually specific to locality.<br>  <br>  These sound like "pantry moths," which thrive everywhere in the world.  They like to eat either bread-and-grain foods, or nuts and nut-based foods.<br>  <br>  Since I bought my house, I've been plagued with them!  (This is for 2-1/2 years, now.)  The only thing that works consistently is commercially-made pantry-moth traps that are a "tunnel" of cardboard completely lined with adhesive gel, with a little foil envelope of pheromone solution stuck inside.  You peel a tape off the opening, exposing the pheromone-soaked sponge inside, and set the trap in a ventilated place.  The moths fly in, looking for mates, and get stuck on the stickum.  You throw the trap away when it's full.<br>  <br>  We had such a bad infestation that we had one or two traps in nearly every room of the house.  We're now down to one in the family room, and two in opposite corners of the kitchen.<br>  <br>  As for eating them:  most cultures in the world have had traditions of eating grubs and larvae of all kinds.  They are generally a *very* rich source of nutrients, and many techno-primitive villages have been spared from starvation by including grubs in their diet.  But there are pitfalls:  I'd say you might get away with eating your foods anyway, but you'd be well-advised to identify the species of moths first!|`|MrVM1T0Xaa	I would not advise eating the food. You do not know if the moths might have gotten into a chemical on the outside before coming into your home. They usually show up in the warm weather. The are usually in grainy foods and cereal. The are usually gypsy moths. I would recommend that you get rid of all of the food wipe the entire area down really well with soap and water. Make sure you get all of the webs as well. They sell traps that you can buy at your local Lowe's store or any home and garden store. They have an attractant inside that lures them to the trap. If you cant find them then you can always use the fly traps that hang from the ceiling too. Keep the food in zip lock bags and only buy what you need if you live in a warm climate.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	I was told that most grains, breads, pasta, etc would get tiny beetles and moths if kept long enough, I don't think they were in my house but came in the food that I purchased...make sure that you buy fresh food and keep it in the refrigerator or freezer|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Try one moth ball in the pantry, they are very strong so only one.

5J2sffx1aa	Your imagination will be you best ally in this case. Go to a fabric store, get a square yard (36 inches x 36 inches) of material. Any-any-any pattern you see that you like will do. Get a tube of Liquid Nails (any hardware store) Measure it to fit under the awning, then use the "Liquid Nails) as if it were glue, speadind a bead of it around the edges, and zig-zag it cross ways down your fabric. Very carefully, place it in the corners first, then very gently, smooth it the rest of the way out.|`|OlHFq87waa	Hello! I have numerous ideas..could you send me a picture of the awning? I will be able to envision it better and help you with an idea.  Some that come to mind are:  Suspend some roll-up bamboo mats/  or marine grade canvas under the awning ;  cover a piece of cardboard with contac paper, or cut a piece of lauan ( very thin sheet wood panel) and hang it very securely under the canopy; hang a custom cut piece of lattice under the awning and adorn it with artificial greenery and/or flowers to simulate a jungle or rainforest feel ;   It would be great if you could find a bamboo ( or plastic bamboo-like) shade the width of the awning and suspend it underneath...I have seen them now and then in Goodwill/Salvation army stores. You might also find them online. If you use any adhesive covered with cloth, it will be best to brush the adhesive on rather than just squeeze it or zig zag it as the imprint of the line is likely to show through the fabric.

2sqERtDVaa	Depende mucho cómo seas y qué es lo que busques, y a continuación me explico. Yo soy del DF, y viví en 3 lugares la del Valle, Coyoacán y la Condesa, y aunque las 3 eran de similar composición, son bien diferentes los vecinos y lo que hay alrededor.<br>  <br>  Aquí en Querétaro es similar. Por ejemplo, hay muchísima gente del DF que vive en Juriquilla, yo creo que el 80% de Juriquilla o más son chilangos. A mi lo que no me late es que es como un satélite wannabe, además tienes que para entrar y salir de Juriquilla tienes que tomar para todo una de las 2 avenidas más congestionadas de Querétaro, que es Av. 5 de febrero, y en Juriquilla manejan super killer como si fuera el DF.<br>  Hay otras colonias más céntricas y tranquilas que Juriquilla como álamos, Arboledas, Carretas, Loma Dorada, Pathé,  . Jurica es otra buena zona, es un ambiente más campestre que Juriquilla, pero a algunas personas les parece una colonia viejona, y las casas suelen ser más grandes y de mayor precio.<br>  <br>  Existe otro polo que pueden ser los clubes de golf como el campestre, Balvanera, Bosque Real, aunque casi todos están un poco apartados del centro (cosa que no pesa si consideras que en 20 minutos te mueves de un extremo de la ciudad al otro).<br>  <br>  También revisa Tejeda y Milenio III, aunque este último se me hace un lugar sin "personalidad". Hay muchas casas nuevas, pero yo tengo amigos que viven ahí y de repente tienen problemas de agua y además los servicios son caros ahí. Nunca ves personas caminando, como que nadie es cuate de nadie, como que todos viven aislados en su mundito, no me gusta.<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que revises una página que tiene anuncios clasificados de la ciudad y ahí pongas en búsqueda varios de los lugares que te hemos mencionados, abajo te pongo el link y espero te sirva.<br>  <br>  Saludos, chau!|`|4QXjBQOcaa	Hola Adriana, yo vivo en Queretaro y vivo en Juriquilla, es una zona linda...

dzlKclSBaa	The best answer is to plant items that are deer resistant in the first place.

Electric wire stock fence worked, but you have to have 3 wires, and the top one high! - 5-6 feet.    Deer don't like the smell of camphor (moth balls) or cigarettes. Try a weekly spraying of what plants and shrubs they go for with a water-and-dissolved-mothball + soaked-cigarette-butts "tea". (Away from the house, add in some human-male-supplied urine.)    Any kind of yappy dog. But then, you have to put up with it, too.    Put a nice, big salt block out in the far reaches.....of your neighbors property.    They understand being shot at. Obviously, that probably is not a solution you can get away with, or might not care to do. (but it worked the best)     The Sound of being "shot" at might be enough.

Gs75LPG5aa	Dear <br>     I can only guess that you will be using a free-standing electric area heater .... right? ...  The least expensive way is to set the heater at a moderate setting say about 3 if it goes to 5 max or ... 7 if it goes to 10 max, then monitor the room from a central location with a regular thermometer. Adjustments from here will be very little turn of the dial. Hope you don't have any kids or a spouse who will mess with it in your absence!!!<br>     Technically more difficult but requires no monitoring ..... Go to a store that carries H-Vac supplies and purchase a physically small mechanical thermostat rated for 120 at 20 amps and mount it to the outside of the electrical cover. Unplug the device and remove the electrical cover. In an area that will have nothing behind it drill a hole about 3/8" to 1/2" across. Be sure not to drill for the mounting screws until you have the wires on the back of the thermostat through the clearance hole you just created. Wrap the wires on the back of the thermostat where they will align with the hole with three layers of electrical tape. Self-taping screws for mounting the thermostat would be best. (intended to be used with a drill and driver for that screw, no need to pre-drill the holes)  Making sure the device is unplugged sever the hot wire between the cord you normally plug in and the first switch it goes to and splice the thermostat in at that point. The electrical connection here is critical. Be sure to use yellow wire nuts of high quality and wrap the wire nuts with electrical tape. Do not leave a lot of excess wire unsecured wire-tie excess after having formed a loop with it. Mount the cover and secure it. Turn the power off to the device and turn the thermostat all the way down. Plug in the device and turn the power switch (or switches ) on. Set the heater in a safe place and set the thermostat. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done and walk away.|`|AA10199877	The best way is with the correct heater.<br>  Servral Hardware stores carry small heaters with built in controls like.<br>  Hi/Med/Lo Fan speed.  Temp Control.  Timer (You can have it run 24/7 or only 1 to 8 hrs pending on unit)<br>  By far the best on the market right now is radiant Heaters some with fans some without.<br>  The nice things about these and other units are the temp comtrol. <br>  You can set it for 85 and it will keep working till it hits 85 then shut off Just like a furnace. ((NOTE- These units are not speedy to say the least so if you left the door or window open it will take some time for the unit to briing the room back up to temp.<br>  Make sure you know what size your room is that you want to heat. When you go to the store on the box will be a listing letting you know how big of a room it will and wont heat.<br>  All units are required to have safety devices on them so if they tilt over they will shut off. this way if you leave and your cat hits it you wont come back home to a house in flames. <br>  As with children there are no really fool proof units. There for I suggest make sure the unit is in a good area and out of reach. <br>  When you go to the store a little bit of investigation will point you in the correct way. <br>

TlfKZvWPaa	There's a couple of different things you can try:<br>  <br>  1.  Oil rings:  you can purchase either a brass or ceramic oil ring.  This ring just sits on top of a light bulb (in a lamp).  You put a few drops of scented oil (any kind...I buy them at Target usually) and turn the lamp on and the heat from the light bulb heats up the ring and you have instant lovely home smell!<br>  <br>  2.  Oil plug in's:  you can buy Glade, Renuzit, Yankee, etc. and put them in several of your home outlets.<br>  <br>  3.  Circle E Candles:  I too hate when candles don't have a lasting smell.  Circle E Candles (hard to find...I live in TX and can find them at local gift shops sometimes, but I would check Ebay or just google) are by far the absolute strongest smelling candles I've ever come across.  I always buy the scent "Bird of Paradise" and you can just take the top off and it will fragrance your home.  This candle will last forever b/c you only have to burn it for about 5 min to make the entire house smell.<br>  <br>  **Oil rings can be found out Hobby Lobby, Michaels, etc.|`|sHEEh4e4aa	Maybe you can try magnetic candles. have you tried? just one thing you have to remember is to blow them out before they burn but othre than that they stay and smell really nice! yuo might be able to find them at maybe cvs or walgreens possibly|`|mTxsJ63haa	Soy candles they are so fragrant and they linger<br>  Try "soy inspiration" I like lemonade <br>  <a href="http://www.soyinspirations.com/soyinsp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soyinspirations.com/soyinsp/</a>|`|KAFG6s5Waa	I use a candle warmer.

f6JWEBdDaa	I'm afraid that running the incorrect mix has probably damaged your saw. I don't know how long you ran it with the 50:1 mix in it, but that mix contains less oil than the 40:1 ratio. so  you may have suffered a failure of the piston, rings, cylinder, or combo of all three.

22dXVgSwaa	Sand as much of the old finish off as possible. If you have been using a polyurethane, and it has been baked by the sun, it should come off with a little work. To get the color back in the door use a good quality natural stain with UV protectors mixed in. Let stand a day or so to allow the solvents from the stain to flash off. Next use a good quality "marine varnish". This is the kind of varnish that is used on boats. Read the directions very carefully. You must sand between every coat to ensure that each coat mechanically bonds to previous coats. You should do a minimum of 2 coats, 3 coats are ideal. Anymore is just overkill. I have been building custom doors for 20 years and I haven't had a failure in finish with this method. Gloss finishes are best, because there are no additives that make the finish "softer". If you want a semi-gloss or satin finish, use those as your final coat. Every few years you need to do a maintenance coat. Clean your door with mineral spirits, lightly sand, then apply a thin topcoat.|`|AA10199877	It would be a shame to paint over the Wood.<br>  There are alot of good products out there on the market.<br>  But you have to ask for them. Sherwin williams is one that carries stain that has a great UV protecter built rite into the stain.<br>  There are other companys out there also. Look for stain with UV protecters in them. <br>  I have a customer that I redid there door 4yrs ago. He redid his door every year due to the sun. <br>  I stripped the door down and took my time and redid it. Even going to the point of a UV poly coat on it. Never the less 4yrs later it looks just as good as the 1st day I did it.|`|nKDFMoeWaa	you don't say what products you are using on it. you should go to a wood specialist (lumber yard etc -not someone at home depot) and ask them the best thing to use. having a wooden front door is like having a table outside, it has to be taken constant care of. if you dont want to do that, replace it with a steel or fibreglass door and sell the mahogany one to someone who wants to keep it that way. it would be very sad to see a beautiful door get painted!|`|gZw2Nqw3aa	No don't paint the mahogany door & don't give it away. Try using several coats of polyurethane. Let each coat dry really well & light sand between coats. That door must be wicked heavy if it's solid mahogany. Wish I had one..  |`|mP0LLMVjaa	Sanding and refinishing MIGHT help and using a UV poly but it won't last long. I would paint it. Wipe it down with some sanding deglosser and then some TSP. Prime with oil-based Kilz-It and Paint with a good exterior enamel paint.|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	 A mixture of linseed oil and turpentine applied on a very hot day would be what I would use.This will make it darker colored but  too it will preserve the wood for sure.You may want to check with someone who does furniture restorations first though.|`|mqUaiNeUaa	Generally speaking, all clear finishes will not last as long as paint.  I would say 4 years versus 7 years.  If you wish to keep the mahogany exposed(not painted) the above posters are pretty much correct.  I would use a spar urethane applying at least 2 coats and maybe 3.  It should look fabulous!<br>  One other thing you might look into is to shade the door from direct sunlight--that would extend the life of the door finish quite a bit.  Good luck.|`|AA11228933	 The sun can affect this and especially if there is a glass door in front. It can be an easy bake oven in there if there is no way for the heat to escape.<br>  Try a marine paint store for the best quality stains or varnish with UVA inhibitors..|`|107edac54d5036be2b7be8f24972702faa	I'd stain it and then use a special clear sealer with UV protection.

P18qCOtxaa	Try goo gone. It dissolves substances such as paint. It needs to be rinsed from the carpet after using to remove the product.<br>  <br>  Apply goo gone and let it sit for a few minutes.

Make sure you rinse 100% of the product from the carpet. If you leave the goo gone in the carpet it will delaminate the carpet causing the carpet to separate from backing.

You can take steps to keep the heat in like put plastic over your windows and put something on the in front of doors that go to the outside to prevent drafts.    It sounds like your dryer is on the way out.  If you can get your landlord to replace it a newer one might be more energy efficient. However most of your cost is probably coming from heat    you might try getting a kerosene heater for about $150. They really warm up an area fast.|`|4Ugrxl2vaa	Yes!

If you can not do it yourself, call a plumber. it will run $149-$300, depending on your location.|`|AA11112165	Its best to pull out the obstruction.  Here are some good ways.  Seal one side and make a tight seal on the other with a wet-dry vac.    Use a plastic zip line. $4  Use a flexible retrieval grasper ($1-$4)  You can also try carefully pouring boiling water down the drain  Baking soda vinegar and a tight seal work well also.
omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "smoky blue" (  7604) might be a good choice.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|ZCltHQpzaa	Light Yellow.      Actually just paint it whatever color YOU like.  Are the appliances white or colored?  Is there a sink with counter top?  You would want to coordinate with those if you need to.      It sounds like you like lighter colors.  That's a good thing especially since the laundry room is probably small.|`|yTlZPmdjaa	Do a tan or an olive green color !|`|OedbpoJvaa	a light peach|`|WS2HAJe1aa	eggplant...eggplant....eggplant only if your appliance colors are white or red....have fun with it...........be creative|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	How about a buttery yellow? It's cheerful and would work with your other colors.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Research the street it's on,  or the bigger streets that are nearby.  You might get lucky and get some old vintage pics.  Also,  check with your local historical landmark guild,  or society, or league, or whoever's in charge of that because,  if you could get your place designated as an historical landmark,  you'll be sittin' pretty as I believe you would be property tax exempt,  AND,  you can get government loans and even grants to restore it and/or maintain it!

xNOloeJgaa	Every night, I "plant" my "two-lips" up against my wife's.|`|J4W68owgaa	I live in MN, so it might be a tad different for me.    I have planted tulips and other bulbs. I usually do it in the fall right before the first frost and I've never had a problem with them being dug up. When I've planted them in the spring/summer however, they get dug up.    Tulips are incredibly easy to grow.|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	yes|`|EpCOXauLaa	Yes every fall.  I dig them up carefully separate the bulbs and then plant them again. In the spring the flower naturally grows without much effort. They are my favourites it is a shame they don't last the year.|`|Je43PBM6aa	Darnit I tried last year and the freakin' squirrels dug the bulbs up and ate them, I already feel like one of those crazy old lady's chasing them with my broom!! Gosh I'm only 23. I hope if you plant them it goes better for you : )|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Yes.|`|HZyDPv32aa	Yes! I planted them on fall, when bulbs were on sale. I bought 3 bags. (150 bulbs total). The squirrel dug and ate some of the bulbs. I hope  the squirrel left some for me.|`|AA12355632	I live close to Houston---we have to chill our bulbs in the fridge for 6-8 weeks before planting them from Christmas to about Valentine's Day.  Bulbs need to be about 6" deep, put bulb food in bottom of hole and cover with a layer of sand (fertilizer cannot touch bulb). Sometimes they come back for one year. Try Dutch Gardens next year---they have HUGE bulbs at good prices.
EXpaRBsyaa	If you want truly automatic buttonholes, electronics has to be involved in some way.  You still have to inform the machine what length you want the buttonhole, even with electronics.  Does the machine have to be computerized?  Well, there are a number of less expensive machines out there that have a mechanical arrangement built in to automatically reverse the feed to sew both sides of the buttonhole and add a bartack at the beginning and end of the buttonhole.  Since there is a small amount of electronics involved, you could say it is computer based, but it isn't really as it uses a special buttonhole foot that mechanically causes a lever to move, which closes a switch that causes another lever to move which reverses the feed.  Complicated sounding, isn't it!?!  It's not really, as once you make a buttonhole to the length you want, all you have to do is move the fabric and start sewing the number of buttonholes you want.  They will all be the same length as the original.|`|4Ugrxl2vaa	I would think so.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	The machine has a buttonhole attachment, something like this one - http://www.sewingmachinesplus.com/media/...       The machine does not do the process alone, you are involved.

2zhQznahaa	If you haven't used it within the past year + 1/2 throw it out.  I saw that on Trading spaces.    Also buy totes, and really ...  well there are certain things you can do.  Get hanging organizors for your closet, and also, What I liked to do at one place, was I lost the lid for a tote, but I dont really like stacking totes on top of totes and totes, so what I did was put a piece of sawed wood between two totes, because they'll dip or bubble when you put 2 on top of each other, and Im an@l, so I like everything OCD controlled.    I dunno.  Just put things where they should go, not where its comfy that they fall.|`|AA10097817	Face your closed door. Start to the right of the door and work clockwise around the room. Work from top to bottom, 15 min at a time. Every 15 min move to the right, again working from top to bottom. After 45 min, take a 15 min break, then start in again. Keep going around and around the room until you feel it is done. If you haven't changed the sheets yet, do it when you're done. Take a shower, go to bed in your nice clean sheets and bedroom.    Remember, you can't organize clutter. You need to decide what items you use and the items you love. Give away the items that are still good, throw away the rest.    You can do it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	eliminate the clutter -donate or toss the stuff you don't want or use.  invest in containers for the rest of the stuff.  return things once you're done using them & quit buying things.|`|AA10526402	You probably either have too much stuff or a bunch of dirty laundry.  So, throw any clothes into the wash and then put away.  Then, go through the rest of the stuff and put half of it away and donate the other half to charity (or throw away if it is just junk).  Then, vacuum your nice clean floor.    To keep it clean, either put your clothes away or straight into the laundry basket when you change into your pjs.  And, make a rule that nothing goes on the floor - put it back where it belongs.|`|4Ugrxl2vaa	Unfortunately, you will have to clean it thoroughly first. Then it's as simple as cleaning up after yourself as you make a mess.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Your vent pipe shouldn't have a leak in it.<br>  If it does, sewer gasses can be coming into your home.<br>  You'll have to find where it's leaking and fix it.<br>  <br>  If it's just leaking around the pipe,<br>  use some Henry's Roof Cement or an equivalent to seal around the pipe at the roof.|`|fac67a37f8db05650acc85a39ff5915caa	where is the vent? in the floor or ceiling? 1st floor? because im thinking the toilet or shower drain might be leaking into the vent. get under the bathroom and look at the plumbing and figure out what is what, then make a decision on whats leaking. toilets are the worst, esp right where the bowls attaches to the tank.
