20090227102605AAljfJk	Health;Dental	Does filing down a tooth hurt?	My toddler (2 years) has a broken front tooth which probably needs some minor filing. Does this hurt? Because he is not exactly co operating with anything,so I'm hoping it doesn't hurt. Either way he won't co operate,but it will be good to know how painful it is. It only needs some minor filing. It hurts him when he touches it with his tongue. (obviously because of his age he won't listen to me telling him to not do that)

20090227102848AAnfM8F	Health;Mental Health	Ive got some sort of on/off OCD going on...?	Hey guys... I'm getting really pissed about this situation...      So my dad brings home a puppy (unsure what kind) I guess since my little sister wanted one...(We already have like, a ton of outside cats..)      I'll spare you guys a long story I just wrote, but then decided it'll just drive you guys away since it was so long. To shorten things up,    I was in my room, peaceful and fine.    My dad brought a puppy home, cracked my door open and let him in to surprise me.(I was awake at the time too.)   It was whining and wandering my room for about 10 seconds, so I stopped it in its tracks and picked it up. It reeked of outside, and a bit of wet dog...   After asking my dad what the hell he was doing with a dog, I told him to take it out of my room, since it smelled bad...      Now I'm feeling a bit of my 'selective OCD' (meaning it only comes up in certain situations...)    The dog was in my room, and I don't know if it has peed anywhere, or that stuff. He was only in here for about a minute tops, but now I just can't explain it.. I'm pissed off now, I think it might start smelling like dog in here... It's like i want to sterilize my whole room, but then I don't, because all my possessions are in here and... ugh.....      Heres the thing: I HATE when someone is in my room. I can't stand when anyone touches any of my stuff. If someone I knew touched my food, I'll just go and trash it.   I feel like I might go insane right now... Before any of this I was peaceful and serene. I just want it to all go away.. I dont know what to do. Ive tried telling myself 'the dog didn't do anything while it was in here...' but it doesn't work... I want to drive someones head through a wall right now.. I wasnt even expecting a dog to begin with (even though it isnt mine) and i dont want anything to do with it...

He has eliminated diary products from his diet and has been on a vegetarian kind of diet with helathy fats such as flaxseed and fish oils and immune boosters. He had his third chemo today and the doctors told him to come for a blood examination on monday, why is this done and is it done to every cancer patient?

20090227103457AAIWEvB	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Deep gash on leg, need assistance asap.?	While moving a very large fish tank, the tank got dropped and I fell on one of the large slivers of glass. I have a gash on the middle of my lower leg directly over my tibia. I can see that the cut went down into the actual muscle. I stopped the bleeding very quickly though, and have since bound the wound together at the "seams" with a combination of sterile gauze pad and duct tape. I have no numbness or loss of control in the leg and toes below the wound. Although it obviously hurts, I can still put weight and walk on the leg.      I have no insurance. I have no real money to speak of. So I have these questions.      Calling and subsequently trying to pay for an ambulance is a last resort only if I'll die from this. So is it safe to at least wait until my housemate can get home from work in an hour or two to drive me to the hospital?      More importantly, do I REALLY need to go to the hospital? I know that lack of stitches can leave a godawful scar. But are there any other really important reasons to get them if I'm no longer bleeding?

Ive been dating my boyfriend for over a year ( 1 year and 8 months ) and he just broke up with me yesterday :/ He said i've changed,i've put him down too many times and i'm not the same person I was. He said i have issues and am controlling and i dont give him his freedom yet i can have all the freedom i want. I know its unfair,but i cant help it...here's the problems we share..         - I get mad when he goes to spend the night at a friends house because I want him to myself so we can spend the night and sleep on the phone like we usually do      - I think that he flirts with his best friends girlfriends,one of them is actually his ex from forever ago. But i think shes so ... awesome.. that they have so much in common,and she could steal him from me if she wanted to,he assures me its dead though :/      - I get mad at him for stupid things,and i shut him out. I give him silent treatments when he asks whats wrong,disrespect him by saying F*CK YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME, and put guilt trips on him and am manipulative i guess you could say.      -He has cheated on me before, when he was drunk. I don't take it as an excuse,im not over it yet...this was back in aug. and i take it out on him,like bring it up when we fight :/         I really love him,believe me. I cried so hard for hours yesterday. I begged him to take me back,and after hours of reasoning he agreed that we take a break for a few weeks,and If i really meant what i said that i would change,he would take me back         I really do want to change.I hate losing him due to my anger issues, i want to prove to him the old girl he fell in love with is still there:/ i love him so much. I want to change,can anyone please tell me tips on how to control my anger.To stop acting the way i do,so it can clear up so much and let us move forward in our relationship? Thanks so much:/

20090227110958AA8MI3U	Health;Alternative Medicine	How Does Lack Of Sleep Affect Me?	Okay...so as know parents always complain when their children go to sleep late and that lack of sleep has a negative impact on your body. I normally wake up around 8:00AM and go to sleep around 2:00AM, this is a total of around 6 hours of sleep, yet as I go to school and such, I still manage to keep my concentration, I don't fall asleep in school, I do all my homework, keep to deadlines, I'm not grouchy or easy to anger and I'm not a delinquent by the way in case your wondering. An interesting question is how do I manage to do that when sleep has that great of an effect on the human body? As well as, by changing the time I go to sleep to an earlier time, not only will it upset my sleeping pattern and could set off something, but it'll put me in a negative mood all day and I don't manage to get all me homework in on time. (I know this since I've been trying to change it, but so far that's all that has happened) Plus do you think it's a good idea to change my sleeping pattern especially now that I'm used to it and I've got my GCSEs coming up soon?

20090309184544AADCZ2n	Health;Women's Health	Ortho tricyclen, lo-ovral, tri-sprintec, ortho tricyclen lo, lo-estrin, or Yaz? which worked best for you?	I've been breaking out due to my PCOS. and gaining weight. I wonder which among all this pills work best for you. I first used ortho-tricylen and help clear my face. then I stop and they switched me to lo-ovral but the gyn didnt recommend it for acne. instead she prescribed me lo-estrin. But I heard that ortho tricyclen and yaz are good.  when I went get ortho tricyclen to the pharmacy they changed it to generic brand which is tri sprintec and now my zits are like cyst that just stay for more than 2 weeks..      If none of this that I mention then what b.c pills work best for you esp on acne? and if losing weight is true, then what work best for you?      thanks

Whenever I try to sing even a little high, air just comes out! I'm a bit worried that it might not come back if I don't do anything now, and I depend on my voice in my school choir.

I bled so much I almost became anemic. I knew something was wrong. After having a pelvic exam I was diagnosed with having fibroid tumors (2 small ones) in my uterus. So my doctor put me on the pill for 3months to slow down the bleeding and unbearable cramps. During those 3 months everything was perfect. Now this is my first cycle off the pill and I feel sick to my stomach. I bled so much that while in the movie theatre I bled through my underwear and jeans. It really scared me because this had never happened to me. I had never seen that much blood.

What other options are there so I can have more children later...and if I have surgery what are my chances of having a child later?   SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY! Thank You

I am hope the D & C will help. I am also looking into a Nova-sure Ablation and I understand the information to say you must use contraception to prevent conceiving. Does that also mean that if the embryos and sperm were zyogted in a petri dish that I could not carry the child full term unless some of the lining were left behind on accident ( I have two friends unable to either get pregnant or carry a pregnancy without 30% chance of death). The two surrogacies will not be for at least a year or more. Im just looking at my options. Also if the ablation is far enough in the past is it possible for new lining to form?

My pain management doctor discharged me from his clinic for smoking cannabis while being on the Fentanyl patches.  I wear them for the recommended 72 hours and change them.  I smoke cannabis regularly for instant relief and to keep pain in check.  I've never experienced any problems doing this, but I really want to know if there are any drug interactions between the two and if so what they are.  Are there any positives?  Was my doctor just being a doctor and basically saying that cannabis has no medical value?

20090309185008AAN6lW9	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Should I worry about my daughters toenail falling off?	I have a 7 year old daughter who recently had a blister on her big toe near the nail bed. That popped and went away (put a plaster on it and antibiotic ointment) and looked like everything was fine. Now however it looks like the toenail is coming away from the toe and it's reddish (not infected looking but bruised looking) near the nail bed. She claims it dosn't hurt & she still has feeling on that toe. So should I be worried? Is going to a Dr necessary? and/or what can I do to help her out?       I've been trying for 2 days now to get her into a Dr but wait times here are ridiculous, all walk in clinics need a phone call daily to make an appointment (and today their main line was down), add to this I work a job where I really can't be missing for long hrs (preventing me from taking her to the hospital directly where non-emerg's have an average wait time of 8 hrs)...yeah so this is why I'm looking here for the info.   Help is greatly appreciated. I've been on-hold for almost 2hrs right now with the medicine hot line nurse trying to get answers.

On Friday, my throat was hurting so I called my mom and told her, and she goes absolutely World War III. I end up staying home, and she scheduled a full body physical for me on 3/17/09   And, I don't feel like I should have this done over a one day sore throat.   I mean, maybe if it was just the xrays, and the other things they usually do, and NOT the blood test, then maybe I'd be ok with it. BUT BLOOD TEST IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! No, I'm not afraid there is something wrong with my blood, it's just I have had blood taken before and it's really painful and last time they did it they did it 7 times, because it's really hard to get blood out of me, and I don't want to deal with that pain again, espesially when its unnecessary...    anyone know how I can get out of it?

I sometimes feel like my dentist looks at me like a pile of cash and when searching for cavities after a cleaning, I think he may be pushing with the scraper a bit hard.  Couldn't this scraper, or whatever it's called, make an indentation into the pit of a molar and encourage food to get stuck there, while also thinning the enamel in that spot?      I've heard of friend's dentists suggesting they get sealant to fill deep pits, but not mine, I think he's digging for dollars.  Why wouldn't a dentist suggest a sealant to prevent cavities, and can too much pressure damage teeth?

I'm 20 years old i have 3 kids( Yes i made some bad decisions in my life but im being responsible about them now =)  ) So Im going to college and doing modeling.

It's 'cause my marks didn't satisfy my parents, I'm working harder now, so please do not criticize me on this.   Well anyways, I would hang out with my friends 3 or 4 times a week. We would walk EVERYWHERE. I'd get a few hours of walking in every day. Now, being grounded, the only exercise I get is a 20 minute walk to school, 20 minute walk back, and PE every 2nd day, but right now we are doing swing dancing which is not as much of a workout as sit-ups/push-ups/jogging. :p They won't let me go out with friends anywhere and I don't like to jog because it's like taking a really big knife, cutting open your chest, scraping around the insides of yourself, spraying lemon juice and vinegar on the cuts on your insides, throwing chalk dust all around, then sewing yourself back up... So I pretty much like to stick to walking... What on earrrrrrrrth can I do?! I can't go out ANYWHERE!!! D: I hate being cooped up like this. And I can't just convince them to let me go out. Please help. :(
20090309201925AA8rUEe	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What does it mean when your heart palpitates to much?	I have polycythemia, a blood condition where my bone marrow produces to many red blood cells. I was diagnosed with it last spring 2008. Sometimes my heart would palpitate every so often. But, lately whenever it does palpitate, it hurts when it beats really hard and it feels like I have shortness of breath. I hope it's not my blood condition causing this. I've been praying for healing and changing my diet. I would try to exercise more but it seems like when I do something that requires a lot of physical energy it starts to palpitate. I tried to give blood today but the nurses said that they couldn't find a vein in my arms, so I got worried about myself. I had to go to my friends and family for help in this situation. What could be the culprit?

20090309205457AAa2yhp	Health;Diet & Fitness	Question About Abs! I Want A Six Pack! I'm A 15 Year Old Female, Perfect Weight, What Am I Doing Wrong?!?	I'm 15 years old and I've been working out since the middle of last year (2008) I am about 117 pounds. What I don't understand is that when I stand up, my stomach is flat and toned-looking with a little definition to it, but when I sit down, I look like I've got quite a belly. I'm not fat at all or over weight/under weight, and in the morning obviously my stomach is empty from fasting so it is flat when I sit down.    Other than the mornings, every time I sit, I look chubby. My question is, do I have to work all that off before getting a six pack? I do cardio, the treadmill, ab lounge, crunches, curls, planks, dumbells, resistance bands, I dance, all that, the whole shebang.       I'm sweating while on the treadmill, doing floor crunches and ab lounge crunches, it hurts like hell but since I am toning up slowly, Its starting to feel good (almost like a good stretch) every time I do crunches and short repititions as I flex my ab muscles. I'm seeing a slight line going down my upper abs, is this the start of a six pack? Or am I mistaken?       Thanks!         Also, Here is a picture of my abs from yesterday. Excuse the scars, they are from a surgery.        http://img22.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...

20090309200811AAwwdZS	Health;Women's Health	Nausea & Frequent Urination in Woman...?	Hi.  The past couple days have been a little aggravating.  Im not sure if this is hormone related as I am suppose to start my period on Thursday (3/12).  I am getting a little nauseous after eating and actually threw up last night after dinner.  This afternoon I ate some rice for lunch and felt queasy but no trip to the restroom.  My main thing is the constant urination!  It is ONLY early afternoon/evening and NOT in the middle of the night.  I am not getting up to go any more than I normally do (which is once- if that) but from around 4ish to 10pm, its almost every 20 minutes.  It does not hurt or burn in any way and it is not just a dribble.  I go a decent amount each time.  I have noticed over the months that the week or two before my period has been so different and I experience symptons that are pretty new.  Im just wondering if anyone can relate to this or if there is someone out there that thinks they could give some advice.  Im wondering if its a pms thing, sign of pregnancy (I have a 17 month but every pregnancy is different) or as much as I dont want to think this but, diabetic or some other medical issue.   Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read and would love to hear responses.

At my college a bug is going around, and in the past I've used a product called Emergen-C that is a Vitamin supplement packet you mix with water, it has about 1,000mg of Vitamin C and I would take about 3-4 a day (like the box says to).  However, I found a bottle of Vitamin C supplements and its a lot cheaper, but the bottle says only to take one per day.        Would it be perfectly safe to take two or more of the 500mg supplements a day?  With the emergen-c I think i was totally about 4,000mg of Vitamin C a day, so yeah...      Thanks ahead of time.

I started feeling like I was getting the flu a bit over a week ago, sore limbs, dry cough (no phlegm) etc, generally like I was getting the flu (not a cold)      So I went to the doctor and told him I couldn't be out of action with full blown influenza so he gave me the strongest antibiotics he could (Zedd).      I took them all but I kept getting sicker. When it started getting cold last night my cough got wet and phlegmy a little, so I went to bed.      I woke up and I literally couldn't breath at all, my entire chest felt full and stung and air couldn't get it, my boyfriend whacked my back so I could get some air and I inhaled steam a bit so I could breath.      Went to the doctor today and he said he didn't know what was wrong with me and gave me amoxicillin, I know that should clear my chest.      I'm just worried about what the hell it could be? Just a really resistant flu? The doctor didn't speak great English and is a bit flippant, so I'm still worried!!

It's so embarrassing, I always try to wash before I engage in sexual activities. If I can smell it NO DOUBT he can. I've did research and most sources say that women have sweat glands, as they do in their arm pits and it can create the odor. To wash with just warm water.

I've been checked for STD's and infection. I don't have any. What can I do? My boyfriend loves going down on me. Its really weird for me because I always feel like he can smell it. And it's not a fishy odor.. it's more like a musty odor. Please help!!

Now you get a picture of my daily life, I know it is horrible but I'm working on it. Anyways... To the more serious problems.      1st Problem :: For 2 years I've been suffering from stomach problems. I seem to always have a pain or uncomfortable feeling in my stomach, it got so bad that I had to drop out of High School. Tons of medical tests but nothing has shown to help. Recently it seems to not be as bad but I have noticed when I pee, I feel like I got to pee more and try to push and it feels like my stomach/bladder area is very tight.      2nd Problem :: More recently I've been suffering from some heart/chest related problems. I feel my heart stuttering, like it skipped a beat, and when I do something to raise my heart rate I have a vibration feeling around my heart. The left side of my chest gets very tight and feels like I got asthma, only on the left side though.      3rd Problem :: My ears seem to be very sensitive to cold, I was driving to the store today and had my window down in 70 degree weather and my left ear was hurting, it seems more recently they have gotten sensitive to cold.      4th Problem :: Just recently like a week ago I noticed a small lymph node like bump behind my left ear and under my left nipple. Don't know whats the cause of this.      I seem to be in bad shape with no answers, so I turn to Yahoo. What do you guys think about this any ideas to what might be causing this?

I had a pretty hard time with the recovery but overall everything went well.  I went back to my ENT doctor last week for a post-op check up and asked him about white spots I've been having on my tonsils for awhile.  I had mentioned them to him in past visits but he told me it was probably just a virus.  They are hard and I get them on almost a daily basis.  After explaining to him more about them, he looked in my throat and told me I had tonsil stones.  He said that the only way to get rid of them is to have my tonsils taken out.   Has anyone had both of these surgeries?  I was wondering what the pain level was on a tonsillectomy compared to a septoplasty.  My doctor told me that it would be pretty painful and I'm trying to decide if I should have it done or not.   Any advice??

I can’t afford to get a removable retainer and I’m wondering if I can let it come out without risking permanent damage. My teeth weren’t really bad to begin with and the biggest problems were solved when I had my wisdom teeth taken out about a year before they put my braces in. I'm pretty sure that the ortodontists went ahead and put the braces in just to space my teeth a little better since i had more room in my mouth. My teeth have never had in problems with turning they just said my mouth was too small for all my teeth so i'm not even sure if the retainer is doing anything.

I'm a 28 year-old virgin (I believe in waiting until marriage), so I know I'm not pregnant. My periods have always been regular, even when I played varsity basketball in high school. I can only remember one time when I was around 15 where I skipped a month. Since then, my periods are almost 100% predictable, including PMS. I've been experiencing PMS symptoms for close to two weeks now (it usually starts about a week before my period starts). Everyday I feel a little crampy, and I'm bloated. But nothing is happening. It concerns me because this isn't normal for me. I guess periods can be late, and I have been stressed out, and suffered a 24 hour virus in the last few days. Should I be concerned enough to see a doctor? I'm out of town until May, so I can't see my regular doc - I'd really rather not have to anyway.

20090309222812AAoeeaF	Health;Other - Health	How can I stop smoking marijuana?	I have been smoking for about six months now, and I'm starting to feel the effects. I used to smoke a few times a week, then every day, but now it's about two times a day, sometimes more.   I smoke very good weed, and my closest friends are big stoners. So everyone I'm around is usually smoking. Don't get me wrong, they are great people, and they have been smokers for much longer than I have. They handle themselves very well when high, but I don't think I function very well stoned. Now I seem to be less motivated. I used to be actively involved in sports and loved playing them. I still do, but it's so much harder for be to being myself to get the energy to do the things. I skip school sometimes to just take a break and be lazy, and I don't do my homework very much. I'm tired a lot and I just don't see much reason to get up and put a lot of effort into things.   I have become psychologically addicted to marijuana...but I don't see it as a really bad thing. I love music more, I love art and poetry now. I think about things a lot and find meaning in a lot of things...like life. I even enjoy things more like little things like being alone or writing. I love the calming effect of smoking...I think in my very busy life, it just helps a lot. I'm always busy after school and on the weekends with extracurricular activities or working. I think my packed schedule is why I have become so dependent on weed. It's basically what gets me through my day, like a reward.      But I feel like the negatives outweigh the positives. The whole laziness and no motivation has really started to get bad.      I need some advice on what to do, and the best methods to cope with quitting or even cutting down. I appreciate any advice.

This has me concerned. Is it safe to mask the pain without knowing it's origin?

(also, I had a round of chemo and radiation about a year before this started for cervical cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. The Dr. doesn't seem to think there is any connection)

My wrist has skin, fat, and muscle atrophy (it's sunken in ). Anyway, he went through my throat, the first injection I felt in my back next to my shoulder blade. Then the next three I didn't really feel anything. When I got back to the room he said I should have immediate relief of pain. I said my arm feels numb everywhere but where my injury is. He said that should not have happened. He said I should have full use of my arm. Waited 30 minutes, my arm up to my elbow was paralyzed. They put it in a sling, asked if I still had pain, I said yes. He canceled my other two appts. said it didn't work and said the feeling in my arm will be back in about 6 hours. I told him about the feeling in my back on the 1st injection, again he said that should not have happened. The pain kept me up all night, today I'm in more pain than when I went in, and I have pain in that area in my back. My PCP, nor the Dr. that did the block will answer these questions-Why was my injury site and above it the only part not numb? Why does my back hurt? What do I do next? I asked him these yesterday, he shook his shoulders and left the room (never saw him again ). I asked my PCP and called his office again today I don't know or that's not my profession are the popular answers. Does ANYONE know?

Will it make my results more or less accurate?   Also, can they detect brain tumours with this? My mother wants me to ask for an MRI, cause she thinks I have a brain tumour. I don't want to ask for something that the doc is all ready testing for.

20090309113314AAAtYh9	Health;Mental Health	Is there any mental disorder that can cause massive self-destructive urges?	I was prescribed prozac for depression but had to stop taking it as I had horrible reactions and feelings from it and ended up in hospital.Honestly although I can be depressed,Im not convinced whether or not I have depression.One of my biggest problems is just big self destructive urges.Like I stopped eating properly for about 2 years,and that was after I made an effort to stop self harming,so it was just like I switched from one thing to another.   When I went out a few months ago,I drank so much I blacked out and hurt myself,which I had to go to the hospital about.      Before that I took cocaine that a random stranger gave me in a club,I drank a lot too.I also had unprotected sex with a stranger,which I am ashamed of.I did these things on differint nights mostly.      I first deliberarly harmed myself at 11 so feeling like this isint totally recent.      Is there any mental disorder that causes massive self-destructive feelings?      I have an appointment next week with my doc to talk about the prozac reaction,but he knows none of this stuff,is there anything a doctor can really do to help in this situation?      I would like to be more open with the doc but its hard in a 10 minute formal situation.

I've had my period for just about 3 years now. It was usually always on time and stuff. & Now it's changed completely.       3 days before Christmas Eve, I got my period 2 days early. I got horrible horrible horrible[!!!] stomach pains that felt somewhat like the worst cramps ever. I then had to go to the hospital a few days later because it hurt so much I couldn't sleep or do anything at all.    Last Month, my period came 2 days early. And I got my horrible horrible stomach/cramps pain back again.   This month, my period came 3 days late. I woke up crying because the pain hurt so much. I put a heating pad and took some advil but it didn't help until I took NyQuil to help my cough. and that made my tired. The other week in my class, they came and I almost started crying. My teacher noticed and gave me some midol to take.      I mean nothing really helps at all! I've taken advil, midol, tried the hot baths, heating pads, and I exercise too!      Now, my period is 'supposed' to be due on the 18th this month. I'm terrified of the pain! My mom knows and she said I need to get some medical help as in seeing a gynecologist or my regular doctor. But, I think she has forgotten! How do I bring this up to her?   Would they put me on birth control if I go to the doctor?

I've had it used on me by a girl, and it's like it can't be blocked. You can't even move cuz the way she will stand is confusing. At least i know it confused me so i couldn't. But do a lot of girls use this move? Have you had to?
20090310014018AAlBuNz	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Advice: Should I be concerned?	Well its not really an illness but I am ill but I cant seem to work out what it is and if I should be concerned. I'll try and write about it as much as I can in detail to see if anyone can well just give me advice.   By the way, it looks like a lot of writing... it isnt haha.      So, my name is Courtz (that doesnt matter though) and im 13.      Last monday before i went bed i felt sick (not like i was gonna be sick but just sick), i slept and it passed and i was fine in the morning.   It happened everynight, on Friday and Saturday i had dance shows coming up which i was going to sing in (which is a first for me).    1 show on the friday, 2 shows on the saturday.    I felt really sick again, mum says it was nerves but im normally fine and full of confidence.    My mate was feeling ill aswell, she had been ill for about 3 days.    After the first dance on the friday i was fine.    Saturday morning i felt ill and when it came to the shows i felt like i was gonna be sick.    I did the shows i wasnt 100% but i managed.    Sunday came felt sicky all day.    Yesterday (monday) i felt really bad, i slept loads and everything.    I kept going from warm to apsolutly freezing.    Later on I was fine, ate dinner felt bit bad again felt better went bed felt horrible.    I got about 1 hours sleep today.    I couldnt go sleep last night cos i felt so sick, i couldn't lay down cos i felt so ill and everything.    I went so cold through the whole night, goosebumps and my hair stuck (on my arms if that makes sense).    I feel really sick today i cant move too quick.    I don't know if it was just nerves from the show with the excitement or if i'm just really hungry or if i've caught some bug or if its just a little thing that will pass and sounds pathetic. I'd say bug but are bugs this long!      Can i have some advice please.      Thank youu   Courtz x

I do about every other night but it seems that the level or amount of ejaculate and sperm is so small that I don't think I could have a child if I wanted to make one.  Is there something wrong with me that I don't produce much sperm any more.  I am in my early 50's.  I have talked to friends about this problem and they don't seem to have any problem with the amount they can produce.  Is there any advice?  Believe it or not 50 is not old and Grand Pa and Grand ma still do it so what is my problem.      Some times I can go for weeks without masturbation and the amount is always the same.  Whats up with my health?

(like what?) "I dont know, but oww it hurts." (does it burn?) "No, like BOOM BOOM" So I freaked and called the doctor's after hours line and he said bring her in tomorrow, but if she starts crying from the pain or acts out of character go to the E.R.....We went out to dinner and she was fine and also told me "That thing with my heart went away Mommy!" so i'm bringing her to the doctor tomorrow but just to put my nerves to rest i need ADVICE!!!! lol Thanx guys!

20090309235840AAu8dDE	Health;Mental Health	Do people with emotional trauma stress, normally break off relationships? If so, do they come back to them?	My girlfriend of a year recently broke off a relationship with me, saying she loves me, but doesn't know if she is in love with me.  She then went on to state that she was not being fair to me, because she needed to work on herself.  She has been depressed, in a stressful job, little to no time for herself (not because of me, I encourage it), she stopped doing all of the things that made her happy when we first met.  She sees a counselor, weekly and takes antidepressants.  We started out as friends before we ever entered a relationship with each other.  I deeply love her and know that she does me as well, but she says she is numb emotionally.  She shows nothing towards anything.  I am showing her unconditional love, even without the relationship.  I have told her that I am in love with her, that I want to be with her and I am going to help her.  My question is this...is this normal for people with this to call off relationships?  We were fine one day, laughing and talking about a future, then over a course of a week, it started going downhill.  She became distant, angry with me, verbally abused me when she was angry.  (No, I am not  going to allow someone to verbally abuse me, I called it out and she understood what she had done, with the help of the counselor. I have been there, done that and will NEVER take that trip again)  Am I the one that needs a counselor for sticking by her?  Do they normally come back into the relationships after they realize what is going on?  She doesn't want me out of her life and will state, I did nothing wrong.  The counselor told her I needed to be a part of her life, that I was great for her, but that we needed a break for now.  She claims she can't handle a relationship at this time.  Can someone make sense of this please???  I am truly confused.  By the way, I am not a teenager.  Was in a civil union for many years (10), so I am aware that it is not puppy love.  :)

My son Carson is 16 years old, lately he’s been doing stuff he wouldn’t do staying out late, drinking, an he started smoking, an doing drugs, I know he an his girlfriend are having sex an this year he’s been kicked out of 3 very good private schools. His girlfriend is 18 years old she lives in her own apartment, there is nothing we can do about his relationship with her. As my son said if we do something or try an keep them apart he will leave an never talk to us again. As The age of sexual consent in Canada is 16 years old. And because she is 18 years old she falls in the (close-in-age law) witch has exemption of less than five years, which permits teens to engage in consensual sex with a partner who is less than five years older as long as the older partner is not in a position of trust or authority and the relationship is not exploitive  We tried everything to put him on the right track, like took his cell phone away, an his car, his computer, xbox, stopped giving him his $1,500 allowance, buying him cloths, everything he has nothing in the house. But his girlfriend bought him a new cell phone an he uses her car buys him cloths. I don’t know what to do anymore I need some advice?

I have always found it reliable in relieving my period cramps and lighten the bleeding  and have never had a problem with it. A few months ago, due to money issues, I stopped taking it. In January I went back on my pill. However, since I have gone back on my old medicine, for the past 3 months every time I'm in the middle of the cycle, I start spotting. It lasts for about 2-3 days and then goes away. My period also comes a lot later then it used to; When my month pack is up it usually takes me 3 days to get my period, it now takes 5 and almost 6! Is it possible that my body changed for the few months I stopped taking the pill? As I said before, I have never had a problem so I find this very strange.

20090310011736AAyhn2i	Health;Mental Health	I always have to pee, affecting my sleep. 18 Years old.?	Ever since I was about 10 years old Ive always had to pee 3-4 times before I went to sleep. Now I still have to pee 2-3 times before I sleep and its only a couple of drops then when I'm lying down to sleep it still feels like I have to pee and I never really feel satisfied. I always usually wake up about 4 hours into my sleep to pee and then again in the morning. When I pee in the morning it feels like I almost have to run to the bathroom because my bladder is so full and I always have to pee pretty badly at times that cut into my sleep schedule. Ive found my self extremely tired for about a year now and have privately had a condition of fatigue which really eats at my motivation.      I'm a personal trainer and workout 6 days a week and have very good diet habits. I used to drink a gallon of water a day and have tried cutting back for my problem. Ive even tried not drinking water about 3 hours before I go to sleep and still nothing.      I went to my doctor about 6 months ago and all he did was snicker and said that I'm way to young for any bladder problem and sent me on my way, but I'm also beginning to question my doctor due to my last visit when I had a condition of congestion and all he did was come in the room and give me 3 different prescriptions without doing any tests or anything.      Even when I'm not sleeping or going to sleep I still find my self going to the bathroom sometimes to let out a small amount of pee because it feels like I have to. I've thought about going to see a shrink to see if its physiological. Ive also suffered with premature ejaculation for years which is another sign of an over reactive bladder.      I'm going to start taking Saw Palmetto to see If I get any results. If anyone has any insights for me I would be very appreciative.

20090227113312AAFBuMl	Health;Mental Health	Was prescribed bipolar medication...but I'm not bipolar. Need advice.?	Yesterday was the first visit to a pshychiatrist in my entire life. He recomended medication and perscribed Lamictal for me. I had no idea what this drug was but we agreed I'd give it a go. When I got home, I did some research on the drug and discovered that it is an anticonvulsant perscribed for controlling/treating epilepsy (which I dont have) and Bipolar disorders.      I didn't know what to think. I know I have suffered from depression since childhood, and was expecting something else. I did more research on the disease and to my surprise, a lot of the symptoms for type 2 fit the bill (and believe me, I thought LONG AND HARD about them). I then realized that the doctor had been asking me some of the same specific questions that matched my research related to bipolar disorder.      Dont get me wrong. I am by no means trying to diagnose myself here. I am just trying to get opinions from others who may have walked these shoes.       I have only met with him once, so I know that an immediate diagnosis is not realistic. My husband said "just because he gave you bipolar meds doesnt mean you ARE bipolar". I agree with that. But I have to wonder if there is something more to this. Out of all the anti depressants out there, I was perscribed an antimanic pill.      How long does it take to diagnose someone?   If you have been diagnosed as being bipolar, how and when did it happen?      Thanks to all.

I had increased my cardio to 2 hrs a night, to lose maximum weight and its been doing that. The other morning I woke up with a very sore throat, when I swallowed it felt I was swallowing cut glass. My left tonsil and ear are somewhat inflammed, altho I don't' feel it unless I swallow or bug it. Ive felt hot, and sore all over, and I had post nasal drip and phlegm coming out of my throat, more lately the past 2 days.

20090310013313AA5WD9q	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Could I have caught something? Is it even possible?	I'll start by saying that yes I am paranoid! And I know this might sound strange! But I often let myself worry about this sort of thing although it all sounds so far fetched... (wish I could stop it!)   Basically I went grocery shopping tonight and once I got home (only about 10 mins after leaving the shops) I went to the bathroom. I noticed that part of my jacket touched the inside of my underwear while I was using the toilet. At the time I didnt worry but then I let myself think about it and now what im worried about is that something of harm could have been on that part of my jacket... im concerned that it might have someones blood, semen, etc which clung to my clothes and then transferred onto my underwear and then obviously into me.   As far as I know I didnt come into contact with anything like that but im worried that it might have been on the guy who served me hands, or on products that I touched within the store.   Is this even possible to catch things this way?   I know it may sound silly but some mature responses would be fantastic :)
