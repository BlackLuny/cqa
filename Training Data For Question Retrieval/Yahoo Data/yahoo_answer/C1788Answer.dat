As far as Israel that is not Arab land it is a Jewish homeland... get used to it or we will continue to be there in the Middle East countries. You guys lose every war ever waged on the West, when will Arabs ever learn to be peaceful?      Straighten up or we straighten it up ourselves.  There will always be a line that Arabs cannot cross, and that is spreading their hate and violence, so just keep the arms down and we won't have to use ours.

For example why Israel make massacres against Palestininans, although this is a pure arab land before Afraim was born? because they think that their christ will come back to that land, in the same time muslems believe that this is their land for same reasons and also because the first tribe lived at that place was arabs. I donn't know how to explan it to you, but i think it is the religion and believes and between we have to search the truth.

We do not get as much oil from Iran or the rest of the middle east as everyone seems to think.  Most of our oil comes from Canada and South America.  That's not to say that if the Iranian government stopped shipping oil the prices wouldn't go up, because they would.  I still find it hard to believe that Iran would stop shipping oil, they like money a lot more than ideals.

It is a thinly veiled attempt to delegitimize the very legitimate formation of the State of Israel.  I believe in the Declaration of Human Rights that gives every nation people the legitimate right to establish self-governance and self-determination.   Every nation people has a beginning, a homeland. For the Jews, Israel is that land. It is a part of the very identity of the covenant nation, our eternal tie to the land of our patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and to our mothers, Sarah, Rivkah and Rachel.  The modern state of Israel does not need to base its legitimacy on a belief of promise from God, even though many claim that is its only reason for legitimacy. For centuries, Jews have been working to reestablish the national homeland through legitimate means and the course of the development of the state of Israel certainly reflects this process. The hard-earned efforts of Israel to gain statehood stand as an example of law, if people would study it, rather than the often so bizarre it borders on insane propaganda spread about it. The facts invalidate the charges by extremist voices who would attempt to negate the right of the nation people, Israel to exist in the home LAND of Israel.     Israel's status as a legitimate, democratic nation state today depends as much if not more so on the process of law and adherence to protocol that it took to form the state for it's nation people according to the UN Definitions and how it indeed, became a legitimate state legally recognized by the UN Charter, to take it's legitimate place in the council of nations. It exists as legitimately as the United States of America or any other member nation. The Jewish people had been working to reestablish sovereignty in the homeland centuries before the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America had been proclaimed against Britain.    The UN recognized this when it allowed Israel to become a state. The nations of the world allowed Israel to gain its independence because there was no legitimate reason to deny its hard won independence by international law. Since the 1800s Jews worldwide had been involved in efforts to purchase lands in British mandate Palestine. A quote from a link below: Shlomo Gravetz of the Jewish National Fund says: "Throughout the history of land reclamation by Jews in Eretz Yisrael, the Arabs have always claimed that the Jews were throwing them off their land. In 1932 the High Commissioner appointed the Bentwich Committee to investigate these claims, and out of 700 purchases of Arab property, the committee did not find one case in which the Jews had acted immorally."  67percent of the land that became the State of Israel in 1948 had been purchased with legal deeds over the course of 150 years prior to the Declaration of Independence of Israel. That is a fact.    No other nation on the planet would have been as restrained as Israel has been in trying to protect its very existence for 60 years of onslaught. Israel dedicated itself to working with the nations surrounding it to establish a peaceful Middle East in its Declaration of Independence. Look at the charters for Hamas and for the PLO. They contain direct statements dedicated to genocidal elimination of Israel. Only when their desire to build a nation in peace is greater than their desire to destroy Israel will they live and work toward that peace. Israel is ready.     A simple search engine can show anyone interested how many BILLIONS of dollars of humanitarian aide has been given to Gaza AND the West Bank in the past decade. If my home state that is more than a hundred times larger in land area had half that much our highways and bridges would not be so dilapidated.     The focus must be on stopping the efforts to eliminate Israel and to support efforts to achieve statehood for Palestine, integrate the refugees into a Palestinian nation, support the nations that now house refugees to help them become self-sufficient and grant them legal status! Going into a fourth generation as political pawns is ENOUGH! (Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Egypt are all where the world's focus for the pitiable status of their refugees should have been all along)     I have seen photographs of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon with captions that lay direct blame on their CONDITION to ISRAEL as if Israel could control how they are being abused and used by their Muslim Arab brethren as propaganda tools and pawns! Where are the many millions of dollars that Arafat confiscated that should have been used for their benefit? Where are the 22 Muslim nations reaching out to their brethren? Would they rather continue to use them to destroy Israel than build their own Palestinian nation that should have existed already for 60 years? AT least this is the message it gives to the world at large, IF and WHEN that message is not continually drowned out with the cry of "Israeli aggression and oppression".     Where is the equal accountability?    One example alone shows how efforts to help Palestinians are overlooked and undermined. This did not even make a byline in my local newspaper when it happened..  U.S. Jews raised 14 million dollars of private money to help the economy in Gaza and what did it get the Palestinians? Greenhouses that once had employed several thousand people and were to be the cornerstone of helping the Gaza economy, Gazans trashed within hours of their taking possession. (Was this so Israel could be laid to blame for their unemployment again?).   The future of the next generation depends on education and preparation to become independent and productive citizens. There are seven institutions of higher learning in Gaza alone that comprises a smaller land mass than my home county. In my home state, an area surrounding me that is three times larger, encompassing two counties only has three such institution|`|bYtCfdwbaa	I don't believe there is a promised land and if others don't believe that ,then just because they think that ,doesn't mean it isn't so.|`|Qqg5ALE2aa	Nobody ever promised me anything, so I went to Milton Keynes.|`|ASJpAP6Waa	play Monopoly|`|i7oHTo9haa	It was offered and Jewish people accepted the offer and obtained the Promised Land like G-d promised.

Take it up with Jordan if you don't like what the Hashemite king named his kingdom. He's a peacable man so cut him some slack.  Syria was originally behind this whole mess.  There never was a Palestinian people:    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.

That's especially true since Hamas has admitted the tactic of instigating hostilities in order to use the casualties as fodder for the broadcast media.  Those shots into civilian areas with no military value are designed to produce terror in the civilian populace in hopes they'll give up and go away. It's worked on a good-sized minority of the populace of Sderot, but it's (1) the very definition of terrorism and (2) not something you'd expect to work in the long term. There have, after all, been Jews in the area for over three thousand years, and they've seldom been treated well during that time. In addition to the moral argument against terrorism, there's the pragmatic: it simply can't be expected to be a useful means to the establishment of a Palestinian state.|`|w8owmaDGaa	Maybe this has something to do with it .....

The wolf went to all the other animals crying about what the sheep did to him, leaving out the fact the he ate the sheeps baby.  All the other animals condemned the sheep.

The Hamas rats take the best "cheese" in Gaza and give the crumbs to the Gaza people.   The Hamas rats think of the Gaza people as their SLAVES, as it is written in the Hamas Charter.  (Article 12)    The Hamas rats provoked and instigated a conflict which they knew they could not win.  They prayed for and assisted the deaths of many innocent Gaza people just to get world sympathy.  They hid in their rat hole while the Gaza people suffered above!    Now the Hamas rats are waiting for "humanitarian aid" to come pouring in, so they can trade it for more rocket parts and get back to their "business" of "defending" the Gaza people.    Good job, Hamas rats!  Stand on those Gaza bodies and tell the world about the wonderful VICTORY which you have won.  Your aid will arrive soon!    The Hamas rat gang  needs to dragged to world court and tried for provoking the needless deaths of the Gaza people.  Not everyone believes their lies!    The Hamas rats admit in their Charter that they understand only one thing: (Article 13)  "There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."   They are saying "Please exterminate us [Hamas rats]."|`|nfLgXAeeaa	Men and woman where trained to go and fight in Palestine, but later realized it never existed, they do not see any of it, why?|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	Palestine.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian...|`|Ph4YvA5Paa	PALESTINE  before 1948,when Israel was created,Palestinians welcomed all legal immigrants who lived,worked and purchased land.

Since then,the Palestinians have been forced into refugee camps in Gaza,W.Bank,Lebanon and Jordan.Gaza is the most densily populated place in the world.  Israel's goal is to break the Palestinian's will.They are trying to terrorise them into accepting a peacefull solution that favours Israel,and denies the Palestinians right to return to their homes and land stolen by Israel.

5vqo3XzHaa	The Lord said that homosexuality is an abomination, yet Obama favors giving the homosexuals more rights, not less.  The Lord said it is a sin to shed innocent blood, yet Obama is in favor of funding abortion clinics.  Jesus told us we would know a tree by the fruit it bears, and it is clear to any discerning Christian, that Obama does not bear fruit that he has a relationship with Jesus Christ.  So, no, Obama is not on God's side.  As for whether or not God is on Obama's side, the Bible tells us that He is longsuffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, and that's what I believe He wishes for Obama.  God bless you!!!  :)|`|5bYpbodUaa	God is on the side of those who truly believe in HIM.    Obama is not on God's side.

So, I say NO Obama is NOT on God's side. Plus, Muslims believe in their own idol, and God says not to believe in any idol, and that He is the only way!

(See Reader's Digest).  And think about it for a minute, even if he were a Musllim, why would that be bad?  Most Muslims are peaceloving, just as most Buddhists, most Christians, most Jews, etc.  There are extremists in every sect of ANY religion.  We really need to stop this hate mongering now.    And some of you need to remember...the Bible is a book written by MEN, so Virginia B.  how are you so sure that the Lord said any of those things?  Your faith is what makes you believe it, not any verifiable proof. And yes, I am a Christian.    As to your comment about killing innocents--i.e. abortion clinics---then what about all of the innocent people who have died in ALL wars during the ages?    It has, until our most recent war in Iraq, been a historical fact that most of our modern day wars were started/escalated by Republicans, mainly because wars used to be good for the economy. Maybe this one will be too, after all is said and done, but who knows.Most wars created properity for the US, but they still killed many more innocent people than abortions to date.    My wish is that we can stop all of this divisive arguing.  Haven't we all been through enough of that in the last eight years?  I wonder why those of you who didn't vote for Obama don't even want to give him a chance.  After all, we are all still Americans, aren't we?    Now, let's see how many thumbs down I get, just because people don't agree.    At least I have the freedom to express my opinion.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Obama is Muslim, so no he is not on God's side.

Americans should pray for their President. God bless President Obama. God bless the U.S.A..|`|a6fUSU2Paa	That all depends on what your definition of being "on God's side" is. Which leaves one question remaining. Is Obama performing his act as President of the United States to the full extent of God's word as spoken of in the Holy Bible?    Having such a stance would mean the USA is a Christian theocracy. There being a separation of church and state and all, Obama can not legally be on God's side. Obama must take a stance on running the country on his own. He must forge the laws & policies according to his own conscience and not according to the laws of the almighty father.    So to answer your question, no. Obama is not on God's side. Well, not according to my definition anyway.

I've been through quit a few ice storms and they are very dangerous. Matter of fact, I just heard on the Weather Channel, that the second highest weather related death is due to icy weather. So no, I don't agree with Mr. Obama. How loud would he be yelling if his kids' bus got in a wreck due to the icy roads? While I don't agree with all of the school closings I've heard this winter, most of them have been more than appropriate. Personally, I think they have too many days off for teachers' conferences.

The Palestinians want not a restoration of their state because there never was a Palestinian state. The area is called Palestine. They want their first state.    It belongs both to the Jews and the Arabs, because they are both originally people from that region.     Short overview.   before 1000 BC - No people lived there originally.     ca 1000 BC - Moses sets out from Egypt. Kingdom of Israel founded. Kings Saul, David, Salomo.     722 BC - Assyrians and Babylonians destroy Israel.     The Jews have autonomy under various people. Persians, Greeks.....    Finally (around 63 BC) the Roman Empire stretches out and reaches Palestine. It becomes the Roman Province of Iudea.     130 AD The Jews flee from the Romans rule, because they don't want to worship the Roman gods.    7th century: Arabs settle in Palestine.    From the 11th century to 1517 the crusades bring war to the region.    1517 The Ottoman Empire rules (which is the Turkish) after WWI it is under British jurisdiction.    1882 - 1904   25.000 Jews return from Europe to Palestine    1917 The British promise both the Palestinian Arabs and the Jews an own state.    1919   40.000 Jews return mainly from Russia    In 1922 there are 84.000 Jews and and 668.000 Arabs (Palestinians) in Palestine.    1936 - 1939 Palestinian Uprising against the British because of too many Jews immigrating.   The British prohibit immigration by Jews and the sellin of Land to Jews.    1945 90.000 Jews flee from Europe after the holocaust.     1947 The UNO plans a jewish and palestinian state.    1948 Jews found Israel.    First day after foundation of the Israelian state.   All (!) Arabian states declare war upon Israel and attack.     Israel is victorius.     Since then, many battles and wars, till today.     The Arabs want to destroy Israel and Israel wants to protect its citizens.     Gaza and the Westbank are Palestinian autonomy regions, administrated by the Palestinians, but controlled by Israel. (borders and so on)     The newest conflict: The Palestinian Hamas is firing rockets to Israel, which defends itself, to end the rocket-attacks once and for all.     Since Obama's inauguration there is a ceasefire.    Edit: @ * Velicity: There is no oil in palestine !|`|DtlQawvgaa	Palestine has never existed . . . as an autonomous entity. There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc.     The word itself derives from "Peleshet", a name that appears frequently in the Bible and has come into English as "Philistine". Philistines was migrant people from the Aegean Sea and the Greek Islands who settled on the southern coast of the land of Canaan. There they established five independent city-states (including Gaza) on a narrow strip of land known as Philistia. The Greeks and Romans called it "Palastina".     The Philistines were not Arabs, they were not Semites. They had no connection, ethnic, linguistic or historical with Arabia or Arabs. The name "Falastin" that Arabs today use for "Palestine" is not an Arabic name. It is the Arab pronunciation of the Greco-Roman "Palastina" derived from the Peleshet.     In the First Century CE, the Romans crushed the independent kingdom of Judea. After the failed rebellion of Bar Kokhba in the Second Century CE, the Roman Emperor Hadrian determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea. Therefore, he took the name Palastina and imposed it on all the Land of Israel. At the same time, he changed the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina.    After the Roman conquest of Judea, "Palastina" became a province of the pagan Roman Empire and then of the Christian Byzantine Empire, and very briefly of the Zoroastrian Persian Empire. In 638 CE, an Arab-Muslim Caliph took Palastina away from the Byzantine Empire and made it part of an Arab-Muslim Empire. The Arabs, who had no name of their own for this region, adopted the Greco-Roman name Palastina, that they pronounced "Falastin".     During the First World War, the British took Palestine from the Ottoman Turks. At the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and among its subject provinces "Palestine" was assigned to the British, to govern temporarily as a mandate from the League of Nations.    The Balfour Declaration of 1917, confirmed by the League of Nations Mandate, commited the British Government to the principle that "His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish National Home, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. . . . " It was specified both that this area be open to "close Jewish settlement" and that the rights of all inhabitants already in the country be preserved and protected.     During the period of the Mandate, it was the Jewish population that was known as "Palestinians" including those who served in the British Army in World War II.     The current myth is that these Arabs were long established in Palestine, until the Jews came and "displaced" them. The fact is, that recent Arab immigration into Palestine "displaced" the Jews. That the massive increase in Arab population was very recent is attested by the ruling of the United Nations: That any Arab who had lived in Palestine for two years and then left in 1948 qualifies as a "Palestinian refugees".     God Bless!|`|n9PUzlhzaa	Palestinian people want freedom they want back their home land. I hope, one day (very soon) they will get it.|`|u2NMWxR0aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UsFqVpm2...|`|VHNyiARCaa	Here is a brief history of the conflict:    The seed of this conflict was planted in 1882 when the Zionist movement started with a group of secular European Jews to establish a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Up to the 1930's, Jews lived in peace with Muslims and Christians in Palestine for about 1300 years (except when the European Crusaders killed all the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem 900 years ago). Most of the Jews who lived in Palestine till then were Arabs.    When Britain occupied Palestine during WWI, they gave a declaration (Balfour Declaration 1917) to the Jews that they will give them a homeland in Palestine. There was one big problem however: the land already was populated by indigenous Arabs (Mostly Muslim, but with significant Christian 6% and Jewish minorities 10%).    Britain opened the door to Jewish immigration from Europe, which escalated during WWII and after because of the Holocaust. In 1948 the Jews made up 33% of the population of Palestine, but owned only 5% of the land. The UN voted to split Palestine 55% for the Jews and 45% for the Palestinians to establish a Jewish and Arab States in Palestine, and to make Jerusalem an internationally controlled area. War broke out between the Arabs and Jews in 1948 and the Jews occupied nearly 80% of Palestine and established Israel on it. In the process Israel ethnically cleansed 80% of the Palestinians from the land they occupied and destroyed and depopulated more than 400 Palestinian villages, massacred thousands of Palestinians and made 3/4 million Palestinians refugees.    The UN voted in 1948 (Security Council Res. 93 and General Assembly Res. 194) to tell Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, but until today Israel never complied. In 1967 Israel militarily occupied the remainder of Palestine (The West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The Security Council again voted in 1967 and 1973 that Israel return to the 1967 borders and allow the refugees to return, but Israel never complied (Security Council Res. 237, 242, 338).    This gives you a brief history of the roots of the problem. The Palestinians now negotiate to get only the lands occupied in 1967 back to establish their own state on it, and for Israel to allow the deposed people in 1948 and 1967 to return to their original homes.    Israel is only accepting to return only parts of the lands occupied in 1967. The land they accept to return has no borders with the outside world (making it an effective jail guarded by the Israelis). They also refuse to allow the refugees to return. They also have built many illegal settlements in the West Bank and planted nearly 350,000 Israeli extremists in them. Israel has taken control of nearly 5/6 of the water resources in the West Bank, and has built an apartheid wall that dwarfs the Berlin wall around and through Palestinian cities and villages in the West Bank . They also refuse to return East Jerusalem, which is part of the West Bank, to the Palestinians.|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	I believe it has to do with "Biblical" beliefs.

Yes i do agree that there is an anti-isrealie sentiment rising in the world, but i think that has to do more with the State of Isreal and not the Jewish people.

z8jYprWkaa	She was an overweight mixed-race participant of a reality "show" called 'Big Brother' and she did so "well" (i.e. she was such a complete ignoramus - 'thicko' - that she was funny) that they had her back in a later series of the same show where she made such outrageous racist remarks that questions were asked in Parliament and an international incident between Great Britain and India arose.  She really WAS so thick that one of the floral tributes at her funeral consisted of the words "East Angular" which is what she thought the part of England on the east coast called East Anglia was known as.  She died of cervical cancer about two weeks ago and her funeral - more like a three-ringed circus - took place last Saturday where crowds of people who had previously hated her guts went to make hypocrites of themselves by throwing thousands of bunches of flowers at the hearse thinking she was some kind of royalty.  Now tell us you knew who she was all the time !|`|foMNboZLaa	Quit pretending you don't know.|`|q1HQzLd1aa	Famous for being the most stupid housemate on Big Brother to date.

Jade Goody was famous for being on that dreadful channel 4 series "Big Brother" some years ago...  Like other contestants she made a living out of this inherited fame.  More recently she was invited back into the Big Brother House to take part in a Celebrity edition when she was accused of racist behaviour against Shilpa Shetty, a "Bollywood star" - probably set up to increase the latter's UK presence.     Jade and Shilpa went on to appear in the Indian version of Big Brother where Jade received a message advising her that recent test results had shown that she had an invasive form of cervical cancer.  The media, including Living TV, followed her final months including coverage of her wedding.  The result of this is that many young women have had cervical smear tests which they may not have bothered with - and lives have been saved.  Also Jade ensured that some money would be left in trust for her two young sons, now growing up without a mother.     I am not a Jade Goody or Big Brother fan but do not believe for one minute that anyone with internet access can be unaware of who she was or that her funeral was held over the weekend. Maybe it may be better to think before posting questions or answers and make sure that they are not going to be upsetting to anyone - like Jade's mother for example.|`|2ac2Ecxoaa	Jade Goody, she was a contestant on the UK's Big Brother a few years ago. She was seen as stupid and annoying but actually became really quite famous in the UK. She then went through a whole problem with being accused of being racist and then went on Indian Big Brother to prove she wasn't racist where she was told that she had cervical cancer.    She died like a couple of weeks ago aged 27 and she was a mother of two.|`|jirVsgVIaa	I'll have a guess and say Jade Goody|`|RAzCYBolaa	She is called Jade Goody and is mostly famous for her time on Big Brother. Her full name is Jade Cerisa Lorraine Goody and she was born on the 5th June 1981. She died on Mothers Day (2009) due to Cervical Cancer. She was aged 27.   Jade's 'title' was; English Media Personality. She came into the public eye while appearing on the third series of the Channel 4 TV programme, Big Brother.  Hope this helped.

Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called israel , then israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine in 1967.Since that time any one who says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon,... . 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas make a peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who get majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections, its objectives to liberate Palestine from israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and israel tried to get red of Hamas party Islamic power .Hamas has people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power there since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons .

However, ironically in reality, it actually helped keep the peace for all these years. <br>  <br>  Iran is very different to Red Russia of course, so it's still very worrying.|`|fd8155dae7976071d353e15771e17fb6aa	There is a thing called ''Mutually Assured Destruction''.<br>  <br>  If a ''MAD'' Mullah is in power you can bet your bottom dollar that he would deem it the will of Allah that he start a nuclear war.<br>  <br>  If only one person from the devil's west is killed in a Holy Jihad using nuclear weapons then that would be enough to satisfy the glory of martyrdom of his entire nation.<br>  <br>  Nuclear War in that area would draw Russia in immediately (probable fallout spill).<br>  <br>  Oh the glorious martyrdom of the whole Human Race in the name of God, and a planetary funeral pyre in the glorification of God.<br>  <br>  The Mullah would have everlasting glory in a radio active heaven with glowing handmaidens to carry out his every radio active wish.<br>  <br>  Your concern is very much in the hands of hard-line fundamentalist seventh century mad men.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I am very concerned about it. Whilst I like the Iranian people in general, I know that their government is a really nasty bunch and that they have publicly stated that they would like to wipe Israel off the map. If they get hold of nuclear weapons, there is no telling where that will lead.|`|yCgytwdvaa	The United States are the only nation to have actually used nuclear weapons against another country, shouldn't we also be worried about any country proven to have been willing to use nuclear weapons?|`|MLLCn4weaa	I don't think so particularly, no.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	I agreed with your first statement, but then your second was misleading. They would be concerned with losing their own men, which shows your idea of Iran if you were to go there would be streets lined with jihadists burning flags shouting nuke the west, we are all martyrs to Allah.<br>  <br>  Iran, like all nations in the world, and you'll like this because you can relate (because i suspect you are a pro-israeli - tell me if i'm wrong and i'll take it back), has the right to defend itself. However, one can rightly be worried if the intentions of those nuclear arms are aggressive.<br>  <br>  As has been said Israel built secretly (with much help from the americans) a nuclear warhead, and many if not all were simply given by the US. That, i am worried about.<br>  <br>  If you want to find out the reason why Iran is so pissed off with the west (bar nations such as France and Italy) i reccomend you watch a BBC documentary on the history of Iran called "Iran and the West". You can probably watch it on BBC iPlayer. Iran has been screwed over more times than i can count on both hands by the US and the UK in particular. So many promises and agreements that required Iran to make the first move and first "favour" and the west never held their side of the agreements.<br>  <br>  To a certain extent i would say that we should express concern over their intentions, not their nuclear ambitions in general. I am much, much more concerned with Israel who acts as a dictator in the middle east, what they can do and what other nations can or cannot do.<br>  <br>  Last point if you havn't thumbed me down by now, France actually sold a nuclear reactor to Iran, and the day of its assembly, Israel bombed it. Who are they to have the right to bomb something built in france and sold to Iran? It is not their property, not their business. When the UN tried to intervene and punish Israel for an attack on another nation big ol' USA got in the way again. And that my friend is why they hate the US.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	How many countries have nuclear weapons? USA, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and may be some more. So what is the problem If Iran make or may be made nuclear bomb. Only USA used nuclear bomb against Japan.<br>  If other countries can launch satellite in to the space why not Iran? Is space is property of USA or Russia?|`|AA11863643	Not especially.  They have hostile nuclear powers all around them (Israel, US-occupied Iraq, Pakistan) so wanting to have their own nukes for deterrence purposes is not unreasonable.  They're not crazy enough to launch missiles at anyone just for the h*ll of it.|`|bf1d2cb2e9eb403eddae1df7d87091e3aa	They could totally wipe us out in seconds??? Is this a quote from the Daily Mail/Express/Star/Telegraph...?<br>  Iran knows it faces annihilation if it launched a Nuclear warhead against any country.

I truly believe they will kick off the biggest war of the world. Just like Einstein said "World War four will be fought with sticks and stones."

But I do believe it will start with them.|`|2ZgXnAY9aa	the infidel world should be worried{west} and jews.once iran gets it's nuclear bomb, it will give it to hamas , hezbollah, syria and the rest of the muslim world. infidels are doomed.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	Nah they seem cool, and President Obama will just talk to them and make everything alright.

AA11442722	LOL.. Funny prank though I did find an excellent article discussing theoretical possibilities of zombies. You are looking at the future when you look at that road sign though. All those cameras used to watch us from parking lots, roadways, traffic lights will be hacked and used to track spouses, gang members will use them to set up hits on rival gang members, people will use them to track down folks to serve summons and such things. The more we introduce technologies like cameras and road signs the more those technologies will be used for unintended purposes.  For example the Microsoft house if it happened would be prone to bugs and hacking. Think of waking up at 3am with your shower running full bore, music blaring from every device in your house, your toaster going ape and your fridge turned off. Why? Because you cut somebody off in traffic a couple days before or your kid made the wrong kid mad in PE or whatever petty reason somebody wanted back at you or just cause they could do it too you the same reason many viruses wind up on your computer.     As for zombies, check this article out. You'll never look at the idea the same again.     http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_p1....|`|AA11049477	Now isn't that strange I read the same thing this morning but the A14 Uk was mentioned, see link below  Could be a hoax?|`|4pZxnpVkaa	LOL that's too funny, I saw that earlier and was surprised to see that the authorities actually kinda saw the humor in it, kinda cool :)|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	Both.

LN81w60haa	Different country, different rules. I don't think that there's going to be a lot of public outcry against something like that, in a place where you might could end up being treated exactly the same for speaking out against the government. News agencies and people in the US complain and blame the leader of the country for everything, from the the economy to Hurricane Katrina, but try and do that in many other countries and just see what happens. US citizens have more freedom than the rest of the world, despite what many claim and what shape the country is in.|`|4RBWP3kwaa	Realistically speaking, the Pakistani army can do whatever they please in Pakistan. The reason that this is so is that they are definitely the strongest force in the country and they don't even answer to the government. The claims that the Pakistani democratic government is in control is an eyewash and a mere namesake, it is amongst the least stable states and governments in the South Asia region, and the world in general.     From a moral standpoint, what the Pakistan army is doing is heinous and utterly despicable, and they ought to receive a lot more blame for what they are doing than what the US is doing at Guantanamo bay. The Guantanamo Bay incidents were bad, but not as revolting as what the Pakistani army and related agencies practice in their country.     The underlined reason why the US military is so condemned is because they are expected to be more civilized. The Pakistani army has violated just about everything pertaining to human rights and the things outlined under the geneva and vienna conventions (which they are a signatory of). People is Pakistan can't raise a voice for themselves, whereas Americans can raise a voice and it will be heard around the world. We ought to berate Pakistan for what it is doing and exert international pressure to coerce the army into amending its flawed ways, we have to take the moral responsibility of being a voice for those unfortunate people who are being abused.|`|yKA70D41aa	Dear x1yofuzz!!!!!!    What fair trial? America is part of the process where ever you see torture and injustice. In Pakistan all governments are made by American will. Military in Pakistan has american blood running into their veins.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	the burden of being the 'best' and 'freest' is that u have to hold up ur priciples even when its hard. its like when ur fighting, the mature better thing to do would be to stop and compromise, while the little immature other guy can act out all he wants.  at the end of the day the more mature noble person has more respect.  -if you dont have ur principles or respect, u aint got nothin'! and the US threw a lot of that away with the opening of gitmo, to the rest of the world, and to most americans.  -if no nation stands up for whats right, what do ppl have to hope for, immigrants come here for a better life because theyre escaping torture etc.  -o well obamas fixing it|`|Lbulud8raa	Because the US claims to know better.    The US claims to embody freedom and due process of law.  Gitmo seriously violates that claim.    The US is signatory to any number of international treaties and conventions and the events at Gitmo violate such treaties.    Just because Pakistan, a fractious and difficult nation, does this does not excuse Gitmo.    These events in Pakistan are considered henious but quite normal, and the media holds the US to the higher standard it claims for itself.    This is non-PC, but abuses in muslim coutries are more common than in the west.  People sort of accept it.  I don't condone that, but the US does claim a moral high ground, and this leads to charges of hypocrisy.    EDIT:  Sj, I would not start trumpeting claims about American liberty and freedom.  Many other countries, such as Australia are actually more free.    EDIT 2    On those grounds, I would agree with you, and apologies for any offence.  I believe very much that liberals often tend to be vocal about abuses at home, and yet willingly co-opt tyrannical regimes but silence.  I t does bring to bear the adage:  "Evil happens when good *men* stand by and do nothing"    I tend to find that many of those liberals who are not rampantly outspoked would rather flagellate themselves and insult the nations that give them so much- The US, Australia, the UK and Canada as examples- than fight the real battles.  While I am all for choosing one's battles, many of those who will put Mr Obama on a pedestal would rather complainj, whine and express vitriolic "greivances" about the so-called eviuls of the west than offer solutions.|`|097ec7f356872967e38438f8b2bde431aa	because america is supposed to be a beacon of hope for thoes who are oppressed. we are supposed to have morals and give EVERYONE no matter what a fair trial and equal rights. its the foundation of america and what makes it so great.
2da5194b07866d04648322c010e378eaaa	. Did the grandparents put new tile down in their backyard after Caylee was missing?  Not in any offical reports    2. Was there an original 911 tape in which Cindy spoke to Casey when she thought the 911 operator was transferring the call and said something to the effect of "We'll tell them you were south of here..." or something to this effect?  Not in any official reports    3. Did the family know Caylee was dead before they reported her missing? Is that why Casey called her mother numerous times on a day around the time she may have died? (in other words did she drown in the pool? Casey calls mom...mom is a nurse...)  No, they did not know she was dead, in fact the Mom of Casey (grandmother of Caylee) reported on the 911 tape that the trunk of the car smelled like death.  Being a nurse, she may have experienced the odor.    4. Did Casey go on a crime spree (checks) after she killed her daughter? Mad at her friends who went to Puerto Rico?  She did steal checks belonging to a close friend and went shopping at local stores, purchasing clothing items, etc.      5. Did she chloroform her daughter to stage a kidnapping to get money from her own parents?  There are no offical reports of extorting money, but there are facts in evidence that show a form of chloroform was found in the trunk of the car.  There was a search on the computer in the Anthony house that was looking up ingredients to make your own chloroform.  6. Do the jail house interviews looked staged to you?  Some do for publicity purposes, and some I think Casey is playing the cameras big time.    What do you think happened in this case?    I have two scenarios.   1)  Casey wanted to go out and had to take care of her  1 priority (Caylee).  Something got out of control and Casey lost it, causing the death of Caylee and then covered it up.  2)  Casey is a psychopath and killed her own daughter to have freedom.

The Obama fan club, champions of democracy and free speech (so long as it is PC) will have a go at you.    Truth is though, what he wants to do is normalise relations, at least somewhat.  The Iran situation is delicate for the US beacuse it feels snubbed by the revolution 30 years ago, and it's pet dictator, the late Shah, was deposed.    Normailising relations was supposedly on the agenda (I am assuming as a very low priority) of the previous administration.  US presidents, especially republicans, have gained a lot of mileage by having a fundamentalist Muslim state to replave the USSR as "The Enemy".    I agree that GWB was rather homespun, ignorant and really rather embarrassing.  He was the puppet of hie fellow Neo-cons yet profited greatly from their avarice, hardline tactics and conservatism.  Conservatism to a point where it is really atavistic.    Sometimes when it comes to making peace, humility is needed.

I hope our 'pen pals' thing marks a symbolic gesture from the hostile one adopted by Bush who called Iran part of an "axis of evil".

2da5194b07866d04648322c010e378eaaa	An estimated 2.1 million people attended the inauguration.  I believe the key reason was to witness history.  First African American president.  What you should include in your essay are facts about the Obama's.  How he was raised by a white family, his grandparents, only met his father once, and so on.  Also include Michelle Obama in your essay.  She was raised in a middle class family, both parents held normal jobs.    Both, Barack and Michelle have graduated college and hold degrees in law.

BmUx3XZFaa	It is all to do with the banks being able to lend to businesses (especially small ones) and being able to get a mortgage, let me explain.    The reason banks won't lend is that the libor rate (rate which banks lend to each other) is too high so they won't lend.  This has an effect on the property market as buyers won't purchase houses as the price is slumping and they are waiting for it to bottom out.    All this has an effect on confidence so people are just saving and not spending as much.  Therefore people are losing their jobs because people not spending money which was why Gordon Brown tried to stimulate the economy with a VAT cut but it failed.    So in conclusion to your question, when the libor rate drops and property prices has bottomed out which I believe to be 2nd half of 2010.|`|AA11277726	Putting the people in charge and not more losers from wall street.

It is not a philosophy restricted to Jews - there are, for instance, many Christian Zionists.  Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is an opinion and one you can only form for yourself. Personally, I believe it's a very good thing.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	Good.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	bad, anything extreme is bad|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	Well, here is what a Rabbi had to say on Zionism.  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DeaZuj7ruw...
