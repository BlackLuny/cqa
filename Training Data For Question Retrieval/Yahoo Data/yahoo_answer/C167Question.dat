20090222165858AALrEF8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Cure for stretch marks!!?	Things you will need:   1. Massage tool      2.Body/Facial Scrub   a1468.g.akamai.net/f/1468...18/300.jpg   3. Safflower oil or olive oil   4. Aloe Vera extract or pure aloe vera gel product: If you use a plant, the plant needs to be 2 years old or older.    5. Collagen-Elastin lotion   a1468.g.akamai.net/f/1468...04/200.jpg      PREPARING TO EXFOLIATE:   About 3-4 tsp scrubs   couple of drops of safflower oil (vitamin E, or olive oil)   1/2 tsp aloe vera extract/gel      MIX THE ITEMS IN A SMALL BOWL... MIX MORE IF NEEDED.      1. SOFTEN THE SKIN: TAKE A RELAXING BATH OR SHOWER FOR AT LEAST 5-10 MINUTES TO SOFTEN SKIN. THIS HAS TO BE DONE SO THAT THE DULL SURFACE SKIN LAYER WILL COME OFF EASIER IN THE SCRUB MASSAGE. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!!!   2. THE SCRUB MASSAGE: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO THE MASSAGE AT NIGHT JUST BEFORE YOU GO TO BED B/C AFTER THE SCRUB, MUCH OF THE SURFACE SKIN IS TAKEN OFF, AND THE SKIN WILL NEED TIME TO REGENERATE AND RESURFACE.   *after you have soaked skin for about 5-10 min. get out of water. get rid of the excessive water on the skin BUT keep a little bit moisture on; take the scrubbing agent prepared earlier and apply a layer evenly on areas to be treated; using the massager, massage the skin covered by the scrubbing agent. Keep the scrub mixture moist so the massage motion is smooth. If it gets dry, add a little water to it. (hold the massager at its base and massage skin with the little pegs).      The right way to do it is as if yo are polishing or brushing the skin. The purpose of the massage is to take off the dead, dull, damaged surface skin layer to promote the growth of normal healthy skin tissues. Massage the skin instead of muscles. Do not pressure or push muscles as you would with pressure points. Concentrate the pressure on the skin surface.   Massage skin clockwise in 1-2" circles. Be very precise and cover each inch of the area treated. Massage over the stretch marks in small, circled motion instead of streaight across them to avoid pulling and stretching the scars. Massage in small circled motions along the direction of the stretch marks. It may feel somewhat uncomfortable at the beginning. Start slow and light, let your skin get used to the stimulation first. Gradually increase the strength and speed of the scrub massage. You should feel the stimulation and still feel comfortable.   MASSAGE EACH AREA UP TO 5-6 INCHES IN DIAMETER FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES (OR MORE OR LESS; FOR AS LONG AS YOUR SKIN CAN HANDLE IT).      Your skin will turn a reddish pink color during the massage, indicating active blood circulation. If your skin is extremely dull, you may not see the color change until a few sessions later. The red color is a sign that you are doing it right. After the massage, the skin should feel refreshed and awakened.      After the scrub massage, use a piece of wet loofah or a rough sponge; gently polish skin with the scrubs on for 1 minute more, then rinse skin clean.   ***NOTE: DO NOT TRY TO OVER DO THE MASSAGE!!! You can tell by the way skin feels. If it feels irritated or it burns, you are doing it too much.      Step 3: APPLY CREAMS -Pat skin dry lightly with towel, while skin is still red, apply creams immediately and massage until fully absorbed. Simply pour some aloe vera gel into your palm, then pour an even amount of collagen lotion and mix them together in your hands, apply and massage into skin.      EXFOLIATION SCHEDULE:   Day 1 Exfoliation massage; apply creams   day 2 skip exfoliation massage; apply creams optional   day 3 skip exfoliation massage; apply creams optional   day 4 Exfoliation massage; apply creams   day 5 skip exfoliation massage; apply creams optional   day 6 skip exfoliation massage; apply creams optional   day 7 Exfoliation Massage; apply creams    day 8 & 9 skip exfoliation; creams optional      DO THIS FOR ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS... ONE DAY ON, TWO DAYS OFF. iF YOU START TO SEE GOOD RESULTS PLEASE SWITCH TO ONCE EVERY 4-5 DAYS. DO THIS FOR A FEW WEEKS. IF YOUR HEALING SLOWS DOEN AS IF IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE; REDUCE THE EXFOLIATION TO ONLY ONCE EVERY 10 DAYS OR SO. WHEN YOU DO IT, DON'T RUSH IT, DO A GOOD ONE! THE HEALING WILL PICK UP AGAIN.      **Lacking of certain nutrition could very well be one of the causes for your stretch marks. Please take your vitamins and minerals! the following vitamins and minerals are very important to skin:      vit A   vit C   vit E   thiamin   riboflavin   niacin   vit B6   vit B12   Vit K   zinc (tip from customers: lack of zinc in your diet might be one of the causes of stretch marks! a few of them reported that by taking zinc supplement actually improved their stretch mark damaged skin. So i advise you to do the same).   Eat moderate amount of animal fat and plenty of soy protein and animal protein. Having moderate amount of body fat is healthy, and it makes yo look younger. Eat plenty of fish. Everyone that I know who eats fish regularly has healthy skin and looks much younger than they really are.           Things you will need:   1. Massage tool       2.

20090222130025AAN8Z5g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Being the middle child, why is it so hard for to get her attention and for mom to see Me?	Am 16, and ive grown up being the middle child of 3 girls and 1 boy whose 12. Am realizing how much mom doesn't pay attention to me, and how much she forgets about the things that we speak about. Even though, am the troublesome child, and rebellious out of all of them, am not that bad  of a kid, the worst that has happened b/w me an mom was  a domestic violence fight, and an acs case after that. Most of the time am quiet, but when i try to get her to see the good things that i do, she never pay attention. sometimes i feel like am a burden to the family, but am also feel that at times if i were not around, the family would be going at each other throats instead of me.she says she barely knows what am inters ted in, and it's hard to tell.On the postive side of me, i dont always do wel constantly, bu twhen i do i excel. Am not always consitent, and i could do well on my own, sometimes i feel that untill i move out of here, from my mom's house, i think i'll do better. When it comes down to my needs, she does'nt aways fulfill then as quickly to the other kids.      has anyone else experienced this?

20090223132236AAkRtMF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	For women who have had SUCCESS with castor oil.?	On friday, my doctor said she was expecting me to go into labor over the weekend, and that if I hadn't by today I would be okay to take a small amount of Castor oil. She said my body is ready so I wouldn't need to take alot.   I have already lost my plug, had a HUGE bloody show 2 days ago, 2-3cm dilated (as of friday), the baby has dropped. I have had HORRIBLE diarrhea the past 24+hrs. Some cramping, but nothing consistant, and it feels like NOTHING is going to happen!!!!   I have been a walking machine, had sex everyday, which those of you at 40 weeks knows how painful that is! Pineapple, spicy food.. The works. I am hesitant to take the castor oil due to the possibility of living on the toilet, but I already am, so i guess it wouldn't make much of a difference.   I have read ALOT about it and asked my Dr. about it and it DOES NOT cause the baby to have a BM, it doesn't even go to the baby. The babies who DO have BM's are the ones (MOSTLY) who are in for 40+ weeks as their bodies are ready to make a BM at 40 weeks.   So, I am wondering if anyone who has had success with the Castor oil knows of any good "recipes" to use, other than OJ, and how much to take??      PLEASE do not comment on how bad it is for you and all of that. I have already read a TON of info. and talked to my doctor. Thank you!!

20090223120849AAp1fNI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding, How much can you pump per session per day?	Right now my supply is so incredibly low. I will be able to start taking fenugreek- I had to order it online becuz my gnc was out :( But it should be here tomorrow according to fed ex. I have also looked into dompadine (sp*).. Has anyone seen results in these products. Also if I want to increase my supply is it a good idea to pump every 1-2 hours instead of every 2-3 hrs will that increase my supply more. I try to put baby to breast but she refuses it, sometimes she takes it sometimes not.  Also, I havent been pumping over night just because its so hard to get up..lol Should I add a pump over night will that help my supply even more or should I just get my sleep. Thanx.
20090223110632AA8KGi9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I say something to this old hag?	Ok, I'm pretty heated right now. I am tempted to leave my desk right now and go home and share a few pieces of my mind.      My husband works for some apartments doing maintenance, he is the boss over there so he won't get in trouble for this.      There is the MEAN old lady that lives there, one of those old ladies that probably hates her life so she hates everyone and blames everyone for her miserable life. Anyways, she went into the office and asked for a shovel because she wants to plant some flowers (or maybe dig a grave) so my s/o brought her a shovel and left her apartment. She started cussing him, saying he's not a gentlemen how he should dig the hole for her blah blah...that's not his job...he had other things to do besides dig a hole for that old b!*c*.      She started calling my s/o ignorant, saying how he is disrespectful (which he is a very respectful person) saying how he is teaching our son bad things and teaching our son bad manners and our son already has an ignorant gene and is probably a bas*ar* child anyways!!!!!!!!!!! Which he is NOT...how DARE her insult a 5 1/2 month old baby...my husband went off on her....probably actually became very disrespectful, but she deserved it. The manager of the property came out and now the old lady has 30 days to leave the property for causing trouble....HA!      But I still want to go over there....how DARE her....I am so heated right now.

20090223111005AAL0iPP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it normal not to have any Braxton Hicks near the very end of pregnancy?	I had a ton of very intense BH contractions during my second trimester, and now (12 days from my due date) I haven't been having any at all. Occasionally I get mild cramps just where you would get them on your period- but it's very rare and they are very mild. What I was getting in my second trimester were VERY intense, stop-you-in-your-tracks, suck the breath out of you pressure contractions where my whole belly would get rock hard. They would come and go, but I was getting them all the time. I haven't had any for months now!      Also, I was lactating from about 15-30 weeks- I would wake up with my shirt soaking wet in spots- and now, for weeks, nothing.       Is that odd? My baby is measuring well and moving constantly, I am sure she is okay, but it's just strange to me.       :) Thanks!

I feel hungry but when i go to eat, it makes me sick to my stomach and then i can't eat what i made. IDK if there are any nurses reading this but i did a quick skin test. When i pinch the skin on my hand, it does not bounce back quickly. It goes back but you can see where i pinched it.....if that makes sense?!?! Any ideas on what I should/could do to help keep things down? Should I go to the hospital ? Thanks for the advice.....

20090223115808AAfNZC9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Abnormal pap smear and colposcopy during pregnancy?	I'm 16 weeks pregnant and my pap smear came back irregular. I had a colposcopy today and they said they would only take a cervical biopsy if it was really irregular, since I'm pregnant. Well, the Dr. decided it was irregular because she ended up doing a biopsy. She also had a student watching and was explaining how she wouldn't normally take a biopsy but that it looked like "more than just HPV effect."       I'm not really sure, besides HPV and of course the worst case scenario (cancer) what else it could be? I also had an irregular pap and two colpos (one w/ biopsy) done during and after my first pregnancy but they never really told me much about the results.      Has anyone dealt with this, and what could it be? I know in some cases they will freeze cells or do laser surgery, is that if they find pre-cancerous cells? I think I'm worrying too much... but I need to know whats wrong.

20090223072427AAFxw7m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter isn't quite walking yet, but she's trying.  I wasn't worried- should I be?	I recently posted an Ad looking for someone to watch my child for a few weeks next month while my normal sitter is out.  In the body I explained that my daughter just turned 1 last week.  Although she is not walking yet, she is very close and probably would be by the time March rolled around.  I then went on to explain that she is a very serious, smart little girl who is talking a little.  She is very careful, and skeptical and it takes her a while to warm up to new people.  I received numerous responses, all of which were perfectly normal e-mails stating availability and rates.  Well one e-mail I got has upset me so bad I'm not sure what to do...I reported it to abuse@yahoo.com but I doubt anything will come of it.  The e-mail said this:      "your daughter is 1 1/2 and not walking yet???? My god. what's wrong with her? Is she retarded? All normal kids walk by 13 months at the very latest, my own started at 9 months and no, she is not a genius. just normal   also, from the description, it sounds as you have a mongoloid on your hands, not a smart child   get real"      I was so disgusted to read this.  My daughter is not 1 1/2 she just turned 1...and she's tiny for her age, about the size of a 9 month old so I wasn't worried about her not walking yet.  She's extremely close.  I guess this lady was just messing with me, being stupid but I can't believe someone would attack my baby girl like that.  She doesn't know my daughter.  I think my little girl is extremely smart. She's talking better than most older babies.  She says about 10-12 words, is giving hugs and kisses...it's so sad to me that this evil person felt the need to say such terrible things about her.        Should I be worried? I still think everything is fine, I've known plenty of 12 month olds that couldn't walk yet.      What can I do about this horrible woman? I reported her, so I'm not sure what else I can do...I just hate the thought of everybody else she is abusing by insulting their children!

I am 14 days late. but am never regular but i am never this late its usually 2-3 days late. The first week i threw up one morning and for a couple days my stomach felt weird like bloated. But i didn't feel like i was going to get my period. And this weekend when i got up i felt really weird again but i can't explain it it was my stomach. i have been pretty thirsty for the past couple weeks. and i went and got 2 tests (They weren't expensive ones) and they both said negative. This probably doesn't have anything to do with it but i usually get my period and then when i am almost done my best friend gets hers. well she is already done hers and that's how it has been for like at least a year now. I really want to know what you think please.       Thanks So Much!!! :)

20090223120924AALYFdK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	All the debates going on....BF / formula ?	Because there have been so many debates on here recently it made me think about how luckly we all are.  We have the choice to BF or to formula feed. There are women in the world that have no choice than to BF and if they not produce enough milk or cant get the baby to latch then their child starves.  We can debate about vaccinating or not but some women have no choice about whether they can vaccinate their children against deadly and extremely common diseases and have to wait for either the red cross to vaccinate or watch their child get polio.  We have the choice to co sleep many women have no choice but to live in one room and bed with their entire family.  So when we all jump down each other throats for making a decision for our child that someone doesnt agree with i think we should all think how luckly we are that we have a choice? Does anyone agree with me???

Im almost 36 weeks pregnant and my little one still hasn't turned... My dr said if she doesn't turn than I have to have a c-section which im SO scared of.. I don't like the idea of a needle going into back..  I have tryed so many different things to try and get her to turn and nothing has worked.. I have been on knees with my head lower than my butt, I have put music and a flashlight down by my pelvis, I went swimming to see if that worked...    My little one is so stubborn that she was almost turned she had her head by my hip and her butt almost at the to of my rib and than decided I guess she didn't like to be upside down.. LOL cause well her head is back up towards my ribs... Anyone else have this and did your baby turn at the last min or did you have to have a c-section? I really want to have this baby at 38 weeks cause my back hurts sooo much and my ribs as well... Thanks for all your answers.

Two weekends ago I I went to one of my friends parties. I met this guy there (he's 16, I'm 15) and I live right down the road so he offered to walk me home so we walked home together. Nobody was at my house. He wanted to come in, so I let him in. We were just sitting there talking and he was like "wann have sex?" And I was like "NO!" Then he was like "Come on, one time won't hurt anything" Then I was like "Yes it will get outta my house!" Then he was like no and started making out with me. Then I made him stop and he was like "wanna have sex now?" I said "No get out of my house!" Yeah, the conversation went around like that till I was like "fine, only once though" I don't know why I did that! I'm so stupid! I mean I think that I was thinking I didn't want him to like rape me or something, so I just went ahead I don't know what I was thinking I'm so stupid! It only lasted like not even a minute though. Anyways, my problem is that I'm scared to tell my dad and I'm scared that I'm pregnant. I'm scared to tell my dad cause I usually would never do something like this! Like I'm a straight A student, I like almost never get in trouble! I'm scared he'll won't like me anymore. I'm scared that I'm pregnant cause I think the condom ripped and I'm 2 days late. Idk if I am sonce it's just two days, but is it too soon to take a test just to be sure?
20090223103341AAm9cHD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is eating ALL healthy food good or bad during pregnancy?	Well i am 14 weeks along and i really have not had too many sweet cravings or junk food cravings,maybe a few oreos here and there but nothing major. I have been eating a lot of salads and vegetables along with quite a bit of fruit and some cheese. I currently weigh 143 and when i found out i was prego i was 146. I love the foods i am eating but afraid that i am not giving the baby proper nutrition. I dont eat much meat and I eat when i am hungry and till im full but i cant put on weight. My dr told me if i didnt get back to my post weight at 15 week check up she would be lecturing me about how i can improve my diet. I am eating healthier than i ever did but i dont know if i am eating well for my unborn baby...please shed some light on this. I dont want a premature baby but i dont want to hord food if i dont have to, please help!

This pregnancy has been totally opposite from my pregnancy with my son.  I have lost 14 pounds, is that something to be worried about?  I'm not vomiting a lot so I don't know why the weight loss.  I was also wondering what your baby's heart rate was and if it was a boy or girl.  Juliace's heart rate was always in the 150's and when I went to the doctor's the other day the baby's heart rate was 168.  I'm hoping that means its a girl, since everything has been so different.  And anyone have any old wives tales or clues on how to find out the sex, I can't find out untill my next ultrasound in 8 weeks!  Thank You!

20090223102657AAJzfBn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant, lost weight but belly got bigger?	I am 25 and 4’5’’, 10 weeks pregnant and pre-pregnancy I weighed 160. Since the first 2 weeks of pregnancy I lost 15lbs which my Dr. and I aren’t worried about because I already have more weight then I need for a person of my height. My question is, is there anyone out there around my age and size who can tell me when they started to show and grow? I naturally have small breasts, 34b and they haven’t grown yet either, but the weird thing is that since I lost that weight my stomach looks bigger. I know I am not showing yet it just looks like fat, but how the heck did I lose weight and my belly got bigger? Like all of my pants are huge on me now and falling off yet I have a belly that people are kinda looking at trying to decide if it’s a baby bump already. I know every preggo woman’s experience is different but just wondering if anyone had anything to share. Thanks!

20090223112710AALlAcl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do you get over depression/over sleeping?	I used to be the happiest person I knew, never down on my luck, never out of energy.      About a month ago, my boyfriend and I thought we were pregnant due to a missed period and false positive (checked outside of time frame).  We're young, 19 and 22, and neither of us have the income to support a baby.        Obstacles aside, we were so happy that at times we would cry.  We planned to adjust our entire lives around being parents and were at peace with the struggles we would have to overcome. We felt hopeful, supportive, and strong.      After we found out it was false, neither of us have been the same.  I can't stop sleeping... I feel lethargic and depressed.  Our relationship used to be a very happy with short lived arguments... Now it is continuous arguments with short lived happiness.       I feel no motivation to do anything.      When I thought I had a child in my womb I had never felt more centered or happy...        We aren't ready to have a baby, and feel blessed to have more time... So, why can I stop feeling depressed?  I am sleeping over 15 hours a day.

20090223114828AAk5rUD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Paternity question with regards to BBT charting and Pregnancy testing?	I have a question.  Bear with me for details. Please do not judge me. Just give honest answers.  I was bbt charting and had low temps from sept 9th (LMP) until Sept 22, then my temps went up. During this time I slept with my boyfriend.  On Oct 4th I had a one night stand, this was the day my period would have been due....I took a pregnancy test the next day, Oct 5th.  Is it absolutely positive that my pregnancy is from my boyfriend and not the one night stand?  I have had numerous ultrasounds that confirm my days...and I'm HIGHLY certain that a pregnancy test needs time to become positive...so a day after the one night stand is definitely too early...and given that I was charting my temps and they were low and got high and stayed high also show I ovulated early correct?  Please keep your personal opinions of one night stands to yourself.  I am 30 yrs old and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 3 yrs...I went to see my ex husband and one thing led to another...biggest regret of my life...   but I just want to put my mind at rest...I believe its guilt more than worrying that the baby isnt his...   What do you think as far as the signs?  BBT rise and TWO positive pregnancy tests on Oct 4th, the day AFTER one night stand?   Thank you in advance.   Kelsey

20090223120824AAa53fg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	No acne while breastfeeding, will it come back when I stop?	I am just looking for other peoples experiences. I had acne when I was a teenager and took all the antibiotics, which worked while I was on them, but returned after use. I then tried Dianette (aka Diane), which worked great for several years, but I had to stop using it when I started getting aura migraines. When I came off Dianette, my skin was awful with cystic acne on my chin. I had no alternative but to try Roaccutane/Accutane. My skin was great while on the medication, but returned 6 months later. I have since been on Roaccutane twice more, each time my skin stayed clearer for longer. My skin started to erupt again and became extremely oily. When I was pregnant with my first son, my skin became great by the third trimester and while breastfeeding. While breastfeeding I got pregnant again and I am now breastfeeding my second child. My skin is great at the moment, I think it is mainly due to breastfeeding; I am also using pro-active which I think helps. I am just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and what their skin was like after breastfeeding?

20090223121646AAoiAcm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	My boyfriend & I want ttc. I've been on Tri-nessa since July 2008. I got my period on Feb 3,2009. I started my?	pills on Feb 9 (sunday starter). I only took 2 pills which was on the 9th & 10th because when we went out of town & I forgot my pills. When we got back on Feb 14th I took another pill, however, since I had already missed 3 pills my boyfriend & I decided that its ok for me to stop taking my bc completely so I haven't taken any since. We were unprotected on Feb 15,16,17,19,20,21 (Feb 16 was day 14 since my period started). Had breakthrough or withdrawal bleeding from Feb 17-20 I'm assuming from missed pills.  My questions are could I have ovulated before the bleeding, could I be prego & could I ovulate after the bleeding I had? FYI- I didn't have the ovulation kit or didn't take my body temp. It was all a last minute decision. Can anyone help me with this. I don't want to wait beginning of March to find out. Its killing me to find out. The reason I ask is because I read the pamphlet that comes with my bc & it states clearly that once the pill is stopped you can ovulate right away & get prego, this part is sooo confusing

20090223133748AAjS63o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Potentially interested in adopting a child some day?	We are not looking for something soon or immediate, as our own biological children are still young (4, and 1.5 year old twins). We are also undergoing some structural issues and major repairs to our home, but we wanted to educate ourselves on the process. I have been on many websites, and any time I try to make an enquiry I have to fill out an extensive questionnaire, and it makes me feel like I am applying to be an adoptive parent, which we are not ready to do as of yet.   We are not looking to adopt an infant, we would like to adopt an older child, probably over 7 (of course we would be open to other age groups, but we feel this would fit best in our family situation). We live in Canada, and are wondering if anyone (familiar with the process) can advise costs involved etc. We would like to adopt through children's services, either the US (if it is allowed?) or Canada, and would like to know if anyone can give us any advice for preparing our children, home, lifestyle before we began this journey. Please understand we are not being "greedy" wanting to adopt another child when we have three. We are perfectly capable of conceiving, we would like to give a less fortunate child a chance at a loving home and family.   Currently we own a 4 bedroom home in the country, the schoolbus picks up on our front lawn, for both Catholic/Public school. We have a fully fenced yard, a seperately fenced swimming pool, and our yard backs onto acres of country. We are currently a foster home for the animal shelter, and have three large dogs of our own. Dogs are an important part of our and our childrens' lives, and respect for animals. In the summer we camp, and in the acreage behind our yard is a pond/creek for skating,a baseball diamond and playground. My husband is a shiftworker and I am a stay-at-home mother, who does crafting projects and draws portraits to supplement our income, however most goes to the local animal shelter. We have a fairly modest income, but we do live comfortably and happily, have no debt (outside our mortgage) and I believe we could offer a loving home to a child. Do adoption agencies consider homes with pets or younger children?  Thank you, any advice greatly appreciated!

20090223144547AAFjPZX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	LMP vs Ultrasound???? Need more then 9 answers..as many opinions as POSSIBLE. 10 easy points!!?	I was on birth control about 4 years. My lmp was on August 28th. I was on the pill, so it lasted a normal 4 days then I started the new pack on that Sunday. Well on the 3rd day of taking them I started bleeding super super heavy. No pain or anything. Just a ton of blood. And this lasted 4 days. Non stop heavy bleeding. Well after the first day of heavy bleeding I stopped taking my pill (as in i stopped it AFTER the bleeding started) cause I thought it was my body just doing its thing. I never went to the doctor, cause I was in no pain. Well it stopped on September 6th. I had unprotected sex on September 7th..then not again till September 13th, and then like evryday from the 17th till the 22nd. (my bf and I just moved back in with each other) And well my next period would have been on September 25th. It never came, so I took a pregnancy test...got a negative. So I waited until October 5th. Took another one and it was negative. So then on October 7th I took one in the morning and at night. Still a negative. Then I waited and took one 9th and it was a faint positive..took one again 3 hours later and it was a bit darker. So I knew I was preg. Went to the doctor and theres came out positive too.       Well. based on my lmp my due date is June 4th which is what the clinic gave me.   Well I went and had an ultrasound done and they told me there wasnt anything there and though it was an etopic preg. They tested my hgc and it was going up..so I went to another hosiptal and had an ultrasound done and they saw the baby, it was just very very small where I was super early. And that one put my due date at June 15th. Well I went to another hosiptal who dated my due date at June 16th. Well I had about 6 ultrasounds from 2 different doctors before my 12 week mark, and they all dated me at June 15th as my due date. And now at 23 weeks she is dating June 15th still. So based on ultrasounds she right on..but its some what off from my lmp. Based on my due date of ultrasound I got pregnant at around the time my next period was due to come. But based off my lmp I got preg a day after that crazy bleeding. Im confuced and need some advice. Its been on my mind.

20090223150241AA4tWIv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of this man?	What do you think of a man a Green Card (Ex Green Card) holder or a US National with a foreign passport? He leaved the country to avoid dealing with the USA, CSA Child Support Agency. Any lawyer will tell you that you will never get any child support order enforced in the other country. His lawyer or his own father told him to do that.       If the American mother had the same mentally is an Italian woman, he would have be able to make a parenting plan that most American man consider fair. As a result the baby daughter will never see her father and her mother will not get any money from him and it is 100 % mothers fault for being selfish.  The mother went to family court and got a child support order against him and he is only allowed to see his daughter 4 days a month.        There is a small minority of American woman that think that this woman is selfish and is unfair to the father.  Those women are satisfied with a small fraction of what they are legally entitled to, and think asking any more is selfish and unfair to the man and the child.  They do things the same was as in the US that does things the same way as in Sicily Italy and most American man don’t ever have to go to family court ever.         Most men step up and no court order is needed for the others the child support can't be put into effect until the baby is born.  He would have done the same if the American mother did things the same way as in Sicily.

I don't know thats its a good idea to put her in a school where I am almost certain she will struggle in math. I could do the "regular' school like we have been but she gets bored because she is ahead of the class and tends to get in trouble because she wants to talk to others who are still working. I am afraid there is no "good" place to put her. I'm looking for input/advice maybe some suggestions I have not thought of. Please and thanks!

20090223142721AAGvMo7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is this wrong or right what i say to my boyfriend about his disability?	My boyfriend of 9months, is fully deaf and has an implant called an ESPrit 3G. Since day one i have been amazed by him, he was worried i wouldn't want to get with him cos of his disability and peoples tendencys to understand his speach [due to him not being able to hear since he was 5].      I took to it all right away, but others can't. He's very insecure about his ear implant, i try and not let him worry it too much, as much as i can help. I've done everything i've so thought i can do...      ? Learning BSL- British Sign Language   ? Met his friends that are also deaf. [He asked me to , other girls turned him down before, due to being embarrassed].   ? Bought a book on deaf to try and understand it fully.   ? Researched about his implant to understand how it works.    ? Accepted his offer of me going all the way to Bradford to his next hospital appointment.   ?Teach him to read and write and speak more clearly.      Anyhow, people in public stare at his head, point , say things. I get really upset about this cos i can see his face when he know's this is going on. I've often had a screaming match with the most rudest of those people, and then have cried for him, i dont know why.      Somedays he goes down and thinks i don't love him cos of his implant and disability. He get's emotional and breaks down after it all build up.  I comfort him as best i can... and here where my question comes in...      His age is 16 but not in the state of mind of a average 16yr old as such, but sometimes he can go in this childish mode, which i dont mind at all, i can handle that im not a shallow perosn.   He starts agreeing with this rude and offencive remarks  people rudly make at him and says things like 'im thick my ears are stupid they dont even work', to make him feel better i tell him he has 'magic' ears, cos he can turn them on and off, feel vibration better, sign, lipread and a ton of other things he can do. This cheers him up alot with a big smile on his face, but tonight after i said it to him i thought to myself...      Is this wrong for me to say?   No nasty comments please and im 15 and hearing btw.

20090223151137AAQP60h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need breastfeeding advice fast....is this inadequate weight gain?	My daughter was born 5 pounds 8 ounces (7 weeks early).  At two weeks she hadn't regained birthweight so the doctors put her on 22 calorie formula (4 times a day and nursing 4 x a day) with no weight gain, then 24 calorie, and eventually 27.  She gained weight on the 27 calorie and within a week was up to 5 pounds 10 ounces.  I weaned her down to two bottles of 27 calorie formula a day and she has been nursing every two hours for about 20 minutes, draining one breast per feed.  Today she is four weeks old and it has been 9 days since her last weight check.  She only weighed 5 pounds 15 ounces which is less than 1/2 oz a day.  The doctor wanted her to gain 1 oz a day at minimum........I wanted to breastfeed her so badly and I am very disappointed, but her doctor is very pro breastfeeding and insists this is inadequate weight gain.

Also, not to sound horrible haha but on New years I had to take the Plan B pill, which really messed up my period.

20090223150037AARZbAg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why doesn't he want our baby?	A few weeks ago i found out i was pregnant, i told my boyfriend (who i have been with for nearly a year and a half) and he goes mental at me saying its not his and ive been cheating - which is not true.      i thought he would be happy as we always talked about having a baby and what they would look like and names and such. anyway he said wehad to go to the doctors to arrange an abortion, so i agreeed knowing it would be a while before i had to go through with it. i cryed and begged him every day that week but he still didnt change his mind. finally the day before im due to have an abortion im on the floor in agony and bleading really badly - i thought i was having a misscarrage. at hostpital they scanned me and said my baby was ok - thank god.      so i go to have my baby aborted (because thats what he still wanted) he's sitting there looking at the scan of my 8 week baby and tell the doctor we need more time to think about it. im sooo happy i cry - propper cry.      so we are back at home and a few days later he says hes not ready for a baby and he breaks my heart again. i love him and all i want is us to be a happy family but i feel that if i keep the baby that he wont be happy and if i let it die then it will destroy me compleatly.       i just need some advice, sorry to go on and on. xx

She would usually be awake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours in between naps, but now she's only awake 40 minutes before getting fussy and rubbing her eyes. Could this be because of teething? She has been chewing on her hands and other things which are signs of teething. Everything I read online says babies usually don't sleep as well...so I'm a little confused and worried.

20090223153016AAp3wea	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Infant circumcision -- foreskin is reattaching itself -- what do they do for this?	My 5 month old son was circumcised the day after he was born.  (Whatever you think of that decision, that is the choice we made, so I don't need a bunch of people telling me how wrong it was.)  Now that he is older, the foreskin seems to be reattaching itself to the head of his penis.  I called his pediatrician today, but she did not return my call yet.  I'm wondering if this happened to anyone else's son and how they handled it.  Is it something we can fix at home or does it mean the circumcision needs to be redone?  Thanks!

20090223153816AA3HC6J	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	After giving birth to a child...?	Hey Everyone,      I was just wondering, after giving birth to a child, how long do you have to name it? My auntie had a baby fifteen hours ago and the baby is still nameless. My mom also went to school with a girl who took TWO WEEKS to name her child. Also, a family member named their daughter a name, and two days later went and changed it because 'it didn't suit her and I found a name I like better'. But I was just curious.      1) After giving birth to a baby, how long do you have to name it?   2) After giving birth to a baby, up to what point can you change their name?   3) Besides no profanity, numbers or swears, what other rules are there when naming a child?   4) If a name was not following the 'rules' of naming a child, who would tell you that you couldn't name your child that?      Thanks.
