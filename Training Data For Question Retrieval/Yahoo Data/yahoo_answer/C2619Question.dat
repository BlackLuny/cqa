20090128122843AAEd4WS	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	What kind of driver are you? Inconvenience others, or inconvenience yourself?	Lets say you're on a busy highway and you need to get off at the next exit. Unfortunately, traffic is really heavy and you need to merge across three lanes. You put your blinker on, and patiently look for an opening... but nobody lets you merge.      Do you slow down and wait for a spot to open up? Do you force your way in and make people give way? Or do you decide to go to the next exit and turn around to try again?

20090128134019AA9x701	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	How do you decide where to sit on the bus/train/subway?	Suppose you are traveling alone. You get on and see three open seats: two of them are part of the same pair, and one is next to an occupied seat. Do you take one of the empty pair (sit by yourself) or sit next to the stranger?      I always sit by myself, if possible, and from my observations, most people think the same way. It always puzzles me when people sit down next to me when there are clearly opportunities to sit alone. If you are one of these people, please shed some light on this question! I want to know what your rationale is.

20090128140615AAGxrJk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Airflow problem on 93 Crown Victoria?	I have a 93 Crown Vic that had an exhaust leak at the Y-Pipe.   I thought it was the cause of my horrible gas mileage (6 MPG) and extreme loss of power.      However it seems this may not have been the only culprit.      I was checking the air filter, and it's clean. At the same time, I unplugged the Air Flow sensor and drove around the block. I noticed, when running with the air flow sensor unplugged, I get a LOT more power and better gas mileage. But the car will die after about 5 minutes and the check engine light will come on.       I plug it back in and the power is horrible, and it just sucks down gas.      And when I start to accelerate, the engine stutters for about two seconds and a 'clunk' sound follows.       I have no clue what's wrong.      Any help?

20090128123601AAOqIjN	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Blizzard, turn lane snow covered, car tries to make a left from the through-lane...?	There's heavy snow, and three lanes. One lane for each direction of traffic and a shared left turn lane in the middle. A minivan stops on the through lane, trying to make a left. The problem is that nobody can see that this van is trying to make a left because another car is close behind. A third car goes into the left turning lane to get around the van, and I follow. We both pass this van to the left, and the van honks at us both as we pass.      So my question, who is right? The minivan was sitting in the through lane instead of the left turning lane, and there was no way to see that the van was turning. On the other hand, the left turning lane was somewhat obscured by snow, and the two of us passing were knowingly going out of the normal through lane to get by...

20090128130652AAIzdZG	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Will my insurance rates likely go up because of a fender bender?	This morning I accidently hit a woman while pulling out of a parking space. She was coming fast behind me when I hit her, however because I was going at such a slow speed, my bumper put a small shallow dent in the sideboard right above her front tire. However, there wasn't a scratch on my car. She made a huge deal about it, including having the police called to file a report, and also keep saying she was worried that I knocked her alignment off which is complete BS. She also sort of admitted fault to not seeing me when i was backing out. I did not admit any fault whatsoever. She will probably file a claim soon when the police report comes out. Should I try to notify my insurance company and give them my side of the story?

Both the check engine and transmission lights have come on in our 2002 CR-V EX AWD with automatic transmission.  I was told that these are for "catalyst insufficiency" and "transmission fluid pressure".  What is the solution? Would transmission fluid pressure be due to a worn bearing in the tranny and if so should I get the fluid analyzed to confirm such a problem?  How long can I expect to run the vehicle before it gives me real problems?  So far it runs and shifts normally.      I understand that transmission problems are common in this vehicle. There is a noticeable whine in 4th gear. The transmission fluid was changed about 10,000 miles ago and the vehicle has 102,000 miles on it now.
20090128135044AA3g4Iu	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Do I have a bad coil pack on my car?	Here's my current situation: I recently asked a question about my transmission being bad, and we think that has been ruled out. I have a 2002 VW Passat 1.8T with 98,000 miles on it. I just recently drove from Pennsylvania to Florida, and about 800 miles into the trip, I noticed some vibrations ONLY when acceleration at high speeds. We then noticed the car has a rough idle when stopped, but only in drive. If the car is shifted into neutral, the roughness goes away. The last thing I got done on the car was the drive shafts up front. I took it into VW dealer today and I came back with more questions than answers. They hooked it up to the computer, ran diagnostics and found no instances of the engine misfiring. The only thing they did find was a malfunction of the catalytic converter. After doing more tests, VW said the drive shafts were defective or installed improperly, and needed to be redone. They say it has nothing to do with the engine. I took the car to a Sears Auto Center the same day and they say it cannot be the drive shafts for two reasons: 1) There is no way the half shafts can cause engine roughness when the car is sitting still 2) I only notice the vibrations intermittently when I'm on the gas (the shaking goes away immediately when I'm off the gas). I'm thinking coil packs now because I've read that a coil pack malfunction can cause engine roughness and a catalytic converter to malfunction due to an excess of unburned fuel. (I do not have a check engine light on, nor any documentation of a misfire in my computer). I've also read that there is an issue with coil packs on an 02 Passat 1.8T. This problem is getting old, and no one can give me a clear answer. Do I have a problem with the coil packs? Driveshafts? Thanks so much for your help

Geico quoted me a price that was $250-350/year less than any of the other companies. The coverage I selected is as good or better than what the other companies were offering.      Would Geico be a good company to switch to, or should I go with someone else? If you have had any experience with Geico (good or bad), please share.

20090128140035AAcZWCO	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	How come there's rarely any radar traps after a construction lane closure?	It happens every time. Construction crews, or accident responders close 1 or 2 lanes of the 3 lane highway I drive every day.      There is serious congestion, and traffic gets wildly backed up. But eventually, everyone merges into the through lane(s) and gets past the construction or accident. As soon as the highway opens up to three lanes again, everyone takes off. Literally! People who were stuck, now late, anxious to get home, with a wide open highway in front of them, easily top 130-140km/h even in the right hand lane (don't ask how I know that we're going that fast!).      So why wouldn't police set up speed traps right after the construction/accident zone? They could nail so many reckless/speeding drivers!

20090128140321AAwInUN	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with my car?	I have a 2000 Mercury Mountaineer, with 96,500 miles on it. Back on Jan 16, 2009 it was 7 degrees in the morning (the coldest it has been in years), and my car would not turnover. It was making this click sound and then not doing anything else. Then on that Monday, 32 degrees, I went out to try to start it and it still was making the click sound and not starting. My mom figured it was flooded and then was able to start it by turning the key and pressing the gas pedal at the same time. Every time I try starting the car now it makes the click sound and does nothing so I have to turn it again and I am able to start by either turning & hitting the gas pedal or turning the key forward until it starts. Every time I started my car the temperatures have ranged everywhere from 20 degrees to 60 degrees. If I got the engine block heater going, would that help anything, or is it something else wrong with it. Before this happened it was starting great in all kinds of temperatures.

20090225075145AAboUVJ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2000 Ford Focus Misfires and Hesitation getting progressively worse?	Hello.  I have a 2000 ford focus SOHC with 160,000 miles.  I noticed some hesitation when I was driving several months back.  Since then it has become progressively worse.  Now, as soon as I start it, the engine runs extremely rough for 45 sec to a minute before I can hear it even out and run smooth.  If I try to drive or accellerate while it is running rough, I have little to no power.  The check engine light came on a while ago and showed a misfire on cylinder 4.  I tried replacing the plugs and wires and it didnt really help.        Today the check engine light started flashing.  I have read online that it could be the timing belt failing, or possibly a problem with the ignition coil pack.  A new issue is, the brake pedal now becomes hard when the car is idling rough, making it almost impossible to stop.  As soon as the engine seems to run properly, my brake pedal is back to normal.  Any advise would be very much appreciated.  I just got laid off and I'm trying to pinch pennies where I can at least diagnosing the problem.  Thanks in advance!!!
