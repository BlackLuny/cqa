20090131200409AAAryeA	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	I feel I need the answer to a question,but i don't know what the question is.?	I know it sounds vague, and it is. It is to me too. I feel wrong with life in general. I cant pin point what it is because everything to me feels slightly, actually allot off.     A friend of mine went to see a psychiatrist a while back for a few sessions. she told me it was great, I didn't go in to details with her, but she seemed like she knew, or felt like she knew exactly where she wanted to go in life, like it had really made a difference. I wish I'd have asked her more details now. But it didn't feel right and I dint really care at the time so I didn't.    I want to feel the same as she did, but how can I ask for an answer to a question when I don't know what the question is?   Do they have some kind of tick board that they go down, like when you were at school and you were trying to figure out the career you should go in to. If they do then thats great. Has anyone been to one? Do you think they are a good idea for every one?  For me?   I know I'll probably get some rude answers. People are cruel within the safe confines of the faceless Internet. I think thats because they are insecure. I'm insecure too, hence this question, but knowing I'm insecure makes me more secure, if you know what I mean.

20090131193045AAmzdpi	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Why do yahoo...........?	keep emailing me with "you have a new answer to ur question", when ive unchecked the little box that stops them from doing so?  i know im using 5 points to ask a stupid question, but, i am very particular about clutter and junk and i never get "spam" in my emails.  i hate emails that arent really emails meant for me etc, ie from my freinds.      i often go to the extreme of changing an email address just to avoid junk that comes through.      any help would be appreciated as i dont want to change my email again, but please, i want yahoo to stop sending me mails that my question has been answered.  i dont need it.

20090131184410AATwd6G	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	Should YG keep ModCentral boards online?	Should YG keep the contents of ModCentral boards available as a resource to Group members after closing these boards down? Other Yahoo boards shut down discussion, but left the contents online for those interested.      ModCentral boards opened on 13-Feb-07 and currently contain tens of thousands of messages and collective wisdom contributed by volunteers. It would be a shame to waste all this effort.      If you suport keeping these boards online please also click the ThumbsUp on the YG Suggestion board at:    http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...     and spread the word around.      As of the writing of this Question you can still see one of those boards at:    http://messages.groups.yahoo.com/Groups/...       Thank you.

20090131190106AABRO9K	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Quality of Yahoo! Answers answers?	Do you not find that for the most part we encounter so many juvenile, immature, or cowardly users on this site. It's struck me as being in huge excess lately compared to what it used to be. I am frequently shocked by the answers people give. For example, some young girl was having some kind of psychosocial breakdown with genuine problems in her family and so on and a user answered 'Kill yourself'. This is extremely dangerous... what if this girl actually did, because of this sadistic answer (even if it was meant as some form of joke).    Sometimes I think it would just be amazing to find these little punks and make an example of them. Find the victim (questioner) and have the answerer confront them on live TV as someone reads a manuscript of what they said and ask for their justifications (a bit like to catch a predator).    Things like that should be looked into more.

I'm thinking about staying low for the next few days while this mess is cleaned up. But, I was talking to a fellow co worker, and he said that this "Troll" is using MY IP Address to post this unspeakable rants and then yahoo suspends all accounts using that IP Address. Is that true?      Is there a way for me to insure my account won't get suspended when I didn't receive a single violation notice? I've never posted anything that would violate the guidelines.      I had to make a new account because my old one was suspended.      Thanks   Captain S

20090131193742AAiCmF8	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	How do you ask Yahoo to nominate a question for being on the featured home page section thingie ? ?	They probably don't just take requests but this question I've found, well I'm sure they would just love to use it. I.e.; on the front page of yahoo answers where several example questions that are unusually interesting or useful or otherwise good questions are posted up on and it rotates, showing each answer maybe once every 10 seconds or so

20090131190152AAQseYE	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What is it for some people that is so satisfying about being completely rude to others on YA?	I'm not referring to people with a different opinion than mine and getting mad at them because of it - we are all free to have our own opinions. I mean those folks who are just down right rude for no reason.    For example, I asked a question, and one answerer told me to "go ___ myself", that I was a stupid human being, and I should go drink bleach. My question was about cooking with egg whites. Egg whites!! I had about 7 responses that respectfully told me what I wanted to know, and then just one nasty comment. I am sorry if this sounds like a rant. I know I should just ignore such comments, but sometimes it is so amazing to me how people can be so horrible to others for absolutely no reason.   Thoughts? I will probably get some rude answers just to spite me but, c'est la vie. Thanks everyone.
