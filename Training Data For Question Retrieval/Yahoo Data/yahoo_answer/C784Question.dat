20090227050902AASkOaV	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Is there such a thing as Vegan?	Given that everything requires some degree of animal product to produce, its there such a thing as vegan?      Fruit bearing trees would be fertilised by the land including animal manure. Petrol used by cars are produced by long dead animal fossils.       Vegetables are again mainly grown on land which used animal fertilisers.      I'm a vegetarian who is trying to conform to veganism with a fair bit of success, I'm not giving myself a hard time for eating cheese or having milk on occasion until I find suitable replacements.      I suppose I just have a few questions about being vegan.      Thanks,

Senza finestra, con un misero angoletto per poggiare i piatti o tagliare le verdure, ma e' in questa cucina che ho scoperto il mio amore per la cucina, nonostante le frustrazioni da urlo quotidiane.
