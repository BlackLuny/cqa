ZeDjn4cVaa	The $5,250 that you were reimbursed by your employer for tuition and fees cannot be used to generate a tuition and fees deduction or lifetime learning credit.    You can take education tax benefits for any tuition and fees paid by your employer that are included in your W-2.  This should be all amounts paid in excess of $5,250.      You can also take education tax benefits for tuition and feew you paid out of your own pocket.    You probably do not qualify for the HOPE credit because this requires you to be a full-time student and less then 2 years out of high school.    The lifetime learning credit is claimed on form 8863 and the tuition and fees deduction is claimed on form 8917. You can choose to take one of the other, but not both.  If your income is too high, you will not qualify for the education benefits.    If you itemize your deductions, there may be some additional benefits.

ZeDjn4cVaa	I will assume that your wife is a resident alien. If she is a non-resident alien, then a statement signed by both of you electing for her to be treated as a resident alien would also need to be attached to your return.    Your options are:  (1) file an extension on form 4868.  This gives you until October 2009.  (2) File as married joint, both sign the tax return, but only claim one exemption (for you).  Then amend the tax return to take your wife's exemption after you have your wife's social security number or if you get no social security number amend the return and use W-7 to apply for an ITIN for your spouse.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!    P.S.  Even though you will be able to obtain various degrees and scholarships offered by  public and private universities, you will still be faced with having to respond on a job application to these questions:  "Are you a legal resident of this State?  And if your answer is "no," do you have a greencard?"  Unfortunately, there is no way around the issue of becoming a legal resident and failing to obtain legal status,  Remember that there are laws against employers hiring illegal immigrants and the fines are quite substantial.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	We paid someone $250 a month to check on our 88 year old Aunt.

bmP4NdKuaa	If they're accredited by your state, you can trust them.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	what you mean is not getting your license on line, but attending  the prerequisite courses on line.      once you have taken them from a state ACCREDITED school,  you then must apply to take the state test and  then, apply for the license.    I do both internet and in person RENEWAL courses as they  are perfunctory......little new stuff is introduced.    Let me share with you why I would not do an internet course  for the prerequisite skills needed to pass the state test--    you need to be able to listen to emphasis on the  part of the instructor and you need to be able to ask questions  and listen to other class mates ask questions.    The instructors in person have incentive to help you graduate  from the school and pass your test; the internet school  is a machine; it does not care.    Things you will be learning--that require intense focus;  the definition of FIDUCIARY.--who one represents.    AT what point is one representing someone?    Under what circumstances can you --as a licensee,  work 100 hours on a deal and not get paid?    What must be disclosed and what need not be?    while there are a gazillion other topics you will discuss--mine  is a hotly contested topic nation-wide and I might have  been the first to bring it up--    remember fiduciary?  when a licensee agrees to represent someone--for 50+ years, sales people automatically  represented the home seller and this same person offered to  do their best when "representing" the buyer.      Until 5 yrs ago, this was just DONE. Period.  Today, it  cannot be done so easily; the seller signs a listing agreement  but the buyer has choices; independent representative,  buyer's agent, and dual agent.    UNDER no circumstances can a dual agent work effectively  and i expect this year, that tens of thousands of  buyers will sue their agents when the agent convinced the  buyer to ACCEPT dual agency [in order for the listing  agent to obtain a commission for selling the house and  another for helping the buyer, buy--as those are two  different processes..........    UNDER no circumstances can a dual agent get a buyer  as good a deal as an exclusive buyer's agent.    Luck to you|`|HVslQ8e4aa	You probably don't learn as much but it all depends on how you learn best. If you can sit in front of a computer and digest the info, go for it.

RkfIPD7Iaa	The city tax office will record a lien on the property for the benefit of the mortgage company, but they may not record the amount.    Really, though, what business is it of yours whether they have a mortgage?  Any mortgage will be taken care of through the proceeds of the sale, that's what lawyers do.|`|bghPNGjMaa	Your county probaby has a department called something like "Assessor/Recorder" where mortgages are recorded.  That is public information.  Not all counties put it on line -- sometimes you have to go to the actual office.    Not all mortgages are recorded.  It is up to the lender to decide if they want to record it.  Most do.    Another way is to find out who the owner is and look at their credit report.  But of course you have to have the ability and authority to look at credit reports.    But anyway, why do you care?  If you buy the house, the seller will be required to satisfy any mortgage they might have.  Except in the very unlikely case where you are assuming the existing mortgage.|`|UVFtr5f4aa	They are correct.  Mortgage is not what you need to be worry about.  You do need title insurance as to check when you buy the house that there are no other liens against the property.  They will check that you would be getting a house free and clear of any obligations.  Also check the city clerk to find what the last appraisal was and the check how much properties tax you may be paying.

If you have your W2 go ahead and file.The IRS goes by your W2,not your last check stub.    A lot of people on here have been asking for EIN numbers.That's a dead giveaway they are using check stubs instead of W2's to file.And if you notice the same ones  come back and say they got their W2's and the info doesn't match.They could have avoided this by just waiting for the W2's.|`|AA11946005	They should match, so I'd question HR if there is one where you work.

Now if you notice a difference in box 3 and box 1, that  is your 401k contribution, just subtract the differnce, also on box 12  it should state the amount.

You have done a good thing to get credentials for those who are doing the work for you.  Hope that helps you.|`|RhEhzGbraa	Yes you can be sued.  The best way to handle this is for you to require that your sub-contractor have Commercial General Liability Insurance and name you as Additional Insured.  HIs/her policy will then provide the necessary defense and pay the injured party if you are found liable.  You should still also have your own CGL policy.  Also note that this is in addition to all other necessary policies that you or your sub should have such as Workers Comp if you have employees, Commercial Auto if you use work vehicles, etc.  Your sub-contractor should provide proof that they have insurance and that they have added you as an Additional Insured on a Certificate of Insurance with a 30 day notice of cancellation.    You should also have your sub sign a contract which should contain, among other things, a waiver of liability.

Reason being that you may be left out in the cold with no support and no tools needed to build a profitable website. Web building is about finding a niche, brainstorming site concept, researching good keywords, building trust through content. Giving away free information that solves a problem. People search for answers to problems, ways of simplifying lives, and solutions. There is a process. I use one that cost me less than a dollar a day. And that is a far cry from $5.95/mo. I don't want to violate Community Guidelines guidelines. If you want more info e-mail me.

They also had to lay off thousands of people (happening all over the place) but so far, they're hanging in there. If they don't sell more in, what, 2 years then they will have to either file for bankruptcy or lay off about 60% of their current employees, including administration.|`|mrAqoMGsaa	No, Best Buy isn't going out of business because people love buying at Best Buy and That's all my answer. OK|`|I1SP0tBMaa	i work at best buy and no they are not
R0NfdgzLaa	i don't know the specifics, but there is such a law.    it was created because some businesses sold items at below cost price just to kill off other businesses, who obviously couldn't compete.  once the opposition died off, they upped the prices and made a killing.|`|JB8samC7aa	Businesses may charge whatever they like for their product or service. There are solid economic reasons why the cost of goods shouldn't drop too low, but no law that says they can't.|`|iHlRHGHcaa	No, we are a capitalist country.

There is the manufacturing prices, Wholesale prices and MSRP. MSRP is what consumers pay. Businesses buy products at wholesale which is quite lower than MSRP and then find a point price.

P2PNqOJlaa	TRADING - Open an online brokerage account (ETrade, TDAmeritrade, Scottrade, Schwab). You usually don't need a large balance to start, but you typically want to buy shares in multiples of 10 or 100, and you should be wary of stock prices below $5. Online brokers will usually charge commissions of $15-25 per trade. RESEARCH - a good site for stock research is http://finance.yahoo.com (similar functions exist at Google and Microsoft and also most discount brokerages). They have a stock screening utility and detailed information on each stock (Profile,Key Statistics, Charts are especially useful). Also, companies are required to file financial reports with the SEC. These are available at www.sec.gov (look for EDGAR section). The reports will describe the business and recent results in great detail, as well as the risks involved in investing (10-K is annual report, 10-Q is quarterly). ANALYSIS: Frequently people assess which stocks are "cheap" or "expensive" by looking at ratios, such as the ratio of price to earnings (P/E ratio) - firms with higher P/E ratios are expected to have earnings grow faster than firms with low P/E ratios, EXCHANGES: Stick with companies on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX. Some stocks are traded on the bulletin board or pink sheets - they do not have to meet the same listing standards and fraud is quite pravalent (beware of emails with stock picks, etc.).|`|Zn8A9vWdaa	You should google the online brokers to get more info.  They include amertrade, e-trade, etc.    You should also google to learn investment and stock knowledge, including reading company financial statements, and industry trends, etc.    How much do you have?  It costs money to buy stocks.  Can u afford to lose your money, as the market is still risky out there.    If u really want to get into it, be sure to diversify, like buying ETF stocks which hold many company stocks, like mutual funds.    Good luck.|`|cXVJMNuDaa	I am in 6th grade we are playing the stock market game & suprizingly i happen to know alot about stocks. Okay, you want to invest in a stock that is publicly traded it cant just be a small business that there is only 1 of. You want to check & see how past stock markets and stocks have varied. You want to buy stocks when they are low in price but have a good chance to go up. My advice is do not invest in a penny stock. A penny stock is a stock that its overall price is less than $5. Big companies that will probably always do well are, unless something big happens in the economy are-Wal-mart, McDonalds, places you have basically wherever you go. Also tech stocks are very high right now like apple & best buy & microsoft. There are good information on www.thestockmarketgame.com just look on that site & it can show you alot about stocks. I know alot of things about stocks & it is very fun to play with stocks sometimes you loose & sometimes you win! Its all part of the experience. (F.Y.I. you ca loose more money you invested so make buying and selling stocks wisely!) well if you need any more info just ask more questions & ill try to answer them best i can. Well i hope you can make money!

RpnS4Poeaa	Capital One is a terrible credit card, or according to the offers I used to get before I had no credit. They generally have bad rates unless they have a Mastercard or Visa logo- which I personally have never seen. At this time, unless it's you're last resor (you need food, clothing or shelter), I would advsie NOT getting a credit card through any leander right now. There are other ways to build your credit without spending money you technically don't already have in your pocket. See if someone will put your name on one of thier already existing cards or accounts. The person doesn't have to give you a second card or anything, just your name on a reliable friend or relatives' account would most likely give you a better boost than signing up for a high interest rate credit card. Bad decision, if you can't get a card with a Visa or Mastercard logo you shouldn't get a credit card at all.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	This is probably NOT the answer you are looking for.  I don't thing there is such a thing as a 'good' credit card.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	They have several types of cards. If you do not pay your balance in full, interest rates and fees should be your focus. If you do, the rewards cards should be considered. They all change your initial terms after you get a card. Read the fine print. Use a Visa debit card if you can. This will keep you out of the "death hold" of the card companies.
UeLigNB0aa	While it is true that conventional loans are harder to get now the government insured loans are still available.   FHA loans are being done with 3.5% down and scores as low as 580 (sometimes less!)  Here is where things get tricky. FHA guidelines do not have a specific minimum score but the lenders are setting their own. I have 2 lenders in the last 2 weeks that raised the minimum score from 580 to 620 on their FHA loans. This means that it does matter where you go to get a loan. If you go to a bank you will get what that bank has to offer at their price and under their conditions. Your best bet is to use a broker who will shop around for the best deal for you.|`|hyo4tWv9aa	well it depends if ur in usa then hell ya cuz of the economic problem but i think its a really good idea to buy a house.

Interest rates are at an all time low, and could drop even further. In Austrlia there is a first home buyers grant. JUst ensure your job is safe before taking any risks.|`|ls9gft0vaa	It depends on your credit score and how much you want to borrow. There is money out there for qualified buyers but you will have to work a little harder to be a qualified buyer. Good Luck with your new house!|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	If you have a good credit score and a good down payment then the rates are the best ever.  If you plan to try to buy before you sell your old house then it's going to be tough, unless you have a high income.  If you plan to buy the new house as a second house, rental or spec house then it will be tougher.      When people say "loans are harder to get" then they mean harder than the last 5 years.  But before that people got loans and it won't be any harder than that.      Also, why sell your house this summer?  Are you being transferred?  The real problem with our real estate market is there was too much speculation in the last few years and people wanted new, larger homes when their old home would do just fine.  Something to think about.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Yes, loans are much more difficult to get these days for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, banks are holding onto more of their money.  They are in trouble or trying to ward off trouble, so they're hanging on to what they've got as closely as possible.  One interesting thing I noticed months ago is that my bank (who is not in the news and actually bought one of the national failing banks) is taking my mortgage payment a lot sooner than it used to.  I always make my payment online before its due date and for years, they would take it out of my checking account 2-3 days after I actually made it.  Now they take it out immediately.  I told a friend of mine about that and she said she's noticed the same thing with her mortgage and credit card payments.    Secondly, the guidelines for getting a mortgage have tightened up considerably.  Some places want squeaky clean credit.  Other places want you to put down a 20% down payment now.  I read recently that a lot of young couples are dismayed because the amount of money they are getting pre-approved for now is quite a bit less than they were getting pre-approved for just a couple of years ago.  It all depends.  You might trying calling around and asking before you do anything.  Good luck!

aKDPrPlkaa	You are not doing this for pay and are not pretending to post yourself as advisors, right?  I do not think you are violating the law.    Update:  It is NOT true what some say below.  Just talking about stocks is not enough to declare you an advisor.   The key here is if you do it for a living and/or pose as an advisor.  I used to be Serie 7, Series 66 certified.  This means, I was authorized to sell many financial securities, could do it over several states and was also certified as an advisor (not just a broker).    If you are a lawyer, Accountant, or other professional that somehow suggests what to do (financially), you could be at some risk of being considered an advisor.  But if it is jus a necessary thing within the services you provide, you are still n ot an advisor.  You are one when your primary duties are to advise financially OR pose as one.  Then you must test.
wUVz8bL5aa	You are a dependent if you received over half your support from your mom or dad.  Sorry your dad died, but he still has to file taxes for 2008.

Got me over $2000 for my daughter last year.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	Even though your mother is on social security, if you are under 24, a full time college student, did not support yourself (more than 50%), and lived with your mom more than half the year, then you are still you Mom's dependent and cannot claim yourself.  If one of the above does not apply then you are not your mother's dependent and may be able to claim yourself.

NdrO7u79aa	Call your bank first thing Monday and ask them if those funds are in your account. Because the funds were initially shown on a Friday, sometimes the computers act screwy. I work for a bank and I know that the online banking system gets a little screwy on the weekends.    If the funds aren't there on Monday, ask your bank to put a stop payment on the checks so they don't bounce. They'll probably charge you a fee to do it, but the fee for a stop-pay is a lot less than paying an overdraft charge to the bank AND a fee to the company you were trying to pay.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Call them back and have them explain where the funds went.

Usually, getting a job offer isn't enough to get out of a lease.   You may be able to sublet the place, or if you can find a new tenant to take your place, then you may not be held responsible for the entire remainder of the lease.|`|3yrpDNavaa	There is no such law.      You and the landlord can always come to an agreement to mutually rescind the lease.  But, since he's under no obligation to do so, expect to pay him some money to entice him.    You can move, which would be a breach of the lease, then hope landlord is able to re-rent the place.  You would then be responsible for only the time the apartment was vacant.    You can sublet the apartment, if not prohibited by the provisions of the lease.  But, you will then be responsible for your sublessee's screw ups, including his failure to pay rent, and damages to the property.

Request it escrowed, or look into a life policy.  Mortgage insurance decreases as you pay off the home.  If you are young, lots of time you can get a 30 year term policy for say $200,000 for a very reasonable price.  At the end of the 30 years (if your loan is 30 years) you have $0 same as the mortgage insurance; but if you die in 29 years with a life insurance beneficiary will receive $200,000.

With the economy in recession and unemployment rising, industrial use is going to fall.  And LNG terminals could make it worse.  The exploration companies arent a good buy, especially COP and CHK.  COP is laying off 1300 and they are losing billions on their Lukoil investment.  CHK is a mess..  They are strapped for cash and selling assets, issuing debt and taking charges for writing down assets.  They sold some gas production in the Anadarko Basin the other day for $4.20 bcf which I thought was cheap at the time.  Doesnt look so cheap now.  All of the exploration companies are cutting their exploration budgets.  The pipelines and utilities might be a good buy.

GJKWgx0Paa	you need to be very clear about the details here -- if you signed as a co-owner of the account with the 30k on it, it is your debt even though he spent every cent of it.    --  however, if he opened an account in your name and credit without your knowledge -- which would require forging your signature -- then you can be relieved of the debt by filing a police report on the fraud involved.    Yes, the bank will squirm.  Yes, they'll threaten to sue.  And, if you didn't sign it, you didn't sign it.    of course, your father would likely go to jail for the fraud -- 30k is felony size money.  He likely also had to commit fraud on the application in that the income he said you had wasn't so.    --  if he did the fraud and you aren't willing to see him go to jail for it, then you need to close the account by going to the bank in person and demanding that it be closed immediately, as in now while you're there.  then you issue written instructions that no further credit be allowed for any reason unless you appear in person to sign for it.  [this is to keep him from re-opening the account or another one in your name.]    and then you pay off the 30k.  No, there is no way to escape paying short of filing the fraud complaint or filing for bankruptcy yourself.|`|SlIsqibwaa	You should get some professional consultation for this.

The middle 50 percent earned between $12.30 and $18.47. The lowest 10 percent had earnings of less than $10.08, and the top 10 percent earned over $22.50.

P2PNqOJlaa	TRADING - Open an online brokerage account (ETrade, TDAmeritrade, Scottrade, Schwab). You usually don't need a large balance to start, but you typically want to buy shares in multiples of 10 or 100, and you should be wary of stock prices below $5. Online brokers will usually charge commissions of $15-25 per trade.  RESEARCH - a good site for stock research is http://finance.yahoo.com (similar functions exist at Google and Microsoft and also most discount brokerages). They have a stock screening utility and detailed information on each stock (Profile,Key Statistics, Charts are especially useful).  Also, companies are required to file financial reports with the SEC.  These are available at www.sec.gov (look for EDGAR section). The reports will describe the business and recent results in great detail, as well as the risks involved in investing (10-K is annual report, 10-Q is quarterly). ANALYSIS: Frequently people assess which stocks are "cheap" or "expensive" by looking at ratios, such as the ratio of price to earnings (P/E ratio) - firms with higher P/E ratios are expected to have earnings grow faster than firms with low P/E ratios, EXCHANGES: Stick with companies on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX. Some stocks are traded on the bulletin board or pink sheets - they do not have to meet the same listing standards and fraud is quite pravalent (beware of emails with stock picks, etc.).|`|nz5p4NU2aa	Try the step by step guide on this website below, it should be of help.

Open and deposit funds into your brokerage account.  2. Familiarize yourself with your account trading platform.  3. Research stocks you are interested in using:      a. Fundamental analysis.      b. Technical analysis  4. When you are ready to buy a specific stock go to your account order entry screen and enter the required information such as:  a. Stock ticker symbol  b. Order type  c. Number of shares  d. Order duration  5. Review your order to verify that you typed in the correct information.  6. Send the order to your brokerage firm.

What you need to do with this work is to tell companies about your opinions on their products and services, and in returns they are more than willing to pay you for this opinion.    How can I make good money doing online surveys?. You can make very good amount of monthly income doing those online surveys, you can doing some online surveys per day to work part time, or you can work full time doing much online surveys.    What are these surveys look like? It is very easy to complete the online surveys, you need to answer simple questions like "How many times per week you do shopping?" This is a sample of questions that you will see when you register with an online paid survey service.    How much do I earn from that work? The only person that can answer this question is you. The amount of monthly income is dependent on your work. Every time you do a survey, you will get paid. So, the amount of earning can be very high if you do the full time work with online surveys.|`|OOkNg0IIaa	Yes paid surveys are real, but the problem is that there are far more sites "posing" as surveys out there than there are real ones.  I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago.  I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5.  The next few months were more of the same.  But I stuck with it and was patient.  Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1.  There are no guarantees with surveys.  It's all about your demographics.  Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find.  The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list.  Period.  All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient.  If it works for you, it won't work instantly.  I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month."  Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk.  You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great.  And if you don't you walk away.    Good luck!|`|V2Om2aa3aa	Onlin Surveys are not a scam provided you know which one to go to. However, surveys are very limited for those below 18 years old.

You would be contacted by the personnel manager.  After a period of one month you would be required to see a doctor contracted by the company.  On his findings you would either return to work on light duties or face dismissal or they would place you on the long term sick list and contact you at a later date.  Don't worry.  Make sure your company is updated regularly about your condition, there is nothing worse than not knowing what is going on!|`|EPzw6hHKaa	No, you definitely can`t be sacked for being off sick as long as you have a sick note from either your Doctor or the hospital, it used to be 2 years you could be off sick for before the company will have a meeting with you and see if there is a way to solve the situation, they have a right to cease your employment then but if they do they will have to pay you redundancy and most don`t want to do that.

AYLRIMZJaa	Hi!  I have an IRA myself, and used to do them at the bank that I used to work for.  Here are your answers...    1. No.  But if you are underage, your parents or guardian have to be on it with you.  2. There are alot of options.  I have mine with etrade.com.  But if you have a bank that you deal with, you may want to check them out first.  The difference in the actual accounts are the same everywhere depending on if you have a traditional ira or a roth ira.  Where you get into differences are the things that you invest in.  Which can vary from place to place.  3. Usually not.  But like I said, the difference will be in what you invest in.  I am invested in 3 different things.  I have regular stock, which has trade fees, and I have 2 different mutual funds that have zero fees.  Some funds have minimum initial investments.  4. 59 1/2.  But there are different reasons that you can withdraw early without penalty.  Buying a house, education, and financial hardship.    Make sure that you read a little about IRA's so that you know which one is right for you.  There are differences.  And if you are young, make sure that you diversify.  You don't want all of your money in one thing.    Hope this helps.  And if you want more info, you can get it from your bank, or you can go to www.etrade.com and read about IRA's for free.|`|AA12072765	Here is another link that may help you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_...|`|ww12lItvaa	Do you have taxable earned income?     One of the biggest benefits of an IRA is the ability to deduct the investment off your taxes.|`|AA10259042	How about a few things you did not ask about?     There are 2 different types of IRA accounts--traditional and Roth.  The difference is that the 1st allows you to not pay current taxes on the amount you put into the account during that tax year.  The taxes are paid when the money is taken from the account.  The second you have to pay taxes on the money you put into the account but you never have to pay taxes on any money taken from the account.      You can withdraw the money at any time, but you will have to pay a 10% penalty in addition to taxes if you withdraw the money before age 59 1/2.     There may be a minimum depending on where you open the account.  Most mutual funds do have a minimum, some of only $500 but many have a higher minimum.  A bank probably does not have a minimum.  If the minimum presents a problem then a bank is where to open one until you accumulate enough to meet the minimum of another investment option.  Then you can transfer your IRA.  I had my IRA at a bank for several years initially.

If he is paying you as a contractor then he needs to give you a 1099 (this will show the amount he has paid).  If he is paying you as though you are a "business", then you will need to file your taxes as though you are a small business.  In either event, your tax bill will basically be the same.    You may also want to consider eliciting the help of a CPA to make sure you have everything on your return in order.      For tax preparation help, you could try the site below...I found it very helpful and they are extremely fast and friendly. They are CPA's but I think they moonlight and prepare taxes so they have "day jobs"...it's not like they are doing it for the money. They're just trying to help people out. Also, their rate can't be beat...last year, I paid something like $50 and they prepared my return for me and got me the refund fast.

You must file a tax return using Sch C-EZ (or C) and Sch SE.

You can refinance it in just your name to get him off but he'd have to sign the deed over to you.
5Gxll9Hkaa	No, because this is a very personal question without a cut and dried answer.    In general, most bankruptcy attorneys recommend bankruptcy to those who cannot (not "don't want to" or "would be inconvenienced by" but CAN NOT) repay their debts and still maintain a reasonable standard of living.    There's the rub: what counts as a "reasonable standard of living."  Some people have a higher tolerance for poverty than others.      There are some clear cases: for example, nobody would want or expect families with children to be living on the streets or in homeless shelters just because ALL of their take-home pay is going to the repayment of unsecured debts.    On the opposite end of the spectrum, nobody would expect a debtor to claim regular vacations abroad and expensive gambling junkets as "necessary living expenses" that prevented him or her from repaying debts.    But there is a LOT of territory in between those two extremes.    For example: some families feel that they are not able to provide their children a reasonable childhood if so much of their income is going to repayment of debts that the children are never able to participate in school trips or sports, afterschool activities like girl scouts, boy scouts, etc., attend birthday parties, see a movie, or go anywhere or do anything with their friends for years on end, all of which typically require some fee or expenditure of money.  Other people feel that they are perfectly capable of maintaining a healthy happy family home and raising well adjusted happy children at that level of poverty.    Some people are willing and able to make due with nothing other than the clothes and shoes they already have for the next 4 or 5 years, eat on a shoestring budget of - say - $35/week, and make any necessary repairs to their homes and cars themselves in order to repay their creditors.  Others really genuinely aren't.    Another consideration is garnishments.  Often the initial event that brings debtors to a bankruptcy attorney's office is that some creditor has sued and obtained a garnishment and is keeping so much of the debtor's wages that the debtor cannot meet his or her other financial obligations.    Another consideration that many bankruptcy attorneys take into account in advising clients is the client's age and amount of retirement savings.  For very young debtors, say, in their early 20's, it may not be as dangerous to their long term financial stability if - temporarily - ALL of their earnings go to paying off debts and they are unable to save for retirement.  But for debtors who are in their 30s, 40s, 50s or later and have little retirement savings, there is a very real question about whether they (and society) are better served by their continuing to pour all their earnings into paying extremely high interest rates to large profitable credit card companies, or whether they (and society) would be better served if they are able to discharge those debts and start putting something away to prevent their own long-term indigence in retirement.    Really, the best source of a balanced and unbiased evaluation of your own particular circumstances is either (1) a good bankruptcy attorney (believe it or not, they don't always recommend bankruptcy to everybody -- good bankruptcy attorneys will help clients identify strategies to avoid bankruptcy if that is the client's desire and if it makes sense from a financial perspective), or (2) a GOOD non-profit credit counseling agency (but note: the problem here is finding one of the GOOD ones -- there are plenty of rip offs out there that will NOT give you quality advice and may even give very bad advice or steer you into a debt management plan that rips you off).    I'd suggest making an appointment with a GOOD bankruptcy attorney (most offer one free or very low cost appointment for just this purpose) to ask this very question and review your current situation.    Good luck!

RpnS4Poeaa	I wouldn't advise applying for any credit card if you're new to the scene. Right now banks (especially institutions like BMA) are in financial hardships. The only thing you will get is a high interest rate card. There are other things you can do to establish good credit.  Take out a small loan with a fixed interest rate and have a friend or relative co-sign or just have somebody (responsible and reliable) put you're name on an already existing credit card or loan they have. This will boost your score. If you don't qualify for a card with a Visa or Mastercard logo, you shouldn't get a card at all. Chances that your account will be delinquent within 90 days are much higher if you get a card before you have any credit at all.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes, just walk in and they will tell you the requirements.    And yes you can get one without a job, amazing as it sounds,.|`|eNPcNGSjaa	You should try to apply for the card online.  The website will automatically run your credit score and will approve or deny you immediately- this is how banks and credit card companies issue credit cards nowadays.      There aren't "requirements" for applying for a credit card other than having credit, which you don't have.  Thus, I doubt you will be accepted for a new card.  But you might as well try, applying for the card does not affect your credit.    If you are denied, you should look into applying for either a student credit card or something like a retail credit card (like Old Navy, or Sears).  Get these card solely to build credit.  The less you use your credit card and the more often you pay it off, the higher your credit score will grow.  Thus, the next time you apply for a card, you will definitely be approved.    Also, if you have a bank account in your name and you are over the age of 18, you will most likely receive "pre-approved" cards in the mail.  These pre-approved cards have horrible APR rates but are a perfect opportunity to build credit, so make sure you pay them off on time.|`|SlIsqibwaa	If I were you, I'd go seek some professional consultation.

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	As a person who critiques resumes as a former recruiter, I have the following suggestions.    Far too many people use the same resume for EVERY job they apply for. Instead, you want to look at the job requirements on the job posting and make sure your resume demonstrates that you can do those requirements. A busy recruiter looks at a resume for just a few seconds, and when they have 30+ resumes for each job, they will select the resumes that meet all of the requirements.     Also, a lot of people will list what they have done, instead of their achievements.     For example (simplified explanation)  Let's say you are applying for a job which requires a person who has experience with SolidWorks...instead of listing SolidWorks...list it as   Capable of using SolidWorks for 3D Renderings.    I would recommend using bullet points, instead of a paragraph style format, because it makes it easier for a recruiter to review your resume. If it's too wordy, they'll lose interest.

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Well, businesses are required to give you your W-2 by January 31st, so you definitely should have received it by now.     Is this a corporate or franchise dealership? If its a corporate dealership, call the HQ for your area and speak to them, and they will be able to provide it for you. If its a franchise, and you aren't getting a return call, you really need to go in person, and try to speak to somebody on the spot. W-2s are NOT forwarded by the Post Office, so they sent it to the wrong address, it will be returned to them.    If you STILL don't have any luck, you will need to go above their heads. Here is some info from the IRS.GOV website as to what to do in that case:    If you do not receive the missing or corrected form by February 15th from your employer/payer, you may call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 for assistance. You must provide your name, address (including zip code), phone number, Social Security Number, dates of employment, your employer/payer's name, address (including zip code), and phone number. The IRS will contact the employer/payer for you and request the missing form.|`|qILTMskOaa	Maybe you can use your last check stub?

These are yields for treasry securities, i.e. bonds issued by the federal government.    For example, for a 10 year treasury bond, as of Friday you would receive an annual yield (yield means interest rate) of 2.85%. It also gives what the yields were from previous dates (1 day, 1 week and 1 month ago).

qNVP4Q1Saa	All those companies do is combine the amounts pay them off and assign you a higher percentage rate over a longer period of time. It is a scam as they charge you for the doing.  Just call each of the credit card companies and explain that you would like a stay for X months. They may ask you to pay a certain amount each. THen make a calendar and just pay the minimums and you will get out of it once the job comes in.  If you are no good at it then just walk into a bank and get a loan. Tell them what it is for and if you have collateral etc, like a car that can be used if it is paid off.        I believe you best bet is to simply call them all and make arrangements. The card that treats you the best should be the one to keep. And going forward, YOU DONT NEED FOUR CARDS.  Just get one good one and spend less money.. Good luck....chance favors the prepared mind....|`|kH81xs9Waa	Please do not use a debt consolidation company... if you think about it, how do they make money?  Off of you!  You've got a few options.

The key with these is to never charge another thing on them, or else you'll trigger interest charges.      Or, you can continue making the payments on your current cards as best you can. If you call the credit card company, they may work with you to set up a payment plan that you can afford.      If you need one on one advice, most communities offer free credit counseling.  Just check with your local government or community center.|`|1pxh5uSkaa	yo|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Debt consolidation is very popular - with the companies who will do that for you - but your total debt increases - sometimes substantially, while the regular payments are reduced.

Struggle with you current debt, and cut up your credit cards. They will wait for their money as long as you keep paying regularly.
Pl9lY7qCaa	Just a short & simple answer to your question.  Either it is same business or different, don't go for partnership business.|`|A13xffyFaa	I think if your family is in a partnership business then it's ok for you to get into that as it will help you a lot to build yourself. In case fo proprietory busines, you will not get the disadvantages which are there in partnership like something called"act of a firm" in which even though any other partner commits some fraud you all will have to bear the loss and thereafter you will be able to sue the partner for the recovery of the lost money that also through court. in case of proprietory you will not get finance in as quick as you get it in partnership, also you will be the one who will be resposible in toto.     But as you said it's your family business i see no harm in joining in. You better be with the people you know rather than with those you don' know.   Ask you family what is better for you they will help you in that as they know it better than what i do and what you do!!  Best of Luck.

ZeDjn4cVaa	You need to find out if the  per diem amount was included in his wages (Box 1 of W-2).  If it was not then there is nothing to do since he is not being taxed on the per diem.  If his assignment of  out of town work was for more than 12 months, he probably is not allowed to deduct the per diem as described below.    If it is included in the wage total, you will need to fill out form 2106.    (1) Gather tax, rental car, etc. receipts paid by your husband while working out of town.  If  he was reimbursed or the company paid it directly, do not include the expenditure.  (2) Look up in publication 1542 the diem rate for meals and miscellaneous expenses for the location or locations where your husband worked.  Multiply the number of days at each location by the per diem rate to get a total.  (3) On the 2106 form there is space for  meals and space for travel, rental car, etc.  $3 per day of the per diem can go under miscellaneous expenses and the rest goes under meals.  The meals number on the 2106 form is mutiplied  by 50% (only 1/2 of per diem meals is deductible).  (4) After completing the 2106, take the bottom line total and put it on Line 21 of your schedule A.    The rest of your return is as it would be.

AA11966821	Very bad timing.  Don't say a word.  If you change jobs, you'll lose your health insurance benes, if any.  It's too late to get a new insurance policy -- no coverage for maternity benes until you've had the policy at least 10 months.  Getting a new job now is very difficult, and not telling a prospective employer that you are planning to take time off in a few months is grossly unfair, while failure to tell may be smart, but you will get payback later.  And you won't have any accrued sick leave or vacation time at a new employer, either.<br>  <br>  Your best bet at the moment is to hunker down and do your job to the very best of your ability.  Hang on there as long as possible.  Accrue as much paid sick leave and vacation time as possible.<br>  <br>  I hope your husband's job is more secure, otherwise your baby will be the one who suffers the consequences of poor planning.  You've known about the deteriorating economy and declining employment outlook for many months.|`|WY7HJDpgaa	I think u are just feeling insecure and over reacting a bit.

D4XWrwuaaa	There will be a disincentive for earnings over $250K in terms of reduced value in tax deductions. <br>  <br>  An AP News story covers it in this quote (link to actual news article provided in my source area).<br>  <br>  'Hard choices' budget sees $1.75 trillion deficit<br>  Associated Press<br>  By: Martin Crutsinger - Ap Economics Writer<br>  February 26, 2009<br>  The $634 billion down payment on expanding health care coverage would come from a $318 billion increase over 10 years in taxes on the wealthy, defined as couples making more than $250,000 per year and individuals making more than $200,000. The tax increase would occur by reducing the benefit the wealthy get on tax deductions. As one example, taxpayers in the current top tax bracket of 35 percent would see their tax deduction for every $1 given to charity drop from 35 cents to 28 cents.<br>  <br>  I know my boss, who owns the business I work at, is already working with our accountant to see what he can to to avoid being caught up in this. His salary is more than the $250,000.  So he is talking to our accountant to see if it woudl be smart for him to reduce his salary and take take the rest of the money in some other way (company perks, company car, etc.)|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Frankly Obama is full of reasons to sit on the sofa and let the govt' take care of you.

You are very confused.<br>  <br>  Even if the tax rate was 50%, you'd still have more money than if you made none above $250,000.<br>  <br>  Example: If someone makes $250,000 and stops, they have $250,000.<br>  <br>  If the tax rate is a ridiculous 50%, then if they earn $300,000 then they still get to keep $25,000 (half of the extra $50,000).

Ofcom regulations state that companies cold calling need to check all numbers with the TPS and if you are on it then you should not get calls.<br>  <br>  Some smaller companies may not check this so you should complain when they call and ask to be added to their "Do Not Call List" manually.  Companies can also get around this if you have purchased something from them in the past and class you as an existing customer, therefore will not need to use the TPS, however, as above just ask to be added to their "Do Not Call List".<br>  <br>  This will all help to stop the calls but will not be immediate.|`|ScBbG8XNaa	Click here,<br>  Earn money,<br>  <a href="http://my.yougov.com/go.aspx?id=1e8f6a0b-53e5-47ba-84d6-c42538abff82" rel="nofollow">http://my.yougov.com/go.aspx?id=1e8f6a0b...</a><br>  Free and quick sign up.<br>  Give it a go )

11KAjY3Paa	I would suggest, starting with free advertising first, as they can be quite effective and of course, it will prevent you from putting out money before making it.     In some advertising communities there are many options, for you, if you choose to purchase advertising to possibly increase your traffic, and they are considered to be quite affordable.     In any case free advertising will give you the option, to stay as a free member or purchase, if you feel the need too.      Hope This Helped!     Maria Angelozzi
Saul1Bhuaa	Yes, you can file.  Contact a bankruptcy attorney.  Bankruptcies remain on credit files for 10 years.  They destroy credit scores, but can be repaired over a few years.    However, IMHO, if:    1.  You have no assets. (i.e., house, car, boat, money)  2.  You have no job.  3.  Your only debt is $7,000    Then, filing bankruptcy is not a good idea.  Rather, either default entirely on the debt and wait for the statute of limitations to run.  Or, work with a bankruptcy attorney to negotiate a settlement that reduces your debt and interest rate.
vqdurAA5aa	Yes it sounds fair, but it does not sound like it is worth the risk/effort of participating.
KN3I89Ycaa	There would be fees...it is a cash advance from your American Express card.  If it is a charge card Amex, you would have to pay the amount by the due date.  If it's the credit card, you can carry the balance.  Call your Amex card and tell them you want to do a cash advance to your checking account and they can help you and tell you the fee...usually 3% of the transfer plus a higher interest rate for carrying the balance.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	If the something you want to buy is not a necessity, a want instead of a need just don't buy it. If you continue to use credit cards you will be paying for things years and years after you bought them because of the  interest charged.....just don't make sense to me unless it is a true emergency.

You would need a letter from your doctor and/or copies  of your medical bills. They are probably still coming after you because they're not going to take your word for it that illness was the cause. You have to prove it. Check with the credit bureaus but I believe if the collection company has not received what they precieve as adequate proof your reason was valid, your dispute is taken off the credit report after 30 days.

Now there are two ways to solve this, an easy and a hard way, based on my experiences. <br>  <br>  The Hard way is to call the credit bureau and clearly identify the disputed item, state the facts, and indicate why it should be deleted or corrected. Follow up in writing with copies (not originals) of documents backing your claim. It is helpful to include a copy of the report on which you've circled the disputed items. Definitely use certified mail, and request a return receipt.

The LEDGER, balance is the balance after all transactions post at the end of a business day.  Depending on what time Friday the deposit was received, it MAY post as a Monday deposit.  The AVAILABLE balance is the amount you can actually use.  This is often updated during the day to reflect deposits and any withdraws the bank knows about.  By law, electronic deposits must become available for use immediately.

m2Z4wnE5aa	Absolutely. For a few reasons:<br>  1. State Laws - Some states Mandate a generic filled when available unless Doctors specifically sign (DAW(dispense as written or "no substituition"). Doctors don't always know when a patent expires on a brand drug and when they become generic.<br>  <a href="http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/statutes_by_pharmacists.html" rel="nofollow">http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/s...</a><br>  2.  FDA approves the generic to be as safe and effective as the brand name drug.  I believe it is something like 90% has to be the exact active ingredient. Differences of ingredients in brand vs generics are inactive ingredients like binders (what holds the tablet together). The company that makes the brand name usually continues making brand name and sells it as the generic once the patent is expired.  In this case the medication is identical in every aspect (except price).<br>  3.  Cost. Generics are cheaper. One of the reasons is generics aren't advertised. In 2005 Nexium spent 224 Million dollars to advertise from 2001- 2005. Who do you think pays for that.  Another reason is most of the research done to make a generic was done by the original drug company, generic manufactures don't need to recoup millions/ billions of dollars spent on research.<br>  Donohue JM. NEJM 2007; 357: 673-81<br>  4.  Pharmacies make more money on generics.  Most people don't realize that.  Here is why. I can get a bottle of #30 Brand Drug "x" for $100.  I can get a bottle of #30 Generic Drug "x" for $10.  It is a lot easier to mark up something cheap than something expensive.  If I marked up the $100 on $10 dollars and the $10 generic was marked up $20 dollars, the generic is still $80 dollars cheaper. Now my customer comes in a $30 prscription is a better deal than a $110 rx. Mos of the time the margin of mark up on brand name drugs is not enough to keep a business open. <br>  $4 rx, actual cost can be .25 to $2.  That is a 2-16x mark up.  Could I mark up a drug that costs me $100 by 2-16. Charging 200 to 1600 dollars? No Way?  Remember before the $4 rx they were charging around $8 for them.  <br>  These 4 reasons to sell generics when available are beneficial to all parties other that the company selling Brand drug.  It must not hurt them to bad though.  When Prilosec went over the counter the price was cut down by about 60% by the drug manufacturer.  They wouldn't have done that if it meant they wouldn't be making money on it. <br>  <br>  If patient wants brand name all they have to do is ask (in 47 states).  The insurance might penalize the patient for it but a pharmacy will fill brand if thats what the patient wants (if allowed by the law)<a href="http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/statutes_by_pharmacists.html" rel="nofollow">http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/s...</a>|`|ScXcnZiUaa	From a pharmacy perspective, no.  They get a lot more income by selling name brand stuff.  After all, everyone is here to make money for themselves.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Pharmacy's should give customers what their doctors prescribed. My wife's grandmother was almost killed when a pharmacist changed her prescription from a name brand to the generic equivalent and she had an allergic reaction to it. Doctors know generics are available and if they determine that there is one that will work, they will typically specify that generic substitution is allowed. Without this permission, its irresponsible for pharmacists to make that swap. <br>  <br>  In the case of my wife's grandmother, it has been determined that the generic drug is the same, but the fillers used to make the pill are different and there have been other cases of people having bad reactions to the generic. My wife takes the same thyroid supplement that her grandmother does and she too has had negative reactions when the generic was swapped. My wife's doctors now specify that generic substitutions are not allowed on her prescriptions without specific approval from the doctor. My wife is careful to read the label every time she picks up the prescription and on more than one occasion she's found a pharmacist ignored the doctor's orders and gave her the generic anyway.|`|S0XPrJ2laa	no but they shouldnt discourage it either.

l1VZkkOSaa	As a sole proprietor, you should be recording any money you take out in a capital account called something like 'Owner withdrawals - Shawna L.'    I don't quite understand/agree with your statement 'Since I actually pay taxes on everything that comes in I do not need to pay taxes on my income.' Unfortunately, everyone gets to pay tax on their personal income here in the USA if they make over a certain amount. Whatever taxes you are already paying on the money coming in is part of doing business and completely separate from your personal income tax liability.  -----------  Oh hey, I just noticed in your first sentence that you say that you are the 'only employee'. That doesn't fly either. You are the owner of the business, not an employee of the business.  -----------  Your question actually describes several of the downsides of going into business on your own. The company pays taxes. The owner of the company also has to pay taxes on whatever he/she takes out of it. The sole proprietor organizational structure is even a bit more scary, seeing as how the owner and the business are regarding as being one legal entity. If someone sues the company, they are suing you. Your assets, both company and personal, are all on the line in that scenario.

xoqQbHi1aa	Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. There is a better way.    A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. The holidays are coming and there will be plenty of temporary jobs available. It is better to have a no fun year or two than a no fun decade.       Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.    2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.    3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt  1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt  2. That will pay debt  2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card  3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:    To start :  Debt  1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment  Debt  2 (middle interest): minimum payment  Debt  3(lowest interest): minimum payment    Debt  1: paid off  Debt  2: minimum payment from Debt  1+ Minimum payment from Debt  2 +extra payment  Debt  3: minimum payment    Debt  1: paid off  Debt  2: paid off  Debt  3:Mimimum payment from card  1+ minimum payment from Debt  2+ minimum payment from Debt  3+ extra payment.    That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.    4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.    5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.    5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.    5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.    You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan.|`|5BTKscZraa	What you need to know about debt settlement firms:    Your credit card companies are not going to offer you settlements like 50%, for example, if you are current (not behind) on your payments. If credit card companies offered settlements to people who are current on their payments, then everyone would be calling them up and asking for 50% settlements. Basically, the only way you can get into a position to negotiate settlements is to deliberately let your accounts go into default. This is exactly what debt settlement firms do....They take a monthly amount from you and use that to build a settlement account, which will go towards paying the settlement at a later date. Whatever monthly payments you make will go directly to the debt settlement firm for their fees and your settlement account. All of your accounts will go unpaid and your creditors will not be happy about this.     If you are current on your accounts, this process will ruin your credit rating as your accounts will all go into default. Your creditors are under no obligation whatsoever to accept settlements from any debt settlement firm you hire. Their response might be to serve you papers and take you to court.    Debt settlement "can" be a viable alternative to filing for BK....you just need to be aware that if you currently have good credit...the debt settlement firms will deliberately let all your accounts charge-off/default to put them into a position to negotiate settlements. It can be a stressful and unpredictable process....As your accounts all go into default...you will get increasingly aggressive collection calls from debt collectors. It is "typical" that creditors offer settlements for defaulted credit card debt....They often do this in lieu of loosing everything if you file for BK.....    HOWEVER, you can never predict how any one creditor will respond to defaulted debt. They might decide to take you to court and get a judgment against you. Debt settlement firms have no power whatsoever to stop creditors from taking this action and they have no power to force creditors to accept settlements.    ****If you have already defaulted on your cards....make your own settlement offers...you can do this on your own and it puts you in control. If you do...get all settlement terms IN WRITING PRIOR to paying them.    Regardless of which firm you use (or if you do it yourself)...the act of deliberately defaulting on credit cards to force creditors to accept settlements can be an unpredictable and risky process.  If you can live with the risks involved, then continue with the program.|`|OUIAspBUaa	Why pay someone for something that with a little effort you can do yourself. You can contact your creditors and negotiate things on your own. Try to negotiate lower interest rates. If you have collection(s) then negotiate settlements or payments. The only thing these credit service companies do is combine all your payments and charge you money to do it. You end up paying more through them. They are all big rip offs!! Do yourself a favor and try things on your own first. If all else fails then do what you have to.

Most creditors are reasonable when they see  a medical collection account on your credit report. When you apply for new credit and this issue comes up, write a short letter explaining the circumstances and then SUPPORT it with the other documentation you have  If the new creditor sees you made  a "good faith effort" they will likely not count that against you    If this never shows up and you feel compelled to pay, then pay it.

When she was 15 she unwittingly joined some kind of record club by signing up for a free record (this was in the olden days before cds). She began getting bills and was trying to figure out where she would get the money. Finally they started sending threatening letters, which she brought to me. She was terrified by the threats in the letter. The same day a collector called her and I happened to be at home. She gave  me the phone and I asked the debt collector if he knew he had illegally made a contract with a 15 year old? He said no, but that now I was responsible for the debt. Among other things I said to him I told him I had not signed a contract or any other document that would make me responsible. That was his last card so he said good bye and I never heard from them again. It taught my daughter a valuable lesson to  always read and know what you're signing and gave me great pleasure in letting the debt collector know that I knew he was just a plain old liar. I would vehemently dispute the debts and tell the credit bureaus to compare the date the account was opened with your birth year. They will see that you were  a minor at the time and having a contract with   a minor is  illegal and your parents  aren't liable either unless they signed the contract also. btw My daughter had no idea when she was signing a contract, it was all on a postcard sized paper and in very small print. You were led to believe when you signed at the bottom you got your free record and that was it. When in fact, you had signed up for a club membership that sent you one record a month that you had to pay for. I imagine something similar is what happened to you. Don't let the collectors bully or bs you. Let them know that you are aware that what  they did was illegal and you could in fact sue them...the dirty rats.

If it is, there are two things you might consider if you're concerned with that builder's craftsmanship. First, find out what other homes this builder has built, and go do some door knocking and speak to the owners of those homes. Inquire of them about what problems they may have encountered. Most homeowners would be glad to speak with you about their home and if they are displeased with their home, they will not hesitate to tell you.  The second and most important step, regardless if it's a new home or a 100 year old home, always get an inspection. Inspectors are licensed professionals who have an unbiased interest and will give you every detail of what they discover.  I would never allow a buider to talk you out of getting your own inspection. A homebuyer's inspection is for your own protection and the cost involved is minimal considering the problems you may encounter later on if you purchase the home as an uninformed consumer.|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	I'll tell you right off the bat, get your own inspector, and go with him to do the inspection.  Make sure you get a full explanation of everything he finds, and make sure he checks not only structural integrity, but also plumbing, electric and disposal facilities.  You will also want to know about mail, utilities available and from whom, sewer or septic system, and who to see about them.  And just generally make sure you have the whole scoop before you even put down earnest money on it.  Paramount--don't let anything slide till after you have signed for it.  If there is something that needs repaired or modified, make sure that it is done before you close, and make sure that it is done right.  Don't trust someone else to see to it, make your own inspection.  Once you own it, it's your problem, and nobody will give a crap about fixing it.

Hae8acnpaa	It is all very well for people to say it is the employer's problem etc in a situation like this but really people need to stop and think.    We are in a full blown recession. A job is a job. Businesses whether large or small cannot always afford whether in financial terms or man hour terms to accommodate the wants and needs of the staff.    In the ideal world 'utopia' promised to those who listened, by Gordon and his cronies, everyone would have everything they wanted.    Well here we are in reality and it bites.

5BTKscZraa	If these debts are for defaulted/charged-off cards:    Dont make the mistake of simply cutting a check to whatever collection agency has the debt for the charge-off and assume that your credit rating will be magically restored...Doing so will not remove it from your credit reports. It will simply be updated to a "Paid Charge-Off," which, while slightly better, is still a seriously derogatory item. Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a charge-off, whether paid or not, can remain on a consumer's credit reports for up to seven years.    Paying them back does look better for buying houses or renting. A mortgage broker will insist that all defaulted debt be paid off.    If you're going to pay off old-charged-off debt anyway, then you might as well negotiate the lowest, rock bottom settlement you can possibly get, being that the negative charge-off notation is going to stay for 7 years on your credit report anyway. ..Mail them a vaguely worded statement like:    I am willing to settle this matter for 25% of the original amount. This is in no way an admission of this debt, but rather an attempt to settle this matter. Your firm must send me a written agreement on your company's letterhead that you will accept this amount as "payment in full" and that is issue will be settled.

Starting with the smallest amounts, once that is done pay off older debt that might alreadt be on your credit report.

AA10259042	Just means that stocks are a whole lot less expensive than they have been in years.  One thing you have to understand about the Dow is that it is and was full of crap--C, BAC,  AGI, GE, GM.  Probably not a real good indicator of business as whole.|`|ww12lItvaa	No, I think it has been overpriced most of that time.     It is also why I have thought for a long time that the market would come down or returns slow. The numbers didn't support the prices IMO.     A company that has a P/E of 20 is making 5% or 5 cents for every dollar you invest. How can you expect a company to return the historical average of 11% if it is only making 5%?  The main answer is "growth". They need to increase earnings to grow to a P/E of 10 to return at least 10%.      But as you keep the P/E at 20 as earnings grow, eventually you reach a point where it is impossible for a company to double their earnings to be making the 10% at which your risk should be rewarded.     And right now we don't have growth in earnings, we have contraction. So P/Es should be even lower.    I think the market prices make more sense at the moment.     But one can't fight the market. They say it can stay illogical longer than you can stay liquid.|`|aCDWwsisaa	!'m not retiring any time soon, so it just looks like an extended buying opportunity to me, with almost all the Dow stocks on sale at bargain prices!|`|375ffaceecee2420f9e38aba060fb989aa	Generally the longer a time frame for a ma the more significance but a 200 month moving average is just too long.  I would plot the importance of a ma as a bell curve maxing out at about 5 years.  The entire structure of business has changed so what was 16 years ago has little to do with the business environment now.  Just in time inventory control, increased automated production, globalization are examples of this.

I have put in a misc. savings column and a housing repairs/maintenance column. I guess it could go in either one. The misc. savings column is for stuff that doesn't happen every month. Things like license plates or my yearly membership to Cotsco. On the other hand, We save every month for repairs to the house but don't always spend it every month. I guess you could put it in either place. I would probably put it in my misc. column.<br>  I hope this plan is working for you as well as it is for us.

You do not need and should not get a debit card.  You want to be smarter than your friends, don't you?  Then don't get into the habit of instant gratification.

hFIOk90Faa	So I am not sure about percentages where you live but... My pay is around790 with out and deductions and By the time deductions are done it is around 660$ so probably out of that 140-150 is taken off my pay .... Our percentage is 13% taxes... your may be different..    What you do is find out how much you pay on taxes for your every day spending, then once you know that you are good to know the %     lets say you work 40 hrs/week    8.65 x 40 = 346    Now lets say you work for two weeks before you get paid    346+346 = 692    Now lets say your % of taxes are... 13%    692 x 0.013 = 89.96      now subtract that from your pay     692 - 89.96 =  602.04    So what you would make of that pay would be around 580$ after all the deductions are taken off.. vacation pay is usually 4%      I hope that helped a little bit!|`|VJpdmd0waa	Depends at what percent you put the rate at to take taxes out.

gqlC8cbpaa	Well, are you able to make the payments?  Or at least maintain the vehicle without being repoed?  But one thing is important to remember, your benefits CANNOT be touched by anyone.  NO garnishments on SS.  As far as the car,  Each state has provisions on what you can keep and what you cannot.  If it is something that you cannot keep, which is usually the case because the loan amount.  You can redeem it under chapter 7, which means that you file chapter 7 for around 1200 total (depends on attorney) and you redeem the vehicle meaning that the attorney will stear you to a lender that will lend you a lump sum amount of the actual fair market value of the vehicle and your finance company HAS TO TAKE IT AND RELEASE THE TITLE.  Then you, if you had a loan anywhere near as ridiculous as mine !  You will be paying MUCH MUCH less per month for vehicle as a whole and maybe depending on your interest rate, a lower one.  For instance my van was 435.47/mo.  for like 41/2 years.  I got financed 14,000 for a 8,000 van!!!!!!  My payoff is like 12,000 and you can buy a brand new van (mine is 05) same van for that much!!!  Fair market value is only 6500!!  Doesn't that beat the heck out of a loan with 3 more year left of 435.47/mo. payments!!!!!!~!~!~  WOW.  So I would take a good lood at your loan, the interest rate, if you can handle it, and especially the fair market value of your vehicle, you would be really surprised!!!!  Good luck.  I am still dealing with my disability "fight" LOL!!!!!|`|AA11173563	no not at all. The only thing that can attach theses payments to you is the IRS and Student loan
b85YIs3daa	I would not pay anything until you get a job. If you haven't noticed, jobs aren't falling out of the sky anymore. Even if you are super qualified, I'd pull up a seat for the long run. During this time, the credit card companies are going to continue piling on the interest and late fees. They are really just digging their own grave by not helping you out. If you are unemployed too long, you will have no choice but bankruptcy when you see how much they have added on.    I see that others are telling you to at least pay something. I see why they say this, but you have to consider all the current circumstances with the economy. Sending them a little bit of money is not really helping that much if you are unemployed for a very long time. You are pretty much just throwing good money away as it will be eaten by all their fees.     If you do insist on paying them, you should let them know how much you can pay and that you won't be paying a dime unless they lower the interest rate and remove the last 2 late payment charges. If they don't, again, I would not pay. It's a waste.|`|5BTKscZraa	- Chapter 7 is the version of Bk that discharges most debts like credit card debt. To file Chapter 7 you need to pass a "means" test, which roughly translates that your income must be below the average for your state. Contact a local BK attorney to see if you quality to file for Chapter 7.  If you qualify to file, remember that you can only file Chapter 7 once every eight years...so be sure that you are really in a true financial emergency before you file.   - Chapter 13 is the version of BK that is like a court supervised repayment plan...where you pay back your debt under a court sanctioned plan over 3-5 years. There are no income requirements for filing Chapter 13.  This version of BK does not discharge debt like Chapter 7. Past due mortgage payments can be included as part of a Chapter 13 filing.  Note: Chapter 13 will not do much good if the real problem is a lack of income/cash flow.   - You might as well enroll in a CCCS (Consumer Credit Counseling Services) debt management plan...(contact your local Red Cross for a referral)...because this is a required step to filing for bankruptcy, should you choose to do this. They can negotiate lower payments and interest rates with your creditors. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.  Money saving tips: Cancel all cell phone accounts (even if you're under contract).

If possible, either (a) borrow against the equity in your home to obtain money to pay the credit cards, or (b) sell your car.|`|U4ABDwKPaa	If you are already 2 months behind they won't be very helpful.

If you have decent equity in your home try refinancing some of the worst debt into a 2nd  mortgage just be careful of who you go to.  Of course job hunting is your first priority but some lenders will do it just based on how much your property is worth (if there is good value there).    Good luck.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	Do you have positive equity in your home?  Many years ago when my father was waiting for ss disability to start and my mother was laid off, they did a cash out refi which allowed them to take a portion of the equity in the home to pay other bills temporarily.    If you don't have equity, try calling the credit card companies again and speaking to someone higher up.      If that doesn't work, try finding ways to get some extra cash.  ie selling junk in closets.  Doing odd jobs in neighborhood.  I'm only suggesting these because I'm sure you are already doing everything you can to find regular employment.    If all else fails, ask friends and family for help.  If they can't and it looks like you won't be able to find another job soon, file for bankruptcy.

ymqWa8GNaa	It is on quite a run.    There are two ways to strategize your decision.    1.  Wait for a pullback.    2.  RIMM is a high probability for takeover, which is either attracting additional interest, or is being steadily accumulated by a  potential suitor.  Likely it's both, and the stock will only continue to accelerate after pulling back.  How much of a pullback will come is anyone's guess.     As a result of the above, I would not go "all in" in the stock, but would buy in multiple purchases to average my cost in (if you believe scenario 2), or would wait for a pullback (if you believe scenario 1).    The concept espoused by some that EVERY good stock is an "awesome buy" right now is flawed.  They are basing their opinion on the likelihood that "this setback/recession is just like all the previous ones".  Are you willing to bet your savings on that?

N4xd99Qaaa	In my opinion Employers always hype a job position. They ask for a lot more than what is always required. So in your position, I would think in your 6 years in the restaurant business you have trained others (taught people) and managed a variety of customers under stress (like managing a classroom) so I would apply even if I didn't meet the true prerequisites, because in my non-related jobs I have learned skills that will help me in the job I am applying for. So the question is are confident you can do a job just as well as someone with 2 more years experience and are to able to demonstrate to the employer that you are well qualified for the job even though you do not meet the prerequisites on paper.|`|Maoj7HYSaa	You time as an esl teacher counts as professional experience.

2eztcCO0aa	Consider raffling the house off.  Sell a certain number of chances at a certain price and you can get as much as you can by selling the house.  You will probably have to cover closing costs and such so the house can be truly free to the entrant (after he or she pays the entry fee).  Many people are doing this instead of trying to sell their houses outright.  I remember looking at a nice house in Arizona that was being raffled off this way.<br>  <br>  If a raffle is illegal in your area, you can hold a contest instead.  There's a house in Hawaii that is being "sold" in this way right now.  Entrants have to say in 100 words why they deserve the house, and the owner will choose the winner.

UeLigNB0aa	It sounds like you signed up for a 5 year balloon mortgage which means you need to refinance or come up with 400K to payoff the loan.   I have never seen anyone use anything other than a 1003 for a mortgage application.   If the loan documents that were signed at closing by your father were different from what you agreed to you may have a grievance to file with your local state attorney generals office. Just because you were not there to sign does not excuse the broker from pulling a switch on loan programs.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	BB&T does BOTH wholesale and retail lending.  So the broker you went to see did what they call "brokered out" the loan to BB&T, so essentally, the broker was a middle-man.    There is no loan officer in a transaction like yours...there is what they call an "account executive" who handles the contract between BB&T and the broker until it closes and an "assignment of transfer" can be completed...BB&T essentially funds the loan.    A 1003 Loan Application is for MORTGAGE LOANS....this is the standard form that ALL BANKS and brokers are REQUIRED by federal lending regulations to use.    There was no violation...this was a straight forward transaction...unfortunately, you didn't care to be at the closing, because it wasn't that important to you..and sometimes there is a price to pay for that.    Just because you didn't do additional research, doesn't mean anyone did anything illegal.    If you gave your father a Power of Attorney (which must be signed and recorded along with the note), that bears the SAME legal weight as if you were there.    So it doesn't even matter if something changed at the last minute...YOU made the CHOICE not to be there.    You signed a copy of the FINAL loan application at closing and in the initial disclosures that you mailed back...it is a common practice for brokers to fill these out for clients so all they have to do is sign them with information that you supply...when you signed another copy at closing, your signature VERIFIED that you reviewed the document and you signed that it was ACCURATE.    When I owned my own mortgage brokerage...I did this all the time and it's 100% legal.    Sorry...it's not what you want to hear.    I can also tell you by the figures, you got ripped off on that loan.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	Well first off. I would check with a real estate attorney about the legal part of your father signing a loan like this.

I would go for a loan modification.|`|wADsOOILaa	You signed a blank loan application?  That was a pretty big clue of trouble ahead.    Modify or refinance.

X9GPTUr1aa	You can try secured credit cards.  A secured card requires a cash collateral deposit that becomes the credit line for that account. For example, if you put $500 in the account; you can charge up to $500. You may be able to add to the deposit to add more credit, or sometimes a bank will reward you for good payment and add to your credit line without requesting additional deposits.    Another way to build credit is to go to a local bank and apply for the smallest installment loan they have.  If they approve the loan, great, if not ask if they will approve it if you open a CD for the amount and use that to secure the loan.  If they ask why you are doing this, say I want to establish credit with this bank.  Make payments until the CD matures and then pay off the loan.  It takes some time but its a great way to help build your credit.  Hope this helps.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Capital One and Orchard however do not look for great terms or interest rates and yes you will have an annual fee.|`|AA10072911	With a credit score that low you will have a hard time finding a bank to issue you a credit card.

That will help you being to built a positive payment history and improve your credit score.  You might also consider opening a small 12 month secured loan at your local bank to help improve your credit score.

You are not REALLY selling them computer stuff.  You are selling them, what?  Patient help?  A good ear/eye for figuring out what's wrong when they cannot for the life of them?  Someone between them and the uncaring manufacturer?  Someone who is smart but not a drooling geek?    You see what I mean?  Then whatever THAT is, which you are selling, THAT is the actual "plus".    So ... one of our clients sells payroll services, but the trade show display we did for them has a guy relaxing with his feet up on a desk ... he can trust them and he can relax.   Another client 'sells accounting" literally but the design shows someone climbing up and over a hill, because he is showing he understands small businesses..    So - what is the plus that you offer?  Ask your repeat clients and anyone who you know has referred a friend or colleague to you.    Best of luck  DElms

The account titles are up to you, but the only thing to note is that upon payment, you take it to an asset account (like a prepayment) and you expense it off to the income statement over the period of the subscription/membership.

For References - If you have any of the above list the people connected with that otherwise list personal references besides immediate family (i.e. not or Mom & Dad) like teachers, coaches or pastors.   Also when you turn in your applications note the time the business isn't busy so you can turn it to a manager. Dress nicely for this - appearances do make an impression. Be polite,give the manager a minute to look over your application and ask any questions they may have. Then ask if they have any positions available or when they expect to be hiring again. If they say something like Joe does all the hiring around here ask when he will be in again, if not ask who is the hiring manager? Try to come back and speak with the hiring manager.

AA10305589	The US Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook is an excellent resource to find out more about various professions, including the nature of the work, educational requirements, median wages, and more.    Here's an excerpt on "Nature of the work" from the section on Electricians, you should refer to the complete article for the most complete information.    http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos206.htm    Electricians bring electricity into homes, businesses, and factories. They install and maintain the wiring, fuses, and other components through which electricity flows. Many electricians also install and maintain electrical machines in factories.     Electricians usually start their work by reading blueprints. Blueprints are technical diagrams that show the locations of circuits, outlets, load centers, panel boards, and other equipment. To ensure public safety, electricians follow the National Electrical Code, and State and local building codes.     Electricians connect all types of wires to circuit breakers, transformers, outlets, or other components. They join the wires in boxes with various specially designed connectors. When installing wiring, electricians use hand tools such as conduit benders, screwdrivers, pliers, knives, hacksaws, and wire strippers, as well as power tools such as drills and saws. Later, they use ammeters, ohmmeters, voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and other equipment to test connections and ensure the compatibility and safety of components.    Electricians generally focus on either construction or maintenance, although many do both. Electricians specializing in construction primarily install wiring systems into factories, businesses, and new homes. Electricians specializing in maintenance work fix and upgrade existing electrical systems and repair electrical equipment.    When electricians install wiring systems in factories and commercial settings, they first place conduit (pipe or tubing) inside partitions, walls, or other concealed areas as designated by the blueprints. They also fasten small metal or plastic boxes to the walls that will house electrical switches and outlets. They pull insulated wires or cables through the conduit to complete circuits between these boxes. The diameter and number of wires installed depends on how much power will need to run through it. The greater the diameter of the wire, the more electricity it can handle. In residential construction, electricians usually install insulated wire encased in plastic, which does not need to run through conduit.     Some electricians also install low-voltage wiring systems in addition to electrical systems, although line installers and repairers specialize in this work. Low-voltage wiring accommodates voice, data, and video equipment, such as telephones, computers, intercoms, and fire alarm and security systems. Electricians also may install coaxial or fiber optic cable for telecommunications equipment and electronic controls for industrial uses.     Maintenance electricians repair or replace electric and electronic equipment when it breaks. They make needed repairs as quickly as possible in order to minimize inconvenience. They may replace items such as circuit breakers, fuses, switches, electrical and electronic components, or wire. Electricians also periodically inspect all equipment to ensure it is operating properly and to correct problems before breakdowns occur.    Maintenance work varies greatly, depending on where an electrician works. Electricians who focus on residential work perform a wide variety of electrical work for homeowners. They may rewire a home and replace an old fuse box with a new circuit breaker box to accommodate additional appliances, or they may install new lighting and other electric household items, such as ceiling fans. These electricians might also do some construction and installation work.     Electricians in large factories usually do maintenance work that is more complex. They may repair motors, transformers, generators, and electronic controllers on machine tools and industrial robots.

PKfh0jhLaa	A! ya wanna build CD Modulators in your spare time?    Seriously, there are VERY few Work-At-Home opportunities and those are for VERY well trained and skilled workers who have proven that they can keep to a schedule and have the personal discipline to get the work done.  the so called opportunities that are advertised on the web are ALL bogus!  Any program that expects you to pay money up-front ... DO NOT PAY ANY MONEY to these people!   Any program that does NOT have a real product or service that they are providing to justify all that loot that they are generating... BEWARE!     SNOT REEL!    There is NO FREE LUNCH!            and as we all know   the emperor is NAKED!  .
eACZ1Rhjaa	You would need to take him to court if you think he should pay half the mortgage to you for the time he wasn't there. When you sell the house the closing cost will be included in the profit or loss from the sale.   You have to sell because his credit is tied up in the house so he can't buy another and is on the hook if you don't pay the payments. Legally you are both each 100% responsible for the mortgage. If you live there a judge would probably say you needed to pay a fair market rent so your half would be that and half the difference.   You need to refi to get him out of your life and if you didn't and there was appreciation you would have to share it with him even if he had been gone 30 years when you sell. Who wanted out doesn't matter.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	You cannot legally force someone to stay in a real estate transaction.    What your ex has done is filed an action to give you the CHOICE between refinancing the home into your name or selling it... before a judge who has zero interest in the case...makes that decision for you.    No, he does not have to pay you back for the last 2 years b/c you both had the property equally.  If you had an issue with it, then you could have filed for the same thing.    He will have to pay his own lawyer.    You will split the closing costs PLUS any equity that has built up since you bought the home...b/c you are equal owners.    If you do not refinance and give him 50% of what he owns, if you are not in a financial position to purchase the home a judge WILL order it sold.|`|ak3NBmINaa	Your ex has a legitimate need and it puts you in an untenable situation. If there were equity in the house he wouldn't be so willing to back out, so I'm guessing your house is worth less than you owe on the mortgage.    A quit-claim deed won't take his name off the mortgage. You can do that only by refinancing or selling. Or if he dies.    I suppose you do not make enough money now to qualify for a good loan.     You have several options:  Call his bluff. Let him take you to court to force the sale, and you can tell it to the judge to prevent that from happening.    Cut a deal with him--agree to sell when the market recovers, if he will back off today.    Counter his proposal with your own--have an attorney draft a letter saying the ex should cover the refi costs.    Why not start here? Go talk to a local banker or a mortgage broker. Try to get that refi done on your own, by showing your payment history, income, etc.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	The question is why don't you want it done?  If he wants off the title and off the mortgage they the house is totally yours, your paying all the bills anyway, good riddance.  You need to consult with an attorney to make sure that's the deal, he'll drop off the title if you'll take him off the note.|`|u4Zu2v0Paa	You are both responsible, it doesn't matter which one of you made the payment.  Now all you have to do is a quick claim deed and that will get him off the mortgage.  It would be yours and you wouldn't have to sell it.
fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	As a former HR professional, yes, this is a very good sign that your resume was forwarded to the owner. In most cases, the HR person screens resumes and those that make the cut move on to the person who will select people to interview.     I wold recommend to follow up within a week, and then sometime in the following week. If they are in the middle of a big project like an audit, the owner is probably stretched just to keep up with his normal workload and the audit.

KxxkOPeTaa	H -    You will need to file 3 tax returns...one federal and then one for each of the 2 states that you lived in.  But, don't worry - you will not be double (or triple) taxed.  Missouri will only tax the income that you earned while you were a resident there.  And NY will only tax the other part of the income.  Basically, you can only have one "primary" residence - so your income just gets split between the two states.    You may want to consider hiring a CPA to help you with your taxes this year - just to make sure you get them right.    For tax preparation help, you could try the site below...I found it very helpful and they are extremely fast and friendly. They are CPA's but I think they moonlight and prepare taxes so they have "day jobs"...it's not like they are doing it for the money. They're just trying to help people out. Also, their rate can't be beat...last year, I paid something like $50 and they prepared my return for me and got me the refund fast. I didn't even have to do too much work...just sent them the forms I received in the mail (W-2, etc.) and I was done!|`|AA11284831	You file part-year returns in both states, showing only the income earned while living in the respective states.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	1. All your income for the year, from both states, must be included on your federal filing.  Also, remember to claim the deduction for moving expenses, if you qualify.    2. You must file a New York Nonresident/Part-Year Resident Return.  If you file on paper, you enter the totals for the year in one column (same as federal) and the amounts for New York in another column, calculate tax on the federal amount and mutiply that tax by the ratio of the NY amount to the federal amount.  If you file electronically, the computer does the math.    3. Missouri probably has a similar procedure, but I do not know.|`|VI7phxR7aa	Hi,    I'm Evan and I work for TurboTax.  You are required to file tax returns for each state in which you earned income.

375ffaceecee2420f9e38aba060fb989aa	Investing in options is difficult right now for everyone because of the higher volatility.  That means more premium but more risk.  Some strategies such as long calenders just don't work with the VIX much above 30.  Even wide iron condors can be hit on both sides testing your stomach for risk.      Any autotrade service should have a track record available to show their success (or not).  Don't forget to take into account commission costs which probably would not be included in tose results.
FhSKRB7Kaa	You mentioned all the famous job portals. Only other sites I can think off are Dice and ladders.    However, if you upload your resume and leave it there it will be less effective as millions of people upload their resumes every day. For example, if you upload your resume on a portal at 10:00am it will show up in the search of the recruiters only for about 15 to 20 minutes as tons of other people are uploading their resumes too.    Here area few tips:     1) You should logon to these sites regularly (daily twice at least) and modify a line or 2 in your resume. That way it always comes up in the first 100  resumes or so.   2) Use some unique keywords in your resume that are suitable for your role and the recruiters might use those keywaords while searching for your resume.     Hope that helps.    Good Luck and God bless!|`|cwKNDZz9aa	Keep looking. Try temp firms.    All the other answers posted here are scams if they reference some great opportunity for easy money.

Why do you want to cancel?  In my experience if theres a problem, companies usually dont care about it, so I call a few times and if they dont fix it, I write a carefully worded complaint letter or email and that usually is enough to get someone to deal with it - I got out of my landline contract early because they c*cked it up - started off with a tiny little problem which got worse and worse because their customer services are so rubbish!|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Good luck, you will need it. 3 are notably intransigent and will tell you that the only time you can cancel is in the initial 14 day satisfaction period. Stop paying and your a/c will be passed to their debt collection agency. Any correspondence you send to 3 will disappear into a black hole.
OeLQPhaWaa	A parent would have to open a "Custodial Account" for you at a brokerage firm such as Scottrade.  Scottrade has NO account maintenance, service, or inactivity fees.  $500.00 minimum to open an account.  $7.00 online trading commission for stock over $1.00 a share.        E-Trade's standard online trading commission is $12.99.  If you do not qualify for exemption they charge you an account service fee (ASF) of $40.00 each quarter.      If you are only going to make a few stock purchases a year for long term investment then consider enrolling in the Sharebuilder "BASIC" automatic investment plan.

ve1vK7KLaa	For 2008 you are set!  If you haven't filed your return yet you can simply take the exemption.    For 2007, things are more difficult!  If no one claimed the exemption for 2007, you'd have to file an amended 2007 Tax Return.    If anyone claimed the exemption in 2007 you have a potentally more serious problem.  Let's say that the child's father claimed the exemption in 2007; he owes you for the money he took from you, when you had the court order.  How you get it from him now is a problem if he is a jerk.  If he isn't a jerk, he can just hand it over to you!    THE BIGGIE IS 2008 & FUTURE!  You have to make damn sure he doesn't try to take the excemption in 2008 and any future years.    If "daddy" is a jerk, IRS (believe it or not) will assist you!  HONEST!  CALL THEIR TOLL ASSISTANCE NUMBER, or visit their office if there is one close to you.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Yes that is a court order and the custodial parent normally is granted the tax exemption.  Go right ahead|`|AA10469473	It's possible for a court to decide that.  If the order is worded properly (legally) then the IRS will honor it.  If it has any conditions, like being current on child support, then the wording is NOT correct and the order will not be honored.|`|e3d22f9e03367e9a354d66ee52012e08aa	I'm not sure if this varies for state to state, but for Ohio, YES & here's the answer from the juvenile court.  First- we trade years, he has even, I have odd years.  Whoevers year it is to claim the child (i.e. this is my ex's year for my daughter), will be able to claim the child as a dependent.   BUT, earned income credit has nothing to do with the court. It comes to the divider rule, who had the child living with them longer during the year? So, since I've had my daughter for 12 months, I'll be receiving the earned income credit.    So, one can claim as an exemption(dependent) but the other can claim the EIC.    As far as the IRS goes, if the other person files first, they will accept it & you will have to provide proof to them showing you housed the child for the time in 2008.    I'd call the juvenile court that issued your court order to verify the laws in your state.|`|4mmTyMglaa	Yes, but IRS won't care.  If IRS awards the exemption to the incorrect party, then you have to go thru civil court to get the funds.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	The IRS has issued a recent revenue bulletin that discusses this issue.  It concludes that the state court ruling is not enough but that the custodial parent must sign  a 8332 form or equivalent to allow the non-custodial parent to claim the dependent.

The IRS regulations define permanently disabled as (a) have a disability that renders them unable to carry out substantial gainful activity and (b) expected to endure at least one year.  You might consult with her doctors to see if they judge that on this basis, your daughter is permanently disabled.    If your daughter is permanently disabled (as defined above), lived in your home for more than half the year, and is not supporting herself,then she would qualify you for earned income credit.

jzSx5kAxaa	Here is how Credit Cards payments work....if you dont want to pay interest you need to pay your outstanding balance in FULL (as shown on that month's statement).  Just to be clear that your "current" balance may be larger than what is shown on your statement and if so then it is the balance that is shown on your statement that you need to pay if full to avoid interest.<br>  <br>  Credit cards have a thing called a "grace period" ... depending on your card it can be between 22-30 days where you dont need to pay anything back and not get charged interest.  This only applies to "purchases" and not "cash advances" (cash is always charged interest immediately).  <br>  <br>  Ideally you dont want to pay small amounts each month because you then get charged the FULL interest of what your statement balance was, regardless of how much you paid...for example, if your statement says you have a balance of $2000 and you pay back $1999 1 day before it is due then the credit card company will charge you interest on the FULL $2000 despite there only being $1 balance the day it was due..the reason is because you didnt pay your full balance of $2000 so they are going to charge you for ALL of it.....greedy sonsbyatches but that is how it works.<br>  <br>  If you were charged interest in one month because you didnt pay your full balance and then you start paying your balance in full the following month then you are likely to see "residual itnerest" charge since it is interest carried over from the previous month..so it actually takes 2-months of paying your balance in full before you stop seeing interest being charged.<br>  <br>  Oh, and dont try to be eager to pay your balance in full so fast....remember you have a grace period...yuo could be using your money somewhere else like earning high-interest...For me, i never pay back my statement balance until the day before...but of course, i have automated withdrawals set up online for my credit card to auto take out the money from my bank on the day before it is due....this maximizes the amount of time i can use my money on other things...if i did an online payment to my credit card it is possible it could take up to 3-business days to get to my credit card which is not efficient....i use to do it that way....<br>  <br>  Hope these tips help.<br>  <br>  And btw, don't listen to the responder above about destroying credit cards...As long as you are responsible it is a strong benefit to have them.  If you keep up your responsibility of paying back and using you build a credit history and improve your credit score which helps for other things in life like buying a house or a car....its like a report card of how responsible you are with money for the rest of the world....the more responsible the more trustworthy you become when you attempt to get credit in other things in life.  It's important when you get older.  I'm still young but have a killa credit score!|`|InM3f9Kzaa	The best way to handle credit is to pay it off in full every month, if you pay your balance owed in full you will not be charged interest. I'm going to assume that you will be paying the full amount by th due date and you are wondering if it makes sense to pay it off bit by bit or wait till the due date. The only positive to paying it off earlier is your peace of mind. If you pay it off in full at the end there are several positives. You have more financial flexablity for an emergency, your money can earn interest for you in a checking account. But it effects your score the same either way. You can monitor your score for free as well.|`|AA10330431	Best way is to pay everything off completely and then destroy all credit cards and do not apply for any more.  Why do people pay credit card issuers for the privilege of spending their own money ?

You'll save money by paying early in the billing cycle.

kifwyOgKaa	I still think paying off all debt first is the best way to go.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Gold is a horrible investment. Sorry but all those advertisements trying to get you to buy gold are not there to help you make wise choices, they are there to make a profit for people who are selling gold. <br>  <br>  Pay off your debts first period. He is probably paying 15%-25% interest on those credit cards, there's no way he's going to make that kind of return by purchasing gold.<br>  <br>  Please don't fool yourself into thinking that gold will somehow be the only thing that retains its value if the economy crashes entirely. In New Orleans after Katrina, nobody was running around trading gold, people were looking for essential goods like gasoline, potable water, and food. If you seriously want to have something of value in case the economy collapses, then buy a tanker truck full of gasoline and park it in your back yard next to a shed full of non-perishable food and bottled water. I guarantee you if we see another grapes of wrath type depression people will flock from near and far to trade with you. Plus, when you buy gold futures you don't actually get gold, you get a certificate saying you'll get some gold at some future time. If the economy collapses before that time, then the person who owes you the gold isn't going to come through and your peice of paper will be worthless. <br>  <br>  Gold? Come on, its a horrible investment and even if it was a good investment its not worth staying in credit card debt to buy into it.|`|AA12103172	That argument might work with cheap debt, e.g. mortgages, but with the high cost of credit card borrowing you'd need such a severe movement to make it worthwhile (e.g. 15-20%), it doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're running a credit card debt (one of the most expensive forms of debt), you really shouldn't be speculating in precious metals.

Employers do not have money or time to train, so they need someone who can "hit the ground running."

It needs to be right up front.  They can't take time to develop and train and mold it -- you have to do that yourself.

However, if you owe any, you should pay them asap.  The penalties and interest that build up while you wait for the IRS to notice you can be quite large.    You can go back as far as 2004.  If you don't have your W-2's from back then, go to your local IRS office and ask them to supply you with the information.

OHlSESqwaa	The stimulus check you received should not be included in income as it is not taxable. The Rebate Recovery Worksheet in the instructions is used to reconcile what you received with the Recovery Rebate for 2008.   The stimulus check was an advance on the credit.  If you received more than the 2008 credit calculation you do not have to pay it back. On the other hand if the worksheet shows that you deserve more, the additional amount is a credit on the 2008 return. It is a win-win for the taxpayer.  If you are seeing the $300 on line 70 on the 1040, line 42 on form 1040A or line 9 on form 1040EZ, this is the additional rebate you are due this year.

The exception is if you didn't qualify last year, but qualify based on your 2008 return, you'd receive the stimulus payment added to your refund.    Unfortunately, many of the tax software designers took a short cut and calculated the stimulus into your refund for 2008 automatically, then have you subtract it back out if you got it last year.  This is causing massive confusion among people who think it's being subtracted from their refunds - it's only being subtracted if it shouldn't have been there in the first place this year since you already got it last year.|`|0uWqjL2raa	You are not being taxed.

ZeDjn4cVaa	To  get your money back from New York State, you must file a non-resident tax return with New York State.  Even though your W-2 shows New York wages, put zero in for your New York wages and attach a note to your return that you are resident of New Jersey and that all the wages were earned working on projects in MA and NJ.    File a full year resident NJ return declaring all your income and  taking a credit for the taxes you have to pay MA on your MA wages.  There are special form usually to take the credit for out of state taxes paid.    File a non-resident MA return specifying the wages you have earned in MA and calculating the amount of MA taxes due on those wages.

Since you did not live or work in NY, you file a NY non-resident return and show zero income.      You file a resident (or part-year resident) return for the State(s) where you actually resided and show all the income you made while you lived there--regardless of where you were working.  You file a non-resident return for any State where you worked but didn't live.  That includes any State where you had a temporary assignment.    If any of the same income is taxed by two States, then usually your resident State will give you a credit for the taxes you pay to the non-resident State.  I'm not sure from you description whether that applies to you or not.    In any case, you need to file three State returns, a non-resident for NY, and a part-year for MA and NJ.    Look for a worksheet called something like "resident/non-resident" or "part-year resident" worksheet.  That'll be where you break out the income among the three.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	If you are present in a state, then any income earned during this period, must be reported to the state.
