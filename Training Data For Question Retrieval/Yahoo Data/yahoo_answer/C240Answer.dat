EcTTRWDlaa	Bakuman hasn't been licensed for U.S. publication yet.    http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?...  *Read the lower right column    As you know Bakuman is a rather recent series, & it will take time for any U.S. distributor (like TokyoPop) to pick up the series (research if there's a market, produce, advertise, etc.).      If it is picked up, a U.S. distributor usually announces it during one of the large stateside Anime Conventions and then you will receive an expected release date (Examples: Anime Expo in California, & Otakon in Maryland).  So during those times (the summer), either visit those Conventions or read up on licensing news at AnimeNewsNetwork.com or Mangaupdates.com  -http://animenewsnetwork.com/  -http://www.mangaupdates.com/index.html|`|AA10159262	You can find Bakuman online at onemanga.com and at mangashare.com
f2800882edad59847e92ecbbac687f55aa	Absolutely nothing.      The halftime performers don't get paid for the actual performance.  Their costs are covered by the NFL, but nothing on top of that.  The NFL gets entertainment and added viewers from the fame of the performer and the performer benefits from the exposure.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	a bundel.
UY3zl9dFaa	I'm hoping that she'll accept his explanation that Bianca was supposed to tell him if she decided to use his sperm. Yes, he should've discussed it with her first, but I believe that he would've if Bianca had made that call. This is the part that makes the least sense- why wouldn't Bianca (who supposedly loves Kendall so much) not call and discuss it with both of them once she and Reese decided to go ahead? Anyway, I think she'll forgive Zach. Binks? Maybe not.|`|AA12336927	Well as far as Kendall saying that, if you recall, right before the tornado, Zak asked her if she would want to have another baby. He said he wanted a daughter, she turned him down saying it was too soon. SSSSSooooooo, that leads me to believe that was nothing more than a knife to his heart. Did he deserve it, you bet!     That being said, I hope Kendall takes the time to remember that Zak forgave her for sleeping with Aiden and keeping it from him. I have the feeling that they will stay together, but I don't think little sis will fair so well|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	I think that whole storyline of Zach being Gabrielle's father is absolutely ridiculous.  For what reason?  And why didn't Zach discuss this with Kendall BEFORE he donated his "swimmers", to see if she agreed with the decision?  That would have been the perfect scenerio.  But now poor Kendall has to be the bad guy because of Josh's evil little heart!  Not fair to Zendall, who are by far the most interesting and devoted couple of the soaps today!  I love those two and hope they can get past this problem.  And Reese?  Get her out of there!|`|AA12319351	They will probably stay together,as they have such history, but..... I don't think Kendall will make it easy for anyone. I don't think she trusts Reese at all, ans I don't blame her. There is just something about that girl that rubs me the wrong way. I feel sorry for Binks, because she is going to be the one who really gets hurt.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I sure hope so.  It was wrong of Zack to not tell Kendall that he was Bianca's donor or even consult her about it before agreeing to donate.  But Kendall also has to remember that he forgave her for sleeping with Aiden when Zack and Greenlee were trapped in the cave.  Two wrongs don't make a right be she should be willing to forgive and move forward.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I believe Zack and Kendall will stay together. She will be hurt for a long time and others will come to know just how hurt and upset she is. If my sister had used my husband's sperm to get pregnant without asking me first, I would be furious at both parties. I don't think I could forgive either one. I don't think Kendall will forgive Bianca.|`|AA12390047	I think they might be estranged for a while but will work to save their marriage.  THey love each other and those little boys.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i think shes gonna stay with him but shes acting really weird not like her self i think she has a secret  or she has something up her sleeve  shes definitely up to something|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I think they will stay together but I'm sure she isn't going to make it too easy on him for a long time. Wow the look she shot at him today when she seen the baby was absolutely priceless.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	It is going to be a tough road to go down but I think they have already overcome so many things, this may be the last straw.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I'm torn on this one. I think she should stay with him....But he has lots of "splainin" to do!|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	i think thwey will stay together, but their marriage will just be very fragile. but Kendalls new heart has chsanged her, and shes not the same woman anymore.
rsOqhdIRaa	benzino was the co editor of the source magazine its along story why the beef strarted but basiclly it started becuase benzino disses Eminem twice for no reason and gave him a 2 stars in the sourse for one of his albums so Eminem released 2 songs nail in the coffin and the souce then the beef continued|`|W7BZcdynaa	Do you even need a reason to hate Eminem?    Just listen to the guy speak. Or whine about how his family life sucks.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Benzino is co owner of The Source mag and loyal to Ja Rule so when the Ja beef started Ben tried to use his magazine to turn people away from Eminem.  Giving him bad reviews and such.  It didn't work obviously (Like Toy Soldiers http://artists.letssingit.com/eminem-lyr... was a result of the original beef)  Because Em is a great emcee and people recognized that.  In turn, the Source actually lost alot of credability because of this and so the story ends.  The two still hate each other and Ja's career (in my opinion) came to an end as a result of this beef as well.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	dont listen to the guy above.............. eminem is in the top 5 all time best rappers|`|Md48G2g9aa	Benzino was the co-owner of the source and said that eminem shoulden't make it big because he's white and taking money from african americans he's also a failed rapper and gave eminem bad reviews strictly because he didn't like him.|`|gtEJbhEaaa	Benzino is a rapper from Boston.

zj4HeXEvaa	Angelo was falsely accused of attacking Belle, He made a deal with that developer (Tim) to get him off. The deal has now come back to haunt him and he is desperate to nail Tim for all the dodgy goings on at the development site. Tim knows this, and there is a lot of tension between the 2 of them. Angelo goes to the site to spy on Tim and try to find out more, but thinks Tim may be laying in wait ready to kill him for knowing too much. Jack is suspicious of Angelo's activities and follows him to the site. Angelo hears noises behind him and thinks its Tim trying to kill him, he spins round and fires 2 shots which he then see's has hit and killed Jack. Angelo is upset, but knows if he hands himself in he'll be up for murder.|`|uJNVAA3saa	I didn't expect that either. I was shocked when I found out he was dead.

He used to be on tv series about a family and that was very good and I just liked to watch all his films.  Rob Lowe never did anything at all for me, sorry.|`|6EenztwDaa	ROB LOWE ALL THE WAY!!!!  i loved him in Class and also in The Outsiders   guys like him are rare cuz   he's talented   he has grogeous eyes   great smile   good personality   and he came out ok (except for the sex tape in 89 but that was like the only thing bad that he did)  and since when is he a perv??? what did he do that made or makes him a perv?? someone please tell me|`|1eetBP4Xaa	Rob Lowe for sureee.   especially in the outsiders.    p.s. how was rob lowe a perve? im only 14  so i dont know much bout him other than that  he was hott :)|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Michael J Fox all the way!

AA11159828	is it an Open Mike night or you are scheduled to play?    if it is an Open Mike night, I would play the Original song first (nobody wants to Hear "Karaoke*** Anyway)  If it is a scheduled appearance, It would depend on the crowds reactions to the bands or performers before you.|`|AA10652867	You should start with your own song in order to keep the public interested. It's something new, and people are searching mainly for those new artists with original songs. As for covers, leave it for second. Covers are more of an exhibition for people to see how skilled you may be depending on the song you have chosen.|`|8D3yOlZyaa	I think you should start with yours so you don't "bore" them with a song they have heard, then after that play the cover song, start with the one that will get more attention to yourself, to help you go far.|`|FDt7cC8haa	That is your choice.....Some people may not 'know' your original and wake away....then again, When you sing a cover, and then they walk away when you sing your original,.....it's your choice....they may not walk away at all, but...I would rather start with an original I guess...|`|vELxMTbYaa	cover first always thats how music is you pay respect to others music before you contribute. plus you gotta play the cover first and if people like what you played then they will hear your song b/c they have to get a feel for your influence|`|0vm66wlcaa	It depends on the cover. If it is pretty popular and you think the audience will immediately recognize it, play that first to get their attention. Then if they like your music they'll stick around to hear more, and that's when you whip out the origina;l composition!    If it's not a very popular cover, it doesn't really matter.    Good luck!

sHO4xhyVaa	either season 3 or 4|`|D3Fyxj0raa	my fave season is the one thats on now|`|dQZzbSXhaa	The one where the School Shooting takes place. Fabulous acting. How Lucas handled Keith's death, and then he found out who shot Keith. I never thought Chad could act like that.|`|Lhsyg79saa	season 4 is a good series  but so far my favorite is season 6, mainly because it has alot of character building, like seeing a new side to brooke (who's my favorite character) and they mix it up. like the next eppy we meet the characters who will be playing the oth people based on lucas' book  like brooke meets brooke, peyton meets peyton etc   can't wait  they also did like a black and white episode, where lucas is dreaming,  and he owns a 1950's club and its set back in them days. very good series so far, plus jamie scott, how cute is that kid!!|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	season 4 is my favorite season as well.|`|Rnkewtiuaa	Season four is my favorite as well, I hate season two.

rGmS44xOaa	to make a amv you need first clips of the anime you wish to produce a amv out of.  there are several way to go about this.  some people chose to download other people's amvs to chop into clips you can download these at sites such as   www.animemusicvideos.org   you can also download full anime episodes you can download them in several ways. if you dont have a problem with subtitles you can download them direct easily from sites such as   www.bleachexile.com  http://www.animedownloads.us/  http://www.animea.net/  http://www.downloadanimevideos.com/  personaly i prefer to use them without subtitles if possible and thus use torrents to download my episodes. a good website listing raw anime torrent is   http://www.nyaatorrents.org/    After you have these episodes for use or other form of clips. You need to pick a video editing software to use. personaly i'm using Windows Movie Maker which is completely free and comes on any window pc. If your using a mac computer theres the mac version. otherwise use which ever version you have.  The thing I find useful about WMM is that it cuts the episodes into clips for you as it uploads them into the programme. altough the effects you can add are limited.    when you get to having everything into your programme I advise you to just play about. other things to note is to make sure you mute the sound on the video clips if possible.     hope this helps a little at least   =]

n6oKAac1aa	I'm not sure but I have bad news for you.  ABC cancelled "Pushing Daisies" before November sweeps and it is reported that the remaining episodes will only be available online.  5 unaired episodes remain that probably will never be aired.
f98b6f9fd0bd4bd97b0b61ddc02e36b2aa	I have my doubts.    Consider the number of people who audition, then consider the number of auditions aired on TV.  Because of the high number of auditions, they can pick the extremely good and bad ones out from the rest of the crowd.  True, it doesn't reflect the percentage of good auditions to bad auditions to average auditions.  BUT, it raises their ratings.    While I'm sure many of these bad auditioning people know that they sing terribly, they want the TV time.  Why to do you think some people wear such crazy costumes?  However, I'm also sure many of them canNOT sing well, and this is heightened by the stress of being on national TV.      Or, perhaps they don't sing terribly... maybe they sing better than most of their friends.  Thus, their family and friends compliment them on their voice.  When this person declares that they're going to audition for American Idol, nobody wants to hurt these kids' feelings, so they give them the go-ahead and leave the feeling-hurting to the judges.  But when they get on stage, the nerves hit them.  Thus, the terrible audition.|`|Gn5L3odFaa	Honestly I think most of those suckish auditioners know they can't sing, but they just wanna be on t.v. But some of them when they come in with cow outfits on or wheaties outfits, yea I think they were set up because who in their right mind would go in there and humiliate themselves like that? Those bad people sjouldn't be allowed to audition, although I love watching them!!|`|f067a71c9ff4b9bd2cdf007ab85cf359aa	It's fixed.  Any rational person knows they sound that bad, or have family/friends to tell them how they sound...|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I think they are really bad singers .  The producers pick out some funny ones besides the good ones for the entertainment factor .  They really are bad.  I don't think they have to add actors to do it.  You see the hoards of people there wanting their 15 minutes of fame , ok two minutes.  It has gotten to the point that people just want to be on TV even if they make a fool of themselves.  Good and funny TV.|`|e3feb7f343e5fb2663e1bedf943f04a9aa	I believe they bring them through for entertainment purposes and not for signing|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I honestly believe that a lot of people are deaf to their own singing.    When I sing, I truly believe that cats have sat on thistles and are howling the street down - I can hear how bad I am.    These people can't - all auditions are filmed, but as bad as they are, they make good television.|`|4XDURiKuaa	No their not :)  They usually don't see that they can't sing but then again most people do it to get on the television|`|cjKPEHaFaa	I think at least some of them are planted just to make it more entertaining.  I'm sure a couple of them are genuinely trying, but the super crazy people are probably told to ham it up.|`|210910c4bd7c692a2773b0fe2daa0e51aa	they aren't supposed to be fixed. they say there were fewer this year being shown on tv and that viewers were dismayed.    i haven't watched the show in two years... but there may be people that know they suck, waiting in line for 8 hours and just hoped to get on tv.  I do not believe that Fox would pay anyone extra to embarrass them self when they get so many volunteers.

Thanks|`|Y1aAGPURaa	Here's a few more "Little Johnny" funnies to enjoy:      At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs.    Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and asked, "Johnny what's the matter?"    Little Johnny responded, "I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife."    --------------------------------------...    The math teacher saw that little Johnny wasn't paying attention in class.    She called on him and said, "Johnny!  What are 2 and 4 and 28 and 44?"    Little Johnny quickly replied, "NBC, CBS, HBO and the Cartoon Network!"    --------------------------------------...    A new teacher was trying to make use of her psychology courses. She started her class by saying, "Everyone who thinks you're stupid, stand up!"    After a few seconds, Little Johnny stood up.    The teacher said, "Do you think you're stupid, Little Johnny?    "No, ma'am, but I hate to see you standing there all by yourself!"|`|CFJzBMwkaa	funny|`|ESQzBFOraa	very good

A Scotsman walked in to his house and threw down a bagpipe  The octopus circled the pipes for half-an-hour and the Scotsman said  "I think i`ve got him there". The Welshman said "No way"  "He`s making his mind up either to play it or sh*g it."|`|YZxc3SnSaa	ok ,you only just got away with that.
ZIMmGqEAaa	Spawn would need to get his head chopped off by a weapon of heaven. He has super strength and durability comparable to that of Spider-man with the symbiote. Also, he has magical powers, regeneration, and a body that is just as adaptable to combat as the symbiote(to some degrees more because the symbiote(Venom one) can't turn itself into weapons only Carnage could).    For these reasons, my vote is Spawn.|`|UGrZGjZnaa	hehehe   ??lol your putting agaisnt 2 of my fav charactres*not fair at all* XD if i had to pick i would choose Spidey cuz he is my fav hero hehehe he will never give up to bring justice??    have a good day XD|`|wMh38OzVaa	spawn was a trained killer and had the powers of hell at his command.It's no competition.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	Spider-man.

fda0393a42e4718c216098ccd1d90b21aa	I thought it was just one episode that they where doing that on|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I am sure it is to try and boost ratings for Private Practice, it has not been doing well this time around.|`|sHO4xhyVaa	I didn't know they were!! They really shouldn't do that!! :(|`|bda465ikaa	Usually a spin-off gets lower ratings than the original series. Sometimes the spin-off ends up with higher ratings after several years on the show.  -----------  It makes sense, since the spin-off is based on characters that are less developed in the original show.  -----------  Ratings usually go much higher when you introduce a characters from the original series on the spin-offs.|`|Wwmi47TLaa	I think there's two reasons why:    1. "Private Practice" has probably lost viewers and the producers think that "Grey's Anatomy" viewers will start watching it (or re-start watching it, if they used to).    2. "Grey's Anatomy" viewers miss the character of Addison and the producers know it. Combining the shows for an episode give the "Grey's Anatomy" viewers who don't watch "Private Practice" a chance to see what's been going on in Addison's life.|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	It's jsut a crossover for this one episode.  Soap Operas have been doing crossovers for years.  It's a lot less common in prime time, but it does happen.  (see: Buffy/Angel, Star Trek Universe for examples).|`|588a783cfb4ea0dc3c1773206e77dbceaa	I think it just for this one episode, good marketing for Private Practice though. Clever idea!
Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey Prez    Get the SG because with a Gibson Les Paul they are a little overrated  and a lot Overpriced.

AA10262086	If you take the neck off there should be a month and a year stamped on the end of it. It could be a 2003 or 2004 but just by seeing the serial number most players will call it a 2003. As far as an asking price goes it depends on the condition of the guitar. If it's in like new condition with no flaws of any kind you can expect to get about 65 to 75% of the original retail price. It can only go lower from there. I love strats , play mine everyday , but the fact is they are a dime a dozen. Everybody and their brother has a strat nowadays. So before they would pay you big money for yours they will just go buy a new one.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Fender says "there is always some carryover from one year to the next".

Jesus, His Mother Mary, and His disciples were quests at a wedding. The wine supply ran out, and through the urging of His Mother, Jesus had six water pots filled to the brim with water. He then had the master of ceremonies taste the water that was now wine. The master of ceremonies then called the bridegroom over and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the quests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now".        2 Healing of the royal officials son  (See John 4:46-54)  A royal official who had a sick son in Capernaum, came to Cana when he heard Jesus was there, and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was at the point of death. After a brief conversation, Jesus told the man "Go your son will live". The man believed Jesus and started on his way. On his way to Capernaum he was met by his servants who told him his child was alive. So he asked the hour when he began to recover, and they said to him, "Yesterday at 1:00 in the afternoon the fever left him". The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him "Your son will live".        3 Healing of the possessed man in Capernaum  (See Mark 1:21-28; Luke 4:33-37)  As Jesus was preaching in a synagogue in Capernaum, a man possessed by a demon was present and began shouting "Why are You bothering us, Jesus of Nazareth - have You come to destroy us demons? I know who You are - the Holy Son of God!" Jesus commanded the demon to say no more and to come out of the man. The evil spirit screamed and convulsed the man violently and left him. The news of this miracle spread quickly through the entire area of Galilee.        4 Healing of Peter's mother-in-law  (See Matthew 8:14-15; Mark 1:29-31; Luke 4:38-39)  After Jesus healed the possessed man in the synagogue in Capernaum, He and His disciples went over to Simon and Andrews home, where they found Simons mother-in-law sick in bed with a high fever. Jesus took her by the hand and helped her sit up, the fever suddenly left, and she got up and prepared dinner for them.        5 Catching a large number of fish  (See Luke 5:3-10)  Stepping in Simons boat, Jesus asked Simon to push out a little into the water, so that He could sit in the boat and speak to the crowd on shore. When He finished speaking He told Simon to go out in the deeper water and let down his nets. Simon replied "we worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing. But if You say so, we will try again". And this time the nets were so full, they began to tear. A shout for help brought in another boat and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking. It was during this miracle Jesus told Simon "Do not be afraid, from now on you will be fishing for the souls of men.        6 Healing a leper  (See Matthew 8:1-3; Mark 1:40-42)  After preaching the "Sermon on the Mount" (Matt 5-7), Jesus came down the hillside followed by a large crowd. A leper approached Him, knelt before Him worshiping, and pleaded, "if You want to, You can heal me". Jesus touched the man, and said to him "I want to, be healed". And instantly the leper was healed.        7 Healing a centurion's servant  (See Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10)  In Capernaum, a Centurion came to Jesus asking to have his servant, who was close to death, healed. When Jesus said He would come and cure the servant, the Centurion answered that he was not worthy to have Jesus come under his roof, but to only speak the word, and his servant will be healed. Jesus was amazed at this and told His followers, that not even in Israel had He found such faith. Jesus then told the Centurion "Go, let it be done for you according to your faith". And the servant was healed in that hour.        8 Healing a paralytic  (See Matthew 9:1-8; Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:18-26)  There was a large crowd around the house Jesus was staying, in Capernaum. With no room left in or outside the house, four men dug through the roof and lowered a paralyzed man on a mat, right in front of Jesus. When Jesus saw how strongly they believed that He would help, Jesus said to the sick man "Son your sins are forgiven!" Some of the Jewish leaders thought this was blasphemy, for only God can forgive sins. Jesus let them know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, and said to the paralytic "I say to you stand up, take your mat and go home". The man stood up took the mat and went out before all of them, so that they were all amazed and Glorified god, saying, "We have never seen anything like this".        9 Healing a withered hand  (See Matthew 12:9-14; Mark 3:1-6)  In a synagogue Jesus|`|kR6hptDvaa	HOW DARE YOU !.............................

4Zj9eYgPaa	If you're into shoujo anime, yes. But if you're a shonen anime kind of person, no.   I mean, the plot is kinda interesting but it's too shoujo. Each time the main character appears he has that kind of pink back ground with sparkling things, etc. When there is a fight, you can barely make anything out because they are zooming on the face of the guys. Meh.  If you like romance and fluff, then it's a must see, if not forget it.|`|O2hmjOPyaa	It all depends on whether or not you enjoy romantic anime. If not, then I'd suggest you search for another, but if you do, then this is definitely a must-see! The plot itself is fairly fast-paced and interesting, but the romance is an integral part of it, so you would need to enjoy the romance in order to love this anime the way it was meant to be.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	If you like fantasy and romance then you'll like it.    In my opinion it's a great anime.  Hope I helped some. :)

TuLOVv5taa	The song "Fat Lip" has been stated by lead vocalist Deryck Whibley as: "The verses are really about what we do: growing up in the suburbs, going to parties and hanging out with our friends, and causing trouble. A lot of people say they relate to it" The song also gets it title from the slang term of a swollen lip after getting punched in the face.    The song "Motivation" has been stated as "The song is about being self-centered, demotivated and lazy, too lazy to look for motivation to do anything"

AA10077992	http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/vid...    You can often get spoilers on this link. I have also read that Jack comes back in 3 months time . One idea was that he would appear in Martha's dreams, another that he is not dead ,just on witness protection ( they did that before though) -something to do with the chemical site

Eddie is fast, but that is it. He is mediocre as a player once you get past his trade mark speed licks. There are many players that can do what he does out there. There is no such thing as the "best". Especially not Van Halen.
bdb965e3f355169aff1feae8ee90d4b6aa	In the career department, they are better working by themselves than for someone else. Their sympathy equips them for careers in charity, catering to the needy, as a nurse, looking after the sick, or as a veterinarian, caring for animals.     They have a love of water, and can be found in work that keeps them near the sea. Pisces creativity includes a natural ability to imitate or mirror another person as well as enter into their feelings. These attributes make them wonderful character actors, and many Pisceans find great fulfillment on stage or in films.    Pisces sense of others, is an ability that makes them effective in civil service and the legal arena. Many in law enforcement and the judicial system are Pisceans. Their intuitive and spiritual qualities can lead them into careers in religion or to service as mediums and mystics. Still others are creative cooks and chefs. Because of their versatility and plasticity, they often follow several vocations during their lifetime|`|fd13d41ae49947f652119d420e3990d9aa	my dad's a pisces.   He loves fishing and is very good at it.   He is a doctor as well. :)|`|Yhw6KwEFaa	Pisces are awesome fisherman, artists, writers, lawyer, doctors...etc. Well pretty much anything except for singers. I hope that helped =)|`|dibBENqWaa	caring for the needy as in the fields of medicine or veterinary medicine ? anything related to the sea  ? acting  ? psychics or mystics ? religion  ? cooking  ?|`|jTkzSyzbaa	well im a pisces and when it comes to fishing i always doze off :/ .. i found it boring..

It is not illegal to post links for movies, its only illegal to host videos on the site itself. Watch-movies.net has been up for a long time. I doubt highly that the government (the only logical party to remove a site) would delete the site without warning. The site is very large and occasionally takes a few days for renovations. It happens every few months. Don't worry. It'll be back up in a few days.|`|MuKz67Zsaa	I can't get on it either it just gives me a hairbrained message like this;    Address Not Found     Firefox can't find the server at www.watch-movies.net.

cuIX13BKaa	Actually I am a Virgo though do not care for most of them as they are the fussy cleany OCD types.....I am laughing....I am soooo atypical....though I LOVE  Taurus, Cap, Scorp...the list goes on...even though I could do without Aries...that is my Moon so wouldn't it figure? My Son an bf are Taurus my dauthgterin law is the day after me...they just had a wee Capricorn ~ I am soooooooo use to airy fairy signs...but then hey I get along with just about anyone who is not cruel. I have 3 in Libra, 3 in Leo, 3 in Cancer, one lone Gemini in the 12th ~ I am covered hon. Most Virgos are nitpicking nosy totally judgemental..and I say live and let live.....or at least leave this Virgo alone if you are on a Virgo witch hunt....for I stand alone. I still think they lied about when i was born...lol~!!!    Garbo|`|cVVvHNXSaa	Ok I'm a Capricorn and I love all my fellow earth signs (Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn) because everyone don't understand us. That's why all other signs usually thinks negatively about us. Boring, stubborn, nit-picking - oh how misunderstood we are, no wonder earth signs get along best with earth signs. We understand each other best.|`|D0XQrK31aa	Sometimes, in another Capricorn. Maybe because their bad qualities might be a reflection of my own, or maybe sometimes they just seem to be overrated. Again, depends how much influence their sun signs have on them.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	Love Virgo's because my best friend is one and he is just hilarious!  Taurus, I've had a very bad experience, so I'm kinda sketchy when it comes to them.  And Capricorns are just easy to get along with, they're interesting and cool.    ?|`|plBXp91Daa	Bad experience with Virgo's my mom & a friend of mine but that doesn't mean i hate them.The strange thing is that i met another girl and she's a Virgo i don't know her so long and i know her trough a website but she seems cool to me.    Taurus with some of them i can get along like my Aunt she is cool and sweet but i can't get along very well with my Sister in law she is a Taurus too.    Capricorn in my point of vieuw they are cool people, i had a class fellow and she was a Capricorn, my Aunt is a Capricorn so is my Uncle and he is funny oh and ofcourse Ashley she is very sweet too, they are less colder then Virgo's.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	capricorns are nosy sometimes    virgo? never met one? i think that's my "match"    taurus? my sister...annoying|`|VYlCgujxaa	I dont really care what time of year they were born..|`|jMGyLvNsaa	Virgos are amazing! lol|`|Pew3CdCjaa	gee what is this mean? poor earth sign...    virgo - sometimes I felt like they are very dumb since they work all the times but I guess they are ok... but I can see why they can not be leader sign though.. Usually virgo likes/loves capricorn alot. I don't know why? in cap point of view    Taurus - hmm.. I think they are funny and nice... usually I found first that taurus likes cap as well.    capricorn - since I am capricorn, I usually get a long with cap well...     so I guess I like them all  then...|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	I love everybody, because that's what you're supposed to do.  My son is a Taurus, he's awesome...my husband is a Virgo, also awesome...|`|IJwlglqaaa	tauruses- can be backstabbers. they talk about you behind your back.  and   capricorns- love being busy. they can be cold.|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Capricorns are kinda ...........weird....       Virgos are nice..picky sometimes overall good.      Taurus, they are too promiscuous...back stabbers..|`|farhj0Kiaa	i AM A CAPRICORN AND I AM COMPATIBLE WITH VIRGOS AND TAURUSES! i LOVE THEM ALL. WE ARE HARD WORKERS AND WE GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. WE DON'T CANDY COAT ANYTHING!|`|2e0ctu64aa	I love Tauruses! But love Capricorns more!|`|0ne87Q96aa	capricorns, virgos, tauruses, r all earth signs they r hard workers and practical, they can be stubborn and cold!........etc.|`|vd1YIMbaaa	a lot of tauruses are crazy, virgos are high strung, and capricorns are cold|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	I like them cause they're cool but sometimes they can be so boring. Sorry|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	LOL, I can ususally find the good in most everybody..I'm a Capricorn myself...I usually go out with Taurus or Scorpio men..not on purpose, just happens that way..think it's cause I like their 'wild' side if you know what I mean ;-) ...My friends tend to be a mix though..most of the signs are covered. I just take people for what they are and go from there...it seems to work well.    edit:    (we Caps can be annoying though, I know this ,lol...and we are weird ,too..at least I'm weird)|`|rVPT2tx1aa	I am a taurus. Funny thing is, I hate them. They get on my nerves. Ha ha.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	Hate. All of them  Because they are all very, just annoying and stupid. picky, hard working, and thriving on privacy are just not what i am about!|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am a scorpio female so I love Taurus, my dearest friend is a virgo.  My brother in law is a capricorn he's an arrogant ***.|`|qnBVKBJIaa	There are some Tauruses and Capricorns that I don't like, the reason is, they all lied to me.|`|p177cS5Jaa	I don't hate them, but I know not to trust them.   They're earth signs, so they are lazy, stubborn, materialistic, and "as cold as ice" when your problems is not in regards to them.  In the same respect, they have a good sense of humor, can give you a nice conversation, and, if you really tight with them (and IF they like you), they will have your back when a bad situation happens.  So if you want to love one of these signs, you'll have to accept the fact that they're not going to change for anyone because they are set in their ways.|`|AA11176856	VIRGOS ARE AWESOME, CAPRICORNS ANNOYING, N TAURUS NEVER CAME ACROSS|`|g2jCrkcPaa	Capricorns I absolutely love, they are ambitious and serious but not to serious. I usually date Capricorns, it may be because my Venus is in Capricorn.     I have never met a Taurus, and if I have I didn't know they were one.    Virgos are meh to me, I have never gotten along with any Virgo except for my mum and my sister. In my opinion Virgos are usually very closed minded which I do not like.

nErAWfHxaa	If you ask questions, you have to wait for four (4) hours after asking the question in order to choose the "best answer." That's to give folks a fair chance to log in and find your question. Many of us log on and off periodically during the day and we may not be online when you posted.    Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."

Click on the word questions and you'll see the list of your questions, click the question and it shows you not only the question but all the answers. There will be a blue box under each answer. Click the box of the answer you liked best. You will get 3 points for choosing.    Be sure you pick the "best answer" before the time for answering expires or it'll be too late, it'll go into voting.     IF YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION, to vote on unresolved questions click the "answer" toolbar at the top of the page then click on the "vote" tab and it'll show you a bunch of questions in voting.|`|MJDjaNtDaa	You can go to the question and pick "Choose As Best Answer" or you can let voters vote for it.|`|pvtq3kjLaa	from my experience that after a few days that the post has been up you can go to yoour profile , then go to your"asked qustions" then click on the question that you wanted to give a best answer too and it should be lit up in yellow asking if you'r ready top give a best answer.... if so proceed click it and give you'r best answer out! and i will be waiting for minez! hahah :)|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	u have to click on your avatar and down a little wats u will see in the middle of the page a couple of tabs click the one that says "my questions" then click on the question u want to pick best answer for and under each answer there is a button that says "choose this answer as best answer"(u have to wait a few hours though) just click the button rate the answer and leave a comment if u want|`|NsayGX3Aaa	As soon as you post a question...many people will answer it.

1bkiNiwzaa	thank you, thank you, thank you!!  My thoughts exactly, everyone says women are complicated, but for the life of me I cant figure out these guys! I mean, What's up with them you never know!!    But to answer your question, Scorpiomen are quite complicated.  Pisces men seem to be complicated but they are not.  The least complicated are Aries men, the closest I got to figuring out.|`|KkOzs2Czaa	I'm not THAT complicated........    "D    Girls are more confusing. "(   trust me.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	YEAS!|`|naySyzfQaa	I think men are complicated period.|`|2e0ctu64aa	yep! but it's easier to understand them if you hang around them! so its pretty easy for me to read guys!|`|fIEmi84Laa	They're complicated to us and we're complicated to them.    But yes, I know exactly how you feel.|`|qg11igznaa	Scorpio's and Cancer's. Both put up communication walls that make it difficult to get near them.|`|EAApPFvKaa	Yup! They are :)|`|t1BUav9aaa	Yeah, men in general are complicated. One day you think you have them figured out but in the end you don't know anything about them.|`|hubjvJAjaa	yes i think they are|`|6Au5FIYWaa	No, I think every individual has their own level of 'complicatedness', and what one person thinks is complicated about someone else might seem as clear as day to another person.|`|DOZxFiijaa	no they are not. they just want 1 thing : they want what they can not have. so, welcome to the GAME =)
grwtwPbAaa	Should I or Shouldn't I...  Jump out of the frying pan?  and into the fire?  ________________________________________...    My humble attempt at a poem!     Oh no, oh no,   what should I do?   these flames of life  oh so blue!      My seas of trouble  those slings and arrows  Do I want a solution  or a resolution?  I grunt  I groan  of this weary life  what do I want   a passive death or the  of confrontations of life?     Justice will you prevail?  or do I take up arms  Should I do  or not do?  Be human with my guarantees  Or choose death that maybe  place of flaming fumes  what would that place really be  a wilderness  with no homeward path!  Does death oh death  have fires of hell?       this pain of life  my desire  Vengeance oh Claudius  what shall it reap?   Where will I go  if I dive so deep?      Interestingly Shakespeare asks some pretty good questions hey Jimi?    Hamlet is speaking of himself here tho' he never uses the word "I"  as he debates his situation  as he ponders the question of ' To be or not t to be"  he looks deeply within himself!  He doesn't wallow in self pity ...he sees his situation here clearly and carefully views the characters of his life thoroughly through the eyes of understanding!   Love how he questions with wonder and contemplates what true nobleness is...in essence he asks himself why he is putting up with all the crap of life...does he fight off this crap?  The seas of it ~ which Fortune dishes out!  Does death hold a good release...is suicide the answer...Oh the Dread of Death, so undiscovered. Is he a coward to comptemplate it..he wonders!  Is there noblenesss in it...or will he pay?   Should death be feared...Does he repay Cladius with death! The pangs of despised love...Poor Hamlet  wow...does he remain is passive submission and hope that justice will prevail or should he confront the injustices...should he even choose...a course of action at all.   To be human or not to be human?  Should death be feared or not?  Is his future guaranteed  or not?    Such meloncholy...as he debates his life!     To be or not to be...speaks of awareness to me...awareness of desires, dreams, journeys' we all have in this passage of life.  He brings to us flooded images of our lives, our passions, our unconguered wastelands, he takes us to undiscovered countries  and questions life...and it's seas of trouble, slings and arrows...Shows us how we can be prisoners of our own conscience!  He desires death  but his desires are covered over with the pale cast of thought!  The hue of resoltion is His prisoner....for he doesn't know what to do...To be or not to be...great question...Jimi...    These pains of life so do speak...but let us too rationalize and wrestle with these timeless thoughts...for me my answer is to be more than not to be at all!      Good one Jimi....God bless ya :)|`|6fcbe940619104ed5872fbb65fb03d34aa	not to be that is the answer|`|DxohE884aa	Ah, be. Why not? I mean, he already wrote a whole speech about it... If I had such spare time...|`|47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	not to be- you might wanna add some context clues; for example: not to be a drug addict.|`|nG6aRGGLaa	to be,but of course....|`|70dnKLz0aa	**** son, this is a hard one...|`|88uIjItaaa	24|`|XB5UCW0Raa	To be!|`|Kbgc6x5raa	not to be.|`|7Qu4SjuHaa	yes.|`|xJezFnRMaa	that is the question [:|`|xgWf3SKxaa	i dont get it|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	THAT is the question...     x]    Shakespeare's nothing special...

I'm very partial to German Metal right now so I highly recommend Heaven Shall Burn, Caliban, and Incubus Dreams. You would probably like Giving Chase a lot, look them up on myspace.

Optimus Prime, because he doesn't get disqualified when you punch him in the face too hard.      I'm calling a draw on this one.      Krillin couldn't win a fight to save his life.  His dying is supposed to by Goku's motivation to get his head out of his *** and take things seriously, remember?      Alfred Pennyworth, because he has Batman on his side.      Captain Planet.  He's got more than four elements, and despite his green mullet, is significantly less annoying.      Vash.  Boba Fett's only upside is armor, and Vash can take bullets like they're nothing anyway...provided you can even hit him.      This one's tough.  I'll side with the Elric here.  Sorry Gourry...      Victoria's got Harkonnen.  It is far more victorious than any sword, and that is final.      Neither of them win, I hate them both.  Picollo because he's pesky, and Orochimaru because I hate everything to do with Naruto (bite me HARDER, Narutards).      Inoue, see reason above.      L dies, HA!      Lucy could take the Winchesters apart.  She was so incredible that she frankly had to kill herself, or nobody ever would've stopped her.      I don't know either of these, sorry.  No call.      Yoruichi.  Even if she lost the IQ test, she could break Robin's pencilneck before you could say Jack Daniels.      Vikings.  Vikings are pirates on crack, and everyone knows that ninjas only exist because pirates let them.      Neither of them win, because Ken Masters' crouching mid-kick cancels into EVERYTHING.

MWYVwNwcaa	I've heard a bunch of different rumors on who might be on....    Donny Osmond  Lawrence Taylor  Kevin Federline  Sarah Silverman    They always seem to have a certain formula of people like the Disney star, comedian, football player, Olympian, soap opera star and a reality star. I would really hate to see Kevin Federline on because to me he isn't a star he is just divorced to one. If I had my choice I would throw in Ellen Degeneres. I know that she would be a crack up to watch!|`|Leda2ha0aa	I'm not sure how Stevie would do it because he does not seem to have any rhythm.  I have heard Florence Henderson and Donny Osmond - he was going to make an announcement and then stopped himself.  We will know in a few weeks as they will tell it on Good Morning America.|`|w6czQwhBaa	Dr. Phil! or maybe Faye Dunaway
mbY2rtd0aa	I just finished a BRILLIANT anime.  Its was called Pretear, personally I prefer shorter animes and this only had 13 episodes so I loved that. Good plot twists and some of the characters were really funny. Its more of the romance side of what you were after but still has some moments of comedy, especially at the beginning.|`|M8qLP7MLaa	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - (Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi)  Azumanga Daioh - (Comedy)  Ranma 1/2 - (Martial Arts, Romance, Comedy)  Pani Poni Dash - (Comedy)  Nanaka 6/17 - (Comedy, Romance, Drama)    Those are all pretty good animes. Ranma 1/2 is made by the same person who created InuYasha (Rumiko Takahashi or something), so considering that and the fact that you wanted a comedy/romance you might like it. I also recommend Azumanga Daioh, Haruhi, and Pani Poni Dash for the comedy, though there isn't much romance (more in Haruhi and Nanaka 6/16 then any of them).    You can probably find the first episodes of them on YouTube.|`|4033b6b06a2fd56f0435794d8dcec6e0aa	Hajime No Ippo or Death Note.|`|wO2WY54kaa	NANA  Chobits  Spirited Away  Chokotto Sister  Aishteruize Baby  Fushigi Yuugi  Honey X Honey Drops  Full Moon Wo sagashite  Gift Eternal Rainbow|`|SQZhlArkaa	ooh ok here we go again, i answered about a few of the same questions XD (all of these are drawn awesomely.... well that's what i think =P)    ~Soul Eater = right now i'm watching that, and it's comedy action-ish, but it can be romantic, depends on how you look at it =]  ~Ojamajo Doremi = there's 4 seasons, Ojamajo Doremi Carnival, Ojamajo Doremi Sharp, Ojamajo Doremi Motto, Ojamajo Doremi Dokkan! and 13 extra episodes called Ojamajo Doremi Naisho!   ~Princess Tutu = really cute =] and romantic too, it's about 30 something episodes  ~Uta Kata = 12 episodes, but very cute =]  ~Nanatsuiro Drops = this has a definite romance genre, about 12 episodes, and it's sad at the end... but then it turns happy again =] and this is kinda like a magical girl anime thing... but very cute  ~Kamichama Karin = very cute and hints of romance and it's pretty funny =] 26 episodes, and there is a sequel, but they still haven't made it into an anime yet T-T it's still in the manga books T-T  ~Fushigi Boshi no Futago Hime = or futago hime for short, 51 episodes, and it's sequel, futago hime gyu, which is 52 episodes long   but very cute =]    that's all i can think of for know.... so enjoy =]|`|lOR8QDBpaa	ELFEN LIED  Its the best anime you' ll ever see|`|QUpzCltZaa	One Piece :  http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1002.html     Hunter X Hunter:  http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1306.html      Ranma 1/2:  http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/4887.html|`|hvJAIwZ2aa	you can try this series called death note.its really good altho the heads are a little wierd but its really good.|`|2Jjz7N2iaa	Some of my favorite at the moment are    Elfen Lied -13 ep (Romance, Psychological, Horror, Drama, Action)  http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_L...

ou6fRri6aa	the song does not fall into the chritistan music spectrum.  however, the song does have chrisitan relgious refrences.   those refrences don't change the point of the song,   which is to support the need for LOVE among everyone.|`|cxXDXUY0aa	iw as thinking the same thing|`|9mRhdTbBaa	Seeing as Fergie's a whore, probably not. But I guess Christians can be whores, too.|`|HAVqiBxzaa	Why does it even matter? It is a great song about some very bad and actual problems and issues in the world. And all you care about is if it belongs to a particular dogma?    Just look beyond what you or the group members belive in. What does it mean to you? Does it say something to you? Then the song and it's meaning become yours, and it doesn't matter whether it was written with that particular idea in mind. The message is what counts.   Sorry if a sounded a bit, well angry before. =P|`|I24AuawZaa	It sounds like a Christian questioning their faith.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	My humps is christian too|`|ldI8DRu7aa	um not really cuz they didnt really say God. they said father...but i guess thats the same in some way...    i don tthink it was meant to be a christian song you know what i mean?|`|zRzb1scdaa	yeah i think so|`|etrLu8Xnaa	well that song is about the world and the government and so practice what u preach could mean like practice what u intend to do like monkey see monkey do kinda|`|CCCWGJCHaa	sounds like you have your answer.|`|TpJbtJCfaa	They were sang by black people, what do you expect?|`|UspK4SQBaa	It was sung by Christians, but it's not a "Christian Song".  Fergie is Catholic.    EDIT:    "And if Christians could be w***** then they wouldn't be Christians."    Not true, but that comment about Fergie being a whore was just the ramblings of a jealous person.  Ignore it.|`|77s3XuOpaa	You answered your own question =]    This song is about helping other desperate people (is it?)Christians help other Christians from falling from God to the devil, right?|`|CuwgNBlyaa	hmm. maybe. but they re also talking about war and peace. sounds religous.|`|bG1YxiwOaa	I just think its basically telling people to pray for peace in our world. The title simply says where is the love? So I guess you can say its christian but no just for christians for everyone to realize what the world is coming to.|`|7yyntdbPaa	The song does remind me of a christian song   I listen to it all the time but.......  the band is not a christian band and I really don't  think they ment it to be a christian song.

Why r u asking a question like that????!" It sickens me, because in questions like those in health section, these immature girls always say ew and never actually help.|`|bEqBVsbsaa	I don't know.

3kNeWYvdaa	I feel very comfortable singing in groups so maybe you can have friends sing with you (especially if they can hit high notes too!) when you sing and attempt to hit high notes with them once you do it often maybe you can try to sing high notes in front of more people little by little and slowly you can get over your shyness.|`|8478b8de7e84637d2b4117c1696b3343aa	You cannot get rid your shyness it's something you will have to deal with .  Get a vocal coach to study with that help you with problems when hitting high notes .  Also study music theory and piano to help your singing .  You are going have to study for several years to get a professional edge to know what to do in those situations .|`|quM6eMT6aa	i have the same problem and i juss concentrate on the note and  pretend nobody is around me it works
08UIuxmSaa	I'm not sure but I really want them to be together. You never know what will happen. I'm looking forward to that hug I saw on the previews. But I noticed that Ricky had this look, like he was trying to get Ben jealous. What I think will happen is that they will just be friends and they will keep the baby. If this happened to me, I would keep the baby. Anyways I can't wait til Monday.|`|KkFnSouWaa	I think she said "I do love him" and also assuming it's Ricky.  Amy seems pretty set on adopting because I don't think she even wants the baby anymore, but Ricky still does (even though he went along with the adoption).  I would hope that they could raise him together, but as friends because Ben deserves her more than Ricky|`|b6OEaFx3aa	omg yess! i want them to be together.  i love Ricky and Amy !  but im not sure because when she said"i do love him"  what if  she meant the baby?    cant wait till next Monday !!!!|`|Q9MBZZMcaa	i think they will get back together.  i think this becouse they both still have feelings for each other and it would add a new twist:]|`|FtPFFd1Vaa	i think they'll get together and raise the baby. Ben's been really annoying these past couple of episodes.|`|ytmov0Ooaa	I think Ricky is a straight up player-but hey he's hot. LOL   I think he is going to cause confusion. Grace and adrian are probually gonna fight over ricky since he has them both wrapped around his finger. As for amy- maybe she truely has feelings for him too, but what about ben!? This is crazy. Can't wait till next episode!  :)|`|41479d464ed912b4157bcb71a2bae530aa	yeah i hope the get together because i dont like amy and ben

5e66f381627bd428c703e558425a21ceaa	Making beats is its own skill really.     You can download frooty loops and record your beats on there. And you can use your computer, you may need to buy a mic.     If you have a mac they have a program called garage band that you can produce beats on.     My advice is try to make your own beats, but also practice on instrumentals of songs that are already out. They have structure (hooks chorus verses bridge) and can give you some starting point when you go to make your own beats. Its hard to make good beats.     You can also see if you know friends or relatives who can play instruments for you. Live instruments bring a real soulful sound.     Rapping and producing are different skills.      Being a good rapper is all about confidence and being yourself. So dont be scared to reveal your truths.     Dont just sing about money cars and girls if you arent getting any of those things. And dont just use potty language. Be yourself and draw on your life experiences.     Definately start a myspace page. You can look on craigslist for people who have already produced beats, if they like your flows they will probably let you use the beats. Be careful.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Fruity Loops has a free downloadable version.  I think you can record on the computer w/ a microphone, you can record everything else.    You'll need to create a tape of your work and have it burned onto CDs.  You can't avoid this cost because producers don't troll MySpace looking for real talent (kinda kid stuff, you know?), though that might work for local gigs.    Best of luck to you.  Other people have made it big and so should you.|`|k39bNUgeaa	There is no such thing as a good rapper  and that's the last thing we need in this world|`|MRijAWJRaa	clear out your mind, and maybe it will just come to you. as for your computer i have no clue|`|Kq2km6KUaa	WE HAVE ENOUGH RAPPERS FOR GODS SAKE!!!!

Well, in appearance...o_o, they do not look similar at all, for obvious reasons.     Personality...I suppose they have some things in common - they both have strong feelings, like blood, are remorseful/regretful and I suppose they are both lonely and secluded.    Otherwise, there is not much the same so I guess there isn't really anything in particular that I like about favorite characters.

Physically I look most like Haruhi from Ouran High School host club and L from death note. My hair is black and cut really short, I have light dark circles under my eyes and I don't pay attention to what I'm wearing.     Physically I don't look like many anime characters, but I share many personality characteristics from my favorite anime charcters. I'm anti-social and cold to people who don't know me that well, but under neath that I'm really upbeat and lively like Haruhi Suzumiya from "the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya". I'm also have some of Konata's (Lucky Star) characteristics. I'm addicted to anime, video games and manga as well ^^. And I'm a bit like L because I always pay attention to every detail and put my thumb against my lips when I'm trying to think.     Hope this helps! :D ?

SHeLdu8haa	I think it's the parents who were being selfish for sending in their babies to cook for themselves. I don't know of any 8-9 year old who can cook....Usually we wouldn't allow them near a cooker in-case they burn themselves.   Some of the children were not even tall enough to reach the kitchen tap properly, let alone dealing with pans of hot stuff on a cooker they could just about see the top of.  The older children were just nasty and didn't have any home training in loving and sharing.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Hence my 20 questions about this! LOL    If that was my kids acting like selfish little b@stards I'd be furious, but then I wouldn't put my kids on a TV show for 3wks!    Plus if in a moment of madness I did let my kids go on a show like that, I'd have made bloody sure they knew how to cook basic food, use a washing machine etc.......|`|oil8ALh4aa	What show are yall talking about  it sounds really interesting  someone email me and tell me about lol|`|9NrmdSdkaa	i thought it was a horrible programe  but good to watch    if my child was there they wouldnt be staying long !!|`|YLFLbbx7aa	I found this programme quite disturbing. I have an 8 year old son, and would never put him through anything like that.    Although saying that, my son does make me cups of tea and coffee, but under my supervision.|`|QASqKvSNaa	I felt uncomfortable watching it if I am honest.    The kids were starving hungry, getting hurt and bullied by other children and sobbing their little hearts out.    I just cannot understand why you would put your kids on a TV show like this- they are obviously doing it for the money! The show just highlights the bad parenting- swearing, bullying, violence, ect.    The older girls are sooo horrible, I mean, they should cook for the younger ones. To be fair at 8 years old you don't know how to cook, use the washing machine and run a house, do you???     Personally I just don't see any benefits of making at TV show like this. The parents should be soo ashamed to have put their kids through this. How can they just sit back and watch their kids sobbing their eyes out??? I couldn't do it.|`|6113592ee4cd8092af2e3a43a226cb9daa	I'm assuming you are talking about Kid Nation.  What you have to realize is that there were dozens of adults just out of frame at all times, so no one was in any real danger (more so than usual).  Still, kids can be jerks, and everyone new that going in.  If parents or kids weren't willing to take it, they could back out at any time.|`|AA10077992	It's left me feeling very uneasy - poor kiddies - their mums should have thought about kettles etc before they let them enter|`|WUEJdKNmaa	the older girls were obnoxious but the boys were just out of their depth and yes it must have been so hard for the parents to watch this but they are trying to learn their kids to interact with each other and fend for themselves so it may be a good lesson so long as they don't let the kids get too distressed (boys mainly) . The girls are totally different as they are vying for power against each other and the older ones are taking over the young ones but so long as the parents are watching out for the young ones and so are the production team and phychologists they wont come to much harm so don't believe everything you see as it is edited for effect.|`|pvxWr5nQaa	Yes, at some parts of the show where some of the older kids were being really nasty. Like for example, drawing on the walls and then telling the younger kids that they were doing it as a joke. Then the parents of the children saying that they didn't want their child coming across in a certain way.    I was quite surprised when the boys were more needy of their parents than the girls though.    I didn't really like seeing when some of the children were being really selfish. When they were making the pizza one said something on the lines of "the makers of the food gets to eat the food" and the one boy just walking away crying. Made me just want to jump into the frame and tell them all how to 'play nice'.    Made me giggle though when the girls were trying to open a paint can with a tin opener.    Cannot wait for the next episode.|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	To be honest, the show should have just involved eleven- and twelve-year-olds as those younger kids were just too young to be expected to fend for themselves. At least with kids aged eleven and twelve, they are still very much children but they are also at high school and have some idea of how to cope independently.    I'm in two minds about the show. On one hand, I don't know if I could watch my child crying their wee eyes out (I can't even handle my dog crying for his food!). But, on the other hand, this was an important social experiment about children and the differences between boys and girls, and they needed children to conduct it. I found it far easier to watch compared with the other C4 show about large families where we saw this hideous, supposedly blind couple expecting their two pre-adolescent daughters to do all the housework and care for their four younger brothers while they loafed around doing nothing.

6Au5FIYWaa	He's probably trying to be a bit aloof in person to appear more alluring... Libras are good at turning on the charm that they think will work on their target.     My guess is that he likes you to some vague romantic degree and wants your attention. Whether he likes you more than his current girlfriend, or whether he likes you as more than just some girl to flirt around with and feel all fuzzy inside about, only you can figure out at this point.    Just remember, though... even if he is just wanting to be friends, he's sort of stepping over the line with his girlfriend with all the things he has said to you. This is a baaad sign... if he does it to her, he'll do it to you too. If you're as cynical as you say you are you'll know that to be too damn true.|`|fd13d41ae49947f652119d420e3990d9aa	wow..long lil story there. lol  Um...i have been dating a Libra man for almost 4 years now....it has its ups and downs.   I am a Cancer sun sign...so kind of comparable to your sign. If I am right you are a Scorpio? It seems as if the water and air signs do not blend well together. I have come to find this. However, I love him very dearly and it is worth it for me to hold on to him.  You know when you find that special fish out there in the sea, you don't want to let it go. What if you never catch another like it? Then what?!?!  Do what your heart tells you to do.  Good luck :)|`|uel6NBOVaa	Hey Scorpion,    I would keep my guard up. In this kind of situation, you are the deciding factor in how things play out. Some people have a tendency to flirt, and Libra has a big reputation for it. This could be the way he chooses to express himself, or it could be the fact that he is trying to get some special attention from you. The question is, how do you feel about this guy? Are you interested in him? Or are you simply trying to understand him as someone you could potentially grow closer to? I think the best thing right now is to not let yourself get attached. Hold a safe distance between yourself and this boy. If you are curious enough, you can talk to him and get to know him, see what his intentions are, but don't allow yourself to fall for him...especially if he has a girlfriend. That is not a mess that you want to be involved in.     Then again, look at it this way....You said that you found out about his girlfriend through another source? Not from him directly? Maybe there is more going on than you are aware of. You haven't talked to him since November, right? So there's no telling what's going on. The only way to get correct information is to hear it from the source itself, so don't judge the situation without getting all the answers.     I think the best thing to do is keep a friendly attitude with him, but don't flirt. Act as if there is nothing more out of your relationship than pure platonic friendship. He seems like the kind of person who would not openly admit his feelings if he did have them, so just convince yourself that he is not in it to win you over or anything. If he tries anything funny, then be firm and get away from him. Hey, if things work out, you may get a very close friend out of it. You never know until you live the situation first hand.

s78ti410aa	Oh Mickey by Toni Basil|`|9LzlIgoJaa	Mickey- Toni Basil
oN1Hcp1baa	i agree that every person should be against this, however if everyone was then we wouldnt have rapists and sexual abusers running around would we? I am personally against it because it violates another human being, it takes all that is good about a person and negates it. I am sure many people have heard about women being tortured during civil wars or revolutions...For example, one woman I read about in History Class was raped with a broken wine bottle. How horrible is that? But the person who did it probably had a different opinion because he/she thought that this woman was a threat. So some people believe that these types of crimes are ok depending on the person and the situation. I however do not agree and I think crimes of this type are immoral and cruel.|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	OF COURSE I AM! ISN'T EVERYONE?!?!?!    All of these violate personal rights. they can cause emotional, physical, or mental damage to the victims. There are no good excuses or reasons for these actions. No one in their right mind (a good person) would harm another human being in such a horrible way.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	who wouldn't be?|`|lFqm9XlUaa	Yes, totally. It makes no since. Why to do it.|`|69YQw3Kwaa	ya|`|XgCIW0XAaa	lol, of course!!    i would hope everyone is..    um because it's rude & wrong.|`|mMBPOjbFaa	the only people i that would be FOR it are the people who do it|`|AA11765949	The only people who would say no to this question are the abusers themselves|`|Zcj3qt2Daa	UMM YES?|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Where country are you from some backwards **** hole?

Of course not. -_-|`|4AfZ9Zywaa	because one person derives pleasure from the suffering of another    that's why it's wrong|`|hvNuBjIEaa	YES  YES   YES  YES    Why?  Who in his right mind would favor such heinous crimes???|`|KFwXBXv7aa	yes because it is manipulating the other person.|`|NVPR8usJaa	Yes, yes, yes, and yes because none of them are nice! It's basic kindergarten "keep your hands to yourself" law.|`|nG6aRGGLaa	yes of course I am against all that! I hate all that! It is so awful and disgusting that is what makes the world **** to live in! *gasps*|`|mNZCMuSpaa	I think everyone is..    why?  Because it's so incredibly disrespectful and hurtful to abuse someone.  I don't care who they are, how old they are, or what they've done to you.  No one deserves to be treated like that.    People who do those things are sick.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	yes totaly.  man can be so =bad to man. i mean like look at al lweve done, wars kicked the indains out of thier homes, the hollacost, and everything else we have done. its horrible|`|VFEZFanIaa	Nope.

Who isn't?  (well besides rapers, child abusers, etc)|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Yes. There are better ways to feel in control of oneself.  Ways that don't hurt anyone else or ruin their lives. ^^^^Those other bad ways are disgusting, wrong, mean, cruel.|`|fWjT3lleaa	yeah, it is very wrong,   anyone could tell you that!|`|ZntkO9ffaa	Of course not.|`|5urfAbazaa	Yes, because it does physical and emotional harm to the victim, and they would be traumatized.|`|Lyq4TlDfaa	YES IM AGAINST IT :O  how are you not its terrible and scars people forever :( :( :(|`|sX3paKxBaa	Who isn't!|`|vaczcH2waa	obv im against it.. its just plain wrong|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	Yes! that stuff is horrible!!|`|LpedVLedaa	Why would you even ask why?  Because it hurts people....????|`|ZxmxjBE8aa	Who wouldn't be against it other than the people who do it?     WHY: Ummm because its wrong and horrible and no one deserves that.|`|0sw9nrcpaa	YES fool, no seriously child abuse is mingin, sos sexual abse, rape same, domestic violence is not good either     so i am against this totally and want harsher sentences for these crimes here in the uk|`|AQwoCjj3aa	Check out these songs:     Polly BY: Nirvana   Rape me By: Nirvana    this is how i feel!|`|TsFG4zLmaa	i have children, if anyone touched my kids i would kill them.    you don't need to ask why|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	No I'm a 100% supporter of people being hurt for no fuckin' reason!    OF COURSE I OPPOSE IT!   DOESN'T EVERYBODY WHO ISN'T WACK IN THE HEAD!?!?!?  Geez obvious question much?!?!|`|Jf0s6pByaa	Yes I am against it because it is a horrible thing that consist of pain and hurt.|`|xJezFnRMaa	who isn't?  d: ew|`|PpWosZsIaa	Yes, It's a Crime|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	isnt everyone?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I don't know any sane person that ISN'T against those things and the reasons are quite obvious.|`|vkIkFgqiaa	Yes who isn't!|`|WB028eTDaa	Um, yeah. Obviously.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	yes. its wrong and it can turn a person's life 180 degrees around to the worst|`|qmwRcAvGaa	Nooo of course not.|`|fC5X8swbaa	Yeah, just about everyone except for child abusers, sexual abusers, and rapers are against it.|`|YogATwEoaa	I don't think you'll find anyone that Isn't, Lady.|`|UnQCBfc8aa	YES I AM AGAINST IT! WHY EVEN ASK THIS QUESTION?|`|AlrjXEgnaa	yea who would ever like that?  movies with that in it creep me out|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	No I'm all for it.|`|elVDYy7eaa	Yeah well. You'd be a bit weird if you supported those things, and even weirder if you admitted it.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Yes, because people have the right not to be physically or sexually abused. Any sane person is against these things.|`|MHoTbF2laa	I think it's gross|`|8YfCC9Oqaa	hell yeah, just this past week i was saying how i wish i could turn into superwoman just so i can fly around town and kill all the sick people who commit all those crimes... seriously.|`|kZBKbMSUaa	It is wrong in every sense of the word.  IF someone ever did any of those things to someone near me i SWEAR I torture them to death.  If u dont think its wrong seek therapy|`|yIdwMPsoaa	YES I am totally against that. Pisses me off so much!  Because it's just not human, it's sadistic and cruel.  It's just ARG. And very very stupid and whatever. Absolutely pointless, hurting innocent people like that. I find it very inhuman to hurt children's or to abuse people. Seriously, I hope the people who do that die in hell.|`|OQS5dY0baa	no man i love child abuse! (sarcasm just so you know.. [for the dim-witted])  are you crazy! of course everyone hates it! why would you ask this question?|`|mggll8dRaa	Of Course...!!|`|P7bNXrlOaa	of course! It's disgusting, wrong, and no one should EVER touch a person in ways they don't want to be.. much less beat someone you're supposed to "love" wtf kind of question is that?|`|czHD5tPwaa	Yes I am. Sam I am. Would you like some green eggs and ham?|`|m6GJMPtJaa	umm..do you REALLY need to ask this?|`|q0Dg8a1haa	NO. It puts hair on your chest. Americans need to toughen up.|`|PJRqTBwbaa	Yep.|`|rAfg747daa	Against it cause it is wrong and people get mentally and physically hurt. Everyone is living and breathing and to hurt someone else is wrong. Wrong because would you want to be hurt like that? Why some people don't think of that stumps me.|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Of course....who WOULDN'T be against someone preying on those who are innocent and can't fight back against their attackers....It's all about control and power and arrogance....but those who would even THINK of doing such things to ANY human being are insecure and tot-ally pathetic themselves, but that is NO EXCUSE for what they do!!!!    I just read one answer that is true that the only people who are NOT against all abusive behaviors are the ones who do it,  but also liberal judges and/or juries who actually let the person  off or they get a "nothing" sentence and their victims continue to live in terror and trauma....and if a plea bargain is made to let them get probation or a light sentence, that is revictimizing  those who have already been totally traumatized by violence...    ANY and ALL kind of abuse against others is totally intolerable to anyone who has any sense of empathy and moral standards of right and wrong....but liberals are more concerned about the "rights" of the perpetraters than for the victims!!!  >:(|`|71nFkYvbaa	I am because I know that the person doing those things probly wouldnt even want to be in the victims position unless thats how you would want to be treated. And I think whoever do that is dumb because they know the cosequences before they even do it so I see no reason to do it if you know its gonna jump on your shoulders      And just the thought of older people doing who-knows-what with kids is disgust|`|W3gpfzj2aa	Well, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say aren't we all against it? The only people who aren't are the weirdos out there who do this! But yes I am 100% against it! I think it is wrong and the sickos out there should think about just who they are and take a good look at their sick selves. But yes, it is tragic that some people have to go through this, and I truly feel sorry for those people! I'm against it because those people don't deserve it! The people who it happens to probably think it's their fault. But it's not. (I watch a lot of Law and Order Special victims unit...) ;D|`|SiAY9zuoaa	First reason to be against these crimes are they are against the law. Second they are hideous things to do against someones body and mind. They will not only hurt the one it happens to, but also all that are surrounding them. Also it changes there lives and others.    The only punishment the person that does this is the DEATH PENALTY. No keeping in prison for life.|`|ecO5LGCvaa	I most certainly am against all of the above.     Child abuse: Childhood innocence can be ruined so easily. Give kids a chance to enjoy like before they find out how harsh life can be on it's own.     Sexual abuse: Why? Why can't people understand the meaning of 'no'    Domestic violence is in excusable. My parents have been married over 30 yrs, and I'll never forget the times he threatened or tried to kill her, only for her to convince herself she was the one who did wrong.     Rape: See sexual abuse.  I was verbally and emotionally abused and I will never ever forget, it caused problems for me with intimacy.    good luck,    Sarah

Nooo i'm just kidding, I don't watch Naruto XD    hmm this is a hard one. It's a tie between Roy Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist and Tohru from Fruits Basket|`|4qVWj3UHaa	i would have to say ikaku from bleach.|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Houstonfob2. :)  My favorite anime character would have to be Gin Ichimaru from the anime and manga Bleach.     Here's some information about him for you.    Gin's most distinguishing characteristic is his expression; with his slitted eyes and ever-present grin, his face looks like that of a fox. Ichigo derisively nicknames him "fox-face" in their first meeting because of this (in the English dub, he instead replies with a more generalized insult). He also has unusual silver hair, which has a purple tint to it in the anime; his name refers to his hair color, gin ("silver"). Gin rarely removes his smile or opens his eyes; in the case of the latter, such moments serve to identify when he is significantly annoyed or angry. There are only a few times when he opens his eyes: once in a flashback when he and Aizen rescued Momo Hinamori and other students from hollows, and the other during a battle with 10th Division Captain Tshir Hitsugaya. His eyes are alternately portrayed as light green/blue, blood red, and yellow. By contrast, there are far more moments when he stops smiling, those usually being lesser degrees of annoyance, genuinely apologetic moments, or in deep thought of a sudden epiphany.    You have a nice main character too!     Later.
tfHYhh0yaa	Sure. Here's what I have for today (2/4)    Early Morning Contest - Eagles tickets  Hazel - Casey and Kate  Vicki's 10:30 - Katie Couric  Vicki's Country Cafe - Shaina Twain  Vicki's 1:30 - Taylor Swift|`|8nGgjTgJaa	I wish I could help.

I babysit my grandaughter and have to listen when she is sleeping or not here...she wants to play on my computer too! I will try...when I can! Thanks.
vqg6wpCLaa	I think you mean 'hokage'? Well, we do not know. The manga and anime are yet to be finished but he probably will end up becoming hokage at some point in his life. Unless he is killed of course.|`|NwT0FTGiaa	yes. in three he will develop an attack called, demon rasengan, ultimate storm. its a comb of three elements he will use it against orochimaru and win, avenging sasuke. tsunade, will realize his potential and he will be the future hokage. also he will meat his gid father who willt ell him how to use his demon transfermation of the nine tails. he will aslo tell him the greatest shocker in the series, the identity of his father.|`|kNGMVXBLaa	Yes, if Pein hasn't killed Naruto, which is almost impossible because he is the main character.    He will bcoe hokage because Kakashi said '' You are t he only one who can surpass the 4th hokage, Yodaim, his father (not really)|`|64Lgwm2faa	The answer to that is yet to be found out. That question is very common among many people. But you just have to wait and find out. But most likely, thats the way it will be. because his father is the fouth hokage, minato, and he is the only one who can surpass him and he already had with fuuton:rasen-shuriken technique. because the fourth nevr got to add nature manipulation to rasnegan due to his early death.
efwvtzitaa	'cause the bomb had to be manually activated and the one who goes will die.  so harry sacrificed himself for his daughter's sake.|`|7LJ2Tx2Yaa	Yep, someone had to manually trigger the bomb.

EB991uRiaa	Yes, it's $11, $8.50 for kids, Seniors and Military, and $5.50 for matinees.    (I use to live in Memphis which has a Regal Munford Square 16, same thing)|`|272b4b9f1dbb02370331a991e15d7432aa	No, but a few relatives of mine does.|`|AA12270666	i don't live in columbus ohio.    i'm guessing that's a movie tehatre that you want to go to?    I know that at Costco ( idk if they have costscos in ohio?)  they sell regal tickets that you can buy in a pack of like 5 or smething and they are 7 dollars each.    Here in Cali, regal it's about 10 dollars for a ticket, so it'd probably be around ten dollars.

Just get a guy with coke-bottle glasses to hang out with you and maybe someone will get it, haha.

If you like her, ignore what your friends say. Don't let others control you.|`|PCE7ri7daa	You shouldn't be asking Y!A if we think the girl that wants to date you is attractive; if you want to date with her, then date her; your friends don't control your life, and who cares if she think is attractive or not, as long as you do; it doesn't matter what other people think(:|`|UnQCBfc8aa	I didn't check out the picture, but dude, don't follow what all your friends are saying. If you like her then go for it! It takes courage to ask someone out. PLUS - you need to look at her personality and not just her outside. She could be really pretty and be dead evil. So don't just go for looks, go for personality too.|`|eoCTlfBfaa	What do her looks have to do with anything??  :\|`|b8R5bPrhaa	I hope you had her consent to post this on the internet.|`|Iv6Oa9Y2aa	did you even ask permissoin from her?!|`|AnIgXRcJaa	I cannot believe that girl's these days will judge hanging out with another girl because of her looks. Wow.|`|De8z6qH4aa	Chill out everyone, it's probably his/her own Myspace and he/she is postin it up to get added and more views.  That's what happens when you give a computer to people with no lives.|`|EgeLl0ayaa	??|`|Ua7kJ6Tzaa	You just want to date her cause she's hot?

Get involved in other activities and meet new people.

UGHHHHHHHHH CAN YOU EVER STOP TALKING OH MY GOSH!!!!|`|7ljzPBjyaa	well did you do something that is gossip worthy? like pooping on the walls? stop pooping on the walls.|`|nO2vflnPaa	Consider it a compliment to be the center of attention and their conversations :) They're envious, and jealous and obviously have nothing else to do in their life but talk about you so I say to you, Thank Them, then apologize because they can never be you or be like you.|`|0hQ2IXIVaa	If they talk about you in a bad way, and you don't deserve it then tell them you'll kick their *** if they don't stop talking sh*t. If they are talking about you in a bad way and you do deserve it than deal with it. If they are talking about you in a good way than bask in the glow of being well liked.|`|7YNW0FZ3aa	Well you must be interesting then. If it's annoying just respond to what they are saying. Either you will get interested or they will get annoyed and stop talking.|`|IP2suWFTaa	You can start by ignoring them,because the more you let them see that it bothers you the more they are going to talk.|`|onAEy5jTaa	Have you heard the saying, "Keep talking about me. You only make me famous!" They're jealous and what have you got to loose? You're becoming famous! Can't wait to see you in Hollywood, lol!|`|SpsixqUUaa	it's obvious that they're jealous of you. they might be jealous because they think that you're full of confidence, pretty, popular, smart, athletic etc. and they're not. just let it slide. hang out w/ your other peers and everything will eventually stop. if it doesn't, you can just tell them that you really don't appreciate you taking about them and ask them to stop. if they still don't stop, you can get some sort of authority involved. teacher, yard manager, etc.|`|AA12221104	Their probably just jealous of you. Just ignore them. When they see that it doesn't bother you they will eventually get bored with themselves and leave you alone.|`|wNlkFXabaa	let people talk...it is a good thing...as long as they talk... good things or bad things,it means you are going forward....get to worry when nobody talks about you,that means you are not doing nothing...in this world there are 3 kinds of people: those that make things happen...those that see things happening...and those that talk about what happened...you must be the one that make things happen...|`|JYVuP6C5aa	and if they're talking about you that means two things, one, you're worth their time, and two, they aren't happy with who they are so they have to talk crap about others to make themselves happy.|`|eqWftUQeaa	Just remember this girly, your haterz are your biggest fans! You've heard all the sayings, "Don't hate me cuz you ain't me" and "Attention all haterz, I realized you have one advantage over me, you can kiss my @ss and I can't" lol that one is my favorite. When people talk about u, it just means they are jealous so take it as a compliment!|`|2FGjYGxFaa	i think the best thing to do is ignore them|`|7scxfyABaa	it means they don't like you    get over it|`|hKVh1EIcaa	carry on with your life|`|EUCfasVsaa	you r going to learn how to ignore people even if its hard ok. it happens to every1 dont worry!

Gv606uKbaa	i have the same problem.  i know this sounds totally crazy but try to just sing as much as possible in public places. just sing under your breath or something in a crowded room. no one will hear you and you ll become more accustomed to singing in front of people. also what i do is try to turn my nervousness into adrenaline for performing. that sort of helps also :P|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Usually voice lessons help you give confidence.  Almost everyone should know that.    Do private lessons and when you feel more comfortable go into a group voice lessons...    Usually in 6 weeks you should be able to sing in front of people...  I did it and you can too|`|V3Esd1TJaa	pictuer everyone in their underware!!! lol jk you schould really not think obout them being ther just think abou the loud applause you are going to get at the end of your perfomance!!!|`|3u4HU7rdaa	picture everyone as YOU> the underwear one just makes you laugh like crazy. not much better improvement.

zVrQILmlaa	Well, I've study dreams before and sometimes I find that we just have strange dreams in general!   Death in a dream isn't always a bad thing, It can mean the starting of something new or the ending of something bad. By writing that it could be that you want your voice to be heard or to let people know what your feeling. To be more outspoken. Trying to get into something that your to young means that you might feel oppressed or that your ready for new things to happen but your stuck waiting on your age to catch up with you.  I'm not sure but maybe the big picture is that you want to be part of things and you want to be known but your still young and you have to wait for things to happen that cause you to feel frustrated.   This is just what I got, it might not be any of this.|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Maybe it means you care a lot about the environment...|`|fd13d41ae49947f652119d420e3990d9aa	I have a lot of weird dreams too.  However, the dead deer in conjunction with your rated R movies and not having an I.D. could symbolize that you fear not being independent.   A great site that I always use is www.dreammoods.com   Here is a link to deer:  http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/dreamdictio...     Hope it helps :)|`|AM6HQvMdaa	are a vegetarian if so than maybe that is why

So the mood would be like, as if your watching someone go through the events of what happens when your addicted to drugs, and the consequences of such actions.|`|fESZI0X2aa	this song  is about the lead singer of the band,Isaac, mentoring this teen who is a drug/alcohol addict.the verses are from isaac's point of view while the chorus is from the teens.like where did i go wrong i lost a friend?somewhere along in the bitterness.it means that the kid lost friends and a lot of other stuff while he was addicted to the stuff|`|fWFRI4Vtaa	http://www.lyricinterpretations.com/look...    visit this website... it has a bunch of peoples opinions/ interpretations on the song!!

MgZtQh6faa	Look up 'How to Read Guitar Tab' on Google search. Plenty should come up. The lines with numbers on it is called tablature. The lines stand for each string just like when you you read notes(which are the dots and stuff I believe you're describing) and the numbers stand for which fret you put your fingers on.|`|rgHnAPhAaa	The six lines you see are the strings and the numbers correspond the fret. The first line on top is the high E string, the second is the B string, the third is the G string, the fourth is the D string, the fifth line is the A string and the line at the bottom is the low E string.|`|NEd2wsK3aa	the numbers are for the fret number

fcQrjl6Gaa	i wasn't born yet but my uncle showed me "Slade Alive!!!" and it just totally blew mw away....|`|JThgHiaoaa	My Dad (51) has a few albums and likes their stuff|`|iy3NISVGaa	Not so much of the OLD!!!  I love Slade, but must say I say them live at an oldies concert here in Germany (without Noddy) and they were really not good. I was so disappointed. But unfortunately most of the line up were rubbish! (Susie Quattro, Desmond Decker and Peter Starstedt - he was booed off the stage - were the worst.)|`|jhYUvRaDaa	I can remember being 16 and hearing 'LOCK UP YOUR DAUGHTERS' at around 300watts at our youth club- that era of Slade truly did show you what noddy was really made for- they did some belters but should have gone on to do loads more and maybe even verging on metal.    I think one of the band may have been called a pervert at the time which is probably why they disappeared- I remember it because there was an accusation about Jimmy saville touching up one of the girls at our school at the same time- funny how he disappeared too- he used to visit Garibaldi Comprehensive regularly and all of a sudden he stopped visiting- not like a man with an innocent conscience in my opinion - but we'll never know will we- the rich are beyond being chastised by the poor.|`|AA10569146	I love slade.

sALPielpaa	Here's an article as to why watch-movies.net isn't available...  http://www.flixplore.com/2009/02/watch-m...|`|VFEZFanIaa	That happens to me too! I don't know what's going on! I NEED MOVIES NOW! :(|`|pkDuhKQ3aa	i was wondering the same thing. if they took it down though for illegal stuff...then all the movie sites that put up new movies would be down too. plus there was a disclaimer on watchmovies that said they didnt show the movies themselves, just that they linked them. another movie site is movietvonline.com.|`|7alY6iuHaa	This has also happened to me. i believe if the website isn't down, its been discovered and removed from the internet for illegal activities.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	The probably got shut down...I don't think ti was legal!    Try some legal sites: Hulu.com, Fancast|`|525m5qrTaa	I think its gone forever...  But you know, while it was illegal - we were the soldiers that truly promoted the movies to our friends and family... NOW the movie industry is going to HOPE that we will bite on TV commercials (yeah right), $20 bucks for a couple for a night out (in this economy)???

5625d5ca0093d8b50bde1a27bf60a8b0aa	You should download rockin the suburbs first. That's the best album in my opinion. Then Songs for Silverman. And make sure you listen to Army off of The unauthorized biography of Reinhold Messner, because there's no doubt he'll play that one, but he probably won't play anything else off that album so I would just get that song.   Have fun at the concert. Ben Folds is AMAZING live. If it's standing, make sure you that facing the stage, you go to the left so you can see his hands running down the keys.

mDdv2tmaaa	yes, and no. if the song is something like techno, it could make the person feel happy and kind of hyper-ish. but if the song is something loud like Slipknot or OTEP, it may also cause some one to act hyper. i guess it depends on the person. some people may act differently. some listen 2 a sad song and it makes them sad, while others dont change, they just listen 2 it and go.

When my second daughter was 16, early in the morning before everyone got up she coated the door knobs in the house with cooking oil.  Slippery to open.    She once put a raw egg in the toe area of her younger brother's shoe.  He got up in the morning, dressed for school, then I heard a loud . . ."Claire.!!!!"    She was mad at me one morning so she snuck out to my car and pre-set all the radio stations to a certain style of music that I find annoying.  While driving her to school she got good laugh.    My eldest daughter knows her sister doesn't like bananas.  She snuck in her room one night and from long sting suspended a bruised, ripe smelling banana peel so that it would be just inches above her sister's face when she woke up in the morning.    After all went to sleep for the night, plastic wrap was pulled taunt across rim of toilet.  When opened to pee...it was very messy.  Not sure which of my kids did that.     Pesty and annoying at the time, some messy to clean up . . .but after all cleaned up...we all saw the humor in it.  Hard to get mad at a good and harmless joke.  .|`|FLUcZ9uPaa	Switch someone's shampoo with hair dye (their least favourite colour.)

8XT1Tvcvaa	Unfortunately a lot of people agree with you. I think this is a ridiculously ignorant argument though. I just don't see the reasoning of what makes someone hip hop and someone else rap.    Just because certain artists make terrible music DOESN'T make them an entirely different genre. Hip Hop music and rap music mean the same thing to me. I understand the frustration of how hip hop is perceived by the masses because of the mainstream artists, but like it or not it's still hip hop.|`|8p8Hy3YBaa	I cant stand either kind of music, only metal.

W4xJGKk2aa	Gossip girl has aired like 17 episodes of its 25 episode order for the season. since most of the episodes have aired, they probably are trying to space out the episodes to last through May. plus GG's rating have been hitting season lows lately and   One Tree Hill has been beating them, so maybe that has something to do with it also.

bw91oaksaa	Oh, Hells NO!    That's part of what made Cap who he is. You can't just start changing his whole history around just to appeal to a bunch of kids who don't know shite and who just want to watch another live action super hero movie.    That's one of the reasons why the Punisher movies sucked so much c0ck and balls. Updating a character by completely changing who s/he is is a disservice to the true fans that made that character so popular and famous in the first place.    Other examples:  - Why turn Dr. Doom into Magneto for those stupid and god Awful Fantastic Four movies?  - Juggernaut is NOT a mutant, so why is he in X3?  - Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Ice Man and Jean were the 5 original X-Men. So why are some older adults while others are teenagers?  - Rogue did NOT get her white streak by absorbing Magneto's powers. It's a birthmark.  - Constantine is a blond British guy. So why did they have to cast surfer Keanu Reeves? And WHY did they have to make it all about Christianity when Constantine has NOTHING to do with one religion over others.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	you know how they say you cant change classics. well cap. america is a classic

HbQnq0Yeaa	Some banks try to make a distinction between savings accounts and checking accounts (also known as demand deposits).   So, with a savings account they may limit the number of withdrawals you can make in a month.    With a checking account, you can take out money as often as you like, so long as there is money in the account.   But there often is a per-check  fee if you write checks.   A student account generally has a low monthly fee and some small number of checks per month that are free.  My Momma told me "You better shop around".    Sometimes the best deal for students is from a bank located on or near campus.  They might even throw a low-credit-limit credit card into the deal so you can start building up your credit rating by showing that you can be responsible with the card. (do be responsible with the card or the finance charges will kill you).     Absent a special deal from some bank specifically catering to the area's students, my experience is that the best deals are to be found at TD Bank (formerly Commerce Bank) if they are in your area.   I haven't dealt with Washington Mutual lately, but they used to be pretty good too (but they have had some financial woes of late).    My least favorite bank is Citibank as they seem to have never met a fee that they didn't like (but they too have had some financial woes of late).    The deals offered by banks change often.   They sometimes have promotions that may or may not apply to you.  Ask at the bank what they can do for you.   Start with the banks that have ATM's that are most convenient to where you live, work and study.    If a bank offers a package that is too hard to understand, then my inclination would be to keep looking for something simpler.  At this time, it's safe to expect that the interest they'll pay for the privilege of holding your money is going to be mighty trivial.  No harm in asking about the interest rates. but 1%/year on $500 isn't going to make much difference in your life.|`|1YHih8wyaa	i had boa about 2 years ago and i could only withdraw from my account a few times a month and transfer a few times a month or else i would get charged 3 dollars. so i closed that sav and opened a checking. i was getting a couple of cents for a 5 thousand i had in there. it wasnt worth it. so now i have a checking and i use it as my sav and i dont worry about transfering or withdrawing if i need to. sometimes when i run low on cash for the bills i have no other choice and i need to transfer. i dont know what their policy is on transfers and withdrawls is but i just want to make sure you know that each time that you withdraw/transfer passed those times they allow you you get charged 3 dollars each time. one time i occured 24 in fees for this. i was mad :o(|`|DPmU5gB6aa	It depends on the banks savings different policies . There are different deposit programs, some of which offer high interest rates, but they have limitations on the withdrawals per month or per year(or on the minimal amount of money you have to save). You should do a research first and then choose the program which is suitable for your needs. and yes, many banks have some special offers for students.    Good luck:)

6Au5FIYWaa	I kinda think he would be a capricorn too. He's aloof, sets his mind on work a lot, can be quite cold, quietly depressive, etc. I think this would also make sense when you take into account the sort of quiet understanding he and Buffy have of eachother and respect they have for eachother's mystery/space/work.    I haven't seen that show in years.... Angel was surprisingly a really awesome show.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Angel would probably have a T Square involving Taurus Sun (sensuality and stubbornness), Scorpio Moon/ Mars (all that depth and brooding),  and Leo Saturn (father issues by aspects).  Scorpio Asc because of all his intensity.  First house Moon because he is often ruled by his emotions conjunct Mars because he finds it difficult to separate sex from emotion.  There is either a Virgo/Pisces or 6th house/ 12th house polarity in his chart.  He likes to play martyr and hero.      I think Buffy would be an Aquarius with Capricorn placements.  Her Sun would be the missing leg of his T Square.  There would likely be Pluto to Mars (lots of pain) aspects in their synastry along with Neptune to Venus (delusion and idolization).      That's all I have right now.

SgKsHxD5aa	uhm duh.. she thinks that you value beer more than her..|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Wow because you seem to care more about a beer than her?  Who cares if the beer gets hot, your girlfriend is more important than beer I think.|`|KpZBscNnaa	She was just ready to go.  Perhaps something was making her uncomfortable.|`|yYjk33Ftaa	It's just beer...you can put it in the fridge......it's not the end of the world..always keep the girl happy or your love will end -.-|`|AkPkrTf1aa	She sounds really desperate.|`|Iv6Oa9Y2aa	who do you like more    beer Or your girlfriend|`|whfa5Wxyaa	She shouldn't be so bossy, you had a right to drink your beer in peace and relax, you had all the time in the world to get ready, heck, you should have thrown a party, gotten a  keg, then then gone with her, yeah, right on. Are you going to make her late for your wedding while you have a beer and Juniors birth wait till your ready. Obey the female of the pack she's always right. Especially when it comes to timing.|`|7fs7VYTmaa	She thinks you value a drink over her, which is bad. Tell her that you didn't want it to be warm so that you could pay attention to her and get her girts when you were sober or something like that.    Woman will be more nicer if you tell them you love them and explain your reasoning.|`|FSyaAnuKaa	I don't know. I would've finished my beer too.|`|sYXJ5Nj2aa	I don't understand either. She could have waited 5 minutes. She's not your mom you don't have to listen to her.|`|h5y9bcHLaa	she probably just really wanted sex right then and when you delayed it she was upset. just apologize and try to be ready for her. and you could always put the beer in the fridge|`|d945dd18c2ccb3f0bf1f4c170ff4619faa	It's that time of the month.    - Women.

f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	They don't have the right to, but they always do. She's not even big, the only thing that had a right to criticize was that horrible outfit she had on. It didn't fit properly and wasn't right for her shape, so it made her look bigger than she is.|`|933e4a28cf2ed1dee09acc2b64ac1674aa	no   they don't have the right the criticize anyone   it's stupid and mean   not everyone likes to look aneroxic   lol :]|`|GCl84SPLaa	It is none of the media's business, but the media are a bunch of whores anyhow and will create a story out of anything no matter who they hurt.    I think she is just beautiful and I emailed her and told her so through her website.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Well they do but they have no reason to.  She was hot as hell back then and she still is.  Women with curves are really sexy.|`|8SEVTKz5aa	no, bcus even if she did gain weight, shes still in pretty good shape compare to the rest pf america  so if they make fun of jessica, what will all the ppl that weight more than her gonna feel?|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	she finally looks like a real woman, instead of a popsicle stick. They should be happy to report about a healthy celebrity in stead of shredding her up in the media|`|pdzfq7ojaa	Actually, they do have the right.  Freedom of the press.  It's in the first amendment of the constitution.  She put herself in the public eye, so the media can talk about her all they want.    Is it nice?  No.  But do they have the right to do it anyway?  Yes.|`|bx63jJVnaa	It isn't right in my opinion, but these people are in the spotlight it's going to happen regardless.  People did it to Tyra, Britney, it'll happen if you're a movie star and you're gaining weight.|`|AA10368887	The media will keep doing anything to generate headlines so long as people like you are interested in that type of "news."|`|2XDwa4iHaa	they don't have the "right" neither do other people..  but that's what the media does..if you're a celebrity you should be ready to be criticized..  i think she still looks gorgeous|`|977dfce09b341a8f080ed1e8be1aef27aa	i don't think they have the right because there are many people that are skinny once and all the sudden gain weight, so why doesn't the media go after them. just cuz your a celebrity, does not mean that you are not normal.    im so sick and tired of the media making a big deal about everything Micheal Phelps smoking marajuana is not getting as much attention as Jessica. Im talking about the LEGENDERY Swimmer smoking drugs - and people are talking about like 15 pound increase???      whats wrong with the world?|`|JPAYaFgsaa	well, she was the one who flaunted her "hot" body in the dukes of hazard movie while she was humping a car..she chose to be in this industry and she should have known tht the slightest change in her body would cause attention from the media!    plus i agree with the outfit crisis.. her outfit was horrible and it was a flop :(  i agree with the person above me, if they are calling jessica fat, how can you describe the obese ppl in america?!    BUT..the cartoons are very rude and immature.. and unnecissary|`|q4xyfJtAaa	They have no right because for one she is not that big and secondly the things they are saying about her is going to make young girls think they are fat too and become anorexic.  She is human and human's don't look like sticks.  A size 8 is not that big.|`|2d17c2ff5cd28b3fd169e4ba5aa17f4caa	Jessica Simpson herself is one of the people who helped to create these ridiculous standards that a lot of women feel they have to live up to.  Yes, it is not nice that she is being criticized, but you reap what you sow.  If she and these other half naked, really thin women weren't out there sending the impression that THAT is what is sexy, then she wouldn't be criticized the way she is now.|`|rVNzIx0faa	Psh course' it's not right.  But it is kinda their own fault, they are after all celebrities.

SAaEiqHvaa	love it, massive fan of both artist...
eOLAnGiSaa	Yup. It all began with an acid trip John Lennon had in 1967, in which he wrote the first line to "I Am the Walrus", which were "I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together." He continued writing (without drugs) from there, as he learned that his teachers were using his compositions as grammar tools for their students. He wanted to make a song that they couldn't understand. So then, "I Am the Walrus" was born. The titular line became a huge controversy, and John first claimed that the "walrus" was Paul (though he later contradicted himself in the song "God" and said that he was the walrus). Any other walruses were supposed to be referencing this song. In "Come Together", that verse was about John Lennon, the "walrus gumboot" was the aformentioned song.|`|UbLuMwcEaa	The Walrus was something of an alter identity of John Lennon. Either that or just some weird fascination, since apparently some his old elementary school drawings were of walruses.    In his solo song "God" - he sings, "I was the Walrus, but now I'm John"|`|oXWv5giyaa	All the songs that you have mentioned were written by John Lennon. He just continued the "walrus" theme throughout those songs.  He liked throwing nonsense lyrics together to mess with the heads of his fans trying to dissect Beatles songs. That's all.|`|ZJZ7JhyNaa	they were really high... yep... they smoked psychedelic drugs, and it mad them loco. THE BEATLES ARE THE MOST AWESOME BAND IN THE WORLD!!!!! peace and love|`|6LcHJbHjaa	I think they were just making a more psychedelic sound, and they just wanted to mentions unusual animals in there songs.

The walrus and the carpenter poem had a religious subtext.    Or just nonsense.  Maybe you have to be a 60 year old Brit to get all the references.    It's like they say: People read books but great books read you.

NCMZy6Uqaa	On his music: it has been discussed that there are three main stages in his musical production, with very defined stylistic features. Maybe you could find some examples and discuss about them, and what were the facts or specific circumstances that inspired these works.    On a personal approach: how the realization of loosing his hearing sense affected his life and following work (see his Heiligenstadt testament and analysis of it made by biographers/musicologists).|`|jbAr62ybaa	Why don't you Google your question?    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&fkt=2...

9znhhikKaa	It's called "I'd Rather Be With You" by Bootsy Collins.    http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/collins_bo...
oSkehc54aa	I'm a Leo and my boyfriend of 4.5 years is a Scorpio.  So, it can work.  Of course, we do fight sometimes but it's only a small percentage of the time.  The thing to remember is fire males love strong women, but they still like for the man to be the man and the woman to be the woman.  If you want to wear the pants in the relationship, you are better off with a Pisces or a Cancer, but since they don't fit your type I doubt you could be happy long term.      An Aries man will be the dominant one in a relationship, no question.  They are very stubborn and find it hard to see how any way but theirs could possibly be correct.  But, a Scorpio/Aries relationship is also very exciting. If you can hand over the reigns without feeling like you're compromising yourself too much, then this could work for you.    The biggest problem with a Scorpio/Leo match is that we really like having our egos stroked.  This can get a bit much for Scorpios, especially when their own egos are neglected.  It's a passionate match though.  If you find a Leo guy who can handle being told his ego is getting a little out of line, then this can also work.    If you find a Sagittarius male who is ready for a serious relationship, then this might be your best bet for living peacefully with another strong personality.  Sagittarius is the mutable fire sign, and therefore the most adaptable.  They don't mind compromise at all, but they aren't great at picking up subtle hints.  If you want this man to change something about his behavior or let him know he's upset you, you'll have to come right out and say it.    You don't have to resort to a metro guy, but us fire signs aren't as finely tuned as water signs when it comes to emotional sensitivity.  So the next time a fire sign annoys you, just be open about it and let them know without being confrontational because we find it hard to resist a fight.  It's hard for Scorpios to reveal things like that, I know, but communicating is the key to making a passionate water/fire combo work.|`|dmxnblomaa	You should try a taurus, very very masuline.|`|DDw6k8JOaa	Since when are all the other signs metrosexuals. Thats very presumptuous of you.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	You are hilarious! I am a scorpio woman and I can relate! My ex is an aries (can't stand him).  My husband is a leo. (it's okay).  Date if you can a Taurus.  Scorpio woman want strength! We want our match! This ofcourse is our polar opposite so I don't know if you'll actually get along but Oh the chemistry. Good luck!|`|nkSjYEoraa	im an aries and my boyfriend is a scorpio we are both dominant and always butt heads but hey we are still together. its like a romantic thriller, but once you set off boundaries and limitations everything will be just fine.|`|Qz3sii2caa	No, it just means you're doomed to a life of butting heads and rough sex. Well, as long as you love each other I suppose it could be worse. LOL|`|2IddNqy9aa	I'm a pisces and i am the greatest thing to ever walk this earth. alpha males r overated cuz i beat the crap out of them on a daily basis. my four brothers r all fire signs, and we all box, and none of them have a chance in hell of beating me. & i'm the youngest at seventeen.     I can beat up Russell Crowe too. & Kimbo Slice. :)    Pisces is the best sign there is. better than leo & sag & aries& especially Scorpio. i dont go out my way to be manly or the alpha male, and i still cant get girls off me. So cut the "metrosexual" ignorant bull & get over yourself!!!!!    Just kidding ;)|`|uHbzyCcHaa	YEAH.....  SCORPIO WOMEN DO NOT WANT ANY ***** IN THEIR LIVES. THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN DOMINATE THEM...BUT IN THEIR EYES. IT DOESN'T MEAN U NEED TO DATE A METROSEXUAL. DATE A TAURUS.........OR ANOTHER SCORPIO MAN....CAPRICORNS ARE KNOWN FOR BOSSY AND NO ***** IS IN THEM......AND YEAH....  BUT WITH THE FIRE SIGNS...IT CAN WORK IF THE TWO LEARN HOW TO MEET ON THE SAME GROUNDS EMOTIONALLY AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE BOSS.

Cipher:  5. music fault in organ valve: a fault in an organ valve that causes a pipe to sound continuously without the key having been pressed|`|dpYMlxA4aa	Tablature:  Pro it's very intuitive and shows a direct correlation to what you physically do to play the instrument. It's good for beginners.  Con it's very difficult to show complicated or fast passages, or anything with a high density of expressive markings.    Staff Notation:  Pro Can quickly and easily express most musical ideas to any musician fluent in the notation.    Con can be difficult to learn, as there are hundreds of symbols you need to know.    Cipher notation  Pro: easy for people who don't read staff notation.    Con: except for aural skills classes, and some ethnic instruments no one knows or uses it.  Also its poor at expressing anything other than the notes to play.

wU0c3i7baa	To the person who said Leo's French, you're wrong. He's 3/4 German and 1/4 Italian.    You forget a lesser known film of his in which he played the famous French poet Arthur Rimbaud. It's called Total Eclipse. He was also French in man in the iron mask.    I don't agree with you. While there are certainly coincidences, France is not a major part of any of those movies other than Total Eclipse and Man in the Iron Mask.    More than anything, I've noticed he tends to do historical period pieces in which he plays bachelors.    Body of Lies - no France  Blood Diamond- no France  The Departed- no France  The Aviator-no France  Gangs of New York-no France  The Beach-no France  Celebrity -no France  Marvin's Room-no France  Romeo + Juliet-no France  The Basketball Diaries-no France  The Quick and the Dead -no France  What's Eating Gilbert Grape-no France  This Boy's Life -no France|`|EB991uRiaa	Ha ha, agreed, he's gorgeous :D  But yeah, I never picked that up. And in Total Eclipse he WAS a French 16 teen year old. Wow, maybe he likes France or it's just a coincidence?|`|71mzNtu6aa	Leanardo IS french!

I never realized that but that's interesting.  Now I wonder why.  Perhaps it's just a coincidence because I don't think his characters in "The Beach" or "Blood Diamond" had anything to do with his France.

KiJ5WEyIaa	Master P's brother C-Murder was convicted of killing someone.  I believe he's waiting for a retrial right now.    Quote:     "In September 2003, Miller was convicted for the 2002 beating and fatal shooting of a fan, 16-year-old Steve Thomas, at a Harvey, Louisiana nightclub, however Presiding Judge Martha Sassone granted a new trial based on the claim that prosecutors improperly withheld criminal background information on three of their witnesses.    While awaiting re-trial Miller was placed under house arrest. Sassone allowed Miller to promote his new yet to be titled CD and novel, Death Around the Corner, while under house arrest, but ruled that a gag order pertaining to the case would remain in effect. The terms of the house arrest required Sassone's permission for all visitors, including reporters.    On March 13, 2007, Judge Sassone granted Miller's request to work on his music career on a per request basis, but denied his request for a 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. curfew.   His seventh studio album Screamin' 4 Vengeance, was finally released in stores on July 1, 2008.    Sassone's rulings in the case became an issue in her failed 2008 bid for re-election. Sassone was defeated by Judge Ellen Kovach; prosecutors subsequently renewed a request to have Miller returned to jail.    As of January, Miller is confined to his residence on house arrest, and may only leave for a documented medical emergency. His new murder trial was set to begin April 20 , 2009.  If convicted, he would face a mandatory life sentence in prison."|`|SEzMrFrbaa	50cent and akon..both werein prison,and killed some1|`|ofC4JQIhaa	Eminem, Snoop, The Game, Mike Jones, Dre all i can think of

zewRBWE7aa	A good bassist should be able to do both. Although "ear" wins out just slightly for me, they should at least know the names of the notes and where to find them on the fretboard.|`|KBBonf97aa	I'll always take someone who plays by ear over a music reader.  People who take lessons seem to work within some set of imaginary rules about what's supposed to be played and where.  That's probably fine if someone isn't particularly creative in the first place, but people who play by ear tend to have great instincts.  They rely on their "feel" for music more than arbitrary guidelines and I've always found that more compelling, as a listener.

Being vulnerable etc.    "Because you're mine, I walk the line".|`|qt9rrk6xaa	There are temptations, but I'm true.|`|41Sr1i1iaa	jhk|`|20M2yA9eaa	Watch the movie... basically he was "walking the line" meaning he wasn't drinking and doing drugs because he loved his wife June.  That's the meaning of "because you're (June) mine, I walk the line."|`|Mwbafje3aa	Being a huge fan, I believe his meaning to this song line is that he is passionately attempting to keep on the "good/moral" side of life in general.    Johnny Cash was well known for his life style in general.  His life was, admittedly, haunted for years with an addiction to drugs.  He was forever trying to live his life as some people thought to be the "right" way.  In other words, his way of living was, for the most part a deviation off the beaten path of morality - in regards to one living "clean and sober".      His "walking the line" was, as I see it, his way of explaining his attempt as well as his public effort to live life "right" in the eyes and opinion of society.    I agree with " the answer "ragdolls..." submitted.|`|AA11195316	its about following christ and following the world   read his story  good luck|`|PnWhN603aa	I'm pretty sure it's about trying to behave himself because he didn't want to wrong the woman he loved.|`|t5x0i5M8aa	It was June Carter who wrote the song.

RzbRRUOdaa	Write something from experience.  Your fears, your thoughts, your dreams.  A 'forbidden' love story could probably be something that parents don't allow because of some family feud or racial differences - or whatever, that is something very real to you.    This would put soul to the story you are writing about.|`|6IbrKgfzaa	hum i love twilight so all i could think for like 5 minutes was VAMPIRES but then i came up with this idea -the guy could be older --- parents don't accept sorry i just luv twilight|`|M9o5WpOqaa	it sounds like something that actually happened to me except i was 12.  It was when i had my first real boyfriend, i dated him for eight months, and despite what people said, it lasted longer than most 12-13 love situations that are over in one week. My advice is to not make it sound to unreal, because behind every cinderella is just an average girl. and behind every prince charming is just an average teenage guy that only has two things on his mind: sex and more sex.|`|n9u1x72qaa	that sounds cute! go for it. umm i think you should write about a girl who thinks there is no hope cuz i know that thats how alot of girls feel, and then write about how anything is possible, but not too fantacy like make it more realilistic cuz then girls who read it will be more interested cuz they can relate. something like that idk hahaha|`|WlywfjG1aa	Not 13 but I have love story happened in my life with 16 years girl. She was very moody , notorious , vagabond , would not listen to parents. Everyone was fade up with her. Her friends , teacher , sister and parents just did not know how to handle her. In such situation she was referred to me as I am professional counselor. I frankly did nothing. I boosted her confidence in herself. Showed her all the creative elements which she had , on which she should just channelize and get focused. She was having a romantic relationship with a guy from her school but just could not tackle it properly.    During this process she got fully ok. Everyone one accepted her. She had her lost confidence regained. But during this process we developed very close rapport and friendly relationship. Although I was many many years senior to her , she developed a sense  of gratitude , trust and belongings to me. Although we never went physical but the kind of bond emerged between us was divine and we think it was god who wanted us to do so.    I tackle many cases professionally , but this was one where I got personally involved.|`|ycr6iVRraa	Its not all love stories are corny. I think if your young its appropriate for you too write a story for teens, so go for it!    I would suggest drawing from your own life experiences however my best friend was involved in an interesting and very taboo love situation.    When she was sixteen she fell in love with her older cousin. He was in his late twenties and they ended up having a secret love affair. The whole time she confined in me about her overwhelming guilt, the pleasure and shame the relationship made her feel. She really trying to fight it but was very starved of affection...there was an element of the older guy taking advantage of her lack of maturity and emotional venerability. She just really need to feel loved.    When she was nineteen her family eventually found out and she was completely humiliated. They were totally disgusted in her and told her fiancee about the affair. He was utterly devastated that she could be involved in an incestuous relationship and never forgave her.   However, her fiancee did still marry her and she still punishes herself everyday for what she considers an 'inexcusable moral crime'.   She is now in her late twenties with two children plus her marriage is suffering greatly because of her dark secret. She never pursed her dreams to study as a way of further punishing herself...its really horrible and I hope she can one day forgive herself.    Her affair never continued and she never spoke to her cousin again...also as an added twist, she later found out that he has done this before! With her other cousin! This didn't help her at all, instead it created further fury within her family..|`|gbOqSqenaa	2 friends crushing on the same guy (not fun!)|`|i5iOyCLdaa	I had a crush on my best friend. It's not really interesting.|`|SJNHYL7Vaa	I'm sorry but Love shouldn't happen at age thirteen in these days,  "maybe you should have a 13yr girl with a 16yr boy fall in love, despite their parents wishes. They're living in verona, Italy in the 1400s where there was a great city. Love at first site."  Does this sound familiar.  Create a different story then William Shakespeare's stories.

Different types of strings really sound different from each other, and that could be your problem...?|`|rYhnAkR3aa	maybe try holding the pick differently. make sure your hand on the strings are to weak on the strings. make sure none of the strings are accidentally being muted by your fingers. try guitar lessons. i've been taking them and it's really fun.|`|hZ2azObzaa	Try using the more rounded part of the pick.....

GCl84SPLaa	No. He is just dead. Not to knock his talent, he was a great actor. But when an actor dies prematurely they tend to get put on a pedestal.

vsy4QMHMaa	The Yamaha Arius YDP-160 has a max 64 note polyphony, the stereo samples used for Piano 1 and Piano 2 will use two voices each reducing the poly to 32, if there are other "tricks" that Yamaha uses for "string resonance" that will reduce voices further. It's probably fine for a home piano for learning, but by the time you get to the advanced stages you'll regret not having more polyphony. You _will_ hear notes drop out of big passages.     I'd look for a 42" or taller professional upright, unless you have a serious requirement for a digital piano.|`|MVGqd6OLaa	Well! i can tell you that there are NO great acoustic pianos for that price.. nor is there any good digital piano for that price... but if your really have a budget that low i would go for a digital piano. this is because Acoustic pianos need tuning and a Piano for 1000$ probably needs it or is about 100 years old which a 38 year old man just inherited from his dead grandfather which became 92 years old last may 27th    Digital pianos are good for beginners as you can get programs like synthesia (www.synthesiagame.com) or just any other teaching program .. point to be noted Garageband '09 has excellent beginner lessons.    just keep this in mind The yamaha YDP 160 might be good the first few months that you play but after a while you will soon regret it. at-least thats what most people do. this is because the keys are plastic and they don't feel exactly how you want it to but id totally go for it! i mean digital pianos are a great solution for beginners also Yamaha make the best DPs (Digital Piano) or thats at least what the numbers say. ... id like to answer this question again.. like this    -SHORTENED ANSWER-    The Yamaha YDP 160 is great for now but you will change your mind in a year or sooner if you play a lot.    Digital pianos are preferable because of their no need of tuning and at your budget i'd say that you cant afford tuning.

vqqxD6Teaa	I think that "Blue Suitcase" is basically about someone who thinks He is everything. He is so stuck on himself that he doesn't care about what he does to other people.She's letting him know that she is ready for him to go.    "Pitter Patt" is about a relationship that is ending. I believe that she is singing about how she has a decision to make. The thought f doing what's right seems to be haunting her b/c it is painful for her to say goodbye.    "Love, Save The Empty", I believe she said it was a song about parents who haven't exactly done there job in being there for their kids and what kind of affect it has on them. She knows that love is the only thing that can help. She is in fact asking love to save all the people who are empty.|`|WuKaWxodaa	I dont know who that is

She doesn't like Amber from the start.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Thirteen told House that, if he wanted to know her name, he could look at her personnel file. When other doctors asked her what her name was throughout Season 4, she simply said that they could call her Thirteen.    Dr. Cuddy calls her "Dr. Hadley." In "Emancipated," she introduced herself as Dr. Remy Hadley to the alleged parents of her patient.|`|u2riik31aa	Its her number from when House was looking for new people. I was wondering why he doesnt call the others by their numbers too! I dont understand that....|`|ejNciq5Waa	it's just her number  and he uses it because at first he didn't know her name so he decided he'd just call her by her intern number and it stuck|`|hOmnEqeXaa	thirteen is her number not her name and house calls her by her number and not the other doctors because he is house|`|7StVhdUraa	just calls her that her real name is like marry or something it was just her intern number and house couldn't remember her name.

But i got really sick the day before his party, so.  He CANCELED the WHOLE thing for me. It was terrible.  i felt so bad. But he said he did it for me. I mean, i know  that the party wasnt just cancelled by itself. Cause alot  of my friends that got invited got a call from him, and said  he decided not to have the party anymore because jasna was sick.  I felt so bad that his birthday party had been cancelled just for me.  I really was happy that he did that but it was just so sweet !   We ended up watching movies and eating soup the entire day.  It was cool. & i loved it ! (: I got him sick, too a few days after.|`|7fs7VYTmaa	Once this guy that I didn't really know gave me chocolate, plushies, and jewelery for Valentines day.    Hmmm.

He knew where to hide them because they were places that I would always look.  This was at night, then the next morning I woke up (a little bit grumpy because I was late) and I kept finding these sweet little notes that reminded me of how amazing and beautiful I am.  It was extremely sweet.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well pushed me down the stairs and now my back is broken and I loved it.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	My fiance told me he wants his daughter to grow up to be just like me.

I was wearing a   floral-y dress and he was wearing some casual clothes and then he  took out his guitar and we both sang "Lucky" by Jason Mraz.   It was so cheesy, but it was the cutest thing ever  : )       What about you ?|`|YVNeeIIIaa	It didn't actually happen because there ended up being a huge snowstorm but since we live in an apartment that doesn't allow dogs and I moved away from my dog who I missed A LOT he was going to drive over an hour away while I was at work, to bring my dog to his parents and we were going to spend the weekend at his parents with my dog|`|gCoqslUGaa	he looked at me and told me he loved me in front of his friends  and..  when we got into a lil fight, he sent me a rose and amitted HE was wrong|`|tbZNMfAsaa	He's done a lot of sweet things every now and then. The most recent was probably when he bought me a cool little drill for Christmas. :-)    The one that sticks out in my head the most is when he came back from Iraq, that very same nigh he drove two hours to pick me up. We went to the barracks and were watching a movie. He went over to his bag that he hadn't unpacked yet and pulled out a golden eagle pendant on a gold chain. It means soooo much to me to this day.|`|d9ONMUpBaa	just today.   i've been suffering from anorexia and bulimia on and off for about a year. and my friend jimmy hates it when i don't eat. if he finds out that i fasted the day before, he won't even talk to me the next day. so today he found out that i didn't eat much yesterday, so when i saw him this morning he didn't say a word, he just shook his head. i started crying. i couldn't stand to see him worry about my disease, and i just started bawling. he looked me in the eyes and said, "alethia, you're beautiful, smart, gorgeous, perfect, sweet, and funny, and you mean a lot to me. please don't do this to yourself." i cryed a bit harder and hugged him. i don't know what i'd do without him.|`|EqVvNnCyaa	Okay, I'm definitely not 'up myself' but all my friends and family say I have great features/looks and ask me if I have had a boyfriend. I am a normal person and friendly, but no guy has come up to me or done anything 'sweet' for me. I only 'went out' with a guy when I was 13. For about 3 days.

3OYv4dnSaa	As the user above stated, there are programs that are for creating animation and artwork.    I'm sure the drawing all started out as a simple pencil drawing for practice and then add color pencil to it to decide what color to add in computer art. After this, the computer artists would add color chosen by the drawer.    For adding drawings into animation, that'll be done in another program.  ____________    For the program, in United States, Photoshop is popular for computer art. You still need pencil drawing to start out and then scan it into the computer. Scan basically means "copy" the drawing on a paper into the computer. You can google Photoshop, but it'll take A LOT of times to master it (more than a year for sure). In addition, it costs hundreds of dollar to buy it (costs $700-$800 in my nearest store). You can download it for 30-day trial.    In Japan, where Dragonball Z is made, it's........unknown to me. =/|`|LnYr2dLfaa	They do it on the program they use to put the anime into action (like making the characters move and that sort of thing) and it does take some time. All they need is practice.

KhGkc2QGaa	Ask them about things like their history, how the members met, bands that inspire them, personal stuff, plans for the future, stuff like that.    The one thing I hate about listening to underground/local bands is that you can never find out much information about them. you know their songs, but not much more about all of the members.|`|Vl6g2YD8aa	Maybe you should tell a little about each member in the band, like their influences and stuff...What made them play the instrument they play..crap like that =)...and you could post some of their songs on the myspace so people can check them out..Ooooh and how they came up with their band name..I always like to know how my favorite bands thought of their band names XD|`|iwu8uJRnaa	I'd love to know their influences, above all else. Where they got their start, geographically, is also interesting to me.     Hope that helps!
NR4hbYPiaa	Jesse Jackson was a black guy who ran for president back in the 1980's|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	You mean Jesse Owens, the black athlete who won 4 gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and upset Hitler.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	I thought that he was that bad cowboy dude back in the 1800s or something like that. then isn't there another jesse jackson. but he's like a dirtbike rider i think?|`|siif0K84aa	I think he was a black runner who won the olympics but Hitler wouldn't shake his hand in congrats because he was prejudice.|`|GCl84SPLaa	Jesus people, instead of wasting time and brain cells posting here, try doing some home work.  Jesse is the head of Rainbow Push, a pro black organization. He hung out with Martin Luther King, and  what ever you may have heard, King hated him and thought he was an *** kisser and a wanna be. He has since lost a ton of credibility because due to his ego, he will find any excuse to be on TV even when it has nothing to do with pro black causes. You people need to get a life, I swear.
Z7c5d0nuaa	idonno, lemme look into my magical crystal ball...    well,  personally think that music itself is in a huge depression.  the music is poppy.  the guitar sucks.  lyrics, shallow.|`|Rys16kqiaa	Obviously, this is my opinion, but I think music will always go on.    Even through the depression, music has grown more than ever. Maybe the way music is distributed may change (maybe albums may not be enough of a profit). But like I said, music will go on forever.|`|tfkHZXYTaa	good question id like to know that too...|`|H0LfFGmlaa	As long as it produces hit songs it will always flourish. If anything music from our favorite musicians will help us through this tough time.|`|Vl6g2YD8aa	nothing will change probably...music will always be around because it's something everyone can relate to and like...i don't think anyone can face life without music..i know i couldn't XD|`|KrFPTVWuaa	Depends on where people get their music from...if people go to itunes the companies make less money. If people go to record stores companies make more money on cds and such. Then there are always those who pirate it and download things for free. So its really hard to say, I think it will be fine cause there are tons and tons and tons of bands in the world either having mainstream success or waiting for their big break into the music scene or waiting to be signed by record companies. So things should be alright. Everyone just needs to keep doing there thing and rocking on!
XoE8UO85aa	The director who did the first movie was absolutely horrible. If you're scared he's not going to get the romance, I don't know how you got the idea the first movie displayed any bit of emotional stuff at all. The first movie had no romance and crappy special effects. So in any case, I don't know why you would be so worried, I'm very pleased, at least this time the special effects won't be so damn cheessyy and let's hope the romance won't either.   I mean either way you still enjoyed the movie right? I did, regardless of how badly directed it was. So just hope for the best.|`|siif0K84aa	I know, Catherine Hardwicke did a sorta kinda somewhat good job on Twilight. The Golden Compass was a good movie for the most part. I think he will try his hardest though because he knows there are millions of fans and he doesn;t want to disappoint them.|`|WFt4rGIFaa	this isn't a very good answer, but honestly I'm not sure if anyone could screw up a beautiful story like Twilight as bad as the last directer. The movie was so disappointing...  i'm afraid with you,  but keep in mind that the special effects in Twilight (the movie) sucked majorly. They made Edward look like he was flying, for god sake!!!! VAMPIRES CANNOT FLY! :)|`|UzjTygp1aa	I know what you mean because I too, am a twilight fan. But as all the actors and actresses are doing I think we should trust Chris Weitz and hope that he will follow the book. I hope my answer helped!|`|XhAFxWG5aa	sorry this so long. and probably not the best answer either.     in my opinion i think that the director for new moon has to step up his game if he wants new moon to rock. because most of the book doesn't have Edward in it and that is kind of devastating for Edward lovers and that means the rest of new moon has to rock. Oh and the last director didn't get the romance thing that much either. i did think that twilight gave me good picture of most of the Cullen's other than that we will just have to wait and see with the new director.|`|c6f9ab7e2d2a7f6e05931699c7bdd1efaa	I think he'll do pretty good. Just as long as he can do the special effects. and the romance. Fingers crossed!|`|bmwR7RdMaa	sorry not a fan, but the movie was directed well by catherine i hope chris does a good job

b5b26df8e4d3363ba97caa423b1ba753aa	Solely with your comp?  I'm thinking GarageBand, a program that comes with Macs. I used to have a Mac and and fun with this program all the time. They have a wide selection of instruments/synthesizers and you can format the rhythms and notes on your computer.  They also have sets of rhythms/chords/melodies that you can mix right in.  One major problem: It's not compatible with PCs.  *sigh* The canyon between Macs and PCs is ever widening...  But yeah, for PCs most people use FruityLoops [FL studio] but GarageBand is way better. The sound quality is a lot better and is easier to use.|`|34f917678352c312dd367a45cec8a80baa	My favorite program for this is Fuity Loops ... it's like having every sampler, synthsizer, drum machine, and musical instrument ever made ... plus a band to play them ... right on your computer. And best of all, it always shows up to practice and play out, never wants more credit or money, doesn't override your groove with stupid ideas, and does not disappear on drunken binges! Splendiferous!     The program is expensive, though, and has quite a learning curve. You can find out more at http://www.fruityloops.com/. There is a free demo there.     There is also a good Open source (meaning FREE) program called Psycle. This is a good place to start making music on your computer ... there are better programs out there, but this one costs nothing, works well, and lets you get a taste of what is possible. Look for it at http://psycle.pastnotecut.org    When you get there, click on "Songs" first ... you can download some mp3s of somgs people have written using it. Pretty impressive stuff.     Also, have some fun at http://www.sourceforge.net. Click on Multimedia, then Sound/Audio ... there's some other good stuff in there, all free, all interesting.|`|fe0291e68c0f84c9668741f94de802f3aa	FL Studio or band in a box can do exactly what you're asking ain't cheap though

AA11104893	If you're into true heavy metal, I recommend a group called Dream Evil.   They're quite new, but they are one of the only groups that can make proper metal like the late 80s bands did. Listen to the album Book of Heavy Metal. It's such a classic!    Apart from that, it depends on what exactly do you like.   If you like more melodic/power metal stuff, try Gamma Ray, Edguy (all but the newest album, which is radio rock, not metal), Freedom Call, older Blind Guardian...    I've just discovered a new band which was instantly my favourite:   Sabaton. They're melodic heavy metal with a lot of keyboards.     If you wish to discuss the contemporary metal scene in greater detail, you're welcome to mail me.

They can't understand how I would still rather play those games than the modern ones.    I agree on  1 and  3 and don't know a lot about  2, but I remember that a standard "dime" bag was $10 and I thought you could make a few joints from that.  It is amazing that anyone could possibly wear bell bottoms again.  Also, I still kept my 30" waist Sergio Valente jeans from around 1982 that I could barely fit into then - just in case by some miracle I can lose about 45 pounds or so.

0GhkcU65aa	You're right, it could be that the bridge is too low. You could use a hex key to unscrew the bridge to make it slightly higher, but if you don't know what you're doing it's best to take it to a guitar shop and have them sort it out.|`|18K7ucsEaa	The strings are too close to the neck and when they vibrate back and forth, they hit the neck and make the "buzzing" noise... its a very common guitar problem. You will need to either raise the bridge a little bit or the nut at the top of the neck where the stings lay. I don't really recommend tightening or loosening the neck truss too much as this can bow the guitar neck and ruin it if you are not careful. The easiest fix I can think is to get thicker gauge strings get .10's or thicker and that way they don't sink so far down in the nut. It's usually just the low E string that does this... if you take it to a guitar shop if you are unable to do a simple fix, it shouldn't cost too much to fix!|`|jWMXi3Lnaa	It's possilbe the neck is too close to the strings. Try tightening the neck using an allen wrench. Or possilby raise the bridge|`|hJP9y6kjaa	String buzz = needs a setup. The best thing to do is to take it to a music store and have them set it up and do an intonation. They'll check the truss rod, bridge, action (string height), and all that.    Next, you're going to want to start googling and youtubing "electric guitar setup" and "how to setup and intonate your guitar". Have a pro do it first - but try to learn how to do it for yourself after that. It's good to feel how it should be set up, ie, by someone who knows what they're doing... I know it's helped me...    It might not just be that you're action is too high or your neck might be a little off... I just had one of my guitars professionally set up (well, it was rewired, new pickups were installed, new strings, plus setup and intonation... ha, that wasn't cheap) and it shocked me how different it played versus what I was used to.    I started playing guitar by playing an acoustic, and while I learned how to play softly (for tha ladies =p ) I also got in the habit of picking a little harder - you have to for acoustics. When I went over to electrics, I still had the habit of picking pretty hard. So when I set up my guitar, I would raise the action until I had no fret buzz.... and I couldn't figure out why I had so many problems with staying in tune... turns out that if your action is too high the strings will constantly be pulled out of tune just by fretting them! Even though it worked well for me, he said that he considered it unplayable.. that it was high enough for slide guitar! I've had to learn how to pick softer, and it's not easy... but I've found out that soft=even faster. Amazing, that whole economy of motion thing....    Anyways, good luck! A proper setup *will* help you play better, the guitar will sound in tune with itself, and overall even though its a cheaper guitar, you'll get maximum enjoyment from it that way.      Saul|`|qkuRfSLeaa	It's possible the neck could need adjusting OR  the pickups could be hitting the strings .The pickups might need to be adjusted .

GCyp7QhLaa	Noah Ringer was found through an open casting call on thelastairbendercasting.com however the site officially went down early fall of last year. They were looking for unknowns and had to do a video of themselves as well as submit a resume. Anything other than that is unknown.    Yes apparently he has a black belt and is a supposedly karate star/champion from Texas.    Jesse McCartney was in talks to play Zuko. However, controversy erupted about JM. Later he is said to have scheduling conflicts and cannot fulfill the role, regardless of his earlier statements in an interview with MTV, that he was in the process of learning the moves. However it was clear he didn't know a thing bout ATLA.     Dev Patel was barely announced a few days ago. Hes from Slumdog Millionaire. A great movie, however I don't think he fits in the ATLA as Zuko, perhaps another character|`|H7zLqL80aa	Actually it's Dev Patel that's going to be playing zuko. Sorry I can't answer your question, nobody knows what this noah ringer kid looks like yet, but I just wanted you to know the zuko thing.

6IHvMqsMaa	erm, is there a way to have a Twilight party?  unless you go and have one on the beach, with a fire! - that would be cool... well freezing actually. lol XD    Only other things I can think that relate to Twilight and Parties are dancing related unfortunately.    Like the above said, paintballing is great fun.  Erm, parachuting would be too expensive.  What other dangerous exciting things that you can do at a birthday party?!  Rock climbing? - tbh, not the most exhilarating thing in the world. Nd outdoor would be cold.  Girly sleepover? - I guess that could be done after whatever other activities you get up to tho.  Laser quest? - kinda young for you now, paintballing replaces it. lol  I am out of ideas; for my 15th I went to Holland for a week with a group of friends, but that took a while to organise.  I went on a parachuting course for my 16th, but also went out for a meal with some mates. lol - part from the parachuting, wasn't that action packed! lol    Whatever you do, hope you have a great time XD      ps.  WOW - a girl who isn't into dancing etc. That must be like, a first!  But I know what you mean, I can't dance to save my life. lol - which is normally why I help out with the DJ'ing side of things XD|`|D58bzW4Jaa	Paintball!|`|0PLV5uXjaa	see the movie,|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	pimp n hoe party ;)|`|6Xqwnk3Iaa	rent a hotel room for the night with your friends and deck it out with twilight stuff|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Erm, whatever you like to be honest|`|tPjjWlStaa	Learn to dance and have a masked ball.|`|3jvGRqiyaa	have a Twilight party in your house or in a hall! and to have twilight themed like games!

My friends and I were all running about and the snow was fantastically thick. I'm very glad I got the day off school to enjoy the snow!!!!!!|`|uqLUKbMbaa	Yes, it certainly did.  Especially when I saw the excited faces of the children, many of whom had never before experienced snow.  To see their faces glowing and hear their laughter was a real tonic.  Our grandchildren's schools were closed so they came to our house where we have a very big garden with a slope at the far end and that's where they swept down on their sledges.  My wife Alanagh and I wrapped up warm and went out with them and took a lot of pictures for the family album.  Later, there was hot chocolate and biscuits and later still, hot dinner before mums and dads came to take them home.  Just a few inches of snow created a fairyland with the main characters our grandchildren.  The picture and the sounds will live long in my memory.  Thank you for the question that made me write these memory pictures.  You shall have a star.

I think that once a woman reaches a certain age, perhaps 50, she should keep her hair short after that.  But, before that, its really up to her and what makes her happy.    If you are asking this to determine how you should keep your hair, don't let a bunch of strangers on YA determine your hairstyle.  When the right guy comes along, he'll like you no matter how long or short your hair is.  If a guy says, "I'll only date a girl with long/short hair", TRUST ME, that's not the right guy for you.

I personally like long to short hair if her hair passes her back i don't think that looks good but every guys has his own type i think girls look cute with shorter hair and "sexy" with longer hair.|`|69zJ609waa	depends on your facial shape and physique. skinnier girls pull off the short haired look more than bigger girls. If a big girl were to have short hair then the roundness, largeness of her face would be exaggerated but with longer hair then its less noticeable. But really personally long hair is always better it just seems more feminin, probably from inbetween shoulder length and just past that|`|aSkRi1J4aa	i honestly, DONT care.

So yes I hate them!|`|CArzkDIUaa	absolutely|`|AA11749193	YES, I hate trolls, too, and their thumb downing offspring. They are wretched, evil creatures that enjoy ruining other YA members accounts. What pisses me off, they get by with it,, are probably valued for their 'reporting skills'.....they stay up late at nite, with No Doze in their systems, deleting great questions and reporting those who answer (Like this answer- it will more than sure get reported)...Hope your question doesn't get reported, it is a GR8 ONE!   Trolls are offensive, and hide behind their computer screens, clicking away at the keys of their keyboard, just LOL at all the damn sh!t they stir up.......Never used to be this way 3 years ago when I joined. Don't say goodbye to your account, your contacts, your fans....Don't let them win! SCREW THEM! They SUCK! They ARE low lives- Just stay on (even though I don't know who the hell you are)......  Well, thanks for letting me vent! Have a GR8 Day/Week!|`|4KTe107Yaa	I was in the same boat a week ago. I was getting reported 3-4 times a day. I said the same thing to my contacts. I GIVE UP. But i realized if I;m gonna get suspended... I might as well have fun in the meantime. I don't want to be one of those people who say I got suspended for no reason. I damn will be suspended for many reasons and go out on my own way...not the trolls. I suggest you do the same. Have some fun and go out with a bang. Messed up thing is ...I'm over 60 violations and still here. I WIN...for now|`|6y5wgdmHaa	I am already setting up another account - I can't even seem to appeal anymore - DON'T LET THEM WIN!!!    WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER, FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE AND GET THEM BACK!  i HAVE ONE THAT ADMITTED TO IT IN AN EMAIL - I WILL GIVE OUT HIS NAME!!!!  BLOCK THEM OR REPORT THEM!!!!|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Holy ****...|`|AA11241794	Awww . . . I will miss you! Don't go. The only way out is through. Does that make sense?

Others can be quite funny (you can't take life too seriously after all)    But the report trolls you're talking about yes I do, appeal violations sometimes you get it overthrown. You shouldn't get offended or leave your account, that's just what they want.|`|AA10226964	I really don't hate trolls at all.  In my opinion I think some people use them for good luck.|`|7dGpL4mSaa	Yes, I hate them very much. I hope they don't delete this question though.|`|PI8VfiY1aa	Why don't you troll-proof your account? dont allow people to be your fans, and hide your Q's and A's|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I cant stand the trolls with the posts that take up the entire page.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Sorry to see you go  :[    Don't let them win!!!!  Come back!      I'm not positive what a troll is acutally, but if they make ppl leave than no, I don't like the little suckers!|`|Lq2psnTqaa	just the funny ones that ask crazy questions|`|Vhq3GURQaa	NO!! Don't leave. That is waving the white flag of surrender. Stay. We will fight like brothers (well, I'm female) and keep on fighting until we banish all trolls from this world. We shall then, run into the streets, singing songs. Embracing, laughing. Peace will reign and joy will spring from computer land like daffodils in the spring. Please, join us, as we fight the good fight.

YdXhZka8aa	Nope it's not strange.  We ate it as kids along with cheep macaroni and cheese and I still get a craving for them.    Beef.|`|7fXpLlhBaa	I LOVE ramen noodles because it is DELICIOUSSSSSS.     I like chicken flavor the best. mmmmmmmmm now i'm hungry for some.|`|BblNSwfAaa	um omg no way. i love them, they are so easy and yummy. and now you just made me want some now, probably the chicken kind, but all of them are good.|`|auRHZadYaa	i love ramen noodles your not a reatard|`|REb0XRgRaa	i love ramen soup, spicy chicken or shrimp for me though    im a spicy kinda guy|`|d4fef0f6ca92f27b2701290acce6be5daa	ooohh,you need some serious therapy! that stuff is nasty!!|`|wSq80V1xaa	I like it!

With a soda on the side!    Sorry. That was completely uncalled for.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	I like it and do crave it sometimes. My boyfriend also likes the beef flavor. I have found that out of all the instant noodles on the market, ramen are the tastiest and end up making me feel the closest to having had real asian noodles from a restaurant. And they are great on the wallet! I bought 6 packs for a $1 the other week. The taste and value are why ramen is a staple among college students.|`|YmLcF2rSaa	guess i am too then because i love them.I mix other thigs in like meat and mayo,mustard,and drain them then add seasoning packet and eat it on crackers|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	are you kidding?    that stuff rocks!  i like pretty much all the flavors but especially the chicken one, the spicy one, and the teryaki one.|`|rOYaiNsKaa	LOLLLLLLLLLL I'm in love with the chicken ramen noodles by Marchaun or however you spell the company name.   Yeah lol thanks for saying that now I'm hungry as crappppp, man!|`|j4T291YPaa	Nooooooooooooo it is NOT strange to crave Ramen Soup. That stuff is the junk. My favorite is the Chili flavor, but you can't find it around here anymore. So I just eat the chicken flavor. And usually what I do is drain out a lot of the water, to where I just have noodles and the seasoning. It concentrates the flavor and you don't have all the liquid. Mmm mm mm soooo good.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	Not strange at all.  I think a lot of people think of ramen soup as something you have to eat when you can't afford anything else, but it's actually very good.  The newer flavors, like the hot n' spicy and cajun ones, are great!|`|YQLTdXhjaa	not really, i remember i craved it for like a whole week|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Weirdo...at least get the stuff in a cup. Is it more cause it's in a cup and has a veggie in there?|`|1oJtJCaWaa	oooohhhh.... ramen noodles.... you just made me hungry!  Not strange at all... mmmmm... I used to like the spicy ones but since i can't find them any more i just add hot sauce to the chicken ones...|`|2jxWrnUGaa	It's never strange to crave it!! I love it haha!!    I love it a lot haha!! I like the chicken or roast beef =P  I'll cook you some!    *cough* that will be $5.00 dollars... *cough*    =D|`|COXOONDQaa	lol naw man the best damn thing ever!! its like the teenage "in" lunch though lol my fav is the shrimp... but i drain my noodles.... good stuff... good stuff :P|`|AA10032971	My preference is for the chicken ramen soup. It is simply delicious and doesn't involve a lot of work. I understand why you like it. My favorite snack is boiled peanuts. They are raw green peanuts that are boiled in brine. I order them through the mail. When I receive them, I usually knock off at least two cans at a sitting. They are awesome. Don't let anyone stop you from enjoying your ramen noodles. I wish you well. Peace!|`|icTmbLjfaa	I love creamy chicken or spicy shrimp|`|UepGEiR9aa	I LOVE THAT STUFF!    I LOVE CHICKEN FLAVOR!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Not really.  I get cravings for them all the time.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	it's the addiction to msg....and I hate it ever since my daughter was addicted to it and threw up after only eating that for a few days straight.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	nope i do it 2 haha|`|AA10429346	Oh, man!  I LOVE those "bricks"!  Remember when they were 10 for a dollar?  LOL  I think they still are at Big Lots.  I like Beef and Chicken.  I stay away from shrimp b/c the little foil seasoning packet always has exactly 2 shrivelled, extra-dehydrated curved C's (shown actual size) that are suppsed to be the shrimp!  But what I do that others think is weird is that I add a splash or 2 of white vinegar while it's cooking.  Now, THAT'S some good Ramen noodles! Hahaha|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I don't really like Ramen noodles. I prefer oddles o' noddles.|`|C2sZREuAaa	you must be craving salt|`|BswVoF8Paa	join the club.........i love th beef flavor, i think they should add a bit more peas to it...|`|mNC4r3EIaa	lol funny description. Yeah I like it somewhat, but never crave for it.|`|FBrCkZaNaa	no|`|wA7kqXfRaa	I love ramen noodle soup. It is the best soup ever( sorry campbells). I like the chicken flavoring and the shrimp flavoring. They used to make a spicy one but I don't see it anymore .That one was my favorite. My brother loves it too. It is also his favorite soup too. Hmm... I think I will go get me a bowl and try to wait 3 minutes before it is done or I might just start licking the microwave.|`|ImnZxskjaa	no its not strange...i absolutely love it...ill tell ya lol im lucky i have a fast metabolism or i'd be obese from it lol..my favorites are the chicken and beef|`|7R7e6yX5aa	no|`|DYZRk07xaa	beef ramen|`|fTzmFbdmaa	No. I like them all.|`|0c31c90d7fdfeb04b71f3bd31799e83eaa	No, it's not.

You might be able to model- it's hard to tell what their looking for these days. It also depends on what type of modeling you'd like to do.

And you should probably have your nose fixed... it's terribly unattractive. Actually, you look a bit like a transsexual. Have you considered going one way or the other? You'd probably make a fairly attractive male model.    Andddd... you look like you're about 37. In that range.

This is however the answer that the "pastafarians" will give you. I myself believe that global warming is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.

Before this was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in Old English) as geoluhread, which translates into Modern English as yellow-red.

HHHHHHHHHHHHMMMMMM??????|`|vAU57Hitaa	The colour is named after the orange fruit, introduced to Europe via the Sanskrit word nranja. Before this was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in Old English) as geoluhread, which translates into Modern English as yellow-red.|`|sw2C2gMwaa	Of course the orange fruit came first.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(col...  I thought that was one of those weird facts everyone knew...          BTW, for you people who are trying to make the analogy "Well...What came first, the chicken or the egg", this is a bad analogy because the Orange situation has an answer that can be proven. (I just DID prove it). The "chicken or the egg" situation does not. (But, if your a Christian, you will believe that the chicken came before the egg, because the Christians believe that god created animals..not a bunch of eggs...) But still, it can't be proven, whereas the Orange situation CAN.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	I don't know.  What came first the chicken or the egg?  Just one of life's many mysteries.|`|NFSrMkbTaa	The fruit was named after the color because when they saw how the whole entire fruit orange was the color orange, even the inside, they called the fruit orange the color orange.  I don't know how anyone would be able to understand this LOL  They should have called bananas yellows...|`|FzYEk1Skaa	yep the color was name after the Fruit|`|SjS8sngvaa	Don't listen to all the other people!

Honestly I don't think any differently of Phelps way more young people smoke pot today than everyone thinks (literally half the kids in my senior class at a respectable high school).  Hopefully this can push towards legalizing it and showing that if Phelps can smoke it and he won 8 gold medals, then why cant we?|`|pdzfq7ojaa	I couldn't care less.

It was an absolutely stupid action and Phelps deserves the consequences that he is faced with. I have no doubt that he will lose his multi-million dollar endorsements at the end of this mess.     Don't get me wrong, I used to be a HUGE Michael Phelps fan. Cheered for him in every single race last summer. Held my breath in the outstanding butterfly event. This just does it though. He's lost all of my respect, and in my opinion, there is no excuse for breaking the law and acting like an idiotic 23-year old.|`|ewgCFUBJaa	Hmmm I think I hear an endorsement deal from high times magazine.|`|sbIesr3laa	I think nobody is perfect and that everyone should stop being so hypocritical.

I'm a huge Entourage fan, I discovered it just a few months ago (I live in Italy and Entourage doesn't air here), I downloaded all the episodes and already watched them like three times! I can't get enough of it, and I can't wait to see the sixth season.  Ari is my favorite character, he's hilarious and his lines are the best, especially in seasons 3 and 4. I love his relationship with Lloyd and Mrs Ari.I wish I was Mrs Ari!  Jeremy Piven is great, they couldn't find a better actor for this role.  Plus, he's hot!|`|bYlEqiKVaa	his best performance = "mercury poisoning"|`|bYv4EtbUaa	Wow, I am a huge fan of Piven's work as Ari Gold!! I think one of the best acted scenes i have ever seen both in TV or movies was where he comes back from the golf course, i think in the episode "Manic Monday", and he fires the employee who had just gotten his lasik done. Evey part of that scene was perfect! Theres a reason he has won 3 emmys. Little known fact: Ari Emmanuel, the actual superagent on which Ari Gold is based, actually requested that piven, whome he used to represent, play his character in Entourage.
sXfFu3qIaa	The movie was more of a film making revolution than a visual one.    It was considered revolutionary because it knew how to capture all aspects of movies that cause fear and throw them at us.    It WAS however considered to be a great success in the visuals because of the various and detailed makeup work.|`|Kr1NMCZJaa	no its because thats military procedure he wasnt racist i dont think but anyhow an operation like that would make you kill anyone back in those days anyhow nowadays thed just throw ur *** in quarintine lol  Anyhow i like the movie too and it was scary for back in the day type of film|`|9v476N2Zaa	dunno|`|0yB3ZKFRaa	I saw this movie at 5-6 years old and it changed my life, Zombie movies and this one in particular are much more of a social commentary than most realize, that coupled with the sheer hopelessness of the situations make these movies so captivating...if your anything like me try reading World War Z..you'll love it.

The question is what would you not do ! ? Haha|`|L6c4wPPGaa	F*ck him :]|`|AA11340890	I would kill them.

At least he's cute.  And I don't know what I would do.|`|fZkFgYDmaa	Joe Jonas, what i would do....hummmmmmm...lots of stuff ;p|`|4IYKRhxIaa	id kill myself.|`|DEX4wNH8aa	question is: WHAT WOULDN'T I DO?! haha[:|`|YhjTbSmDaa	If I were stuck with ANY OF THEM, i'd probably risk my life swimming the ocean, just to get away.    I really cant stand any of their whiny voices.|`|nLdSwOQLaa	i would pick (if i had 2) joe, and then i would swim off the island not caring about sharks, or freezing, or anything like that.  :)|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I'd make idle chit chat like I would with anyone else.  I think Joe Jonas would be better 'cause he's the cutest.      Or, whichever has the best survival skills to get me off the island! lol|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	Get them to fight off the wild animals with their horrid singing.|`|dShUF6A9aa	I would be stranded with Nick since he's like only a yr older than me.  First, we would become bf and gf and then i'd get pregnant  Then we would call someone for help and live happily ever after|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	id pick kevin so i could punch him in the face|`|2JM1LEA9aa	Kill them|`|S3tK5UN3aa	If it were with Nick, I would f*ck him.  If it were with Joe, I would f*ck him.  If it were with Kevin, I would strike up friendly convos.|`|GG1oN4rSaa	I'd be bossing them around and if they disobey I will break their legs they suck at what they do.  But maybe they are good persons so might turn into their friends.|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Make him my slave and tell him to get his lazy butt working to think of a way to get us off the island =P|`|M2w4XoBYaa	kill him and use him as bait to kill other animals and eat them. :D|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Commit suicide.|`|k3xgdvsHaa	All three of them.  and I would scream!!  then try to survive as long as we can and maybe try to get off the island.|`|cdONxv3gaa	Have sex.|`|lzOqcGgUaa	all three.  first, i would drown them all, and make their bodies a boat.  and get myself off the island|`|2wrEoTYgaa	I would like to be stranded with Kevin. And who knows what we would do ;) jokes. But i would be very intimate.. but having sex before marriage is not on my to-do list.. or his either!|`|Myrftx3Zaa	kill them then eat them i would use their hair to keep me warm|`|wkqO8Uixaa	How about instead of me agreeing to your sick brand of torture, I just say no?|`|AXJPQgcZaa	i'd would most likely kill myself !!!|`|EMfLFsXEaa	Knock then unconscious then use their bodies to make a raft.|`|1UMKmxgcaa	Shoot him..whichever one it is. I don't even care.|`|3MXFll0qaa	makeout! Hey he's the only guy ;) nick jonas that is then we'd find a plan to get back home so I can be with my bf|`|ar8njwPgaa	Id pick Nick Jonas and then Id kill him and eat him to keep me living for a little while. He doesnt mean anything to me anyway|`|5jINw4PGaa	I'd probably drown them.|`|NGFgKGeLaa	i would swim off the island ASAP. or give them singing lessons and then swim off the island.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Uhhh... I would choose nick just because he is the closest to my age. Then I wold FORBID him from singing EVER when I'm near him.  Then we would get off the island, find civilization, I'd get his autograph to sell on Ebay, and I'd never have to talk to him again!    I would say, like, swim in the shark-infested water, but I don't want to die, I just want to get off the island and away from jonas as fast as possible!|`|5eArOiRxaa	Dude, I would grill them on how horrible their music is and how I blame them for being part of the downfall of today's music scene...|`|irAlfTveaa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Jonas Brothers soooo much and so i would become really close to them and become besties and work together to get off the island. And if and when we got off we would keep in contact :) And i would want to kiss one :)|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	Ill pick all three that way I can take them all out at the same time and there is no witness to the brutality|`|AA11014675	before or after they lose their virginity lol

Puppets?  Really?  He's a lot like Carlos Mencia, in that they serve the lowest common denominator of "comedy."  Jeff Dunham has never even made me crack a smile.  He's absolutely cringeworthy.    If you're looking for a non-traditional stand-up comedian, take a look at Dimitri Martin.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Walter is my favorite, closely followed by Jalapeno [on a stick]    Achmed the Dead Terrorist is my least favorite...I just don't think he's that funny    LOL..side note, me and the girl above me put almost the EXACT opposite of eachother, down to the words|`|oYF3nIbsaa	I absolutley LOVE achmed the dead terriorist!!! hee|`|f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	I liked his work years ago, when it was Peanut and Walter (and the jalapeno). Then he developed the new characters and it's really obvious how he just relies on racial humor and I cringe every time I hear him. So....most of them are pretty horrible.

His behavior has been in the gossip blogs for a while now, I'm surprised nothing else has surfaced that could damage his career because it easily could - he parties pretty hard with the skankiest women I've ever seen, you know he's doing worse than pot. But, he's America's Olympic hero, something tells me they're going to cut him a lot of slack.|`|AA10368887	I think he does what a lot of people do in private, but being a public person, the media leeches always have their cameras rolling.

6qsTmMQaaa	I agree with you on Disaster Movie. Usually, parody movies aren't very good, and usually the money used to film the rubbish could be used to donate to UNICEF, or something.

Friday The 13th Part 4 and so on, it works well as a trilogy, the way the try to continue the story is just ridiculous    Freddy Vs. Jason, what the hell are you kidding, both of these guys should have stopped being in movies in their prime!!

RpqkwPcCaa	I LOVE THEM!!    I always enjoy their scenes especially on all the finales, they always kick ***.    They were supposed to be together (the writers said that Sawyer, Kate, Sayid was supposed to be the triangle because Jack was supposed to die in the Pilot episode) .. Romantically, they'd look HOTT, but they are better as friends because their teamwork is amazing.    We call them "Team Awesome" :D|`|6YvkP2sGaa	I think Sayid is into women he can trust, and I don't see Kate as trustworthy.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Kate drags down both Jack and Sawyer, so I can't imagine that she and Sayid could be more boring.  On the other hand, why mess up one of the other interesting characters by sticking him with Kate, who is pretty much a boat anchor who drags down anyone she interacts with?|`|fGFO61JWaa	I think they'd be kind of cute, actually. I always thought there was a bit of an attraction, like when he left to map the Island in the first season, and he kissed her hand. They're always the ones going on the excursions, why not?|`|bdC6JcoSaa	I like Kate and Jack better, but in the flashforwards, they break up. Lame. :-P|`|cw2KARcPaa	I don't think it would work, besides the obvious "all of Sayid's women die" point. I did like the Sayid and Shannon connection, because it is what they both needed. He needed someone to love to help him get over the idea of never seeing Nadia again, and she needed someone who didn't want anything from her or expect anything of her. They fit in a weird way.    Kate and Sawyer belong together, that is all there is to it. Kate and Jack will never work because Jack can never get over the Sawyer thing (while Sawyer is the better man about all of that, as long as Kate is honest with him)... though Kate has just a few (sarcasm alert) issues with being honest with anyone.     However, I see Sawyer and Juliet getting along quite nicely and I can see the two of them getting closer and eventually becoming a couple, giving Jack and Kate the okay to pick up where they left off.     So basically, NO! Kate and Sayid is a no go. Both cool characters, just not compatible at all... Sayid needs someone he can take care of and Kate would probably blow him up or shoot him or something like that.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	All the women that Sayid has been with on the show die.  Poor Kate wouldn't stand a chance.  lol|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	They look good together but I don't think their personalities mesh.
DCKP0XtSaa	A song with no singing is called Instrumental, so named because it consists only of instruments.|`|rFBypeEfaa	"instrumental"?|`|vAwzvNgzaa	that would an instrumental acapella has no space between the a and the rest of the word.|`|wqg3GrI2aa	Solo concerto = Instrumental|`|SuZbBnycaa	acapella is singing with no instrument accompaniment  I've never heard of capella...so a wild guess is: singin with instruments.
BzUMSGgwaa	I never liked Lilly Allen because she always seems to be picking fights with other celebrities and she makes fun of people.  But I am ADDICTED to this song.  I think it represents celebrities and how they dont see whats going on around them they just want money and fame and will do anything for it e.g "I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless, cause everyone knows that's how you get famous" & "Everything's cool as long as Im gettin thinner".  I think the song is brilliant. I've been waiting for a song like this to come out, though I heard Lilly Allen singing it live on TV and I was quite dissapointed because she sung it all out of tune lol...x|`|rbcb5S1Kaa	i agree withbthe persob helow|`|g7ffUmTbaa	she didn't write them, but i agree that i love her and them.|`|e8620f879344847e16d087b73c129d97aa	Who cares what they mean its a decent song and she is fit !|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	she probably did'nt even write the song tbh|`|1glKIE5Baa	I HATE LILY ALLEN|`|5ydqCVE2aa	I think it's just general criticism of society's obsession with celebrities, physical appearances and materialism|`|sNPjBNEqaa	the song is about celebrity culture;  how we idolise people for being famous,   and how people are ready to do whatever it takes to become a celebrity.    "i'll take my clothes off and it'll be shameless, cos everyone knows that's how you get famous."|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	She's criticising societies obsession with celebrity (when she is one) fame (when she's famous) physical appearances (when she's admitted seeing a hypnotherapist to help her lose weight) and money (when she's loaded). Basically being so hypocritical it's not even funny.

I think her album is ok...not the greatest in musical Genius...but ok.
lpyWVR2oaa	The reason is probably that you are a Taurus born very close to the next sign of Gemini and hence, may have inherited quite a bit of Geminian or even Aries (next to Taurus) characteristics. Fire and Air are complementary in nature.    Check your personal planets namely, Mercury, Mars, venus, Ascendant and Moon to see if they are found in either of the two Fire and/or Air signs.|`|5y4uMfIvaa	Hahaha.

qmi4Az4Haa	Hello,  This happens to many singers. You are probably singing a lot of female songs SO you are getting used to the tune and the key that they are sung in. If you just tried singing male songs this is different you are not used to it but all you have to do is practice them. They seem harder because they are in a different key.   HOPE I HELPED !!|`|37b306e9f3811e8d3f057cc4f3082ef9aa	your question and statements and examples need to be clearer like do you sing the woman songs in there range or a octave lower. if you can sing the woman songs in the range they are sing it you should be able to sing the man songs in there range

When a grime song comes out thats like Nas "One Mic" or Lupe Fiasco "The Cool" then I'll start liking it.    ADD: yea I like the other ones. I only heard of a few "Grime" songs and they gave me a bad impression. What are some good songs to check out? And what is grime exactly? Would someone like N-Dubz be considered grime cuz I really like them.|`|ByVkqiSCaa	No, Americans don't.|`|nlRUP7UAaa	some do|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	Im American,  and Sway is the best rapper in the UK.

6AqFenaSaa	I think Ana will marry into the family and struggle with it - her a Barb will grow to be closer friends than her and Margene and this will make Margie jealous - she'll try to hide it. And I think Roman Grant will die in prison during the trial. Sarah will go to ASU and have the baby out of state to keep it quiet - my gut tells me they'll try to pass it off as Margene's or something. Nicki will get busted for working at the DA's and she'll prepare to testify against her father but won't have to in the end. And Don will marry again, someone young and pretty and stop focusing on his missing family. Bill will close the Weber Gaming deal and have to travel a lot, sparking a lot of fights between the wives for scheduling.    What's up with Lois trying to kill Frank? That part of the last episode seemed really disjointed and it wasn't clear whether she was sucessful or not. ??|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	I looked a few months ago to get a general idea about season 3 and came up with nothing. I know this isn't much help but I think HBO does a good job keeping the lid on things and/or it doesn't have a big enough fanbase.     I would never spoil myself for Big Love. There are too many surprises and I love it when they shock me!
GTN95TwZaa	dmn dude i i think thats one of the best poems you have ever written and you should become a poet!    if these guys are picking on you then you should take this **** into your own hands and work out.     here what my work out is:   push up  x25  x2(sets)  crunch    x25  x2   suicieds   (half a mile)  wide push up x15   x2  tight push up   x15  x2     and if you have a bar that can hold your weight   chest press(australian back lat)   x25 x2     thats what i did all last summer and it got me really pumped for the new school year and no one messed with me. all you have to do is all of these every day when you get home from school and make sure you eat right to. i'll tell you something: never let anyone pick on you because your as big as your mind lets you to be. my dad always told me that and now im on the Rugby team at my high school and no matter what do let them tell you other wise about anything. all the things i just gave you will really condition your body for anything that you do in life this right here is a work out for life that you have to keep up for at least a month untill you see results good luck!!   and i liked the poem|`|rprwurWFaa	huh?|`|0FZUwQ27aa	hate it, sucks, i hope it will get better.|`|awyNp31caa	wondertacular :D|`|gILygKvRaa	wow. that sucks. i like your poem though,|`|NGTuXvM8aa	truthfully its been hard.

RIZpDdNgaa	very interesting comparison there.  Smart guy!  Anyways, it is very possible if enough people eat a ton of it and get addicted i mean the numbers are increasing so yes its possible.|`|st2zmU88aa	No....|`|LV28Dmopaa	It's not the next-it is!|`|izMSawiCaa	In case you haven't noticed McDonalds and all fast food places have already become a the next tobacco. there are so many people overweight and at risk for being overweight but they don't care because they like their chicken nuggets.|`|ObPKPgZDaa	not for me bc i don't eat it that much. it's rare that i eat fast food. but for other ppl i would have to say Yes.|`|gILygKvRaa	umm yeah, im glad i hate it there|`|VBhPT19baa	mayb|`|gF4t4Lr4aa	Not for me!|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	well, they're just as bad, if not worse for you..but 2 things I see wrong with that ..1) there's full disclosure 2) they aren't (that we know of , lol) putting anything in their meals to make them more addictive    um...but yeah, they're horrible for you in many ways and they marke to kids...|`|nG6aRGGLaa	Yesss!!!lol!:)))))))))|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	yes|`|XB5UCW0Raa	No.|`|HsrCk2J1aa	yeahp.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i do think it was the next tobacco in terms of legislating it as a thing that should be taxed as a "sin tax" but with the fall of the economy i think it is free for now from that|`|HMc4FBxMaa	No you can't have it in a pipe|`|9dtrWO5laa	nope McDonald's is gross|`|428cDspiaa	yes cause soon we will become fat and die|`|0jQcNWITaa	Maybe so.

Give the weenies half a chance and you can kiss McD, the King, Wendy's, A&W, and Bob's Big Boy goodbye.|`|AA11518036	It sure is.|`|pbsMWtsdaa	Yes        http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|DlrZ38T0aa	lmao, yes, for some people.|`|tWzIsIH0aa	No. That's Starbucks.
rUMlDAINaa	I bet it's on the deleted scenes. I was wondering why Phyllis or Bob Vance didn't roast Michael - they had more than enough "ammunition" considering his behavior at their wedding.  I think what would have been a better roast of the employees would have been if a substitute boss had come in for a day or two and hammered all of them into busting their tails and actually working, then Michael could come back from his "personnel days" and roasted them.     Anyways, maybe Michael hadn't planned on Phyllis and them saying anything at his own roast, so he hadn't come up with those cards before-hand (those were the cards that he wrote earlier, right? That he pulled out at his own roast?).    Good episode, though - better than some others this season.|`|xshrKvIRaa	Good question....course they didn't roast him either did they? Oh Kelly did. Hmmm, I don't know. It was a funny episode tho. When Dwight wore that mask from the CPR dummy. Hahah!|`|uDXpoFlbaa	Good one! I never even wondered that! I'm not sure why he didn't. I figured he would have really laid it on Toby since he doesn't like him! And Kelly would have been an easy one to roast haha!
ahzL8uCKaa	i personally love the name and think it sounds sweet, loving, caring, feminine, pretty,|`|977dfce09b341a8f080ed1e8be1aef27aa	no it reminds me of Brooke Hogan    and all the dumb stuff she says "i don't think America need a female president" blah blah blah.|`|y92o0hkHaa	i actually hate it. But I like old names like rose, alice, anne|`|QVfOsrO4aa	kinda.|`|GnJWVuqyaa	Yes, I think it's a beautiful name.|`|Me8JEgzpaa	No, it is the name of a tiny river.

XhJuHMwQaa	I like if better on Van Halen I.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHvwC62Tu...|`|1vCoaf08aa	Demos are always awesome.    I posted a Q with Megadeth's Loved To Deth on it.    Yeah, EVH does shred there, that is what you call "classic" Van Halen.    MQ: Wasn't a polished version released on Van Halen (album)?|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Great. Love Van Halen. Eddie sounds great on this one. So does Diamond Dave. Thanks for posting that one!|`|cUjcn2lsaa	I like it! Van Halen is soooooooo underrated on R&P!

VH ROCKS!!    ???|`|9ntoGPFyaa	Surprisingly, I haven't heard this...|`|LkN5nr6faa	Everything Van Halen does is pure gold, including their pre-Van Halen I material. Sometimes demos are better than some of the actual songs bands end up putting out, in this case it's right up to par with VH.|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	Rikitiki..., as Spicoli says in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "Awesome, totally awesome!!!"  Heard it before and just love any Van Halen with "Diamond Dave" at the helm.  Btw, Eddie's just too good.  Peace out!!!|`|JyxNA1o0aa	AHHH!

I havent heard that demo before.|`|fbbb1919a6be870cfe6b62811bef94cbaa	That just made my day. It rocked me good. Thanks for sharing. Van Halen rules.
6bF4s18qaa	It's because Stephenie Meyer portrays Edward as a guy with all the qualities any girl could ever want. Handsome, mysterious, charming, well - poised, strong, loving, intelligent, gentle; yet fierce at the same time, and most importantly, sexy. We probably find him appealing because he has all the different qualities a girl could want in a man and more. I'm 18 and find him very attractive!|`|AkMZNRIzaa	Maybe the movie. Robert Patterson has something to do with it?|`|5wfUr37Eaa	he is so freaking amazing and such a good boyfriend =(except for in "new moon" but i forgive you)and so unreal its hard to ignore you just have too love him and the fact you will never have him means he is off limits so...idk i used to love him i moved on...omg start watching kyle xy he reminds me soo much of edward|`|1jGEeMDYaa	He's the "mysterious bad boy", even if we'd never really marry one, most women/girls have a thing for the bad boy type.  I know that and I've never read the book or seen the movie|`|GXVanwgPaa	because he's sexi, dangerous, charming,intreging, protective(sweet), and totally off limits! what more could u want?|`|rAawJuWcaa	idk y either to me and my friends we think that dude gay but hey girls even think the jonas brothers cute but they super gay nah mean    but hit me up on myspace my email nunez78@hotmail.com|`|GmGogzsXaa	just tell him this sentence he will understand--    HES HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WAOJLC9Yaa	well..because he's charming and kind person..even tho he's heart is frozen.  plus he does everything to keep the people he loves fine.  i love him too!|`|El570Rouaa	Well Edward is this cute kid. Of coarse girls are going to love him!! But he is also a great person who is put through difficult situation's with Bella. When we are younger, girls like to dream about there crushes and their weddings. We like their hardships that they go through just to pull put of them with their love for each other. Also we like Edward because he is this really cute guy who respects other. He lets Bella do what she wants and spoils her sometimes to. So isn't that what we want when we are that older?!  Hope this helped!!

A shot of vodka normally puts me slightly more at ease to take a nap but honestly you might do better with a sleeping pill or excerise. take a lap before you hit the bed and a hot shower and you'll be ready to become a log.|`|l6UKwzUXaa	Enough to knock you out.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	alcohol comes in measurements as small as teaspoons? huh...|`|GlP7KECoaa	idk ive nevr heard of that|`|qWicVoU9aa	437|`|j0gtbpS1aa	10 mg ambien does the trick for me.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	All lol....U will DEFINITELY sleep soundly then.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	idk...cuz i dont drink so i have noooooooooo idea what so ever.|`|xqhSoNylaa	none :D|`|fFObxgxuaa	eleventy|`|XB5UCW0Raa	its more like a shot of alcohol

But she's a WHOLE lot better than Miley and Jonas Brothers combined.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I think she's pretty, talented, and has good fashion sense.  I can't understand why people pick on her and other Disney stars.|`|luwBPdE8aa	She is gorgeous.  That's all I know.|`|cg5Ka4g2aa	butt s.l.u.t|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	shes HOT !|`|76f188939b997c72ffed710f70520cdaaa	don't care|`|BBRI3ziYaa	Good actress, nice singing voice, interesting fashion sense.|`|n7ukHgvwaa	sometimes she is pretty but sometimes her face is JACKED UP!!!|`|JfwzuyLyaa	sexy & a good actress  her songs suck tho|`|RqJaLTr5aa	bad bad actress..ok/good singer..pretty|`|tQ4yFI0saa	She is just...    just no.|`|YGMlocIVaa	well i think she's kind of cool, and better than Hanna Montana!    but i can't believe Taylor Lautner has a crush on her  =(|`|KMlmnXlBaa	She is my favorite actress!

But over all she is really cool.  My cousin wants to meet her a lot to.|`|51DrQZyeaa	Selena is a doll....  she is a real sweet heart, amazing actor, and super singer!|`|FU6Lb5vKaa	She's a pretty good actress, but her songs sound to remixed and worked on. Love her fashion style!    Peace  :-)|`|g6myJnG7aa	i think she's just  another one of the disney clones. She does seem to be a bit different than the rest but she probably just end up like miley cyrus and vanessa hudgens.|`|HIJudEeBaa	i think shes actually pretty cool.  she is a better role model and a lot prettier then miley cyrus.  she also had a funny show so yeah. i thinks shes good. =)|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Overrated like 99% of the disney stars today.     They make pop music horrible. Pop was better off without them|`|w1HbcbZuaa	shes okay but in a way the same as miley|`|KNYYSlFOaa	She's pretty (:|`|XSa8fgNIaa	I absolutely love her!!!!!

She a professed Christian, which I like, Oh and she GORGEOUS! Very talented.|`|FiMmHlnKaa	who gives a s*** all those people are stupid and ridiculous  the creators of high school musical should go suck on a cow d***|`|HGdDjjULaa	i like her alot actually. she doesn't try to be like anyone else or in my opinion a typical disney channel star ( even though she does sing now...).  she has an edgy side and is a good actress. but she has an odd shaped head...?

Miley died young, soon after but those old ones are great.|`|Jf5h5OPCaa	Ahh the roaring 20's    The music that people consider today as "jazz" tended to be played by minorities. In the 1920s, the majority of people listened to what we would call today "sweet music", with hardcore jazz categorized as "hot music" or "race music." Louis Armstrong marked the time with improvisations and endless variations on a single melody, popularizing scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables are sung or otherwise vocalized, often as part of a call-and-response interaction with other musicians on-stage. Apart from the clarinet, Sidney Bechet popularized the saxophone. Dance venues increased the demand for professional musicians and jazz adopted the 4/4 beat of dance music. Tap dancers entertained people in Vaudeville theaters, out on the streets or accompanying bands. At the end of the Roaring Twenties, Duke Ellington initiated the big band era.

Edward Cullen is so much more understanding and compassionate than Jacob.   Example:  (This is where Bella and Jacob talk about why Bella loves Edward in Eclipse)    Is that what it comes down to? Good looks?-Jacob    Don't be stupid, Jacob.-Bella    Is it the money, then?-Jacob    That's nice. I'm flattered that you think so much of me.-Bella    Aw, don't get mad. I'm serious! I'm trying to understand here, and I'm coming up blank.-Jacob    I love him. Not because he's beautiful or because he's rich. I'd much rather he weren't either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit-because he'd still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I've ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?-Bella    It's impossible to understand-Jacob    Please enlighten me, then, Jacob. What is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I'm doing it wrong.-Bella    I think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.-Jacob    Well, that just sucks! I guess I'm stuck with Mike Newton after all.-Bella    That is why I'm Edward all the way. He would give up anything for Bella(Awww, so sweet).    p.s. Team Jacward??? WTF?

A7dMPUeiaa	I won a guitar the first superfan weekend & I think I put in about 1 million points.  This time I put in about 6000 points & won a Dierks Bentley CD.  It all depends on what you are trying for, if it is something like a guitar you need big points-the more entries the better the chance of winning. I hope this helps!
f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	The Cardinal Signs: Libra, Aries, Cancer, Capricorn    Libras manipulate you into doing what they want by nagging you and making suggestions until you think that you're the one who wanted to change.    Aries manipulate you by pouting and throwing tantrums.    Cancers manipulate you by crying and using guilt trips.    Capricorns manipulate you by wearing you down.  We'll keep talking and arguing (Our favorite phrase is "But...") until you give up.    EDIT: That Girl's Not Right in the Brain    I'm not offended at all.  To a certain extent, it takes some degree of smarts to manipulate people.|`|eVt0qkT8aa	I would have to say Gemini, but I agree with Capricorn12 - she made a good point how the cardinal signs can be very manipulative.|`|D0XQrK31aa	The ones you never suspect to possess such qualities or intents, usually the emotional manipulations are the most potent :x  This doesn't narrow it down to just water signs or anything..|`|5y4uMfIvaa	virgo/scorpio/capricorn  e.g: the smartest signs      hehehe nine thumbs down here I come..|`|foISqcTFaa	GEMINIS!!!!!!|`|rnqgiRkWaa	Gemini! by far     because they can sway you with their funny easy going personality but in reality they are just 2 faced and tend to be the hypocrites of the zodiac.|`|to6JW3yFaa	I've had friends from every signle one of the signs, so from MY personal experience... I would have to say Sagittarius.    The girl that I know that's a Sagittatius always manipulates guys into falling in love with her, but is ultimately just a gold digger. Pretends that her bf's are her world and only love, but the whole time she's just going for the money. Of course... she could have just been a bad apple. :)|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Gemini duh!  We will talk you into doing  anything. I do it all the time.|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	One of the air signs. Libras don't like causing drama but we will do dirty work (if provoked) behind the scenes and watch it all unfold. Aquariouses seem to be two faced so yeah they can probably. And Gemini is the sneakiest of all. Also having two faces, they could be nice to you and decide they do not like you the next day and leave you hanging or something like that.|`|mji0CK4Raa	Well each individual zodiac sign can be manipulative in their own way. But I would definately say the top manipulators that usually can get away with it would have to be Gemini because they are so good with twiating up words...and they have a split personality so they are naturally manipulative. Another manipulator would definately be an Aquarian like myself. They are very quick-witted and are creative with controlling someone's way of thinking just by easily being persuasive. and the other to are Libras and Scorpios..! Definately Scorpios!|`|CpwG3YV4aa	Virgo, Capricorn, Aquarius|`|XdMcYDgbaa	mine|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Gemini and Cancer|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Scorpio and Cancer|`|HpWyrJKGaa	Scorpio and Sagittarius|`|d1X9zICiaa	SCORPIO!|`|0V2RsODOaa	Im very manipulative.

They're underrated, but not by us indie fans in California!! We tried to see them in San Francisco last October and they sold out so fast we missed out:(    If you haven't heard them yet, check out "Psychotic Girl" or "Things Ain't Like They Used to Be." Do it. Now. You won't regret it.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I think they're just plain under-heard of. At least within the people I hand around.

94zi1LFFaa	pisces is a very good match for cancerians.. aside from scorpio, pisces is the best for us...    Natives of Cancer are probably most in tune with those governed by Pisces, since Pisces is prone to moods just like Cancer, but of a less volatile nature. This is a couple who will find peace and harmony throughout the majority of their relationship. For the Cancer male, a partnership with an individual governed by Pisces is one where he can drown himself in the charms...which are considerable...of the Pisces partner. In short, this will be a deeply romantic pair. The love, passion and tenderness that can occur in this union is incredible and wonderful...so much so that it can appear almost unreal to outside observers. There is a mutual physical attraction here and the Cancer male will be very appreciative of Pisces' special hidden qualities. Thus, he will idolize his Pisces partner. Together, this is a couple who can tune out the world and create a dreamy love nest. Basically, this is a perfect match both emotionally and romantically...a definite soulmate connection. Indeed, each partner will find comfort in knowing that the other shares the same worries and concerns. The only potential problem is that both tend to dwell on the negative when things are not perfect and it will be necessary for someone to lighten the mood. As long as that can be accomplished, this will be a constantly smooth and magnificent pairing. For the Cancer female, a relationship with an individual governed by Pisces will provide the lavish emotional warmth that the Cancer female seeks in a partnership. The Pisces native is strongly passionate soul who, much like Cancer, dwells within a world of feelings. The affection displayed by Pisces will make the woman governed by Cancer feel completely special and totally adored. In essence, this is a perfect fit between two exceedingly deep-feeling Signs and a true soulmate love match. This couple will ooze with mutual love and devotion. Both partners here understand each other in ways that would perplex an outsider and somehow, each always knows the right thing to say when the chips are down.  http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/...    have fun!|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	yeah.

AvuwXkWkaa	Joshua Morrow has stated that SHICK will return... it's just a long and bumpy road to get there.  Fret not.  :)  We'll all just be patient (us shick fans are getting damn good at that...) and watch syphyllis hang herself in her love life and Shick reunite and make babies. :) lol|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Really??? that sucks! So Phyllis forgives him for sleeping with Sharon?!? I can't wait until Nick & Phyllis call it quits...don't like them together.|`|a4gNLvP3aa	I want Nick and Phyllis to stay together. She has been faithful to him all during their marriage. I am ready to send Sharon to the goofy farm. She will just bat those eyes and think all men will come running to her.    Remember she had the affair before Nick and Phyllis got together.|`|ZfPCgVooaa	I want Nick and Sharon together. I think when he cheated with Phyllis Sharon was to quick to let him go. Had she not done that they would still be together. Nick loves Sharon, he's just going through the motions with Phyllis. Besides, I don't like Phyllis. I think she's a nut. Look at what she did to Cricket years ago with Danny.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Oh thank the Sky's above...

I figured that they would write her in as getting knocked up after she slept with Nick. Even though Phyllis ended up with Nick from having an affair, I'm sick of Sharon. Phyllis ought to kick him to the curb.|`|ile3KJriaa	I don't know if I should be happy or sad. I am angry that Shick will sleep together AND I'm even more angry that Nick will cheat on Phyllis.(She didn't EVER once cheat on him..she was completely faithful)    I'm happy because Shick will not get back together but Nick cheating on Phyllis gets me more mad!     My  question: You said that "Nick and Phyllis mend their relationship together" Do they mend it after Phyllis finds out he cheated on her AGAIN (and this time it was all the way) or do they mend it with her not knowing or knowing but not revealing to Nick that she knows?(She's done that before...)     She better give Nick a mouthful! Nick better  apologize and fight for Phyllis!!!!!!|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	Hi hun, i read the spoilers and it does not say anything about Sharon and Nick splitting at all, it says that they do hit the sheets and have an affair, and in fact get back together, so unless u read somewhere else, pls post links on where exactly u read that Sharon finds a new love interest, b.c on what i read only speaks about Nick and Sharon's fling!|`|tEqcmCv3aa	I hope that Phyllis finds out and beats the crap out of both of them.  Of course Sharon will turn her romantic attentions in a new direction. I mean really, how many times did she cheat on Nick?  Phyllis deserves better...

5Wgsi9kXaa	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's over. I think the reason so many people are unsure is because it never really ended, and they just kind of moved on. That's probably why they are doing iCarly now. The show was popular enough too continue, but I guess they thought it was smarter to not. I think the reason there is so many re-runs still is because it is still popular. The last season ended in 2007 I think, although there was also that movie they made just last year. I guess there could be more movies, but unfortunately, it seems very unlikely that they are going to continue with the show after this long.|`|rdUMY2h8aa	I think I heard somewhere, a while ago, that it was over|`|8aFOSlHWaa	im not sure because the last episode they did was that Christmas special,so i dont know|`|aBqJhdufaa	Sure|`|LQqAzHbVaa	God I hope so....|`|EECePKs6aa	yea i think there over....:(|`|HfamMJIqaa	the show isnt making anymore episodes but im sure they'll make another movie, like Merry Christmas Drake and Josh or something|`|mH26I4f2aa	yup|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	yea i think so  answer my questions!|`|TRUgtW8oaa	that show was gay anyways|`|2SmgLIfVaa	hopefully|`|aeODdMATaa	Yea its over, its too bad because I really liked the show.|`|k2ZKQuyGaa	yes because miranda has a new show: iCarly|`|CAgVycs4aa	i think so because they are in bigger movies now and miranda cosgrove has her own show now.

It'll take time but it's a good thing in the long run.|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	You need to love yourself first before other people can love you. How can you love other if you don't even love yourself?    It's important to love oneself in order to be a good person and do good things. The future would be brighter if you love yourself first.

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Genre identification also depends upon the type of rhythm being used, as well as how the melody is interpreted, and to some extent the instrumentation.  One fairly good sound source of different styles would be the rhythm section of quality personal keyboards.  Each rhythm has a name which usually indicates the style, although of course each style will have several rhythms associated with it.

7LJ2Tx2Yaa	Seriously, does everyone not look at the questions already posed.  I have seen and answered this question about 10 time now.      But, Anna is the killer.  When she was in the asylum, that crazy girl told her stories about killing the children.      Anna was doing fine and went home.  This is were I am a little fuzzy, but I think this option is correct.    She was fine until she saw her dad with the nurse.  Then her mind went nuts and she began seeing things that made it look like the nurse killing people.  But in fact, it was her the whole time.      Or, and i am not too sold on this thought, she was still crazy before leaving and decided to finish what she had started.  But this does not fully sit right with me.

You just go to http://www.ovguide.com/ and search for whatever movie or tv show you want to watch. OVG then gives you a list of search results that are places you can watch that title for Free online. Take you pick and then OVG links you directly to the video.. its pretty awesome.

chlGzFQlaa	Damn, I wish I had friends that listen to Sigur Ros or any other types of experimental music for that matter.    Sigur Ros is more ambient, harmonic (except their last album), something you could listen to just to soothe you down. The vocals are heavenly, I swear that guy sounds like a f*cking angel! lolz. You never really have to understand their vocals, you just sort of get the emotions their songs emit.     Coldplay is definitely more mainstream, aimed at the masses, more accessible. They have soothing music too most of the time... I don't know, there's nothing much I can say about coldplay, sure they're one of the better bands of this generation's mainstream music, but I can't really find anything that stands out extraordinarily, something that'll make coldplay immortal. Sigur Ros will always be unique to those who listen to them, whereas I feel that Coldplay will die out to the memory of their listeners....just my opinion.     Edit: I first got hooked onto the band once I had heard Saeglopur on this Prince of Persia ad. I have the whole Agaetis Byrun album, and I'm going to buy Takk and () over the weekend perhaps.    Whoa, you listen to Bon Iver too? Just saw your contact name! Have you got their Blood Bank EP,  it's so f8cking epic!!!! Not as good as Emma though, but it was just an EP, I bet their next album will outdo their first.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	Hey, bon iver is one of my favoritesss.|`|6xHOa3tJaa	no no cold play rocks|`|eGPZpfr5aa	well coldplay consists of fags so I'll say sigur ros|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Sigur Ros.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I'm not a huge Sigur Ros fan at all, Sigur Ros is far superior to Coldplay. Coldplay is just boring and I don't think anyone in the band is very talented. They occasionally pull out a decent (catchy) song but that's about it. There's nothing special or great about them. Sigur Ros at least has some talent, consistently decent songwriting (not every song sounds the same), and well, I guess I just think they're the much better band. Of course, I'm a Radiohead fan and Radiohead fans tend to like Sigur Ros - what else can I say.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Sigur Ros by far. Coldplay is mediocre and unoriginal.|`|bnm9BfxDaa	both are untalented. coldplays "viva la vida" was proven to be a rip off from another artist, they are unoriginal. 100%|`|jt4PVBKkaa	I only know cold play       send a video of that other band|`|aBqJhdufaa	Coldplay is better.  Clocks was so original!|`|58WCrqe1aa	I'm glad you prefer Sigur Ros, but wtf? Why in God's name would you compare them in the first place? Someone needs to put a bullet between Chris Martin's eyes the friggin' flee!    Coldplay are mellow and boring, where as SR are mellow yet relaxing, and sometimes depressing. But at least they stir an emotion that isn't rage (because Coldplay are so ****).|`|kchqZjeuaa	coldplay because i have never heard of the other one till i clicked on the website and it was just weird i only listened to like 1 min of it|`|1TRlzSsYaa	I just clicked on that link and the song absolutely disgust me. Coldplay is on one my favorite bands. The lyrics are nice and the sound is always great. Besides, they're videos are SO COOL!!! And they may be considered "soft alternative", but it's more rocky on "Yellow" and "Violet Hill", among others.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	This comparison really amused me. "Better" is a completely subjective term, so  will avoid it and rephrase: I prefer Sigur Rs here, and by a *monumental* landslide. Sigur Rs and Coldplay are, imo, completely incomparable. One is mainstream britpop and the other has ranged from post-rock to shoegazing to their own highly, highly unique sound. I know many people have begun discovering them via that video game and have taken "Saeglopur" to define their sound. Takk... (the album which said song comes from) is a more different album than their earlier work. If you are familiar with their earlier work, I think the musical distinction between them and Coldplay would be extremely obvious.   Coldplay:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4w7an00v...  Sigur Rs  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5SHiXSRa...  Sigur Rs and Coldplay have very, very little in common. "Better", again, is going to depend upon one's musical taste, and I wouldn't think less of a person if they preferred Coldplay over my favorite band. I would say, however, that the two are quite incomparable and that I *overwhelming* prefer Sigur Rs.|`|V4PMErjyaa	I like Coldplay, they're one of my favorite bands!    answer mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|5eGs0wKPaa	i like coldplay better they have a more relatable lyric system than sigur ros...no offense sigur ros fans i like them too!|`|YFx8N0wjaa	Coldplay|`|ucQxe2e4aa	SIGUR ROS. seriously?? emotion is dead in every coldplay song, sigur ros is ALL HEART.  nothing technical about that.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmQuIsDnQ...|`|NKE6Apz9aa	my dad listens to coldplay and sigur ros alot. coldplay is more popular but sigur ros is so different and i like different kinds of music. over all i think i like both.  sigur ros has great music videos!|`|7lCJsp0naa	Coldplay receives too much recognition and credit for making boring and untalented music. So I pick Sigur Ros. Does Chris Martin know how to play guitar with a violin bow?|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Sigur Ros.    Coldplay are mediocre, boring and steal their music (though I don't mind their last and first album)    Sigur Ros is in my top 10 favorite bands of all time, they create rich ambient soundscapes, they have a sound unlike anyone else, and their music makes you relax and takes you another place, the singer gives me orgasms.      Yea, I know what I said..|`|YCdYz83zaa	First album of Coldplay was the best i have to say but out of the two, which band is better...Sigur Ros wins.|`|ENkFZhlraa	Sigur Rs and Coldplay are my two favorite bands. I've thought about this before and I simply can't choose between them.

YXGsKS1Qaa	something you forgot???    I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you  I'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)  The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)    [Lil' Wayne]  Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too  ***** feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe  Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through  God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to  be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me  Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney  I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands  Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much  but I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up  but everybody **** up, now this other ***** lucked up  Tellin' me and my clique don't give a ****  Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia  She was my down chick, I was her soldier  I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder  You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!    [Chorus] (Lil' Wayne)  You've been hiding, never letting it show  Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)  You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)  but there is something you forgot    [Lil' Wayne]  You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring  I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing  I remember the love, right after the fights  You can't tell me you don't remember those nights  and if I would cry, then you would cry twice  To me you are the brightest star under sunlight  See take away my title, take away my stripes  You give me back my girl and you give me back my life  Give me back my girl and you give me back my life  See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice  Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight  I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back  What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)    [Chorus] (Lil' Wayne)  You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show  Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)  to keep it under control (but I know you know)  You got it down (I know you do)  and your well on your way to the top  (but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)    [Verse 3:]  But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center  You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver  You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered  and your boyfriend is not like me  Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me  I remember we would sit at home all day  You called me "Butta", I called you "Babe"  My momma asked about you, my partners did too  I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you  and I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me  and let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with  No engagement can amount to your friendship  and I hope that ***** know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!    [Chorus]  I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you  I'm pretending, and that's all I can do  The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart|`|evFXsDvdaa	Your probably thinking of "why must i cry" by Rehdogg.

cQAULrHaaa	The actual occurrence is that once Anna had come home, she had seen Rachel & her father having sex. She becomes angry & try to burn down the house. But her sister & mother are killed in the fire. It is also revealed that Rachel was not evil & everything was the doing of Anna due to her mental instability.    Anna was not seeing anything actually. What she was seeing was an imagination of her mind.    The woman with Anna in the Hospital at the beginning was "Mildred Kemp" the nanny who killed 3 children. There is no clear answer for the 2nd question.|`|jwtRYXH0aa	I recomended visit Capitancinema -^-`com and enjoy full movies online,new releases added everydays..just enter site in English And Join!!|`|8b140fWJaa	1. Anna was imagining her sister because she forgot what happened that night remember in the begining she is talking to her therapist and she said "why can't i remeber anything?"    2. Because she didn't remember anything from the night. I also think she was sckitafrenic or however you spell it. And i was a little confused about some stuff so idk if im right.

Have a nice day!|`|ntj9WfzYaa	He might be doing that to show you that he only likes you as a friend without having to say it.  Because water signs are usually a lot more sensitive to people's feelings.  ESPECIALLY when we're into someone.  So, simple answer, he's just not that into you.|`|dmxnblomaa	Well speaking frrom experience and all, I am a leo also the average ,man can not handle us. By the way if he is insulting you and direspecting with textin other girls, yeah let him go, you can find someone else, and think about it there is a time and a place for everything. He needs to respect you point blank. I am sure you respect him. Think about it. Do u !!! And do it well Miss leo. I gaurantee he will have to think twice when your gone. By you being a leo it makes you way stronger than most you don't have to put up with it. In the end it's all up to you. I don't why us leo women, always fall for buttheads, not saying he is a butthead, but leo women usually don't have the best judgement in men. Cause we get wrapped up so easily. Stay strong! Look at Jennifer Lopez, Halle Berry, Whitney Houston, Madonna, we fall in love with the wrong men, and try to hold on. Then it ends up blowing up in our face.|`|BulOiEr3aa	i'm also a leo girl and horoscopes say that we don't tend to get along well with pisces. try finding an gemini, sagittarius, libra or aries|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Don't take his crap anymore.
yJd1WwF2aa	A friend of my mom's took his son to one and it was forever!     First they go into a big place, usually a football stadium and there are these people there{idk who they are} who say either yes or no. If you get a yes you come back the next day and they put you in groups of like 4 or5 out of the group you're in the people listen to you all only 2 or 3 get through. They come back the and preform for the producers {at the time Nigel and Ken} if you get past them you come back to see Simon Paula and Randy.    And unlike the show that shows it all in 1 day, it's was like a 2 week thing|`|f6IzDB2eaa	they go through a first set of judges which you never hear of. if those first judges think you are really good or really funny then they let you through. Less than half the people make it through. Thats why some terrible people make it on the show, they sing bad on purpose so they can get in.  That also makes the show funnier. It would take a very long time for everyone to go through, so they have to have a first set of judges. Hope this helped|`|aihogb26aa	On Day One, everyone gets ushered in front of a set of producers with about 3 other contestants at a time and get to sing for only about 10-15 seconds. If they get past that day, they come back a second day where they again go in front of producers and eventually the exec producers, but they get more time to audition this time.  The 100-200 people who get past that day return several days or even weeks later to perform in front of Randy, Simon, Paula and Kara. It all takes place over several weeks, rather than just the 2 days that they portray on American Idol.

Also, listen to an oldies radio station...a lot of cities have at least one oldies radio station...and for the songs you like, pay attention to the disc jockey giving the name of performer and song, and use that in your 50's production.  Good Luck in the competition.
RluCMVUSaa	All the time!!    Fried Oysters for me, I hear they heighten the salad tossing experience!    Edit: Yes Ted, would you get me started with a carrot stick?|`|ba4R1tf1aa	The answer is 47.|`|6U9b2t4raa	Some of my dates when I was younger used to ask me if I would like to finish their salad..but some had nasty white creamy ranch dressing like stuff on it, and some tasted like oil & vinegar.   Some even had cheese on it.  Very disturbing.  I just like plain salad with a little oil on it.       Oysters..

cQAULrHaaa	For the first time in the movie the pearls are mentioned when Rachel(her mother's former nurse & who is now dating Anna's father) shows Anna her pearls, saying they were a gift from one of her patients.    The second time the pearls are showed is In a picture Anna where sees the mother of the 3 children who were killed by their nanny  wearing a pearl necklace just like Rachel's.    Anna & her sister Alex  try to get to the pearls as evidence for a case against Rachel thinking she is Mildred Kemp the nanny who killed the 3 children. A struggle ensues between Anna and Rachel, but Anna manages to get the pearls.     The actual occurrence is that once Anna had come home, she had seen Rachel & her father having sex. She becomes angry & try to burn down the house. But her sister & mother are killed in the fire. It is also revealed that Rachel was not evil & everything was the doing of Anna due to her mental instability.    The pearls have no great importance as it is an imagination of Anna.    It is also revealed that the woman with Anna in the Hospital at the beginning was "Mildred Kemp."|`|7LJ2Tx2Yaa	I assume they are fake also.  She is manufacturing what she wants to see with her twisted mind.  The stories her crazy friend at the asylum told her are getting mixed into the reality around her.    That is what I got out of it.    I also did not really like the film.|`|8b140fWJaa	at the end when midrel kemp has them in her pocket she is the one that killed those three kids and thats why she is even in there. and Anna imagined Rachel having them because she was also crazy and didn't like her because she was having sex with her dad.

82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Lamb of God's my favorite band right now. Lol    Ashes of the Wake or Sacrament.   Sacrament, I think Blythe's vocal's are a lot better and have more range. Ashes of the Wake has a lot of awesome tracks.    New American Gospel and Burning The Palaces are both good albums, but to start I'd go with Sacrament or Ashes of The Wake.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Start with "Sacrament" and go from there. The thing I love about that album is that the "popular" single from it is one of the worst on the album.    The standout track for me is "Foot To The Throat".|`|uyvedpH2aa	Sacrament. I have Ashes too. Also, look for the new album, "Wrath"? I think. It's out this month. Should be good.
qmi4Az4Haa	Franklyn by Paramore|`|SEfBwYiOaa	john frusciante has some pretty awesome backing lines if you listen carefully (for the red hot chili peppers).    also his solo stuff has pretty cool backing singing to it, however im pretty sure its something of a rarity to be able to sing anything like him (you hopefully will be able to pull it off though)    Newton faulkner 'all that you be feeling' is simple but catchy as well, not sure what album its from though    and dreaming of you by the coral gets a lot of people going!!     not sure thats what sort of stuff you meant but hope you have fun .......

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	I also play keyboards by ear, and I found that learning some of the theory helped me to hear and identify the accompaniment chords and the chord progressions much better.  Scales are good so you can play in different keys, chords are good for the right sound to the accompaniment - major, minor, major 7th, diminished, augmented 5th, etc.  You need a combination of the theory (the words and music notation) and the sound (play the notes/chords and practice identifying them in music).|`|n5FNbQRNaa	If you have no intention in learning about "music theory," then why are you learning about scales?|`|Vh62DLxvaa	Keith Snell has a great set of books called The Fundamentals of Piano Theory. maybe you could get some of them and just skim over them.

I think you are being stereotypical aside from being ignorant.

eLtE3aWxaa	Hi there...!!!  Well when i first heard the idea of including manga in the anime, I was excited and really looking forward to it. Now that I watched the trailer...it really turned me down. It is not up to my expectations, or may be i expected a lot.   Animation, as you said, is poor as compared to 1st series. Ed looked like Ed, Al looked like Al, but Roy looked... um... weird. The 1st series Roy looks definitely cute and much more handsome than the new one. They look more like the ones in the manga.   And i m against the idea of EdWin, nothing personal though. Its just because this was the first ever anime I saw in which the main storyline did not have anything to do with love story, unlike other animes, where most of the story mainly characterized love, romance,attraction etc etc. I hope the story remains as pure as the 1st series. I have no personal choice on any pairs...(...um...maybe Winry and Russell XP...just kidding..I know that's not possible).  Since it is following original manga, it may be fun to watch for people who didn't read manga, because story-wise manga was better than series. But it really shouldn't at all follow the manga to the 'T', that's what i think.  So, in short, the FMA season 2 trailer was a real bummer for me. But i m still looking forward to it.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	lol, we all love our fanbase couples. You love your yaoi couple and I love my own. I love Roy/Hughes. Roy/Ed is cool though. :)    Well, I'm looking forward to the new FMA coming in April. I collected the manga, and I have the movie.    As for the animation, its so new and I'm sad that it won't look as good as the other FMA anime. But, its a matter of adjusting to it.    And, I'm going to be sad to not see Wrath and Slouth (Ed's mom). And, I'm going to be happy to see the Easterners appearing in the new anime. East! finally!

zy5qcc0Raa	Jane's almost a definate, and for Alec, they're considering Harry Potter's  Tom Felton,  HSM's Lucas Grabeel, Willy Wonka's Freddie Highmore, and  Hannibal Rising's Gaspard Ulliel.|`|DC9iuGqbaa	vanessa anne hudgens and brenda song were rumored to audition for leah clearwater...but they turned out being fake, dakota is not 100% jane....and i personally think she should NOT play jane    as for alec, there has been no other rumors|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	On a slightly different note (because Alec has not been cast yet) - have you seen how much muscle Taylor Lautner has gained to play Jacob in New Moon? He's trying to gain 30 lbs of pure muscle (he's at about 20 now). That cannot be good for a 16 year-old's body!
aeODdMATaa	I really doubt that he's gay.|`|fTHE2OoQaa	idk but the whole movie is GAY..... i hate high school musical!!!!|`|e90oXWlzaa	hell yea just look at him for petes sake god...imagine your in a dark alley and he comes up to you and askin you to go to his house...... he is a freak man god he scares the crap out of me he is a FAG ....just like bill kaulitz ..YES he is also a fag/wierdo|`|MeGazyy7aa	They are all gay. End of story.|`|eGPZpfr5aa	yes and they are all gay!|`|cR1M8ALyaa	Yes!|`|UjG8FqLUaa	YEAH, THEY`RE ALL GAY! DUHH;|`|DkaaG9j3aa	Yes, he came out of the closet over a year ago. He is gay|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	i'm pretty sure.  i mean. have you seen him? haha|`|02lXYAOPaa	Duh!|`|BOQxPnjCaa	no hes not.  its disney channel  theyll get dued for  promoting gays   or sex or drugs  hes like that   cuase his act  is suposed to be  of a broadway  white boy who rich  && lives for performing|`|WKdhUG1gaa	i doubt it .  they just make him seem gay|`|hHI0Vktxaa	I was going to say "yes, they are all gay" but then scrolled down and noticed several other answers questioning the sexuality of the cast, so I will just answer with....    I don't know.|`|9Ev7PdZGaa	haha yeah.    that doesnt mean all boys who act are gay, its just he looks AND acts gay all the time.|`|tbZacLA8aa	yes|`|SSvRfxhaaa	thats a retarded question|`|A3RY3EBQaa	no he's not!! believe me..
iuz0B6sBaa	I think that was Fallen, a servant of unicron.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i thought it looked good. the robot was THE FALLEN    hence the title: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN.
28ZCfGWIaa	I thought it was an interesting concept and I thought the cast was good. I think MNS could have definitely gotten more indepth in the story line and thickened the plot a bit.|`|b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	I gave it a 0.5/10 and it is currently ranked last on my 2008 films list.  Mark Wahlberg was terrible in it, but I blame that more on M. Night than anything else, because it was quite obvious that he was acting like that and its the directors job to direct his actors.  One of my main problems with it is that it took itself so seriously and was absolutely dreadful.|`|4EflpUK8aa	I thought it was great. People who don't like it are uncultured swine.      ...and cue the thumbs down...    haha.|`|8b140fWJaa	what pissed me off, is that everyone was expecting to be scary, but it freakin wasn't M. Night Shyamalan is not a scary movie creator.     and everyone that is was such a political statement. and i don't think is was. i really loved the movie. mark whalberg is always incredible. :DD    and how was is weird? it wasn't at all!
BuJClF3Faa	It's always illegal if you haven't paid the owners of the rights for it.|`|QOYIpbeHaa	it's not illegal bc there is a time limit to how much of a movie you can watch.  then you can pay the price for monthly, yearly, or lifetime.  and it still is a website.  i watch movies on there all the time.|`|hWNAyvTDaa	yes watch movies.net illegal because it is bootleg. that means people go to the movie theaters and record the movie and put it on dvd[blank disk] or on websites for free. If You watching a movie that currently came out and u have not payed to see it it is iillegal|`|KHptWL2Taa	its not and for everyone who is wondering what happened heres the new link  watch-movies-links.net|`|sALPielpaa	Watch-movies.net is not illegal because they don't share any files. All they do is provide links as to where people can watch the (illegally uploaded) files. So, all watch-movies does is provide links.   Apparently they were blocked to North American ISP addresses so we couldn't access it and therefore watch illegal movies. They didn't do anything wrong, and the site still exists, just not accessible in the U.S.  Use http://www.flixplore.com now for free online movies.|`|YUjVFkocaa	Technically, yes.      Everybody does it, nobody cares if you do, and hardly anybody ever gets caught... but technically it is illegal.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	its not illegal, but that is no longer a website :-( sad story! I loved that website.|`|DC9iuGqbaa	i go on, and i dont think its illegal...but the movies ARE a little blurry..of course, but that might not mean anything|`|PVmm28G9aa	Well, I watch movies there and I certainly don't download stuff from that site either. But the same thing happens to me too. I just wanted to check a few movies out and the page won't open.   One thing I "think" is illegal is uploading the movies. But in a way, maybe watching and uploading is both illegal because it could be piracy. Another thing to add on, is that watch-movies.net get their movies from other sites too (just to let you know).  Hope I've helped.|`|AA11008280	Yeah.. I think it was deleted. Since the site hasnt been working for like a week.  But, I dont think its illegal. In which case I dont care I would just watch the movies there. Its a really good site, or at least WAS!    To answer your question correctly .. in my opinion ..  YES it is illegal. Maybe thats why it was put down in the first place.

NgtIBEG8aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4op2Ia4...  Ok watch the preview here of the season. It shows a bunch of girls in the pool when DeAnna appears on the balcony, including shannon, lauren, nikki, and that blonde haired girl (all who are now gone). It shows shannon saying something like "I couldn't stand seeing you with DeAnna, I cried. Im hanging on by a thread" So it had to have happened earlier in the season when they were all there, but now they are gonna. I  hope ABC isnt gonna be a jerk and not air that juicy footage, because that is what EVERYONE is waiting for! Hopefully there is just some good editing there to make everyone believe it happens earlier in the season and it is still to come, but by the looks of it they arent going to air that footage :(|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	The season started out as any other season. I think its down to the final 10 or less. Deanna has not shown up yet but tonight I think she does. But at the end of the first episode it showed her telling Jason how she made a mistake and wants to have another chance.    Personally I really liked her last season but I don't think that its right for her to butt in in the middle of the season. It's probably producers though. I know that you haven't seen any episodes yet but I think that Melissa is the best fit for Jason!    you can watch episodes online at abc.com. or just google "the bachelor"|`|6CAsx3jaaa	the good news for you is that you can watch those shows at abc.com. the previews have really been giving away the story and i think the fact that you see him crying means he told her no. whatever happens jason is lucky to have so many great girls to choose from
cSceVisnaa	youtube it|`|fna0OfuCaa	Go to http://www.youtube.com and type in tom delonge a lot of videos should come up :)|`|0XZNZDlmaa	no idea
uhHfm3Azaa	probably the language barrier|`|nM1DMsNFaa	Because that is the first thing they listened to and they liked it so they stuck with it. Maybe they don't know about music from other countries because someone hasn't introduced them to it yet.|`|kiWPbDQ5aa	its just normal to listen to the music that you grew up hearing. but its also nice to hear different things i looove amr diab and i dont speak arabic.... yet :D  and samo zaen is great to :)

2092c0a75d0ea252b54e233bc7d45e53aa	I'm totally agree with you, but don't pay attention to the haters. Don't worry about them, because it's their opinion,even if it's wrong, you know what is true, i mean, the jobros aren't stupid or gay.  I hope the haters live their life in peace >.    BYE !   =)|`|GilxwZ2Haa	They say they are gay even though they know it's not true and can't think of anything else to say. Not everyone will like them, and unfortunately those who don't are really rude. The Jonas Brothers have fans who really like them, and they know it. They are still really popular and have a lot of fans, and the negativity doesn't change things, so just try to ignore it and keep loving them    :)|`|vSTtAfOWaa	I  most certainly DO NOT hate the Jonas Brothers. I don't enjoy their music. I think Kevin Jonas is a tad bit weird but I do not hate the people. I'm sure they are very nice. I like the idea that they are going to wait in till they are married to be sexually active. They seem like very, very, very nice guys. I'm not really a fan though.  And I think people who can't stop talking about how much they hate the Disney stars need to go get a life. Some of them are nice people.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	wow, you actually sound like you know them on a personal level.   what? are you going to cry because people don't like them?|`|houWY7qvaa	I've seen them on tv and have never heard their music.    If someone is really good, a day does not go by that they are not on the news or some other show.  It's okay to like them or any other music group you choose.  I think it is a generation gap of sorts.  Some of us are a little too old for the new teen oriented groups.  I think I would reserve any criticism until I at least heard something they recorded|`|mzIgLo0vaa	i dont listen to teeny boppers, but they are cute and talented...i guess|`|duN63EkIaa	Bahahhaa. I just laugh at people that think they're gay. Because really, they do in fact look gay sometimes. I wouldn't let it get to you. The Jonas Brothers could care less. They're still successful and always will be. Words can't touch them. Haters are awesome. You have to learn to have a sense of humor every once in awhile. I make fun of them, hell, I'm probably considered a hater to. But I make fun of the people I adore. There's no point in trying to defend them, you know what they are. You shouldn't have to prove it to anyone else.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	L0L W0W; Y0U SWEAR LIKE THE J0NAS BR0THERS KN0W Y0U, LET AL0NE GIVE A **** AB0UT Y0U 0R WH0 Y0U ARE.

(4*************)they have been compared to The Beatles and Rolling Stones. Ask your self how stupid that sounds. People are comparing them to LEGENDS that brought music to the next level, from flutes to GUITARS.    tell me -  what major influence have the Jonas Brothers been to music?    i dont hate them personally, cuz i dont know them. It doesnt matter to me if they are gay or not ... whats wrong with gay people?    i hate them as artists because honeslty i dont think they should be as big and popular as they are. they havent done anything substantial for music.|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	People don't like the fans who throw them in our face every other yahoo! answers question when all they have to do is use a search bar.|`|hHI0Vktxaa	Horrible music, Gay looking (tight pants, longer "fagggy" hair) and I think that about covers it.|`|CIZX6PyQaa	I used to be a huge JB fan when they were a small band from New Jersey. Their fans are seriously... insane! They are seriously overrated.|`|AA11431665	I love them |`|ThdFMIFUaa	I like them. They have good music.|`|8b140fWJaa	alright, they unfortunately got into the scene of disney channel and eight year old fans. but like joe jonas is gorgeous and the only song i like is love bug. me and my friends aren't fans of really mainstream things. and they just are WAY WAY too mainstream.|`|VW9fVQouaa	well hmm idk i dont like the jonas bros because i just think they are annoying but thats just my opinion hehe but i like mindless self indulgence and see other people may think otherwise they may think msi sux but anyways opinions opinions opinions!|`|dejqLjaLaa	i lovelovelove them:)|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	jonas brothers are on the same level of miley cyrus and all of the other ridiculous disney stars that HAVE NO TALENT    i have actually listened to their music, and there is nothing appealing at all.     i apologize that i would rather listen to stuff with a little more substance.     and god bless you for the jonas brothers being your favorite band. let me help you out a lil...    NIRVANA, lynyrd skynyrd, the white stripes, the allman brothers, pearl jam, radiohead, STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN, john mayer, amos lee, jimi hendrix, bob dylan, THE BEATLES|`|GnJWVuqyaa	Well, I don't hate them. I look at them from a different point of view. I think of them as a 6-10 year old band, like Hannah Montana. I like music by artists who are a bit more adult oriented.|`|BBRI3ziYaa	I don't hate the Jonas Brothers.   I dislike their music. I think that they're overrated. I think that they are a bunch of pretty boys, but I don't hate them.  The word hate implies passion or intensity. I cannot have passionate or intense feelings about somebody I have never met.

a9vbJeOzaa	Virgos tend to over analyze everything and are too critical of people.  A lot of times, they tend to over expect things from a person and that person will usually fall short of their expectation.  As a Virgo, you will be disappointed and probably hold a grudge against the person.  Virgos are perfectionist by nature, but you have to remember that people aren't always perfect in your Virgo vision.  Don't expect that if the Capricorn talks to you on a regular basis, then he likes definitely likes you.  Capricorns just don't let out their feelings easily, especially to people who they don't trust.  They tend to keep everything inside, rather than expressing their feelings to someone.  Maybe he just wanted to stay friends and didn't want to hurt your feelings.  But it looks like you dug yourself a bigger hole by ignoring him.  A Capricorn will hold the longest grudges and won't give second chances too easily.  Once they decide that you are not worth their time, then you don't even exist to them anymore.  Yes, Capricorns can be cold. but Virgos can be harsh!|`|Pew3CdCjaa	hey girl...   this is cap lady... but i can understand why he does these things  Capricorn has a idea like "give and take"  once people nice to us or royal to us then we will do same way.  but if you stop talking to him then he is same way as well.  I know cap is weird.. but that's who we are....  Don't be too frustrated. once you are virgo, cap is interested in you as well... we are very freakish compatible. seriously!  so just be patient and if you see him, say hello like normal people.  or Talk to him how you think because virgo tend to not to speak but for cap, we love to communicate each other whether you believe it or not.    cheer up and you are virgo(if he is cap then you know what I mean).. so don't worry and study hard and show him you are very smart and serious about your career stuff... he would love that|`|AA10315175	He has his options open and you got mad at him and didn't talk to him so he took it as ok if you don't want to talk to me then I won't talk to you either. He does fill comfortable around you anymore. You started it by taken it so seriously to the point were you stop talking to him. you should have respect his opinion and keep talking to him from the beginning.

4VEIbUWjaa	OMG! I love horror films, but they are terrible. I am an aspiring film maker myself so I understand.  Make sure you don't have too much music. Natural sounds are so much creepier when a person is walking around in the woods or in their house. And when the "Bad guy" does come out, don't bother to make that Noise all horror movies make when something jumps out. That's when you want to start the music. Having a constant "scary HUM" is bad too. If you watch most of these horror movies you'll here it and it doesn't make it anymore scarier. Maybe some old school music that isn't that creepy but would be if you have a killer on the screen.     Another thing, you shouldn't have is nudity. That's a mistake I see countless of filmmakers make, cause it's like they want to pull the viewers in, and since their story line isn't doing it, some **** on the screen will. I mean if that's the direction  your film is going then so be it,but I wouldn't recommend it.    Sit down with the people doing the film and try to think of different ways to scare people. Don't do the typical, there's something behind the refrigerator door when I close it. Or the mirror/reflection thing. Or some silhouette walking across the front of the screen.  Those are lame and played out. Watch 28 days later, or The Strangers. I mean even if you don't like those movies, watch just how they direct them and how they use their music. They are perfect examples.     Books? I'm not sure. I mean I don't really read horror books. The last one I read that somewhat was a horror was I am Legend. I has a lot of suspense and was nothing like the movie. That's a great read.     I know I'm "talking" your ear off but if you do only pick one of my idea's, PLEASE choose the music. Horrors with little music are the BEST horrors ever.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	books by ray bradbury,steven king,tales by edgar allen poe,john gresham,anne rice...  tips good music,don't give awy the story at the begining,use good names,and the females in the movie.. please let them have some brain..|`|tLI94qWNaa	Some good horror films are any of the classics such as the exorcist, friday the thirteenth, halloween, etc..     Some newer horror movies I recommend are   The descent   The ring   Jeepers creepers   The strangers   The exorcism of emily rose   The grudge   Shutter     Any books by steven king are great books.|`|AA11008280	What kind of horror film?  Vampires, monsters, serial killer, supernatural??    Humm..  Why dont you get some inspiration from other horror flicks?    e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hor...    In books I truly recomend the author Stephen King ( he's a genious when it comes to horror) =]   Have you seen "The Mist" or "The Shinning" .. well the "Shinning" wasnt that scary but hes still a genious.    ALSO, In my opinion the worst horror of all is "Phsycological Horror"     read more about it in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologic...    Whew!  it was a long pargrapg, but hope I helped.|`|fc44938890cde1403e34c717ab97b938aa	I recommend watching a couple of old horror movies (House on Haunted Hill, Dementia 13, Frankenstein, etc.) and comparing them to the newer horror films (Stephen King is good.) to really understand what makes a horror film... well, horrific. Here's a little insight into what they're generally about.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film    Oh, and here's something just to give you a smile.    http://nac.tamu.edu/x075bb/survival.html
oCUk64enaa	Lol. No...I mean seriously WTF ?!?!  If I look deep into my heart it will give me the answer?  Since when is my heart like a magic 8 ball or something?  I mean I'm not a biology genius or anything but I think that if I could seriously look into my heart I would see a bunch of tissue or something like that....|`|97oxJ0B8aa	It depends on the heart.  I think the answer for everyone is yes at least at first.  But then the things some people do to their hearts over time can leave no truth there to find.|`|AA10471659	Some times you could,but not all the time.|`|y6406A92aa	Nope..|`|l1pewZpaaa	I've tried that and unfortunately it's never the right answer!|`|hQn84sigaa	That sounds really cliche. But anyways, it's impossible to "look deep into your heart", or maybe I am just a very un-deep person with no perspective.|`|afikdpZoaa	You will find the answer, but you may not like it.  That's why most people don't really look.|`|YY5kGrwCaa	i guess|`|wdk3Ke6qaa	Nah otherwise I wouldn't be on this site.|`|5ApgSjriaa	No.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	any time a person looks deep within their very soul they will find the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth ... you can never ever lie to yourself ...... you only see what is meant to be .......|`|H1YaVLqwaa	not at all .|`|gF4t4Lr4aa	That guy called me a retard on my question too, so ignore him.  But anyways, i think if you listen to your gut the answer is there; for example awhile back my gut told me my bestfriend and boyfriend had something going on..but i never followed it through; if i would of..i would of had the thrill in dumping him and knowing everything before everyone else knew everything!|`|9NniKJcEaa	No not my heart in my brain yes.lol.|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	maybe you'll find it on google.    NO!  scratch that.    maybe you'll find it on http://www.goodsearch.com    *i goodsearch for friends of TOMS (TOMS shoes)... who do YOU goodsearch for?*|`|y3op8rr1aa	i do believe that:)|`|FEdixswzaa	I looked deep in my heart for the answer to this question. It's "cottage cheese."|`|jCUiWihtaa	no|`|J5jI6VDvaa	That made NO sense.|`|OnAoyAZFaa	no    that sounds like something from a crappy chick-flick|`|puVdvis2aa	well, the meaning of the saying "look deep into your heart for the answer" means do what you believe is right... well, that's the way i look at it lol. but when someone says 'look deep into your heart fot the answer' they mean think about what is right before you do it!     sure hope i helped lol! :D
sKzPSe3Baa	i only have the one for march sorry lost February's. :(
gxH4ySqraa	Yes. I always use mine because they work WAY better then the red and blue ones.
AAwe5WbVaa	wow that made me laugh out loud. ha:) i love this question.  uh yeah i believe it could. like say:  you wake up and step outta bed on the right side and step in a pile of dog nasty. :( then you have to go wash your feet in the bath tub and you smell like potty all day.    OR      you could get out on the left side  and see the dog nasty and completely avoid it.    i think ill try this tomorrow|`|5ApgSjriaa	I believe that if it has to do with someone else you spend the day with, like saying something to comfort or depress them, then yes. Or, if you put your right foot down and slip, and hit your head, it could affect your day. It would affect you psychologically... Other than something scientifically proven than no, I don't think so.|`|0P5qBxiZaa	i do believe in that concept actually:)|`|gFb9IWnXaa	yes for example if you kill urself u won't live the rest of the day and if you live you will live for the rest of the day but i dont think choosing which foot u walk on should matter.  =)|`|ybdNwzMBaa	Devon, have you been on the wacky baccy again,If you don't put one foot forward then get ready to kiss the floor.Why try to change what you cant change.God gave us te gift to,have many new teeth now stuck him in so have to take great care of them.No I would not call you retard that relay would be unkind,nut case now that more like it, or Fruit Case could fit the bill.But you keep it up do not want to stunt the growth of an imaginative mind|`|1FWYRIchaa	yes yes I am @24    I am  with you|`|AiOBRjYlaa	no|`|VkXv4RInaa	absolutely.  The tiniest of actions can and will change all future actions/decisions. If instead you put your left foot down and your whole day is the same as it would of been with the right foot, then this is simply a coincidence, because the two days must of been entirely different.|`|xsizQ5X1aa	Kinda reminds me of Yes Man, and how saying Yes instead of No had a positive effect for the main character.    I wouldn't go as far as to say it would be that extreme with regards to left or right foot first. But it could be the difference between your foot getting ran over or not.|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	Yes, but if that ONE thing is stepping on your left or right foot, then No.|`|vRmsvSb6aa	Left foot right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot. I just say that all day long. You is kinda cute. I have no clue what you are talking about.|`|S3tK5UN3aa	Yah actually I do believe that.|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	interesting concept..|`|puXPrxfJaa	Maybe  but i have never tryed that   and i hope i never well  :P   lol|`|AA11565658	I believe something like that could happen yes, but not in all instances.

1a1fb9d97c52906ad87aba95144050c4aa	I do not understand why some Americans are SO STUPID. Puerto Rico is an American territory, a commonwealth. So that's the reason why AI is going to PR.    Now, for those of you that claim it doesn't make sense if it suppose to be AMERICAN IDOL but they're bringing other people in, you all forgetting that you beloved Simon was born in England and he has a hell of an accent. So...... stop being so ignorant U.S. americans!!|`|d5ug5W5kaa	Puerto Rico is part of the US|`|4Pk6VNftaa	First of all, stick your ignorance back in your pocket.  It's embarrassing.    Puerto Rico is an American territory, and is allowed to vote in the presidential election.    As for why they went, remember what the REAL point of American Idol is - MONEY.  The goal is to find some one to make Fox and the producers a lot of MONEY from music albums and other ventures.    Furthermore,  Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language in the US after English with over 35 million speakers.  That's a big market - and one that's virtually untapped by US music producers.  Idol hopes to change that - and make a ton of MONEY along the way of course.    MONEY is the only reason American Idol exists.  If they thought that Muslim singers could make a lot of money, I guarantee you'd see Symon and the rest hanging out in Detroit and Dearborn Michigan, holding auditions.|`|qDTemwqcaa	i agree, US is the 50 states and DC. Nothing more, nothing less.    There is no american state called Puerto Rico and they do NOT vote in the US general elections (like someone incorrectly said here, dear God!).  Puerto Ricans have their own national identity like the main poster said, read his/her links.   I guess they were looking for the puerto ricans living in NYC, which most of them were not born in Puerto Rico or were looking for a different accent.  What's next? American Idol in Monterrey, Mexico? American Idol in Nassau, Bahamas?|`|YxCRA5N7aa	I thought that Puerto Rico was part of the US?!    Probably that is why they went there! There were pretty good singers there!|`|XnyFEfI6aa	First of all Puerto Rico is not a country, it's a territory of the US.  Puerto Rico is part of the US. They even voted in the primaries for the Presidential election last year. It's called "American" Idol and Puerto Rico is part of America.|`|OvTLFuTFaa	they want different people like people with accent|`|92gN7RVPaa	I heard they wanted to have an accented singer on the show.|`|gDPMX4Pcaa	Puerto Rico is Associated but it is not part, it is not annexated to the US because they do not want to become a state, they don;t want to lose their flag and culture and their nation.  American Idol? They are just looking for hispanic viewers in the US i guess.|`|lCE5sziNaa	I really don't know why they went there, considering the show is called: "American Idol" considering to those that live in America. They said they wanted and accented voice, which makes no sense to me.

jaW7NbqSaa	they don't make sheet music for synths. you should learn piano first, but synth isnt that hard depending on what style youre playing. buy a learn piano book, take lessons, or watch videos on youtube for piano or synth. you can't be solely a synth player, you have to do both. thats like playing the tambourine but not being able to play any other percussion.
KFjEkOlPaa	Going from DW to OCDP is a downgrade bro.     Time for a history lesson.   There's a company named Keller that makes excellent drum shells. Very high end quality. Keller supplies the shells to both OCDP and truth. The reason why I say OCDP is a downgrade, is because their lugs and mounts are garbage quality. Truth uses worldmax parts, which are mostly die cast and of better quality.     So far, both companies use same shell, truth uses better parts.     Get this! DW made all their drums before 1999 with Keller shells! So if you have a real DW that was made before 1999, you will downgrade to OCDP, or make a lateral change by going to Truth. No upgrade there. If your drums are DW from 2000 to present, then it's a slight upgrade to go with Truth and a downgrade to go with OCDP.      If you really have a PDP and are just calling it a DW (because a lot of drummers do)  then Truth would be a better choice. But, you should also look into SJC and C&C because they're are excellent. I think SJC is the premier new school custom drum builder right now. Just some really creative stuff. Truth is a close second.     and Pearl, Tama and Gretsch can suck it.|`|07bX5jGsaa	Out of those, OC. But I like tama.

4Zj9eYgPaa	In my point of view, that means that Obama has a lot to take care of.    The oval office is basically the president's office, all those things you see scattered on the ground are all the problems Obama has to deal with: the helmed and the grenades = war in Iraq; the broken piggy bank and the chart = economic crisis; the thermometer = global warming; pink slip = people being fired due to the economic crisis; the gasoline container = the oil crisis and the raise of the fuel prices; the the "top secret" rubber stamp, the folders and the recorder = the black deals the Bush administration did, etc.    Basically, he has to deal with all the problems the Bush administration left undone.|`|2BmGwbvYaa	This cartoon is illustrating all of the things that Bush never got done and all of the challenges in the economy and the world affairs that Obama must take care of ( the empty oil container represents the oil crisis and so on)

tLI94qWNaa	The Silence of the lambs      Young FBI agent Clarice Starling is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath Hannibal Lecter, who used to be a respected psychiatrist. FBI agent Jack Crawford believes that Lecter who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator have the answers to their questions to help locate the killer. Clarice must first try and gain Lecter's confidence before he is to give away any information    The killer skinnes his victims to make a female body suite to wear.  He takes down the larger women and starves them and then shoots them, then kills them for the skin.    It was a book before it was a movie, you should read the book first.

nbGk4waZaa	Well, for some really cool non-sideways stuff, hold down on Alt and press one of the numbers on the SIDE of your keyboard that look like a calculator.  Alt + 1 = ? (If it's bigger it looks like a really cool smiley), Alt + 3 = ? (heart- well, duh!), and you can do a lot more with other numbers and stuff- you can even combine numbers!  Like, Alt + 15 = ? (a sun, in case it's kinda hard to see).  Hope I helped!

Dm9QGcupaa	Here are some topics that you could write your song about:    -Grief  -Protest  -War  -Government  -Friendship  -Revenge  -Winning  -Love  -Enemies  -Trauma  -Pain  -Phobias  -Dreams  -Conflict  -Regret  -Memories  -Violence  -Lies  -Heroes  -Family  -Religion/After life/God  -Faith/Hope  -Sports  -Past/Present/Future  -Emotions (depressed, happy, confused, and etc.)    *Chose a song title that will stand out.  Be original.  My advice to you is: write the chorus first and then write the rest of the song.  Use a dictionary and a thesaurus, and make sure you have a few rhymes that don't sound forced, high diction, and your song has a message.    I hope this helps. xD|`|izMSawiCaa	wanna play monopoly with a stranger  on a sunday afternoon  drink my lemonade on the backporch  all i think about is you.

JL631MAgaa	Ooohhhh i've always wanted to do this....  First off, don't by fangs from your local gag shop, find some that are more convincing. Buy two sizes, one that aren't as long and sharp, more of a casual type of tooth, but it is sharper and longer then normal, then a set that is very long and scary looking. Like the first poster, drink blood red liquids only. Make yourself look more shady and unhealthy during the time you are acting like you do not have enough blood, by putting on pale makeup and adding dark circles under your eyes, lightly at first, but more defined as the 'bloodless' period continues. Of corse, you need to do the same with the 'bloodfull' periods, don't get completely regenerated after you 'drink blood', so gradually make the makeup less noticeable untill you aren't wearing any at all.   As for situations, there are many. if you can ever follow them from a place where there aren't many people around, and just gives off that creepy vibe, put on the long fangs, and quietly come up behind them, out of nowhere, and grab one and pretend to almost bite their neck, but them stop and say "No I can't" and run away. If you can, dissapear into the nearest shadow.  Another thing would be if you were ever at one of their houses alone with them, or alone with more then 1, act very charming and get close enough to one of them to 'lunge' at them, and atc like you are just about to bite them. I hope I helped!!!|`|OBc5JlwJaa	First bet would be to get some caps for plastic fangs. Drink only blood red liquids and, if need be, put on some white make up, but NOT thickly; very very lightly.     Then, for situations... well, any dark knight for a little stroll, sneak up behind them (make sure they don't know you're there) cover their mouth and get very close to their necks. I don't know how comfortable you are with your friends, so that determines how close you get. Hope this helps    ~Shadow

He was also a doctor, performed a lot of unnecessary surgery. And then in 1920, he started a secret society"     They also mention a Roylance Guide and Spates Catalog, all of the books mentioned are fictional.

5Pgs61ePaa	The as-yet unaired sixth season was the first season of Project Runway to be filmed in Los Angeles rather than New York. The season was filmed at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising,[6] and filming concluded on Friday, October 17, 2008.[7] Finalists are showing their collections at New York Fashion Week this month.[8] The Fashion Week runway finale will be filmed at Bryant Park on February 20, 2009, but the finalist designers' names will be withheld from the audience and thus their identities will be kept secret until the intended future airing of the sixth season of the contested show.[9]    The sixth season had been announced to begin airing in January 2009 on Lifetime, but this did not occur. The announcement occurred before NBC Universal sought preliminary injunctive action effectively enjoining production. The launch may be further delayed due to Lifetime's request that the suit between NBC Universal and The Weinstein Co. be moved to a federal court.[10][11][12] As of January 30, 2009, the court case is still in state court, with no trial date set.[13]|`|PumYhJSvaa	Right now it is up to the courts to decide.
F2Npn75Aaa	REAL EMOTION Lyrics from Jade's Adagio Single    What can I do for you?    What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  I can hear you  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?    Far beyond the hazy borders of my heart  I can see a place that's something like this  Every now and then I don't know what to do  Still I know that I can never go back    But the things I've seen  In those hazy dreams  Can't compare to what I'm seeing now  Everything's so different  That it brings me to my knees    And though I know the world of real emotion has surrounded me  I won't give in to it  Now I know that forward is the only way my heart can go  I hear your voice calling out to me,  "You'll never be alone."    What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?    I can hear you    And if I find  The real world of emotion has surrounded me  And I can't go on  But you are there  The moment that I close my eyes to comfort me  We are connected for all of time  I'll never be alone    And though I know the world of real emotion has surrounded me  I won't give into it  Now I know that forward is the  Only way my heart can go  I hear your voice calling out to me:  "You'll never be alone."    What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?    I can hear you  I can hear you|`|4iNyAbhfaa	This?  Bob Dylan - What Can I Do For You?    You have given everything to me.  What can I do for you?  You have given me eyes to see.  What can I do for you?    Pulled me out of bondage and you made me renewed inside,  Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,  Opened up a door no man can shut and you opened it up so wide  And you've chosen me to be among the few.  What can I do for you?    You have laid down your life for me.  What can I do for you?  You have explained every mystery.  What can I do for you?    Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,  He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.  Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?  Well, you've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.  What can I do for you?    You have given all there is to give.  What can I do for you?  You have given me life to live.  How can I live for you?    I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,  I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,  Whatever pleases you, tell it to my heart.  Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through.  What can I do for you?|`|EwFcQDGRaa	Real Emotion-- Jade

Zkk9LPFwaa	i just got this guitar for christmas in a cool red chameleon finish.....pretty nice guitar...and its my second one too:) i started with a squier pack3 years back and decided i wanted a nice guitar with a locking tremolo..    pros- zr tremolo: ibanez's very own... its very smooth, and theres a system called zps, at the back... u can remove its 2 springs to make it a floating tremolo like a floyd rose bridge... whats special about the zps is that if u play crazy stuff like herman li, and if ur string breaks, ur guitar stays perfectly in tune....unlike a floyd rose..., two humbuckers, with 5 way switching- it gives u more tone options n stuff like dat...the pups are quite good for stock pups.... the guitars body is very thin and comfortable, as well as the neck......and finally, it has a very handy spring tension adjustment wheel at the back.    cons- a considerable number of people complain that their tremolo arm holder broke... mine didnt till now... but there's a year warranty and theres always spare parts.....u can also get the holder custom made with a stronger alloy... u probably wont need to worry about this if u dont plan on doin crazy stuff like herman :)    hope this helps!!    p.s. have u heard abt buckethead? he's quite an amazing guitarist.... after seeing him play i started learnin how to shred...    HAVE FUN!!|`|VgiaKpElaa	Pros: Ultrafast, great sound/tone, good sustain, cheap, very good quality for the price, double locking trem(whammy), easy to control, good sounding pickups, great bridge that is almost better than then the original Floyd Rose, nice looking.    Cons: the bridge is from from a sorta cheap metal(but all parts are replaceable)    The bridge is great but its just sorta cheaply made. Unless you do some  crazy chit like dragonforce to get effects from the bar, it isn't going to break.

I don' do no akahol.    Haha. That's how my dad sounds. I think alcohol is a real screw up.|`|kg6H6HDuaa	I think people that think lightly of drugs, smoking and drinking should actually live the hard life maybe a significant other being addicted to crystal meth(pot is a gateway drug) and them having to pick up the pieces.  Or someone they love die of lung cancer, or have a drunk driver hit someone they care about.  That way they can honestly say oh to each his own or hey it's my body.  I think immaturity follows drug use|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I have nothing against drinking, though I feel the legal age for drinking should be lowered to 18 here in the USA.  As for smoking, I could definitely do without it but, just because someone smokes, it doesn't mean they're a bad person.  As for drugs--illegal drugs I'm assuming--they're all illegal for a reason!    In my old school, which I graduated from last year, I have a feeling quite a few of the people there did drugs and I'm pretty sure a lot of them smoked.  As for drinking, I'm not sure how many people in my school liked to get their fill of some Old No. 7 and other various drinks.|`|suVispAAaa	I think there is a big percenatge of kids smoking, drinking & using drugs at every school, unfortunately. I do not agree with it. I mean drinking occasionally (over age of course!) & in reasonable amounts with out getting carried away is ok, but i do not like cigarettes, they do more harm then good & they make people reek & turn their teeth yellow (ewww..). There is nothing about drugs that makes me want to try or use them. I do not understand why people us drugs or anything.

I think it is a way to cover up there anger and loss!! Like If your parents are divorced you have that empty spot inside and you either shop, eat, smoke, drink and that kinda fills up the empty space!   Or they did it to impress their friends and are addicted to it!! I feel very bad for those  people and I will pray for them!! Please don't get involved with it!! You will really mess up your life!( and you might even die)  You will really regret it!!! How would you like to tell your friends and kids when you are older that you were a bog drug dealer or had a bad drinking problem!! And have to go to therapy, and have to lie in bed sweating cause you can't get your drugs or drink!|`|zyTrMeovaa	all good in high doses and frequency.|`|HsrCk2J1aa	Sucks to be them!  yeah, i'd say 35 percent smoke sometime and 70 percent drink.   Personally, I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs.|`|2LpWgU20aa	smoking and drugs are unnessary, drinking is acceptable in certain occasions and when the individual is over the drinking age and drinks responsibily, its just a good way to relax. At my school im sure about 85% drink , 40% smoke and the same persent do drugs. kids these days. they are ruining their lives. tsktsktsk.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	I think their a waste of time ,money and their about the most unhealthy thing a person can do.    Schools need to find where it starts and deal with it.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	same here!! sukks for them|`|m9tWBMBJaa	i live in a high class area where all the kids at my school are freakin preps... except for the new kids who are all like, fake gangsters hahah.................  so maybe not 70%... more like 45% of the kids at my school do.  but it's still sad isnt it?  im not one of them.. my mommy's proud :D hahaa.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I go to private university, so you can imagine...|`|emkT1a6raa	Only like 6% of the 8th graders do.  You know what, I agree with the fiirst answer.It's their choice that their making to ruin their own life, so let them..not my problem.|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	nothin wrong with it|`|hQn84sigaa	Same here. But it's not by saying "I wasted half of my highschool years, doing drugs and drinking" that I am going to university. :]  I mean they can do what they want, doesn't bother me *evil laugh*  In my school, it's probably like 80 %.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	drugs aspirin  smoke ~salmon  drink ~mines a pint please  enjoy
uHbzyCcHaa	ITS TRUE...CANCERS LOVE SECURITY AND CHILD HOOD FRIENDS PROVIDE IT VERY MUCH. THEY CANNOT HELP IT....THEY NEED THEIR SECURITY....ALSO....SCORP AND CANCER CLICK FROM THE EMOTIONAL ATTRACTION SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WATER SIGNS.......SAG IS NOT EMOTIONAL ENOUGH TO FIT CANCERS NEEDS.........SO....YOU CAN KEEP TRYING BUT EVENTUALLY....SHE'LL BREAK UP WITH YOU FROM INSECURITY........IF U DO WIN....I DON'T KNO THOUGH.....|`|izX7ymibaa	I'm sorry to say it but you are really not compatible with Kaily as a Cancer. These two signs don't mix well at all. You, as a Sag, will quickly grow bored with her neediness and insecurity. This is why she will gravitate to the man she knows. Also, almost anyone could make a Cancer cry. They cry at the drop of a hat. I'm also sorry to say, that in the long run, Joe the Scorpio would be better able to take care of Kaily and her needs. That's just the way the stars are.|`|ioZeveazaa	You need to let her know that you like her and ask her out on a date. Don't waste your time dropping hints. However according to signs, Scorpio is a better match than Sag even though personally I couldn't get along with either. Just tell her though. If you know anything about Cancer females they are sensitive, emotional, love "protection", loving. These are the four main things that we are so try to use it to your advantage. Good luck!!|`|2IddNqy9aa	i'm pisces, my best friend is a scorpio and my girl is a cancer.    so, i'm obviously better than scorpio and saggitarius so i'll help you out.  if this scorpio is anything like my buddy, he'll kick your ***. back off. cancers are emotional any way and they get real attached. since your independant by nature this wont work out anyway. go find a libra or something|`|KlOqs6nbaa	i am a cancer girl. (and btw, i dont date )but if i did, i would choose the childhood friend. (no offense) but, if i knew he's not the one, i would chose 2 years. it is possible for someone to love 2 people. show kailey that you do love her. but don't push it. hurry before joe  gets her!!  tell her how you feel at the right moment. good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HZxX9ke8aa	cancer's needs protection, what's better than a childhood friend who's in love with you now? no risk or whatever, you'll know what kind of a character they have...    scorpio & cancer also a better match. you're totally out here. but if you really want to do this, go slow. make more obvious hints and do that when you two alone. cancers emphatetic people and we are talking about a female here. any fight and "you" will lose. anyway, you should win her digging slowly, showing that you're reliable guy, totally in love with her and you know the drill.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	cancers and scorpios ALWAYS work out. they're like magnets just like you said. he would hurt her over and over and she would go back to him again and again. i'm a scorpio and i know how it happens coz i've seen it before. i'm not very familiar with cancer-sagittarius relationships but i know that if the scorpio likes her he won't let her go easily because once a scorpio wants something good luck trying to stand in his way, it won't be very sweet. so if you like the girl, knowing that she might choose him over you, don't let him get her if you really love her, and try to find ways to win her. cancers are sweet and have a very sweet heart. act smart and watch out for scorpios. they sting, and it hurts

I have liked that song for a little while now.|`|kHY0eMVraa	I use to Love this song when I was younger :)  I still enjoy listening to it!!!
kov7p4Y8aa	I love it, I can hear the guy in Secondhand Serenade singing that.   At least their genre, but I dont see Taylor Swift. Really I love it.  But maybe extend it a little, like take a part and make it the chorus, just don't go on and on and draw it out where it becomes redundant, but when sung chorus' are what brings people into the songs.  For Example (lol sorry if I'm goin a lil farther than you wanted )    And you, don't change your mind.  Its gonna be alright,  Just you and me,  And nothing between  These hearts of ours they're intertwined  Babe, I'll be yours if you'll be mine.    then as a possible chorus have    And you will kiss me on my forehead  And be the same with me  If I told you what I felt  I know you'll agree  That we are perfect for each other,  that in the end we'll see  That deep within our hearts  Is written you and me    But those last parts are just ideas   Just trying to help  ...  Good LUCK! You are very talented :)|`|i7o1zE8Saa	great i liked it  :)|`|biheycXqaa	I really like this!!!! Normally I'm not too fond of the lyrics people post on here, but I think there's finally someone with some talent!!!|`|bL0G6EGNaa	agreed too sappy|`|34K0QIzTaa	awwww! its cutee|`|XO16mAOhaa	Yeah it rocks i like the way you wrote them!|`|ZICvolQNaa	Good, it sounds like something Taylor Swift would sing|`|IkdB22IXaa	This is so great, I like what you did with the apple tree.|`|PmCdW80waa	you did not write that i have seen those lyrics before|`|Ai6XsCNfaa	Sounds great, I write songs all the time for my band.  Yeah I like them a lot.  GOOD JOB!!!|`|BWPtZkIDaa	they are beautiful  i would relly consider a career in the song-writing bizness|`|PeAqoy1vaa	i think it's pretty good! the only thing that seemed to not exactly...flow right was "I think that you'd agree   That we were perfect for each other."  but other than that, these are amazing lyrics. nice work|`|P5mXlubvaa	Nyah.  Not that good.  Sounds like some dumb pop song.|`|EVC5tO97aa	It is a bit sappy but that's just me, if that's what you want to write about then that's what you write about. From a lyrical stand point it's pretty good, flows nicely, connects, touches emotions which is important. If your song has no emotion or feeling to it, it's not going to draw people in. I think put to the right music, with a nice chorus it could be pretty good. For a chorus you might want to use the part where it says"If I told you how I felt" they way you have it repeat is nice.  As for music I personally like piano, maybe a little faster than what you were thinking but not too much just a little pace to it.   Sorry for the novel of an answer lol I like to think I know about this stuff so I tend to offer my two cents plus about 300 :P|`|4xL9vqpjaa	It's really cute and romantic... but... repetitive... maybe redundant.  in the second part, like three sentences end with "felt" and that doesn't rhyme... It's a little sappy but still cute.  I liked the first portion, but you should work on the second.  I can see it looking really good, though, don't be discouraged :)|`|AbSizeNBaa	not bad better than i could do. but some parts could use a bit of work but all in all pretty good|`|hlXxuOOTaa	i really reallly like ittt! no kidding! i try to write songs all the time... it just never works. but wow, im impressed, no joke. good job! :)|`|W1YHgXlAaa	OH EM GEE!! its so sweet and likee cute you  know, names in the sand, a kiss on the forehead...i liked it :]|`|Q7WC6R0saa	WOW! if that was a song, and it was sung nicely i would buy it on itunes or wherever it is sold. the only part is "If i told you how i felt, I think that you'd agree(you should add) just you an me" or something about yourselves that rhymed. you don't have to i'm just helping. But that is really good. gives me a good image of a couple and the beach! :)|`|jF1i780kaa	i guess their ok, but not the best.|`|53AIMDCjaa	i think it is good but 1 line does not make sense:you would kiss me on  for head and do the same for me?but other than that line i think its good|`|F0Qg8XOWaa	Great lyrics!
58e49cee94da926929118606381c20f0aa	i agree, it was pretty awesome.|`|27c2d354649c70e87537d2a6d6934df4aa	thanks!|`|TApVoMdAaa	omg im so excited it looks awesome!|`|TR6wQ7PPaa	Yeah OMG it is SOOOOOOO awesome!

lpyWVR2oaa	There's no good or bad with this placement, as the way you are predisposed to be.    Pisces Moon will certainly tone down your Leo pride and needs to get the accolades and attentions from your surroundings. Pisces Moon actually makes you more emotionally sensitive and empathetic than the average typical Leo, although you may not show it that obviously.  You're actually more compassionate and sensitive to the needs of others around you and this combo does make you a good leadership type who thinks about the feelings of others as well.|`|utJE0EyIaa	I have this same combo...it makes us very sensitive and emotional. The leo rising gets us notice quite a lot whether good or bad.

Y1aAGPURaa	To love is to receive a glimpse of heaven.    Love is a friendship set to music.    I dropped a teardrop in the ocean and the day you find it ... is the day I'll stop loving you.    Do you love me because I am beautiful, or am I beautiful because you love me?    Love is like a flower which blossoms with trust.    Love is the only thing you get more of by giving it away.    The most eloquent silence; that of two mouths meeting in a kiss.|`|1UY2o5lDaa	I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for their religion -   I have shudder'd at it.   I shudder no more.   I could be martyr'd for my religion   Love is my religion   And I could die for that.   I could die for you.   - John Keats    Soul meets soul on lover's lips.   - Percy Bysshe Shelly     When you love someone, all your saved-up wishes start coming out.   - by Elizabeth Bowen    Hope these helped :)X|`|AgzRyqWTaa	I am not surprise about the voice of my enemies but rather the silence of my friends.

ajrnlFczaa	i don't know what made her come out.  Except that is what is being shoved down our throats in just about every show that is on now.    I do not watch her show, she makes me ill, just thinking about her sexual perversion.  We need to pray that she will find Jesus.|`|r0pfnlGzaa	i like her show...  wanna visit her show,,,|`|8aXimsjBaa	She was proud of her sexuality so wanted to share it with America and maybe make a few more converts.  I very much dislike her show!    Peace|`|AA11111233	It was the "Coming Out" episode on her show entitled Ellen... one of the memorable episodes in television history.  I love her show, she's so funny and entertaining, and anyone with working eyes and ears can see she has a great time with the guests and audience.  She could certainly teach Rosie O'Donnell some things about class.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	If you are a christian you should not be watching Ellen DeGeneres.|`|AA10876072	Love her and her show.  I think she just wanted to make her sexuality known.  Not ashamed.    She is a very funny lady.  Love her dancing.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I'm not sure. I think that the way that she feels that she's no different from other people. When I look at her, I see a funny talk show host. The only time I remember that she is a lesbian, is when she mentions her wife. I love her show!|`|gjr6pA0Gaa	Well, she probably wants to come out so she doesn't need to hide anything anymore. She doesn't want these feelings boddled up inside and wants to let it all out. I loved her sitcom and when she come out I was a little surprised, but I still like her very much because she makes me laugh and happy. I don't understand why people liked her before the news came out and hates her afterwards, I mean did she do anything wrond that makes you hate her? I'm very happy for her and hopes her the best of her career and marriage.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	I think Ellen is extremely talented.    Everybody (Ellen, you, me, Hitler, Billy Graham) is a sinner and therefore in need of a savior.  We ALL sin.  I cannot fault someone for sinning.  I can pray for them.    I can though, fault someone for making it a point as a public figure with influence to purposely attempt to 'empower' and encourage others to explore their sin nature, to use their position to attempt to sway public opinion away from God's opinion.  That is exactly what Satan did to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.  In that, I do fault Ellen.  No Christian should watch her show or support her in her position.    We all sin - we all need to call it sin, repent and try to walk correctly.  Not embrace it.|`|sJs0nuTSaa	I thought she came out because the gossip magazines had started reporting it and talking about it.  I love her show.  I work nights, so I'm asleep when it comes on here.  I record it and watch it the next morning when I get off of work.  It never fails to give me a cheap laugh before ending my day.|`|5vqo3XzHaa	She had kept one secret hidden for a long time, that being she had been molested by her step-father as a teenager.  Supposedly, these incidents were what turned her against men and led to her being attracted to women.  I don't know, but it could be since Ellen had lived with that secret for many years and it made her very unhappy, she couldn't bear to spend the rest of her life keeping another secret, so she made a decision to come out in the open about her sexuality and let the chips fall where they would.  As evidenced by her popularity these days, it would appear she made the right decision to be honest with the public.  But, what is right in the eyes of the "world", is not right in the eyes of God.  I do not watch her show.  God bless!!!

MXpW48lFaa	Well, I don't like Miley and I don't hate her.  Don't get me wrong if this isn't what it is but,  I know I don't like Miley, but I'm not jealous,  What has she got that's so good?  Because she's famous or something?  I'm just pretty sure that Miley haters hate her  Because they think she's spoiled,  and she's done some skanky pics in the PAST.  So yeahh, everybody has their own opinion.    Hope I Helped :)|`|A3RY3EBQaa	no.. she's just annoying sumtimes... no jealousy at all|`|skZcJ3k3aa	No she just annoys me  HER VOICE  HER LOOK  HER PREPPYNESS  yesh that meh new word|`|yuHV59Yhaa	Nope. It's because everyone is just sick of her. Her songs are annoying too.|`|7WtThw8jaa	noo way and i hate her!!|`|WysJMdnWaa	they're just jelous, but I do start to hate her now cuz shes turning in to a diva|`|k39bNUgeaa	Jealous of what? Her having a body double? Her lip syncing? Her wanting to get a tattoo of her boyfriends name.    There is nothin to be jealous of|`|ulBW2m62aa	Oh my bad for hating.  Why should people be jelous of a slut that pretends she can sing?Has her dad write songs for her,date a guy over 18,and take racy photos.  Yeah...we're just so jelous of that.  NOT!|`|wB8bK0vFaa	I don't necessarily think they're jealous.  People like to hate celebrities though. Usually it's because people think celebrities are stuck up people.  I wouldn't know, since I haven't really had any encounters with celebrities.|`|AA10368887	Exactly. What exactly am I supposed to be jealous of? For one thing, half naked photos of me are not circulating all over the internet like they are for "Miss Wholesome Role Model".    I guarantee that in 5 years, she will be completely forgotten.|`|TofmqjUaaa	Well for one, she's completely shallow and is a total brat. She is on a one way ticket on ending up like one of the Spears girls.....  Plus the Wiggles and Imagination Movers creep me out, so yes, i hate them as well.    They should jump off a cliff and spare us..|`|MXjvZMUXaa	welll.... i hate miley and YES i'm jealous of her because she has the "perfect dad" and i lost my dad when i was just 4 and it hurts so much to see a girl who has no talent at all having the perfect dad who loves her and ...... whatever..|`|SvklMRtlaa	its because she is a slut (as seen from her magizines and boyfriends) and yet people let there kids go and see her. something about this so very wrong, do u want your kids to be a slut like her? i should think not|`|HIJudEeBaa	y be jealous of miley? theres nothing to be jealous about!!!becuz shes annoying!  she thinks shes all that and bigger then angelina jolie or jessica alba or something. she thinks too much of herself and that's y she thinks she can do anything and get away with it. that y she took those vanity pics. i can't hate so i dislike.|`|mpB2agPBaa	they have reasons, its just that you dont know them... and yet you never will...|`|EiGhB34laa	yeah pretty much , me i think that girl is pretty adorable and she can sing! whoo    wish she was mine ;)|`|ozqz1fW6aa	I love Miley Cyrus and i guess people do hate her cause they're jealous. She hasn't done nothing to deserve hatred so its kind of dumb. And yes she has made mistakes but doesn't everybody. She's a human being and everybody makes mistakes!|`|cloASB6paa	I'm pretty sure the Wiggles don't have suggestive pictures of them on boys' laps circulating through the internet. Honestly, I really do not like Miley Cyrus. I'll admit I'm jealous of her... but not in the way you think. I'm actually really just jealous of her money which isn't a good reason at all. By your question I'm assuming are the haters jealous of her "talent"... no. I may not be a good singer, but I do not want Miley's voice. I may not be the best actor, but I'm a heck of a lot better than Miley. Yes, you can call me materialistic but that's just about the only thing I'm jealous of - money. Fame doesn't really appeal to me. And she isn't "just some kid". She's an overrated teeny bop singer who tries too hard to say she's different but she really isn't.    Her fans who say that the haters are jealous shouldn't just jump to conclusions. Her fans' actions actually make me dislike her more because it's so annoying. I'm sorry if you like her and you're offended by my comment... this is just how I feel.

aihogb26aa	She's one of the gimmick contestants that they use for publicity and to get people talking (which worked... there was a lot of buzz about her after her audition). Once they get in Hollywood, they tend to really evaluate people on their vocal talent, rather than just on gimmicks, and I think that is where she'll tank.|`|7xMy4jmFaa	No she is a hot mess!!!!!!!|`|yJd1WwF2aa	No she'll be cut in Hollywood, she only got in b/c of Simon and RAndy being board by all the OTHER untalented people who didn't come in bikini's|`|7be0W5FWaa	im watching american idol.

Uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh    [Verse One:]    It was all a dream  I used to read Word Up magazine  Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine  Hangin' pictures on my wall  Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl  I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped  Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock  Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack  With the hat to match  Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha  You never thought that hip hop would take it this far  Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight  Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade  Born sinner, the opposite of a winner  Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner  Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri  Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky  I'm blowin' up like you thought I would  Call the crib, same number same hood  It's all good    Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, *****, uh    [Chorus:]    You know very well who you are  Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars  You had a goal, but not that many  'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty    [Verse Two:]    I made the change from a common thief  To up close and personal with Robin Leach  And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day  Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way  The Moet and Alize keep me pissy  Girls used to diss me  Now they write letters 'cause they miss me  I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff  I was too used to packin' gats and stuff  Now honies play me close like butter played toast  From the Mississippi down to the east coast  Condos in Queens, indo for weeks  Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak  Livin' life without fear  Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears  Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool  Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school  Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood  And it's still all good    Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, *****    [Verse Three:]    Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis  When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this  50 inch screen, money green leather sofa  Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur  Phone bill about two G's flat  No need to worry, my accountant handles that  And my whole crew is loungin'  Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'  Thinkin' back on my one-room shack  Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back  And she loves to show me off, of course  Smiles every time my face is up in The Source  We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us  No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us  Birthdays was the worst days  Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay  Uh, damn right I like the life I live  'Cause I went from negative to positive  And it's all...    (It's all good)    ...and if you don't know, now you know, *****, uh  Uh, uh...and if you don't know, now you know, *****  Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, *****, uh    Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh  Uh, yeah, a-ight|`|4Vchxp32aa	the song was made after the first bombing of the WTC.

Iguana on the bass as long as he could wear some sick shades or a cool hat or something,  5.  A horny toad should play rhythm guitar and probably look dorky, but "cool in his own right",  6.

l3b0hjdWaa	Leo and Aries because of pride. Aries always act like they don't care whether you're in their life or not but come on now    *edit  Leo Jen, you sound so self centered in your answer. the question is not about you and your love life|`|HZxX9ke8aa	signs that are tend to be much more social than others. if you have alternatives, you will forget easier after all. but "in appearance" yeah, leo and aries.|`|HpWyrJKGaa	for some reason, i'm a pisces and i do that.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	Air signs they can come out of a relationship easily there afraid of commitment like air they flow from one person to the next in order    Aquarius  Libra  Gemini    then fire because if pride but a bad breakup can hurt them very bad there ego get hurt  in order    Leo  Aries  Sagittarius|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	Probably a capricorn. They make a huge debacle out of breakups (even when they are wrong) and still come out thinking they were right.|`|1TqXChgNaa	Leo for sure. Leo's are lions, so they are always very proud. They are also positive, so they are more than likely going to find a plus to it. The sign that would make a big deal about it is cancers, they usually will be pouty and hold a huge grudge. Trust me, I have dated a Leo and Cancer.    My favorite sign to date is Taurus, (I am Capricorn) they tend to hold there head high but still be a little sensitive and forgiving when they need to be. Other times, though, they are very stubborn.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	"I'm You" hit the nail on the head with his/her answer.    Once an Air sign breaks up with a person they detach themselves and don't even look back or think about that person. They remain a part of their past but never the present.    Fire signs may take a break up hard but their pride will keep them from contacting their person ever again. Once their ego is hurt they move on like they never knew that person in the first place.|`|3QpAqd1xaa	aries|`|1PdUecpYaa	i did. i dumped my leo ex for cheating, and i was proud of myself. i did the right thing.   i did cry afterwards, but for a few hours after the breakup, i was really proud of myself. i told all my friends about it. i thought i could never have done it cos i really liked him and being a typical pisces, i depend on my lovers so much. but i did it, and i felt great...|`|dmxnblomaa	A LEO because that is what I am about to do, we hurt on the inside, but have too much pride to show it on the outside.
esLaHM0Oaa	Like aspicco mentioned, not un-emotional. Just uncomfortable with expressing them so tend to repress them. And I read once that it's not good to keep emotions "bottled up" so let them loose if you can.   I have moon in cap also, so I know exactly how you and the others feel. I have a tremendously hard time expressing my emotions. We are just like Scorpio, in a sense of mastering the 'poker face,' lol.  I have emotions like everyone else but not just as good as expressing them as I would like to. One example is; I rarely cry, I cry, maybe only twice a year. So, true for me on that. It also makes me seem cold, distant and very serious. But I guess in a way, I have to say it does bring structure for me, in my life (pisces sun) so I can't complain about that. :)|`|BgWgQimGaa	i dunno. if you have emotions then no. if you think that you don't and never did, then yes. Think about it. Ask friends and family.|`|XT4MqRT8aa	Topically yes but, it depends on the sun and other aspects. I have a Pisces friend with a Cap Moon, she cries a whole lot. I was stock to find out she had a Cap Moon.|`|32P3hG0Laa	Un-emotional? No. No such thing. But a Moon in Capricorn isn't going to be gushy & weepy & boldly passionate.|`|d1X9zICiaa	yes, capricorns don't feel much emotion. We're HORRIBLE at expressing what we feel, we think it.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	i don't think so. capricorn=ambition. moon capricorn=when you want someone you will do whatever it takes at least you will not be shy when it comes to proposing i guess.|`|635890b7eaf69137233c1c37ceeecf6caa	I have a  moon in Cap and yeah I hold back my emotions like crazy I am always cool calm and collected emotionally, even when situations warrant me to blow up...  Once in a while, rarely I loose my cool and blow up.    But usually I keep my cool and think logically then try to figure out where exactly things went wrong so that it doesn't happen again or I am better prepared in future.  I can seem cold and I can be cold.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	I have a Cap Moon but it's influenced by Sagittarius since its on a cusp, and I'm very unemotional in public, I can hold myself in public but if something comes out in private i will burst this is like the Sag coming out. Capricorn is known to be cold and being in a moon is a bad position for Capricorn because it's hard to let out emotions this is where the moon falls of course there's other things like what aspects the moon has and the houses it's in.|`|0HGqGJYTaa	My sister is a Leo w/a Cap moon too!  The answer is yes! My sister is the most laidback person alive. She makes all decisions in a practical matter as a cap would, so she is not made easily upset unless her Leo ego is bruised...then that's another story in itself. But, on a day to day, she is very very cool.    I'm a Libra with a Aqua moon, when it's time to be emotionally "in tune" with things, our family can't stand us because they think we're both oblivious to things.There aren't too many things that ruffle my feathers either.

HNmO2ZwXaa	Oh no:(    They were talking about appealing to a wider audience in a recent interview, thats spells sell out really and your comments prove that:(    I haven't heard but im gonna buy the album anyway but im not expecting great things from it to be honest cause if I build up my hopes I may be let down!!|`|trQ4vqx4aa	The intro and lead-out sound like it isn't intended to be a stand alone song, but something you'd get a better feel for by listening to the album as a whole -- sort of like several radiohead, pink floyd type albums where individual songs aren't the focus of the music, but one part of something greater.     I like the song, but it's no Capillarian Crest.    I'm looking forward to the album, they are trying a ton of new stuff, and I look forward to the 'class rock' feel Brent has been going on about.|`|CeyuSMT9aa	You changed your avatar and nickname today. You're a bandwagon fan! I had you in my contacts and yesterday your avatar was just a cartoon one
AA11552737	You idiot, its impossible for a landfish to beat up a zebra! Well, I guess it could slap it to death with its tongue, but the zebra would probably run away in the meantime. But if it was possible, I would have to say yes, a camel's toe would blow up because the magical blood of a zebra was absent and could not coat the camel toe from the nuclear war.    Now, I would have to agree with you that donkeys like apples better than peaches. I have locked one up in a cage before with just an apple and a peach and it immediately went for the apple. I have also tried to do  the same experiment with a talking banana in a cage with just a grape and a potato chip, but it just kept shouting to get out. The experiment failed and the results were never known.|`|hfuo91ysaa	No, because if a landfish beat up a zebra it would be the end of sanity lol...so a camel's toe would be the only things left after a nuclear war...I like grapes too lol|`|vrGjDDmzaa	no, the camel's toe dictates the nuclear war!

Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey Bro long time no see!    Yeah I bought it. Its good AK has his traditional dry raw lightly distorted guitar tone it sounds great.    I love the song Sadistic Values its a more progressive side of the album. Strike, Conform, Enough Said are all good tunes.    Derek sounds great.     I love the typical simple Chugah Chugah Chugah alternate picking open string riffs and random slides of AK always have. Joe of Gojira does too just like he uses on the song Oroborus when he sings the versus after he does his cool @ss tapping trill combo thing.     I like the album it could have been heavier at times but never the less I like it|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I havent checked it out but I intend to. But you cant really call it Sepultura with no Cavaleras so I'm not expecting much.    w3rd
mfwDnMupaa	Yes, it's a way to point out to lose who are single "Ha! You suck!"    Gotta hate single awareness day.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	Nah... Modern consumerism isn't even spirited enough for evil, only mere soullessness.|`|a6QK1oQFaa	not evil..but i personally HATE IT..its just a sad day lol|`|rcHnA1iQaa	I mostly think it's a holiday to mock all the single people|`|7nTJKhW6aa	somewhat|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	I guess for those who don't have anyone to share it with.|`|AA12187799	yeah,but the day after you can get candy cheap!|`|awDMukQ4aa	NO because that is my birthday|`|oMBdvEtiaa	It's WORSE than evil!!!!|`|AZTNUH08aa	i can see why someone would think so|`|KhhrBqldaa	I don't think its evil, but its definately commercialized and its made such a big deal out of so companies can get money. Especially with all these jewelry commercials, I don't think it should be as big a deal as it is.|`|N9BiqI8gaa	Not this one, my dad got me a joker shirt! YES!!|`|79742c6af3ce8b6a79acffa1c263de4aaa	Evil?  No.  Retarded?  Yes!|`|RsYwCOeFaa	The only reason I would ever see someone call Valentine's Day evil is if they recently broke up with someone or they don't believe in love|`|tuEu43YTaa	i think it is because i don't have a boyfriend. love sticks.|`|Dnf4ijdJaa	ehhh i dont love it, but i dont hate it.... that much lol :]|`|b8R5bPrhaa	Yes  [:|`|9zrNQryYaa	Yes it is.|`|MeGazyy7aa	I hate it.

It's a manufactured holiday, designed for people to buy candy and get a hotel room.|`|b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	It's an evil holiday created by the evil corporate executives at hallmark to scam people.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i had mty first date with my husband on v day!! :)|`|t7U9rliVaa	It's a ridiculously commercial "holiday", but I wouldn't call it evil.|`|puXPrxfJaa	ITS OK  :P|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Why... why would it be?|`|OYBABzjDaa	No, I think people only complain about it because they don't have someone special to be with on that day. Am I correct?
N9BiqI8gaa	1. 100, I'd spend the million to quickly  2.chewy chocolate and carmel coated cockroach eggs, yummy( gross)  3.If you came up to me and gave me a hug, either I'd push you away or hug you back. It all depends if your cute  4.I'm gonna say the chicken, because god created animals first  5. I would be a tv celeb. so I could marry Christain Bale  6.I love my parents, my grandparents cause too much drama  7.Yes, my best friend is a girl. I do have guy friends  8.The most annoying question, is when people ask ' what is the most annoying question?'  9.I would rather have a brain make-over! I could be smart and become rich.  10. I think that internal beauty is best. If you are nice and sweet non-attractive person, I find that person beautiful in his/her own way. Beautiful people could be real a$$holes which make them ugly.|`|PDJjy0bPaa	1) $100 a day because it will end up being more than a million today, plus I won't go spend it all at once.    2) Lol nasty...but the chocolate caramel covered cockroach's eggs.  They would be over with quicker than a rat tail.    3) Haha I'd say Hi, how's life, whoever you are?    4) Egg...No chicken...no I THINK egg..    5) Neither but if I had to choose one, TV celeb.    6)  Umm probably a tie.    7) Both.  I have a guy best friend who I was raised with as though he was my brother and I have a really close female friend.    8) I hate the racist, sexist, etc questions.  I actually like polls like these!    9) Brain makeover.  It would over rule in the end!    10) Internal because you can be really pretty but if you're an awful person no one would want to be around you...and THAT would suck.|`|ab6c493f91ee96628f1337c9e7d2bfcdaa	1. 100 bucks everyday of my life for the rest of my life.  2. the chocolate gross caramel yucky cockroach egg thingies.....blea....  3. i'd be like "hey!" and give you one back.  4. the chicken. most definitely  5. tv celebrity  6. parents.....but that was hard one....  7. same sex.  8. all the ones with people asking "am i pretty?" or "how would you rate me?" or "am i ugly?" arg.......just look in the mirror people! as long as your comfortable with yourself then its fine. oh, but my fav worst question has to be the ones about miley cyrus. why would you waste 5 points on her? even though they're not real, still. really?  9. probably brain makeover because i try not to let the external features rule my world.  10. internal for sure. i know that's how people probably judge me since i doubt i'm that pretty but those who are internally pretty shine even from the outside:)|`|WnoHELH5aa	100 dollars a day for the rest of my life    Garlic Butter Rat's Tail    At first be a little creeped out but if they werent trying to do anything than just keep hugging them    Egg    Parents    Same Sex    If you get your ears gaged, can you still wear small earrings?    A brain makeover since i am already pretty : )    Internal|`|h9uGsFfTaa	1) definetly 100 bucks for every day of my life. It may take longer, but it makes me richer.      2 )chewy Chocolate and caramel coated cockroach's eggs. Gross, but there is chocolate involved.    3) depends if I had pepper spray on me or not. (lol jk)    4) the chicken. If not, how could the chicken get IN the egg?    5) prime minister. I hate celebrities.    6) is neither an option?    7) opposite.     8) ????    9) I wouldn't change me.     10) DEFINETLY internal! Your personality is soooo much more important than something as shallow as looks.|`|ltDPK4UFaa	1. 100 bucks every day for the rest of my life..who knows how long I'll live..it could be a ton of money    2. I'll take the cockroach eggs    3. I'd probably be a little shocked that a stranger is giving me a hug    4. egg    5. Prime Minister..it just sounds cool    6. parents..I see them everyday    7. I have a female and male best friend..it works for me    8. The "Am I Pretty?" questions    9. smartest person    10.  In all honest, internal beauty..she can look really good, but if there's not even a tiny bit of intelligence I wouldn't be able to stand being around her.|`|uld1CxQeaa	1)would u rather have a million bucks today or 100 bucks everyday of your life for the rest of your life  100 bucks everyday because i would spend the million too fast.     2)this ones kind of gross +o(  would u rather have garlic butter rat tails or chewy Chocolate and caramel coated cockroach's eggs  mmm. probably cockroach eggs cause anything coated in chocolate tastes good  3)what would u do if i came up to u and gave u a big hug   i would be like..oh hi. haha.  4)this q has been asked like 40 million times just on y/a but i thought i would ask it too what do u think came first the chicken or the egg  neither? i think it evolved from something else.  5)what would u rather be:a prime minister or a tv celebrity  tv celebrity. cause prime minister is too much pressure  6)who do u love more parents or grandparents  both. but probably parents more.  7)do u have a best friend of the same sex or opposite sex  same  8)what is the most annoying q u found on y/a (other than mine lol)  am i pregnant? i had sex! hahahah its like DUH  9)would u rather have a beauty makeover to make u beautiful for life or a brain makeover to make u the smartest person ever.  beauty cause i already got brains :]]  10)last q be honest:  do u think internal or extarnal beauty is the most important  i cant help be attracted to external beauty but i would never date someone who is a jerk.|`|mbwWELxPaa	1. Definitely the hundred bucks each day. Then I could go to Taste of Chaos and the Avenged Sevenfold concerts... Damn I wanna go. haha  2. It's times like these that I say I AM A PROUD VEGITARIAN. Sorry for cheating. XD  3. Give you a hug back! I love hugs and randomness. =)  4. One mutated egg from another species in my opinion. I mean, dinosaurs and chickens are really closely related.  5. I hate politics, so I'd have to say tv celebrity, though it'd have to be a GOOD music channel. Fuse or something.  6. I love them the same. My parents are always there for me, but my grandparents are always nice to me and I don't get in trouble or anything. I can't choose between them.  7. Same sex.  8. Just anything about people complaining, whether it be about stupid fans, people, or whatever.  9.  I'm glad the way I am. I definitely don't need to be a genius to be a roadie/band photographer, and that job doesn't require a drop dead gorgeous face either.  10. Definitely internal beauty. I've had personal experience where someone who really isn't the best looking seems gorgeous because of their personalities, and vice versa with others. Really the personality makes someone attractive or not, though not everyone is so patient to look deep enough.|`|W3gpfzj2aa	1)would u rather have a million bucks today or 100 bucks everyday of your life for the rest of your life----- (u copied the other person lol. I took their surve but whatever I don't care lol.) By the way, I'd rather have a million today. For all I know I could die next week. I think I shouldn't hope for the future. What if something happened?    2)this ones kind of gross +o(  would u rather have garlic butter rat tails or chewy Chocolate and caramel coated cockroach's eggs----- the chewy chocolate carmel coated cockroach's eggs. At least I wouldn't hardly taste it! :D    3)what would u do if i came up to u and gave u a big hug     4)this q has been asked like 40 million times just on y/a but i thought i would ask it too what do u think came first the chicken or the egg---- The chicken    5)what would u rather be:a prime minister or a tv celebrity---- T.v. celeb. More exciting!    6)who do u love more parents or grandparents--- My parents. I never met my grandparents on my mom's side they died. And my grandpa on my dad's side died when I was 5. i hardly remember him. My grandma on my dad's side, well let's just say I'm not close to her and don't talk to her much. So of course my parents.    7)do u have a best friend of the same sex or opposite sex--- Same sex. I go to an all girls school. :(    8)what is the most annoying q u found on y/a (other than mine lol)--- I'm not for sure. Mostly one's that don't make sense.    9)would u rather have a beauty makeover to make u beautiful for life or a brain makeover to make u the smartest person ever.--- Well I'm sort of smart already. And I don't wanna be smart all the time, everyone would expect me to do well abd be perfect. So I'll choose beauty.    10)last q be honest:  do u think internal or extarnal beauty is the most important ---- Oh, well to be honest.... extarnal...  I know it should be inner beauty. But sometimes I judge people but outer beauty. But don't we all? So I guess I'll try to start judging people by inner beauty.|`|kmPLOi5Yaa	$100 everyday for the rest of my life, it'll last longer    definitely the roach eggs, you cant go wrong with chocolate   = )    I wouldn't mind, its fun to hug strangers    the chicken    neither, I'd rather not be known    i love my parents more    both    something along the line of "hey baby *whistles*" (yes that was a real question on y/a)    i wouldn't mind being a little smarter but i don't exactly want to be a genius    internal beauty is the most important because then you actually have a personality as opposed to external where you're beautiful but that might be the only thing you've got going for you|`|8VSKLiuoaa	100 everyday for the rest of my life.

cwlgGB98aa	lincoln was born first so he took his fathers last name. But then his mom got pregnant again but left his dad while she was still pregnant so since she didn't have a husband, he put her last name on the baby.

Anyways, the shows good.      And as for " for the love of ray j" i don't plan on watching it  cuz that show is gonna be NASTY. Just from the previews alone and the fact that ray j is the whole point of the show is the reason why i don't want to watch the it. Ray j is nasty. i don't like him anyways.

I hate spelling errors like that..|`|emkT1a6raa	yeeeeeahhh.  someone agrees with me!!  and he talks like he's got a mouth full of ****.
fna0OfuCaa	Umm. A double shot at love is definitely scripted, there was an interview with someone from the first season with Tila that exposed a lot of the secrets, its all scripted. Paris Hiltons New BFF I'm sure was scripted, so is Super Sweet 16, and exiled. Date my mom, parental control, room raiders those shows are all fake. The Hills & The City are only half scripted.. The only show I know on MTV that is completely unscripted is The Real World.|`|YxCRA5N7aa	I so agree with Ashley C.!!!|`|aihogb26aa	Ashley C. is right...they are almost all heavily scripted and are often told what to say or are given a basic idea of what producers want to hear. And it's more than that...they often do more than one take of scenes so that they can get all of the camera angles and reaction shots that they want ( They do that on The Hills a lot).. They also often manipulate or set scenes up and even "cast" people to portray characters on the show. For example, Audrina on The Hills, had never even met LC or Heidi before the show. Producers saw her sunbathing at a nearby apartment complex and asked her to play the part of LC's friend.|`|7xMy4jmFaa	Umm yes. Plus i dont think those chicks are really that hot
vqg6wpCLaa	Maybe the question you should be asking is this:  How many people are annoyed when people incessantly talk about how much they love Twilight?     The answer: nearly everyone on the face of the earth. Twilight fans are the minority, so don't try to make yourself seem big. It's also not the books and movies that the haters usually hate - it's the damned fans! Of course we're going to hate them if the fans never shut their mouths! It's frequently quite annoying especially because they have a high level of stupidity.    Now, why don't you leave Comics and Animation and leave us at peace. I believe that Jokes and Riddles will gladly take in your Twilight questions.    Good day to you.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	We're annoyed at how much people rant on how much they love Twilight|`|r7bmz65eaa	meeee|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Twilight sucks.|`|AA11086232	I just find it a little shocking because how could you hate those books so much? i found them pretty addicting. however, i do have to say they are not all that well written but the story itself is very addicting. as far as twilight haters go, i think partly because they are jealous or annoyed at how much passion ppl have for those books. (it's especially clear when they complain about how much twilight sucks when they didn't even read the books themselves) the movie though is not very good.|`|dY61VnW2aa	lol u should change the question to how many ppl are annoyed when they talk about how much they love twilight?  so far i havent rly heard any1 say they hate twilight watsoever its usually "OMG!! twilight isss sooo goood!!! i looovvveee twiiillliigghhht!!" datz more like it....  i sumtimes get annoyed by that i guess....|`|NH0rB0twaa	Its kind of annoying. But people  do over obsess over twilight. I  think people just make fun of  twilight because they have nothing  better to do; even if they didnt read  it.|`|R8iz9ZM1aa	i dont mind it unless they havent read the book yet      like my friend "hates" the book but only read the first 2 pages|`|oyB861Swaa	I'm not annoyed.  I could give a...  If they don't like it it's really not my business or place to tell them what they should think.   I have my opinion and I happen to adore Twilight.   Some people don't.  That's okay!|`|Slyg7o6Laa	i itry to ignore them but i truly dont really care cuz they havent even read the bookj cuz most of them cant read and some ppl r really opsested with it though but i read all the books in two weeks & i loved it...|`|hoPEnlo5aa	i like twilight but i'm not annoyed when people hate twilight  i'm not obsessed with it|`|WNgHV0Csaa	I have to agree with Flamingo-guy. It gets really annoying when people never shut up about  the book. I just finished reading the series, and it really isn't THAT good.|`|ZRNJ4mH1aa	i dont really like twilight anymore....but i dont hate it. =)
lpyWVR2oaa	The Eastern Zodiac Signs work on the basis of a 12 year cycle and each animal is further distinguished by its element i.e. fire, metal, water, earth, wood.    You need to put in your BIRTH YEAR to find out your Eastern zodiac sign.

I have their most recent album (2006's self-titled album) but it is so different from their earlier days. Not so grunge and way, way more political.    Oh, and The Who and Queen too. The Doors.|`|yctQjQDTaa	Its because music is at a stall, the same thing that's happening now is what was happening in the late 1970's to the early 1990's. Its a bunch of Dinosaur Music executives, except unlike in the 80s where it was the baby boomers, now we have Generation X to blame, it seems the people who were all anti-corporate are all now part of a corporation, they forgot what the musicians of their decades said and now they are repeating the process, who did we see winning all the awards in the 80s and early 90s? People like Eric Clapton, people who were major points of the baby boomer generation, they refused to acknowledge the current music arena and only give awards big shows to the people of their time, rarely it seems that the really big artists who are/were in the now didn't get the attention they needed at the time they were the most popular, it almost seems like a neverending machine or even a paradox of sorts... and I didn't make any sense, sorry for my sub-par semi-rant :(    As for bands touring that don't really matter anymore,  Boston, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Cars, Motley Crue,  Poison, those among others, I love SP and The Cars... but they just aren't the same.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	George Clinton is still touring, and I'm not sure he ever was relevant.

PiPAIs31aa	LMFAO that's funny...k here's some for you:  Little Johnny went to school one day and the teacher was asking each student what their father did for a living. As she went up and down the rows she received the usual answers: firemen, policemen, doctors. Then she came to Little Johnny and asked him and he replied 'My dad is a gay prostitute!' Then the teacher asks him to see her in the hall and she says 'Johnny, is your father really a gay prostitute?' and he says, 'No, he plays football for the Chicago bears, but I was too embarrassed to admit it.'  not a little johnny joke, but hilarious regardless:  So, this teenage boy's parents were going out, so they asked him to babysit his five year old brother. He puts the kid to bed (they share a room, little brother on the bottom bunk bed, older brother on the top bunk) and he has his girlfriend come over. They end up in the bedroom on the top bunk, but he tells her they have to be quiet or his brother will wake up..so they start doin the dirty and she yells 'lettuce' when she wants it faster and 'tomatoes' when she wants him to slow down..pretty soon the little brother wakes up and says 'hey you guys quit making sandwiches up there, I got mayonnaise in my eye!'  hope you enjoyed :)|`|RXn6xO4caa	Johnny came running in the house and said "Ma, there's a flat dog outside".  "Don't be silly, there's no such thing as a flat dog. Go back outside and play" said his ma.  Five minutes later Johnny ran in again and said "That flat dog is still outside"  "How do you know it's a flat dog?" said his mum.  "Because there's another dog behind it pumping it up!"|`|tEoGnn8Jaa	Soryy but its madd long to read|`|zhK1PGioaa	LOL  =]|`|y1inpoULaa	Not that haven't been done to death, no.      Sorry.|`|ToN0dSMcaa	There were 3 people fighting for a cause. So they made signs and stood on the sidewalks. One sign said Save the animals. The other said Save the earth and the last said The End Is Near. one Stood in the Country One Stood in the city and the other stood near the bridge. The first person didn't seem as if anyone even glanced at the sign. No success with the second guy. But with the third person,people looked at his sign and thought nothing of it. But all of a sudden the third guy heard crashes coming from the bridge. He turned and saw that the cars had fallen into the water. "Well," he said,"I should've put the Bridge Is Out."|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Thats funny I answered a question 2 hours ago with that joke, here is proof of it    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
i8PdTgoLaa	It'll stay that way. To change it right click the song, click "get info", the the tab that says "artwork". Click on the picture you don't want and press delete. Right click and copy the album art that you want right back into that empty space then click ok and get out of it. If they still aren't going together, then do the same thing, click get info, and change the album name so that they're both the same.

HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH...    **************************************... are you doing with with your ******************************* life|`|FeZR63f8aa	THAT'S AWESOME!!! I play French Horn, and I've given a demo before like you're going to do, but I didn't get to pick a cool piece of music like that.    I would use a piano or something to find the same starting note, or just play your French horn until you find the starting note, then transpose it from there.  I've done that before with recorder/piano/French horn, back and forth.    Or, you might be able to ask your music instructor how guitar relates to concert pitches or to your instrument.    In any case, good luck, sounds like fun! xD    (...and ignore people that make fun of you for playing it.  I may not look like someone who plays French horn, but I do, and I don't let people give me crap about it :P)

Let him have his pot, it's not like he's doing meth or anything. I don't see the big deal, really.|`|F8GUqsqiaa	What an idiot, we as Americans should be ashamed that our country was represented by such a disgrace.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	I am disappointed. He is suppose to be a hero, but I still support him. I just hope his medals aren't taken away. I think he Just met a bad person and his mother probably sure showed him who's boss. She had a good talkin' with that boy. She wants best for him, so I am sure that she is mad and disappointed at him. Wants the best for him. I wonder if there was a connection between this and the London 2012 Summer Olympics. He will get back on track. But, this isn't his first run into the law. He was arrested for something else a few years ago. Possibly DWI, but I'm not sure. His life needs to be straightened out as he is a role model for many young children. Hang in there kid, because you don't want to fall like so many other stars.|`|HsrCk2J1aa	It's pot or marijuana.   Crack is a completely different drug.|`|AA12380746	He smoked off a bong...     and so what?      people need to get off his nuts.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think it just accounts for his wild and crazy look!|`|ZpmZy03maa	Crack is cocaine not marajuana.

Yeah, still not you.|`|Bru5jJZraa	Who cares if he does I don't get why people are so :o about it, the guy has to be a role-model 24/7? that sucks.|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	My opinion about him has not changed, I still like him|`|PtzcEh5Caa	lost some interest in him. i dont see him as that big hero anymore. now he's...like Garfield to me. sorry!\  and he just threw his life away. he had a great life and loving fans and that marijuana just put his great job down the drain.|`|wSq80V1xaa	It was weed.|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	weed, not crack|`|pjLtmjIiaa	it's pot..  not crack|`|ICLekd2Vaa	so he does a comercial? so what?|`|j7D3Sazraa	I think it's absolutely unjust for people to take this so seriously. I know people in 7th grade that have tried speed and pot. He's only 23. He's still a great guy. And all the people that judge him, they need to get a freaking life. It's not like he took out a machine gun, and shot his mom or anything. I saw that on the news, and some lady said she was so disappointed. She's a mental b!+tch. His business is no one else's business.

'7 Days to the Wolves' is a great song, btw.|`|KEk728Gsaa	Damn I was thinking about asking this exact question the other day, I just couldn't narrow it down to a few songs.    The most epic song is perhaps "Lateralus" by Tool. It's like 10 minutes long and the lyrics fit perfectly with the Fibonacci sequence, which is really, really cool if you ask me. A good tune to just sit back and listen too as well.    Other epic songs are  "Master of Puppets" by Metallica  "Black Rose Immortal" by Opeth  "Bleak" by Opeth  "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin  "Icarus - Borne on Wings of Steel" by Kansas|`|ucQxe2e4aa	i di not agree with all, but props on floyd.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	5 other songs which spring to mind are:    1.

Think about that. I like these answers; Eric Clapton, Roy Clark, and Django Reinhardt.   I would like to add some heavies, common and non common.   Leo Kottke  well brain went dead... because I keep thinking of Phil Keggae .    The Question: "Who is the best guitarist in the world?"    Rumors have followed Keaggy for years that Jimi Hendrix had supposedly named him as his answer to the question Johnny Carson asked him, "who is the best guitarist in the world?" while making an appearance on The Tonight Show. Another version of the story goes something like, "Jimi, how does it feel to be the world's greatest guitar player?" To which Jimi supposedly replied, "I don't know, you'll have to ask Phil Keaggy!" which according to some was from an interview in Rolling Stone or Guitar Player Magazine. Sometimes, the rumor is that it was Eric Clapton, or that it was on the Dick Cavett show. A recent variant has it that it was Eddie Van Halen on Letterman or with Barbara Walters who was asked the question. During live performances, Keaggy has mentioned it but personally thinks the rumors are untrue. However, because many of these shows did not keep archives of many of their early shows, it is nearly impossible to either confirm or disprove the rumors completely. Some fans have claimed to have seen the show in question, or read the interview but to date, no one has presented a tape, a magazine article or any kind of evidence to confirm it. Phil was asked this at one of his guitar clinics he held in California a few years ago and his answer was simply, "I don't think there is anything to it at all. I doubt that Jimi ever heard me play as he had died in England before I recorded with Glass Harp at his Electric Ladyland Studios in New York City. Someone told me years ago that when asked that question he replied, 'Phil Keaggy is the shortest guitarist in the world,' which is more believable."

Okay, Not much of a very "scary" movie. But it still is a horror. It's much better than Bloody Valentine, Uninvited and unborn. If the movie isn't there, then rent it once it come out.   But the best movie out of those three in the mainstream theaters is the unborn,even if they showed all the scary parts in the commercials. But it was just like the ring. Someone going around trying to find out why they are being haunted by a ghost. (Those movies are getting so lame)|`|6qsTmMQaaa	The Uninvited is very good.|`|LUg9dgb5aa	The Uninvited,  My Bloody Valentine 3D,    My Bloody Valentine Description,  Ten years ago, a tragedy changed the town of Harmony forever. Tom Hanniger, an inexperienced coal miner, caused an accident in the tunnels that trapped and killed five men and sent the only survivor, Harry Warden, into a permanent coma. Then, exactly one year later, on Valentine's Day, Harry Warden woke up--and brutally murdered twenty-two people with a pickaxe before being killed. Ten years later, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony on Valentine's Day, still haunted by the deaths he caused. Struggling to make amends with his past, he grapples with unresolved feelings for his ex-girlfriend Sarah, who is now married to his best friend Axel, the town sheriff. But tonight, after years of peace, something from Harmony's dark past has returned. Wearing a miner's mask and armed with a pickaxe, an unstoppable killer is on the loose. And as his footsteps come ever closer, Tom, Sarah and Axel realize in terror it just might be Harry Warden who's come back to claim them.

cz7qltkkaa	I actually think it could be Jim's. cause he dumped karen the very last episode of season 3, and the obviously had sex that day, because they had a hotel in new york.

Also when I was watching NBC earlier it came on again.|`|IC9ikMKoaa	Where did you see that preview!!|`|pUCe6F1Vaa	Because they went out not not too long ago and she looked pretty pregnant.  In the the preview they never said it was his baby, they just want you to think that so you watch.  You never know.  I can't wait to find out.|`|73gzvniqaa	He is definitely not the dad theres no doubt in my mind because him and karen broke up 2 seasons ago and that was like 2 years ago so unless he's been cheating on pam which i highly highly doubt especially after the scene between them on last nights episode, theres no way that he could be the dad.  And if you rewatch the preview and look at karens left hand you'll see that she sporting a ring so it's definitly not jims  Here watch it on youtube...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6SG_BlfR...

That is, unless they try to compare Jimmy Page to Nick Jonas, then they just ask for it.|`|JXTLpgUoaa	Teenagers these days are listening to music as old as 30 years old.  When I was a teenager, on average the furthest back we went was really about 15 years.  Sure a few people liked 50's music but not many.  Maybe its because Rock has a much deeper history to pull from now, or maybe its because a greater percentage of newer music really isnt all that good so they have to go back further, I really dont know.    Most generations have a hard time understanding other generations music.  I am now my parents who liked Elvis Presley who dont understand why I like Van Halen, because I dont understand Emo.    Trust me theres still a lot of crappy music that I listen to and like.    Its ok for music to just be "fun".    For teenagers especially music is a ticket into a social circle or a ticket out of one.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Thats extremely biased and close minded of you to say.|`|WwXQCRcgaa	Why do you care?    People are allowed to have an opinion you know.|`|pkWX3rbPaa	idk, because everybody else does?     one of my friends told me she was listening to "hard core" music, so i asked what and she said ne-yo. LOL|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Well I'm a teen and anyone that knows me knows I DO NOT like crappy music. What are you? a 60 year old Beatles fan or something? Get ur a$$ some Depends|`|RHAK3PUNaa	i bet your parents considered your music crappy when you were a teenager so ask yourself|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	Why does your avatar look like George Washington with black hair?|`|917b2cf1346cceecc3a29f80cf74a5c4aa	Great Question man.    People, by crappy music, he probably is insinuating everything pop, pop rock, alt. rock, indie rock, and techno.    It's cause they don't understand what really goes into music.  They just   "Oh, He plays guitar, he must be good at it and everything he does must be the best" and stuff like that.  Everything on the radio and TV is made to be catchy.  Catchy doesn't mean it is good though, which sucks so much.|`|8oDAhb7Waa	because Mtv says it's cool.|`|80t10xWGaa	Screw you, Enrique Iglesias is fantastic.|`|Pchvnsanaa	we don't listen to crappy music. we just have different tastes in culture than you. i mean the Jonas Brothers ARE crappy music and it annoys me that so many teenagers like them. But a lot of us listen to good music: Avenged Sevenfold, Breaking Benjamin, Hinder, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Fall Out Boy, Slipknot, Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, Brad Paisley, Linkin Park, U2, The Beatles, Jimmy Eat World, Blink 182, Goo Goo Dolls, Stone Temple Pilots, Third Eye Blind, Ok Go, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, The Killers, Three Days Grace, 3 Doors Down, Papa Roach, Boston, Quiet Riot, Blue Oyster Cult, Steve Miller Band, White Stripes, etc...    We don't listen to crappy music we just have different tastes. And it's only human nature to have different tastes. So if you've got a problem with the kind of music we like then obviously you're saying that God screwed up when he made up, and if you've got a problem with God then i suggest you stay away from thunder storms cause you're gonna get zapped.|`|5youb38Raa	Wait...lets say you consider Metal good music and consider rap crappy.  Someone else can find it the other way around.    But anyway..if by crappy music you mean Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato, etc..[i think they're crap music, but thats just me..] its b/c the media hypes them up too much, and doesn't hype up other bands AS much.|`|xhVe918waa	Crappy music? What is crappy music to you?    Please do yourself a favour and stop being so ignorant.|`|Yv5RYcmvaa	It makes them feel better knowing that you can live a crappy life and be paid for it (like the musicians they listen to) give me the old days man... miss them.

They alluded to that way back when Cole and Langston were planning Starr's surprise 16th birthday party last year.  And now ... Langston has really put the screws into Starr, blaming her for trying to protect her own father from himself.  She seemed pretty fired-up that Starr would actually hurt Cole in that way ... despite the fact that Starr was the one who carried the baby for nine months and suffered the loss just as much as - if not MORE than - Cole!    Yep ... I TOtally see Langston trying to "comfort" Cole.  I see them both getting together and laying all the blame on Starr for Cole's decision to react in the way that he's doing ... and I see Langston excusing her own behavior by reasoning that Starr messed up her relationship with Cole by lying on the stand.    Langston is already hot with Starr ... she's decided that Starr is no longer her best friend.

4Zj9eYgPaa	FULL METAL ALCHEMIST FTW!!!    ...    Sorry.    I kind of want them to make a new series. The manga has a lot of new characters (Ranfan ftw) and a much richer and wider plot. It's different from the anime on a lot of ways, and I would like to see those differences animated XD   You're right, they could allow a wider gap, but keep in mind that's Bones producing it, and Bones isn't exactly Studio Pierrot. Take Soul Eater as an example, they are already catching up with the manga so they will stop the series. They will probably return to it when they have enough material, they won't throw some fillers in it until they have enough material like Naruto.   Bones has made a lot of cool anime so I'm keeping my hopes high. ^_^|`|4UeOIGuhaa	I'm not looking forward to it. I'll be reading the Manga instead.|`|XNzj7b7Taa	i love the anime   i don't want any fillers though|`|cidwIuJRaa	I think it will be quite interesting to see how it turns out.    Due to the fact that I liked the original series,I am looking forward to the new one as well.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	If only and I wish that no one ever heard the news because as of now, I'm so impatient.    The first FMA may be different, but it was one of the best. Everyone, and I mean everyone, loves FMA. Very little people don't like the series. But, FMA is just awesome. Its on top of the charts.    Poor Arakawa though. So much pressure, and she hardly gets her breaks. D=    I agree with you that FMA doesn't have that sad or happy ending, and its not Happy Go Lucky either. I don't know how to describe it. This series just really blew me away. I loved FMA in Japanese and English audio. It was awesome.    Back to your question, I'm definately looking forward to the new FMA series.    The animation is new, and I'll have to adapt to it because I loved the older animation.

Until that time I think it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own timeless brand of loveliness. But his words smote me, because of course you see, I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of way and who would have it otherwise? I walk, and lets be splendid about this, in a highly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isnt far short of being, quite simply terrific.      The secret of smooth almost shiny loveliness, of the order of which we are discussing, in this simple, frank, creamy sort of way, doesnt reside in oils, unguents, balms, ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers, liniments, lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just one noble moment, it resides, and I mean this in a pink slightly special way, in ones attitude of mind.    To be gorgeous, and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you have to do is believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely. And I believe it of myself, tremulously at first and then with rousing heat and passion, because, stopping off for a second to be super again, Im so often told it.

0a3e8afcef784f7c3fadf1171e01b3e0aa	Not sure if he was involved or if he was trying to catch the developer's. It could just turn out that it wasn't him who shot Jack as we did hear another gunshot and they have discovered there was a third person there that night. Probably the developer who was due to meet Angelo.|`|fdI8OtNeaa	I think it was an accident, he didnt know Jack was following him.  Is he definitely dead??? That gives Martha something else to whinge about - honestly that girl has had the worst life ever!|`|2LVegVG5aa	Yes it was an accident, Angelo was trying to find out about the developers on his own but jack followed as he knew something was going on Tim fired at angelo while jack was hiding angelo couldnt see anyone and he heard a sound in the bush and just blindly shot into the dark and then found jack dead, he then left him there and went on to give a speech at his funeral while under suspicion by martha and charlie and he was later found out and beaten by tony and then arrested.|`|1uvnbVOXaa	it was a third party though Angelo is convinced it was him.

Yes, i've been a Transformers fan since i was a kid. they ruined the movie.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	wiki seems to have the most info about the upcoming movie.  including a bit about a new transformer named "the fallen" from the transformer's comic book in "The War Within".    I want to see who it is that punches Optimus Prime in the face.|`|2BmGwbvYaa	Sometimes movies switch dates. Twilight was moved into the new Harry Potter movies' place when it aired. Twilight was supposed to come out much later than planned. But when the news came out that there was a movie being made, the fans went nuts.       The producers were smart and asked to change release dates with the fifth Harry Potter movie. And they did.        That might be the same situation with this new Transformers movie.|`|RJd9Cprraa	The 2010 date was when it was first greenlit, when the first one was still in theaters.  It has been slated for 2009 for over a year now.  You can check out transformersmovie.com for a synopsis.|`|HIJudEeBaa	i don't know. i thinks its like the decepticons r seeking revenge becuz of megatrons death or something.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	its about robots that change into vehicles. oh! and they fight a lot.|`|3Z3ub5Pnaa	"Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle. " from IMDB|`|GNkR9R8baa	The battle for Earth has ended but the battle for the universe has just begun. After returning to Cybertron, Starscream assumes command of the Decepticons, and has decided to return to Earth with force. The Autobots believing that peace was possible finds out that Megatron's dead body has been stolen from the US Military by Skorpinox and revives him using his own spark. Now Megatron is back seeking revenge and with Starscream and more Decepticon reinforcements on the way, the Autobots with reinforcements of their own, may have more to deal with then meets the eye.     The date was changed because they were done faster than they thought they would be.

AA10916001	Inappropriate according to whom?    I find it to be interesting and entertaining.      In the big scheme of things, it is aimed at adults.|`|YrEQ3oHEaa	Just plain weird! I could be a little inappropriate.... I've never seen it, but I saw some commercials for it, those already had me saying... Weird!! And No!!!!! So yeah.|`|S3pgtJGpaa	I don't think Chowder is inappropriate, but it is kind of strange. The only thing close the inappropriate is once Chowder lifted his shirt up and it showed his butt bouncing and it said "sweet" tattoo on his butt. And one time Shnitzel made out with a check...  But otherwise, no. It's a good show over all.|`|B9Jn2YGhaa	i think its funny at times because of its stupidity but then yea i agree it shows some weird jokes and the plot is just no sense i dont see any think educational or significance|`|0Snb72lvaa	nope absolutley normal now a days if you think thats weird watch flap jack the blue guy drinks maple syrup like its alchol when hes depressed lol|`|gr8Oc9c9aa	I love that show, but some episodes have bad things that only adults would understand, so thats why its safe for kids.|`|AA10652430	Saw part of it the other day. Saw a scene where the purple thing (Chowder I suppose?) was begging one of his friends (older character with glasses) for a favor or something.  He kept saying 'please' 'please' 'please', and while he shrieked "please", for a split-second his face changed to that of a makeup-clad Chowder in DRAG, speaking in a sultry voice "Pleasee..." then changed back to his regular face. I'm like "WTF...?" lol  Other than that, I haven't watched it enough to comment much. :P  I have to watch it more to get a better opinion. Sometimes new shows are hard to get into. :P

kppEhBBgaa	I agree with you.  It's just warping the minds of a younger generation.  It's all corporate advertisement, and mindless shows with no meaning whatsoever.  MTV has also gone from a music channel to "reality" television.  There is nothing "real" about these shows, and most of the people in them are no role models.  How parents allow their children to watch these shows, and imitate these bad behaviors, is beyond me.

yjSGVfdiaa	The last few years have been a shift for me.  I still pick up old bands, but the majority of the time - I've been discovering new stuff.  Thanks to sites like last.fm, pandora radio, pitchfork, allmusic, said the gramophone, and many others.  Usually those new bands end up pointing me to older stuff - what they were influenced by, or former bands, but finding new stuff has been much more rewarding for me than only looking backward.    BA:  definitely Animal Collective - Merriweather Post-Pavillion    could end up being my favorite of 2009....  that album is beautiful|`|kSJTD2ONaa	I always go with the old.   I still check out tons of new music, but most of it as of lately lacks substance.  I'm always finding tons of forgotten indie bands of the 90s as well as finding obscure psychedelic tunes from the 60s that no one knows.    And as far as my favorite 09 release?  I don't have one.   Though I am awaiting the new Deftones album, (it's a shame about Chi, I wonder if the band will continue now) as well as the upcoming Akron/Family album.|`|fn5ijdnIaa	i do both, really. I like them equally if I'm hearing the right kind.    BQ: The Empyrean - John Frusciante  :) x|`|8oDAhb7Waa	Right now I'm doing both, like right now I'm checking out some bands I haven't heard yet that released some stuff not too ago while ordering some newer releases off amazon. But when I'm not looking for the ones I've overlooked I am looking for new bands. I've fell so far behind on searching new bands it's not even funny. In the past 2 days I've discovered like 12 bands I totally missed a few years back.    Favorite release so far this year? Vreid - Milorg|`|yuqZ6M96aa	old music; ive spent years going thru countless albums of the 60s 70s and 80s, i remember the 90s and right now mainly stick with listening to lots of 80s 90s 00s, mostly local bands from around the country and world that older musicians have shown me. i really only listen to new releases when told i must, i got a buddy that reads ap and magazines like that, i stay away from all types of publications and radio/tv so he lets me know about interesting new stuff    bq: i dont think ive got any new releases yet, but im really interested in the new algernon cadwallader, not sure if its been released yet though - oh yeah, the buddy holly collection called 'down the line: rarities' excellent but definitely not anything new|`|YlCgMDVwaa	New music is top priority for me.  I can get in touch with older music whenever I have the time.  Which I do have tons of time, so I technically do both all the time.    BA: 'Survivalist' by ABACABB|`|UnsZKr4saa	More of the latter, mainly because I'm more in touch with modern Metal than classic.    BQ: "Hordes of Chaos" by Kreator.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	New Music for me :)|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Definitely old. There are so many bands from the  past that I still want to check out. But I'm keeping up with newer bands as well.    BA: It will come out next week, I can't wait!: 'It's Not Me, It's You'- Lily Allen|`|7fEVNng5aa	Typically older stuff. I do like newer music, though. I prefer to shop in used record stores, where you're going to find mostly older music. If I miss something brand spanking new I know I'll get around to it eventually, even if I do kick myself in the butt for missing it when it was released.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Hi, f.i.g.!  Hmmm, good question! I think I'll go with keeping up with new bands and releases. Although I love discovering older bands, I like seeing newer, talented bands take off.  :)|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Old. There is so many important, basically historic songs that I haven't heard yet.|`|AA12301664	hmmm    when push comes to shove, the new stuff probably wins.  i will go backwards occasionally, but there's only so much money in my pocket.    don't think i've got a release from this year yet, but i am looking forward to the upcoming trail of dead.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Old music.   Despite growing-up on Classic Rock, I have found over the last couple of years that there is still so much of it I haven't heard yet!    I do listen to some new music ~ though mostly from established bands, or ones who started within the last 10 years...      BQ : Nothing yet for me|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	I prioritise both on an even scale. Im checking out classic rock at the mo like Van Halen, Deep Purple, Led Zep, Pink Floyd, ZZ Top, The Beatles, Rolling Stones and from that list Deep Purple are easily the best.    Since 07 I love Municipal Waste, Evile, Gallows, Satyricon, Enslaved, Opeth, etc.    BQ: The only new release i've got has been Radio 1 Live Lounge cause there looked to be a few intersting covers on it which they were but most of the rest sucked:(|`|y0hpaZi2aa	Nice question Jen:)    I really dont know to be honest, '08 was a chaotic mix  of both i guess. I had my discovering Pixies, Joy Division,  Radiohead stage(the latter especially I feel like a dipshit  for not checking out earlier) and then I found out about   No Age and I think thats when R&P(you) came in which brought   an overload of bands who had recent releases that I needed to check out. In fact, the list of bands I have on my profile(I guess there isnt one now) would look pretty sad if it wasnt for you. Im sure you know this   but for the questions sake im telling you again! I guess right now   im only checking out 2000's on stuff, the 90's are on a backburner(besides old E6 stuff) for now.(I'll have to really dig deep for something new)        BA: I want to get Animal collective's new record but I guess it  cant count as a favorite yet. If we're talking about bands ive discovered  in 09 ill give you 5(bands, you'll have to guess the releases!) The Whigs, Wrens, The Gerbils, Major Organ and the Adding machine, Animal Collective, and TV on the radio...Okay so I wasnt gonna leave  out Major Organ!!!    Wow, 10 misspellings... well im to tired to correct them!! Same thing  goes for if any of this doesnt make sense!!!    Really? I dont think I've ever done that, besides Pearl Jam of course:)|`|zpTIvQQaaa	Kinda hard, I've not been listening to "old stuff" lately, but I haven't really listened to stuff that came out recently either, I've been kinda looking at bands I've been listening to lately's earlier material (late 90's, early 2000's releases) I like to keep up with new releases though, some kind of satisfaction I get buying an album on the day it comes out...

plxV97hxaa	Don't give up. That's the most important thing.  Believe that you can do it, and you can.    Tips:  - Do lots of warm ups. You can find the professional ones [they're kind've odd, but they work well] by searching for them on a search engine.  - Take care of your voice. Don't sing within four hours of waking up, as this isn't good for your voice. It takes your voice four hours to really 'wake up' after the rest of your body has.  - Expose yourself to lots of music. This includes many genres. Listen to music you may not like, even.  - Find out your strengths and work on your weaknesses.  - Practice the songs you're going to sing over and over.  - Perform with lots of charisma; connect with the audience.  - Move around on stage.  - Have a back up plan in case you don't make it big.  - Get yourself known. Look on bulletin boards and the internet for singing competitions, or perhaps record a CD with you singing to instrumental versions of songs [they can be found on YouTube, and you can rip them off there with www.forinside.com], or since you play the piano, you could record you playing the music as well. Give copies of the CD to your friends and family.  - Write your own songs sometimes as well.  - Get as much feedback as possible. Not only positive feedback, but constructive criticism, too. Don't let negative comments bother you too much.    Good luck =)!|`|dZxjXHA2aa	Apply to the schools you want to go to...you can shoot for scholarships or take out your own loans so you don't need your parents' approval or support.

Im telling you go there with a nice box of chocolates or something you know he loves and if they are chocolates write on top ''life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you're gonna get''    then write ''Im so sorry, i acted stupid and in the wrong way and for that i am truly sorry. Send me a text back PLEASE! il be your best buddeh :]    LOL! men always get the women chocolates. Little changes at times would be perfect    Or anything else he likes!    Please tell me what that means because i don't understand!   ''Ok mr. im 32 and bald and a firefighter that makes only $30000 a year'' wtf!    If he doesn't respond then he is an a$$.|`|ZOoLgSSFaa	not gonna read all that|`|SYDaRM11aa	wow, that's a problem|`|i1T8yKhpaa	i read it ....u should go to his house with a teddy telling him how much u care and love him...tell him to give u one more chance..|`|PK9R1V8gaa	you'll have to wait a bit and actully prove to him you'll never act like that again. ask if he'll meet you at starbucks for coffee, and dress nicely~like in a nice shirt with a cardigan and your hair neatly combed~to show your more mature and are ready to talk|`|aQLDF2H7aa	It's a bit long for me too.|`|OilQvoLZaa	I can't help you, you like twilight (which doesn't deserve capitalization).|`|XTExSyv5aa	I read part of that and he shouldn't talk to you ever again!

Good luck!|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	face to face apoligy|`|yw3Jze2naa	well you already know you screwed up. you can't really do much more, im assuming you already told him that you were drunk when you did so and you didnt mean any of the crap you said and you misunderstood his saying and you completely overreacted. just hope he forgives you, dont constantly bug him about it more, it'll just make him hate you more. cross your fingers i guess.|`|qWqg7vFJaa	You say you would rather talk to him...So why dont you just do it and get it dealt with and the guilt also dealt with..|`|c5af1b2ca75df71428bec7b2f36a8296aa	too long...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|`|wDJRyzE9aa	AA|`|a6UuiDMWaa	I am sure you are forgiven already and this person understands, don't worry about it so much :)|`|RsYwCOeFaa	Well, just see if you guys can still hang out but change your behavior.|`|dDhMadf4aa	Did you just write a novel? xD|`|ahzL8uCKaa	i  would give it a week then never lie to him again plus valentine's day is coming up!!|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	I think you're going to have to leave it up to him.

And "Ok mr. im 32 and bald and a firefighter that makes only $30000 a year."?????   Whats that?|`|8R71JMumaa	Honestly, and this may not be much help, but all you could really do was apologize. Maybe he just needs some time to cool down and forgive. Just don't do anything crazy like trying to get him jealous or anything...All you can really do is apologize and tell him how truly sorry you are.|`|ToN0dSMcaa	Well,your friends are right. You should give him time first. The you should do something hugely nice for him. IDK what I mean by Hugely because Im not old enough to understand. Don't bug him over and over by saying sorry. Give him time and then find a way so you can talk to him and he might stop avoiding you (if you did) Oh and also,did you tell him you were drunk? Well, to some people Im like a miniature Oprah. So Good Luck!|`|0kZ8tePYaa	Now, don't take any offense to this, but you sound like a very dependent person. You need to take some time to yourself and clear up your life a bit. No more drinking and partying, you can see how it's affecting you as a person and hurting others around you. It's obviously not worth it. As for the guy, I don't see how he'd want to return, but maybe if you give him some leeway you'd be better off. Clear up yourself and maybe one day if he runs into you and sees how you've changed he'd think about giving it another chance. Although I wouldn't recommend it, it sounds like there are more problems involved. Find somebody who makes your good side shine the most and will make you truly happy. Until then, realize you can be happy on your own and you don't need anybody else in order for that to happen.     Good Luck To You :)|`|2LYIMahxaa	You goofed on his job AND income?! Leave him alone. He will never forgive you. Put a period behind it and move on.|`|pBGzoqAiaa	This guy shouldn't talk to you again.  You are making fun of a guy who is a firefighter because he only makes 30k a year?  It is gross how underpaid firefighters are.  I'd be proud to say I was a firefighter and could care less about how much I make.  It shows some people only care about money and not doing something they love.      He's 32 and bald?  Wow there aren't very many men like that in the world.  Wait probably about of 1/3 of us have some form of male pattern baldness by 32.  Besides I'm sure every bald guy wishes he was bald since it is something he can control.      I mean do you understand how hurtful it is to text something like that?  I don't care if you are sorry or drunk, it's no excuse.  This guy deserves someone a lot better than you.
ZyGyDLsDaa	The novel is mentioned/talked about or seen in each of these movies. In several, the novel plays a pivotal part, including "Conspiracy Theory:; and "Chapter 27", which is about Mark Lindsay Chapman; who murdered John Lennon.    Here are others:  Singles  Annie Hall  Big Fat Liar   After (2003)  Pleasantville  The Collector  Jerry Maguire  The Good Girl  Tropic Thunder  Chasing Holden   I Love Your Work  The Shining (1980)  Kicking and Screaming  Six Degrees of Separation    If the original novel for "Field of Dreams" had been followed, J.D. Salinger and his most famous book would have appeared in it! But, Salinger wouldn't give permission for the use of his or the novel's name in the movie, just as he continues to refuse to allow his story to be turned into a movie.    Actually, the lead character in "Rushmore" is patterned after Holden Caulfield, and people have "borrowed" the first or last name for characters. I didn't list any of those.|`|RJd9Cprraa	Conspiracy Theory|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Ghost World.|`|uo4Or00qaa	peter pan  (he didn't want to grow up)    honestly, no movie really connects with the book.

I also love Dangerous  but blood on the dance floor was  so catchy and had a sexy vibe.  although you cant beat thriller  I'd have to say Invincible was great  I love listening to "unbreakable"  and "threatened"  this is hard to choose from!!|`|ZeKnInbjaa	I'd have to go with "Thriller." It's really hard for me to choose a favorite though because each album has something very special to me on it!|`|HXpOui7gaa	OMG! Hmmm,, its a hard one.  Deffinitely between Thriller & Bad & Dangerous.  Overall probably BAD!  But i love the other two lots!!  I like off the wall, HIStory and Invincible, Bllod on the dancefloor etc, but i dont think they're s good.

AA10876072	Love Rachel Ray 30 minute meals.  We all need to discover something new to make.  Get stuck in the same old things like spaghetti, chili, hamburgers, meatloaf.      I love Gordan Ramsey in kitchen nightmares.  Makes you want to check out the kitchens in these dining places before you eat there.    Wouldn't that be funny to go into a place and say I want to inspect the kitchen before I eat here please.  I wonder what they would do.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	Kitchen Nightmares along with Hell's Kitchen are guilty pleasures of mine. There's something about Chef Ramsey, I personally enjoy the crazy things that he says to people, it is funny. I've never been a fan of Rachel Ray, I don't know why. I've tried watching her show a few times, I just don't care for it.|`|uxU5lOLYaa	I can't stand the two people you mentioned but I like cooking shows in general.  The best ones are the holiday shows.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Ray doesn't actually cook and I abhor her.    But I like shows like Kitchen Nightmares, Top Chef, Hell's Kitchen, etc.|`|D58bzW4Jaa	i love hell's kitchen with gordon ramsey|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	I love the cooking shows....|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I cannot stand Rachel Ray!  I love cooking shows so much! I'll just sit there watching those amazing cooks and wish that I could do some of those things. I'm a teenager.|`|AA11464088	Love it! I love Rachael Ray. Her magazine is amazing too!
r30KO1K5aa	It IS good, and I love Colin Hay's voice, but ALL the way to Australia? That's about 24 hours! :D   I like this one of theirs too- http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=swQi4CAzmr...|`|en9Xk0h2aa	Haha I wouldn't say 'epic' but it is a classic song.    Bloody catchy too.|`|NWwKrrC3aa	You do, thats who...
oLfcE5kXaa	I love it! (: One of the best songs 
fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	The Master (who I was shocked to learn The Doctor loved more than anyone else in the entire Universe) dying in his arms. Followed closely by Genny (The Doctor's daughter who I was shocked to learn that the The Doctor loved immensely even though he barely knew her) dying in his arms.     Oh and all of the times that he died were probably important too.
dZxjXHA2aa	Be original and get a signature...something about you that stands out from the crowd.  Get heard!!  Put a video on YouTube or your MySpace page, sign up for every singing contest you can find and take any opportunity to sing in public even if it's for free.  You want to be heard, you never who is listening!  Make demo and keep copies with you so next time you're singing in church or the national anthem for a local kids event you have them to hand out on request.  And send them to record labels with a photo and quick biography.  Pick up the City Paper or Philadelphia Weekly and check the classifieds...a lot of times local bands need a singer, even if just one gig and that could get you some good exposure!|`|JHnT32Dvaa	Try out for some musicals or see if you can sing at some like, restaurants or something.    Or American Idol.|`|85f5b4fcd39d295459a2a6ee7d6d0b87aa	american idol... or move to LA|`|mXMxsC6oaa	im not to sure about this stuff. but maybe ask at a pub or something that u cud play at and get a few gigs meet some people that can help you and if you are really good it will happen. Good luck.|`|Vu4SFGsqaa	Like the above commenter's say, try for American Idol or a musical. Also, you should get an opinion from someone you are not as close to, so you can get a good honest opinion. Hope I helped a little.
9CCtt077aa	Nah. She's just a tomboy. Sort of.|`|4WQ6GuImaa	tink so|`|HIJudEeBaa	hope not.  but then again, i don't like her that much either, so....|`|BKO5Y2ZDaa	She's kissed women but I don't know if she ever had a relationship with one so I'm gonna say no.|`|YORoyQlPaa	lol i have been wondering and pondering for years and years. and my conclusion is...    maybe.    she really is like a tom boy to me, and she likes guys for sure.. but wtb girls??|`|oJpH2OiXaa	I've never heard that before. A girl can be a tomboy without actually being attracted to girls.
AA10409668	I'd go with silence.  ----------------|`|Vhq3GURQaa	An empty thank you at least acknowledges that you are aware of manners. This is necessary for minor polite responses from strangers. If it is someone well known to you an empty thank you (if the other person was trying to be nice. ) Silence is better than the sarcastic thank you with obligatory eye roll.|`|1hiImyBdaa	"Thank you".|`|a6QK1oQFaa	silence :)|`|AA11173475	silence|`|aQLDF2H7aa	A breast rub is always nice.|`|9fZfwfe9aa	Silience|`|frA6KJwIaa	an empty thank you is a lot less rude than silence in my opinion.|`|qsg8wCBiaa	def silence, lol|`|qD2wkU1Vaa	Silence.   Don't waste your breath if you don't mean it.|`|e8icUia3aa	I kind of like the sarcastic thanks|`|a6UuiDMWaa	Silence not everything needs a thank you|`|RsYwCOeFaa	Silence|`|7RUqEJzLaa	What? Like if you hold a door for someone? Well an empty thank you, because then they know how to use manners. But.. at the same time if you're not meaning it, then why say it. :S   It's hard to choose..|`|0cMVKUnAaa	Silence|`|JD3yWKNGaa	An empty thank you because I hate awkward silence.|`|fpimGI3baa	Silence|`|dw2iHuzraa	Silence|`|lW0dmKmvaa	I prefer the perfunctory head nod.
AA10409668	Silence is golden.  ------------------|`|Vhq3GURQaa	As my personal life coach says "Stupid is as stupid does" Forrest Gump.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Better to say nothing when you don't know what to say.  If it is to someone who has experienced great loss; just say you are sorry, give a hug if appropriate and leave it at that.  I vividly remember the dumb things people unintentionally said when my full term daughter died at birth.  One that I particularly remember was "What did you do with it"?  Very insensitive.    Just convey that you care.  That alone is priceless.  Non-verbal speaks louder than verbal anyway.  If you've already said something stupid, apologize in a way that they know you didn't intend to be insensitive.  You may save the friendship.  Everyone makes mistakes.  If you can't rectify, forgive yourself and go on.  And forgive others who say stupid things to you.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Say what you want|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Noting.|`|xXyy51Efaa	Say nothing at all, because you don't get as much criticism as saying something stupid. X)|`|VSfiigz3aa	silence is the golden rule in this case.  If you say something stupid to a girl then you are in the dog house.  If you say something stupid in class, people laugh at you.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	nothing at all|`|03i9D71eaa	nothing at all depending on how u want your apearence to be|`|l1pewZpaaa	Nothing because then you won't say something stupid      Silence can be interpreted many different ways|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Say nothing at all|`|8a1d6ccf0d0d55393c413e0362906d9eaa	i think its better to say nothing at all, becuase if yuo say something stupid you just embarrassed yourself...:] ?|`|eiEdUWNbaa	It's better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.|`|tEoGnn8Jaa	its better to say nothing at all because if you do, then they'll fight back|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Nothing at all.|`|ahzL8uCKaa	i don't|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	because it is one of the TROLLS rules|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	Nothing because if you say something stupid you might regret it.|`|siTibEIGaa	Silence is  a virtue|`|yT3ZNEROaa	Nothing at all at the risk of hurting a sensitive persons feelings.|`|AA11825776	Say Nothing, I don't like to say stupid things.|`|j0gtbpS1aa	better remain silent and everyone think you a fool than to open your mouth and confirm their suspicons.|`|z8QQY2Meaa	Depends on how stupid it is. Sometimes it's productive to say something to get a conversation going.    However, if you have really nothing to say, don't say something with a negative effect in order to start the conversation. It could go horribly wrong.|`|MfCxMOPCaa	I think go ahead say something stupid! it's all good. atleast your voice was heard thats better than keeping quiet.|`|AA10531094	say nothing at all  because you'll show how stupid you are|`|C90bta8Saa	be you! if that is stupid then be stupid|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	I always say something stupid and then the other person (or people) either laugh or look at me like im strange. Otherwise saying nothing results in an awakward silence and I always break an awkward silence by saying "awkward"|`|2o9P1da6aa	say nothing at all cause then you won't look stupid|`|tI0rkxeuaa	Better to keep you mouth shut and be thought a fool,  Than to open it and remove all doubt.|`|awyNp31caa	nothing at all...you can't get made fun of that way xP|`|4WQ6GuImaa	nuthinnn|`|cTKxaiJLaa	say nothing at all|`|M5J5Ku6Raa	Say something stupid. It may not be as stupid as you think it is.|`|zntOXCfuaa	I think it's better to say nothing at all, because if you choose your words, people will listen to what you say.  That's my line of thinking, since I'm usually quiet.|`|NEEVRp16aa	My lips are sealed....|`|7TArEhEBaa	nothing at all, because then people don't think you're weird if you say something stupid.|`|I8iFm8Qkaa	say something stupid...  Maybe whoever is listening needed a laugh|`|JD3yWKNGaa	Say nothing at all because then you won't embarrass yourself.|`|PzU8u2LSaa	say nothing it avoids more problems|`|150e076f660112479385c22c1c1c2b2eaa	I think its better to say something nice.|`|a5zfxLqEaa	I think it's better to say nothing at all because you won't go through life regretting saying something stupid.|`|T3rpHfGVaa	Nothing at all. I have had LOTS of experience saying stupid things and feeling like a total idiot. If you don't say anything you don't need to feel embarrassed.|`|0TQKFdBpaa	nothing ast all that way you don't end up saying something stupid!    -Cheyenne-|`|a6UuiDMWaa	Say something stupid being quiet all the time makes you a quest shy person that nobody wants to approach|`|j6RDbnl6aa	nothing at all.  people get butt hurt easily and its no fun when they do.|`|124a0bbcc24398b278b496723141494baa	say nothing at all you're better off that way|`|DNBYSdoVaa	nothing. who wants to look stupid?|`|3AfgkblXaa	Say nothing at all if its stupid it they could hold it against you for awhile.|`|85gpKa4saa	nothing at all. cuz if you say something stupid, you'll probably regret it|`|og9XQSLgaa	Nothing at all.  People are very judging, so if you say something stupid some people may judge you as a stupid person, even if it was just one statement.    If you say nothing then you won't be judged unless someone is super observant of your quietness. o_o|`|aO5uVFwIaa	nothing at all|`|UEqiglhCaa	It depends on the situation. If your going to hurt someone its better to say nothing at all but if its not going to hurt anyone then you can say something stupid.|`|RsYwCOeFaa	Well, silence has always worked in my favor, but if you couldn't give what this person thinks about you, say somthing stupid. It gets stress out|`|QLJH3Dclaa	It's better to say nothing at all.|`|kkCF1oSzaa	depends on the situation. in a date kind of situation or a guy you happen to like, it's better to say something stupid than say nothing at all. beats having the awkward silence. amongst family and friends, it's better to say something stupid than nothing at all. but up against your parents and teachers, it's best to say nothing at all than to say something stupid.|`|TQuSnnlVaa	it depends on the situation  if it was hanging out with friend saying something stupid usually works pretty well  but if it's in a serious situation like a job interview say nothing at all  the last thing you want to do is seem stupid to some one who you want to impress|`|0L0llku8aa	nothing at all. You would look quiet and not stupid.|`|kOMFVL2Caa	it depends if you are in a akward moment then yes  if you are asked to answer a question you don't no then no it would be smarter to act like you didn't hear it|`|Yg2iIneKaa	Say nothing.|`|K9QpF4S3aa	say nothing because if you say something stupid and people think you dumb or something, your scared to say something else without feeling stupid again|`|x5mDmNlOaa	say anything..........it is only in your head ..............but don't say anything dumb|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	My daddy had a motto he lived by; he said "A still tongue makes a wise head".     If we listen before we speak chances are what we have to say will mean something and help somebody.

You can also buy a tuner card for your computer and use it to get the live TV signal.

IXg2gLVUaa	yeah, it depends on the quality of the dj. For a party like that, assuming i brought all of my own equipment, and it was atleast a 2 hour minimum, i would charge 200 an hour.    Save yourself the money and just use an ipod.|`|OH3P4rA5aa	Wow, 13th birthday party and you want a DJ? Are you nuts? Maybe at your 16th birthday party, but 13th?

The guitarist from fear Factory, I forgot his name for some reason, but he has played solos like that.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I think  Dimebag, but It's hard to compare guitarists because they all have different styles. You can't compare: Slash - Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page - K.K. Downing, Kirk Hammet - Stevie Ray Vaughn ...|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	They are both great in different ways there is no doubt they will have a heavy influence on young guitarists everywhere but they have totally different styles. I think they are equal in talent just different in the type of music and the style they use.So You both Have a valid argument.|`|Y5XRdMlfaa	Tom Morello!!!|`|YwtXSUAdaa	If you are talking about more creative, influential and has a style that can't be imitated, then it is obviously Tom Morello. He is one of the most creative and influential guitarists ever. No offense but Dime didn't really ever do anything extremely creative.|`|qLqYSeqRaa	Tom Morello may be a bit more original, what with the cool effects and stuff, but Dime is more skilled. So I say Dimebag  RIP Brother Dime|`|rPhP8CJWaa	well dimebag of course he doesnt use effects so he is a true guitarist tom morello is good but when he just plays guitar he cant even come close to dimebag|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Dimebag is obviously more skilled, but Tom Morello is more creative. In the end Dimebag wins.|`|JXTLpgUoaa	I like em both but truth be told I'm a much bigger RATM fan that I am a Pantera fan.    But Dimebag's got the skill on this one.  Morello's cool but dont get blinded so much by cheesy effects.. thats a custom guitar hes got and the stuff he does isnt really possible on most guitars.|`|gbm71puSaa	Dimebag is better. He didnt relie on a bunch of effects to make wierd noises when he did a solo. I like Morello but his thing he does for every solo in every song wears on me.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	So using effects is considered creativity? Hmm.. I guess I lack. But anyway, Morello is more familiar with the creativity and influential BS, but Mr. Darrell (may he rest in peace with the other deceased guitar gods) gets the entire cake. He's got the skills, he's got the speed, and hell, he never used effects. And I'm a bigger fan of Pantera anyway.    So to answer your question, Dimebag.    Like several answers above me, you're comparing two entirely different styles of guitar. That's like comparing Ludwig van Beethoven to 50 Cent.    And, dude, c'mon, don't argue with the ol' lady, she is right on this one.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Dimebag is clearly the more skilled guitarist. Tom Morello is great because he is creative with effects and has cool sounds but He cant touch Dime's       Can I have your girlfriend?|`|IydsHlfqaa	I love all three bands that you mentioned, but I think Dimebag Darrell was a much better guitarist. Don't get me wrong, I think Tom Morello is great too.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I'm sorry dude but I think your girl friend is right. Dimebag is one of the greatest metal guitarists of all time, in my opinion. I think Tom Morello is overrated, but still really good.|`|qcXXtcRRaa	i have seen them both live, if you want to take straight guitar playing its dimebag, creativity its morello, and remember its two different types of music styles, almost like comparing hendrix to stevie ray vaughn. you cant its two different types of music|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	They are totally different styles of guitar. Each is better than the other at their own particular style. Morello is the best at the effects and such, and I think Morello is a more influential guitarist and part of a more influential band (I hadn't heard much of Pantera before R&P and my most of my friends have no clue who they are and many of them know music very well...)    I'll take Morello...|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Im sorry dude  but heres another vote for dimebag and your gf

Just like most rock musicians.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	The damage is done and there is no way to reverse it.  The ringing will eventually go away.|`|Ai6XsCNfaa	Yeah my remedy is to get water stuck in your ears and it usually works.  It may sound weird but it's worked for me.  But if not, I suggest you go to the doctor and get help.|`|FtWm5fR1aa	pull your fingers in and out of your ear    but it will eventually go away    :)|`|jpoY9463aa	well i usually get water stuck in my ears then lay on one side till the water unplugs then the other side ten it normally gos away

I don't get why people take offense when celebrities don't share their secrets with the whole world. Selena isn't "living in a box" and hiding things from us. She's setting a good example for the little kids that look up to her. Whereas Miley does something stupid, says it's a mistake, and all the little kids think it's okay to do that as long as they say it's a mistake. -_- You don't have to know everything about a celebrity... if you did, that would be called "stalking".|`|TApVoMdAaa	none nope nada zilch neither|`|sQuahbP9aa	well this is coming from a 15 year old guy so i ll do it by some categories  acting:selena gomez to me is a very good actor for her age as is miley but selena to me is better  singing:both can't sing but selena aint that bad so i ll go with selena here  dancing:no clue in this one but we ll give it to miley  better person:obviously selena i mean miley just doesnt act the right way and i really wouldnt be her friend or her boyfriend as with selena i would be her friend and her boyfriend so for me selena is just a better person and shes really pretty actually but this is just my opnion|`|lM2x2i0maa	I think Selena's cute cuz she looks like a chipmunk lol|`|QV02KUDRaa	neither...both suck majorly|`|iNKnyj7Qaa	Out of them.

I think it acctually could make a good story line, but it seems like a bit too much of a girlie girl kind of book with girl drama, and not enough suspense- using celeb names also will kinda take from it, because now the reader probably has the celebs in their head when reading them, and that would just ruin it.   If you fix the names and spice up the story, ungirlieify it then maybe

He sat down next to a  blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV.     The 10:00 PM news was coming on. The news crew was covering a story of a  man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.     The blonde looked at Bob and said, "Do you think he'll jump?"     Bob says, "You know, I bet he'll jump."     The blonde replied, "Well, I bet he won't."     Bob placed a $20 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"     Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy on the ledge did  a swan dive off the building, falling to his death.     The blonde was very upset, but willingly handed her $20 to Bob, saying,  "Fair's fair. Here's your money."     Bob replied, "I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 PM  news and so I knew he would jump."     The blonde replied, "I did too; but I didn't think he'd do it again|`|HrW8DUHpaa	a little girl went through the grabage and found a condom. she went and asked her mom what it was and she said a twinkie wrapper honey. the little girl smiles and says "good because i licked all the cream off"       i think its gross but funny|`|LO3BMobRaa	1) This young boy walks in on his parents having sex and gets pissed. His father however just laughed at him, so the the boy walks down the hall into his grandma's room and starts having sex with her. His father walks in to check on him and sees what's going on, and yells, hey man WTF. Then the son says uh hun you see it's not so funny when it's your mama is it?    2) There was this sailor and this soldier that had both died in a war at the same time and they both arrived in Heaven at the same time. St. Peter came and gave both of them their wings, but he warned them that if at any given time they had any inappropriate or unclean thoughts, their wings would automatically fall off. Just as they had put their wings on, this beautiful angel shimmed passed them with a nice smile and smellying real flesh and clean, and the soldiers wings fell right off. Then when the soldier bent over to pick up his wings, the sailors wings fell off.    3) There was this stripper at this bar who was notorious for her split that she did at the end of each of her acts. One day she got ready to do her act, and right before she went on stage, a cat (guy) spilled a drink on stage and it didn't get mopped up too well. So this time when she got ready to do her split, she lost her balance and hit the floor so hard that it took two hours and forty five minutes to break the suction. You should have heard the round of applauses she got when she hit that floor (LOL).    4) There was this couple that had been married for ten years, and for their tenth year anniversary they decided to go back to the same hotel they were in ten years ago for their honeymoon. They went back to the hotel and even got in the same hotel room they were in when they honeymooned.They drunk champaigne and everything was just perfect just as it was ten years ago when they got married. They where starring at each other from across the room in their robes, then they took the robes off. At a given signal they ran towards each other, but since they had been drinking all that champaigne they missed each other and the cat flew right out the window like two flights down. The bell man came rushing outside because he heard all this noise. The man says get me something to cover myself with i'm naked here I need to walk through the lobby so that I could get back up to my room. The bell man says you don't need nothing to cover yourself with, if you want to get back to your room, you can just walk on through the lobby because ain't nobody in the lobby. The mans says what you mean ain't nobody in the lobby, the bell man says ain't nobody in the lobby because everybody left to go upstairs to watch 'em take this chick off the door knob.    5) A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of b---s who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of b---s who are getting on, get your --ses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the --*ch in the kitchen

Catsy82Caa	frank zappa was a sick guitarist. he released a boatload of instrumental guitar solo albums.     joe satriani is another popular instrumental guitarist. i take it you already know about vai, malmsteen, pertucci, van halen, etc. shredders.    eric johnson (you may know him from guitar hero) is insane as well. don't forget about jeff beck.    and then there are bluesier players like gilmour, clapton, page, hendrix, and so on and so forth. i like that stuff the best.    mark knopfler really knows what he's doing. check out sultans of swing and telegraph road by dire straits.    i dunno if any of that is what you're looking for but, hell, beggars can't be choosers|`|KTCR5XP8aa	"Doesnt Remind Me" by Audioslave has by far the BEST solo I have EVER heard.

AA12397801	My Definition:  They are mod souls. Mod souls were created in the soul society but then banned and destroyed. Only a few are left including those that are with Ichigo and the rest. Most mod souls were made into little pills but after they were banned, all of the pills were destroyed. The mod souls that are with Ichigo and his friends now were given to them buy Kisuke Urahara to help them sense bounts. The mod pills were put into stuffed animals so that is why Ichigo's perticular mod soul is a bird. (Because it is a stuffed animal) There are four mod souls that are introduced in the Bleach anime. [Kon,Lirin,Kurodo,and Noba]    Here is more info that I got from wikipedia:    Modified souls (, kaiz konpaku?) are artificial souls created by Soul Society researchers some time before the start of Bleach's storyline. They were created to reanimate the dead bodies of humans to act as a formidable fighting force, but this was found unethical and they were ordered to be destroyed. Four modified souls have been introduced in the series thus far, each having been saved from destruction. All have enhanced speed and strength when compared to normal humans, and often special abilities which set them apart from each other.[55] Each typically inhabits a plushie with all of their abilities intact (albeit scaled down to fit their size). The three introduced in the anime's Bount arc also possess a personal gigai (?), a synthetic human body, that they can use to avoid attention and otherwise regain complete use of their abilities.    Hope i helped =]|`|1RtGjzTUaa	They are a set of three Soul Mods, one is a bird (Lirin), one is a rabbit purse(Kurodo) and the other a turtle(Noba).  They are basically like a con (the yellow stuffed teddy bear).  They were basically designed by the technology bereau of Soul Society to help fight hallows, but are now more in the use of allowing the death reapers (shinigamis) to   1. Get out of their bodies (gigais)  2. Help the gigais move to a safer place so they will not be able to be vulnerable.    When they were fighting the Bountos, these three are basically related from the bountos (the bountos came from modifying death reaper souls) these three could detect their spiritual pressure or reitsu.    Ichigo would carry around Lirin, Orihimi carried Kurudo and Chad carried Noba (nova in english)    The three special soul mods|`|wCGeer97aa	Do you mean hell butterflies? if you do then those butterflies are used to guide a soul reaper or send messages|`|T8CHurVaaa	Goku wins.
fJt5zRTXaa	Shinigami Eyes are eyes which can see both the names and lifespans of humans floating above their heads. If a God of Death drops his or her Death Note to the human world and a human picks it up, that Shinigami can give the human Shinigami Eyes at the expense of taking half of that human's remaining lifespan.    Humans who follow through with the "eye deal" gain the ability to see other humans' names and lifespan, but cannot see their own lifespan or the remaining lifespans of other Death Note users. They also gain 3.6 times their current vision, as revealed by Tsugumi Ohba in Death Note: How To Read 13.|`|WRFvfBExaa	I think that its more along the lines of that you make a deal with a shinigami to trade half of your lifespan for a pair of shinigami eyes? I dunno ^^.|`|XQpZADDGaa	No, you trade half your lifespan for eyes of the shinigami, and you can see anyone's lifespan except yours and another owner of the deathnote. You can only see you and the other holder of the deathnotes name.|`|GzpFvgVAaa	No, it's when the death note owner makes a deal w/ the shinigami. In trade for the eyes, the owner gives up half of their remaining life span to see the names of other people. (:  happy anime watching! ^__^|`|vqg6wpCLaa	A person can only get the Shinigami eyes by trading with an actual Shinigami, being the one that originally had the Death Note. They trade half of their lifespan for the eyes, and then are able to see the names of their foes and how much time they have left to live. Misa does the trade twice in the story, halving her life twice.|`|uctxzjIIaa	They simply request it from the Shinigami who is attached to them by way of the Note (and give up half their remaining lifespan in the process)|`|wCGeer97aa	NO! it's not from over using the note book it's trading half of your lifespan for the eyes tha allows you to see someone's name or lifespan exept for someone who is the current owner of another death note|`|Slyg7o6Laa	the shinigami that the book belongs to .. they can trade their eyes for half of thrie human life span from them..  it allows you to see BOTH someones true name & lifespan|`|dY61VnW2aa	no its from trading with the shinigami...  u exchange half of ur lifespan to get the shinigami eyes

I think you're thinking of the Benny Hill theme music though:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcNhDstL4...    They've used that music and bit in a couple episodes. If we're thinking of the same one, its Homer saying "Oh no. Its Helen Fielding." ( the writer).

I asked for 4 kids meals, 3 girls and one boy. you know to get the right toys.  and the lady goes "ok you want three boys, and one girl?"  "No, its three girls, and one boy"  "Ok, so thats a big mac, a ceaser salad, two medium diet cokes, 4 happy meals, 3 boys, and one girl,"    i could have smacked her.  yeah and she gave us three boys and one girl.|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	thick headed? or thick waist?    both|`|ICLekd2Vaa	no, they train you for that!! :))|`|bFfdbWk2aa	no most of the people there are average|`|uQrIdrjfaa	ur a jerk|`|6UlOorwMaa	thick as in brain or waist?   lol|`|AA12155452	Not at all ..... working in McDonalds is simply a thread in the rich tapestry of life.|`|a6UuiDMWaa	So I take it you are in a very bad mood then..... how about wanting to earn money|`|s6RPiUE8aa	Yeah it must be cause they said i failed my interview|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	thick as in fat?

Hats off to them, I don't envy their job!|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Wow that is really rude! I'm guessing that you must have had a bad experience to write that. I do know what you mean though. They always give me the wrong food or something. And it doesn't even taste good. I don't know why I bother. When I first saw your question, the reason I thought "how mean!" is because my younger brother (who is very intelligent and a very hard worker) applied for a job at McDonalds but they had the cheek to turn him down! How dare they? Maybe it's because they could see that he wasn't thick! Anyway, he works as a Trainee Mechanic at a Garage now! Ha ha! He's wayyyy too good for McDonalds!     |`|AA11569882	I applied when I was sixteen, and was told I was 'over-qualified'.

The Joker, who is often considered The Bat's arch enemy (and l love some of his jokes). What I like about him is that he uses his brains rather than his brawn.

My next favorite is probably Manbat or Clayface because l love the stories of how they became what they are.

I would pay any price.|`|5rESfAItaa	Im already gorgeous. I don't need it.    EDIT: Sorry, I meant to say drop dead gorgeous. Silly me.|`|2Hqb8lmjaa	Where do i get it? What is the cost?    TELL ME NOW PLEASEEE X|`|4TNJcyaqaa	no cause im happy with what i got and i still have the ability to see color.|`|RUFk8Vxeaa	Hell yes I would.  And fornicate as much as possible.  That's worth color blindness :):):)|`|0TQKFdBpaa	nope.  jesus made me beautiful  already and earth   is more beautiful  than anything!|`|7XVEbkEgaa	no i dont want to be that  perfect or beautiful|`|GoWPQvgHaa	That I know of, alcohol is the only beauty "pill" on the market nowadays.|`|lFqm9XlUaa	um, maybe I would have to try it first. but most likely no.|`|Voa3zqGFaa	No i am sexy|`|vGiXqViXaa	no i wish i could but i need to see colors|`|5jqfKDdfaa	No im beautiful in my own way...i dont need pills|`|0zHj2nZqaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. the beauty the pill transforms you into may not be beautiful to some. Therefor I accept my self the way I am, and love seeing in color so I would not take the pill!|`|SRFfaKbCaa	I think anyone who says YES to this question needs to feel more beautiful about themselfs inside!!!|`|cpZOqe5waa	depends... would you just be beautiful for that time you had it? then you could gain weight and be ugly. or forever.|`|U7E7Sn2eaa	No|`|URo3Ee4oaa	Yeah.|`|PAZWfnFtaa	Intriguing; you become beautiful, but you can never experience beauty.  Since I don't have to look at myself but I can look at other stuff, I think I'd rather stay as is.|`|qtjFD2qqaa	No! Besides Im already pretty good-looking. Not hot or beautiful but good. And losing color vision would suck!|`|AA10876072	No, I like everything in living color.    Beauty comes from within.      Therefore, we can all be beautiful without a pill.|`|o4tblEZaaa	No. I believe that the beauty of a person truly lies on the inside. Plus, even though my vision isn't terribly good already, I'm fine with the way I look, and I want to be able to see the gorgeous spectrum of colors that inhabits our sight! Sure, everyone has their insecurities, but it doesn't matter. It is materialistic to favor outer beauty over the beautiful colors of this world.|`|NdTy3twjaa	No, I am who I am and that outer appearance wouldn't chance a thing.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	sure, whatever.|`|f0c95deaaf11cb4f884379031898dea3aa	Just once.    Only once.    I love the colors.|`|kkCF1oSzaa	no, because real beauty is skin deep, and if you can feel beautiful inside, that's what should really count. not how you look on the outside. even if one thinks of beauty on the outside, what use is it if you can't truly see your own beauty? colour is crucial. what happens if you want to wear make-up? what happens when you go shopping for some clothes? how are you going to know if the colour is right? how are you gonna know if it matches something you have? what happens on valentine's day when you are given a rose, but can't tell if it's red, or white, or black, or yellow, or pink? these are all things to consider. anyone would mistake you for a blind person.|`|IUpwBn2Taa	I look beautful anyways. I don't need a pill|`|30Q1007vaa	no, I wouldn't  I don't hate myself that much|`|nuLroEjraa	yeah i'd take it.|`|WQjDQgB9aa	Sacrificing seeing beauty so you can be it..hmm.  No, I wouldn't do it if it were irreversable.  Actually, probably not at all.  Just because it sounds way too immoral. lol|`|VPNP5Irfaa	no  being beautiful is not what matters in life  and everyone is beautiful in their own way|`|IhUEzjjYaa	nope. I'd rather see the beauty of the world in color than have people staring at my beauty.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	probably but im already kind of pretty...|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	Nope, not at the moment.  I'm satisfied with my appearance.    Ask me in 30 years.  I'd probably reply differently/|`|lvOjxwjNaa	im gonna be honest, yes i would.   im not bad looking, and i dont care that much how i look. But i think seeing in black and white would be AWESOME|`|CpUJI8adaa	no, i love the way i look ,i believe people should appreciate the way god made them. im thankful for the way i look ,im not the best looking person in the world BUT, im not ugly either, i have to remember this is the way god made me , why complain he made me in his OWN image, i cant mess with that, no pill ,surgery,or anything would make me alter his creation. we are all perfect in his eyes. god bless ,|`|T6wCgLSvaa	Yes.    As much as I love color, I would be willing give it up so I wouldn't look in the mirror and be disguisted by my appearance.|`|shvhgzXeaa	No I am happy with how I look.
dmxnblomaa	Mr. Darkwing you already know, Leo's with the hottest fire the sun! People can't even put us out, we have the most fire, just think about how long will it take for the sun to burn out. We are rulled by the sun, that star is always burning.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	Aries is the leader of Fire, it's like a forest fire very powerful    Aquarius is the leader of Air it has the strongest quality's     Capricorn is for Earth it's a born leader fair and just    Scorpio is for Water it's the most intense in emotions|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Leader of the pack  Fire - Leo  Air - Aquarius  Water - Scorpio  Earth - Capricorn|`|HZxX9ke8aa	technically, it should be aries since it's a cardinal sign. cardinal signs are initiators, they are naturalborn leaders. period.|`|MtANnIlfaa	This is my opinion, which doesn't mean that it's true.    Fire: Aries  Water: Scorpio  Air: Aquarius  Earth: Capricorn|`|vfedIVuOaa	Leo. The Lion will always make sure that the other Fire signs know that THEY are in charge and not the other way around.    All the Fixed signs are the pack leaders:    Fire: Leo  Water: Scorpio  Air: Aquarius  Earth: Taurus    The four most stubborn are usually the toughest(Fixed).|`|tMPqa9rYaa	The fixed signs are the leaders of each element.    Fire- Leo  Water- Scorpio  Earth- Taurus  Air- Aquarius|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	I think I answered this question the other day but I can understand about you picking the wrong best answer so I'll answer it again. I had fun doing so the first time anyway! I'm a fire sign (Sagittarius) and while I do love my sign I don't think it's the leader of the pack. For one Sagittarius are more laid back of the fire signs. This is my opinion of who's the leader of the pack in all the elements.    Fire:   Leo  Aries  Sagittarius    Earth:  Capricorn  Virgo  Taurus    Air:  Aquarius  Gemini  Libra    Water:  Scorpio  Cancer  Pisces|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	The Cardinal Signs.    ARIES.CANCER.CAPRICORN.LIBRA.    However,    I do think that Scorpios can try to be domineering...if they feel like they are losing control...|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Fire: Aires, they are very assertive  Earth: Capricorn, they are very hardworking and ambitious  Air: Gemini, they have a way with words.   Water: Scorpio, they can manipulate their way to the top|`|RlATSbfZaa	Fading is right, Cardinal signs are the initiators or leaders of the zodiac.    Fire - Aries  Earth - Capricorn  Air - Libra  Water - Cancer    *Leos - don't be offended by this, Leo is a Fixed sign (Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio also) and those influenced by a Fixed Quality are determined, reliable and persistent. They have great strength, and strength of purpose, and love to get the job done. So what if they refuse to budge? They get results.*

XD  So don't feel bad! =]|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I'm white and I like rock music?|`|yctQjQDTaa	Music taste is based on personal preference, if somebody says you cant like a certain type of music because of your race/gender/age/size/  then tell them they can just go f*ck themselves, its better to go against the mold anyway. People usually think by the way I look that I like some type of hip hop music (even though I don't dress "hip-hop"), or no music at all, and people who judge me by my voice usually think I listen to country, they're both wrong (even though I do enjoy things from both of those genres).|`|kt4WbuRkaa	i totally get where youre coming from.  im a white looking, pure bred mexican, who hates new pop, and hip hop type stuff so the odds are against me.  youre not weird, in fact, youre normal.  rock music is so deeply rooted in the african american blues community. african american blues musicians are responsible for bands like the rolling stones the beatles led zeppelin and the who kind of.  anyway, the who are my favorite band of all time and seeing you have a good classic rock education, you ought to love them..

rUMlDAINaa	It's funny that I just found your question - I actually just posted a similar one on the general quality of The Office, as it's been lately.    I thought this episode was funnier than the others this season, but as for its overall humorous quality, I think it definitely could have been tighter and funnier.  Plus, they billed Jessica Alba and Jack Black as guest stars, and I really wanted to see some fresh faces interacting with the Office crew.  The scenes between Jim and Pam were sweet, but BORING. I'm ready for them to get married off and go far, far away.    Isn't Amy Poehler doing an Office spin-off show? I am really interested in that. I hope they get better writers for that show, though.|`|pX4crBjgaa	Everyone at my house thought it was really funny. We are all big Office fans though, we love all the episodes.|`|QvjMJsaNaa	i loved it especially the first 5 min!|`|ZFHh5jNwaa	It was ok.|`|uDXpoFlbaa	I loved it! It is one of my favorite episodes!

AA12270666	The trailer you probably saw was fan-made because it's not possible it coud be the real thing. cause they don't film til March.    So whatever you saw was probably taken from other movies.  Some of the ones on youtube are really good, i thought they were real, but they're NOT.    they film in March and the movie should come out around Novemeber 20, 2009|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Filming locations so far.

They were just dancing fools created by record labels with the intention of entertaining the easily amused, and they caused that foolishness to be associated with hip hop culture.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Buy. A lot of people around my age group got their first introduction to hip hop through those guys and they've gone on to become hip hop fans for life.     As wack as Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer were at the time (and even more so looking back on it now), anyone who says they never bumped Can't Touch this or Ice Ice Baby when they came out is lying.|`|dOurKVdiaa	buy:  they made it be acceptable to a broader base, you may debate the content of the music, but before we were limited to certain time on the music channel,    Wit those guys we were play at anytime    I make the comparison to the way you straighten up and conduct yourself when you are at work,     Your whole demeanor and talk differs from when you on the block    Same thing with hammer and Ice,    When you go to work you get money that helps you expand your resources to live    And if you just stayed on the block, well you would just be on the block    hammer and Ice exposed us to the world on the constant basis|`|fff5a37756aff5f36e5a8cbdcad5c867aa	Hell no!

I think way more people heard "Ice Ice Baby" before they ever heard of Common or The Roots (a lot of people haven't heard of Immortal Technique to begin with).  Hey, for somebody "Ice Ice Baby" or "Can't Touch This" could have been the song that got somebody into hip-hop.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Sell.|`|mZOt8oURaa	Sell!I can say that the roots had a major impact.We had never seen an actual rap band that made their music with their own instruments.They were very different you can saythey all had major impact.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Buy.

How many rappers out there are talking about love and romance in a repectful way to women, covering Bob Dylan songs and putting on live shows that leave people breathless and dissecting politics?

eGpOIV12aa	In the grand tradition of sports movies, ultimately it wasnt about the hockey at all. The Rocket is the story of Maurice The Rocket Richard, who was a French-Canadian playing for the Montreal Canadiens back in the 1940s & 50s. The movie mostly depicts the apalling racism Richard had to overcome on his way to his legendary 50 goals in 50 games record.    It was interesting to see that even back then, the NHL failed to recognize & optimize its best chance at relevancy. Blinded by prejudice, the league refused to protect Richard as the superstar he was, even as he was gunned at & blatently threatened by other teams goons. Richard was forced to protect himself, eventually sparking the Richard Riot of 1955 in Montreal when he was suspended for hitting a linesman in the middle of a violent brawl in the Boston Garden.

You might like explosions in the sky.     Go and have a look round the net, a good site that will give you similar artists to the ones you already like is last.fm, just type in the band you like and it lists similar bands    Hope this helps.

You've obviously just realised, or more likely just been told that the music produced by them is of black origin. Most people already knew that. Are you expecting everyone to thank you for this revelation? They may well win a lifetime achievement award sometime, after they have run out of black artists to give them to.
7L0PFTXKaa	I'm obsessed with 24--it's all I honestly talk about.  My friends know not to mess with me during lunch, because I'll just be watching the clock, counting down the seconds until the next one.    Until I discovered this nifty website:  www.24fans.net that counts down the seconds for me! =^)    I can't wait to find out what happens to Matobo--and Renee and Jack!  I think that they're going to get together sooner or later, if Renee can get over her entire fued about "You just betrayed me, resticted me airways and made me go unconscious, took my ID card and gun, then abducted me, shot me, kicked me into a ditch, and buried me alive with absolutely no way of getting out."      ...alright, so she does have a few reasons to be mad at him...    lol.    But yeah, last season, I loved Nadia and Chloe.  This season, I love Renee and Jack.  I'm hoping for some romance sooner or later, but Agent Larry Moss could be a problem...    Best,  Phoenix|`|JF18hOeMaa	What Kind of a Question is that!?!?!?!?!?   Of course Others like 24!!!!!!   It's the Best show ever!

It's so much better than the other shows on TV - twists and turns, action, drama, dry humour every once and a while - you can't go wrong!!|`|Gh6ep5O7aa	i watch 24   ;]  and lost  and secret life|`|f9Cn5Y2xaa	yes i do|`|huto12P3aa	Iv only seen the first 2 series of 24, and I loved it, watched it none stop til i got to the end of the 2nd series.|`|9fcdd674cc0260e33942adf9ee0b7c25aa	I have been watching 24 for years now, and I can honestly say that it is my favorite show ever.  I have watched the past seasons over and over again, and it never gets old.  The show is so exciting.  You never know what the next episode will bring.  I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and that's sad.      I also really like Prison Break and Lost, but they're not as good as 24.|`|NSg62Fleaa	I LOVE 24!!!!!!    best show out there  i just like watching jack bauer and how he has to deal with everything and everyone against him

MtANnIlfaa	I make up an excuse and break up with them. Something completely stupid so I am seen as the bad guy and he'll want to leave me..

Acting is for people that think their real self should be concealled.  Be natural and honest.  If you aren't interested, then just say so.  Be kind. Move on. Make a clean break. Don't send mixed signals by letting the other person cling on.    Love,  Socrates

cR8UZdi1aa	I can't pick one. They're all idiots. I was really liking CJ until he did that charity stunt. But they're all morons. The first girl that got kicked off (the black girl) she was so full of herself & she wasn't all that great! so I couldn't stand her, then I really hated that blonde that got kicked off for the charity bit she pulled with CJ, but I think my least favorite is that chick with the short hair her body is beautiful but she was such a ding bat & her head needed to go, it just made her annoying to watch. All the guys are morons & rude, Joel IS mean, they all are. Its like a bad car wreck where you watch but you don't want too, but you can't help it. People are freaks!|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	Billy- he's really cocky

Well not to laugh at your question or anything, I honestly don't know myself. Which is weird. Why would i answer this question then? Right? well I don't think anyone knows the definition. It's a feeling, complete momentary bliss, or the touch of a hand, the speaking of a name or something. It's eternal if it's true.|`|z5tCcEA3aa	you dont know what love is but your name is happily taken ? hmm|`|NLwfMSJWaa	everyone has a different opinion on love|`|7bhhJLZaaa	"kinda?"  lol  umm well actually i think that love, for everyone is different caz they have there own opinion for how love acts and feels like

I've heard that the owners of the site forgot to pay their domain name fee, and someone else bought the rights for that domain name, that it was shut down for good, that it's only closed for repairs, etc.    As for other sites, it's hard to suggest anything else. Most movie sites like watch-movies.net require you to download Zango (an adware/malware program!), which I'd really recommend you don't do.     When you think of a movie you want to see, I'd just type in the name on google or yahoo along with "watch online free". You're sure to get tons of results.     However, if you're really bent on having a movie site, the only thing that comes close is http://www.ovguide.com. It's like a search engine for free movie content. Just be careful not to download or agree to anything! :]|`|ssDOOzZoaa	OMG .. I'm So Mad .. I Just Read Up On It and Yes They Did Close The Site =( ... But They Are Probably Coming Back ..

Boys II Men ~Mama  (Lyrics)  You taught me everything  And everything youve given me  I always keep it inside  Youre the driving force in my life, yeah  There isnt anything  Or anyone I can be  And it just wouldnt feel right  If I didnt have you by my side  You were there for me to love and care for me  When skies were grey  Whenever I was down  You were always there to comfort me  And no one else can be what you have been to me  Youll always be you always will be the girl  In my life for all times    Chorus:  Mama, mama you know I love you  Oh you know I love you  Mama, mama youre the queen of my heart  Your love is like  Tears from the stars  Mama, I just want you to know  Lovin you is like food to my soul  Youre always down for me  Have always been around for me even when I was bad  You showed me right from my wrong  Yes you did  And you took up for me  When everyone was downin me  You always did understand  You gave me strength to go on  There was so many times  Looking back when I was so afraid  And then you come to me  And say to me I can face anything  And no one else can do  What you have done for me  Youll always be  You will always be the girl in my life  Chorus|`|LWEceVT4aa	These are just a few suggestions:  Beatles-With love from me to you  Ben E.

45Db0MJGaa	I think the movie you are looking for is Dangerous Beauty 1998 here is the plot:  Veronica's lover Marco (Rufus Sewell) is discouraged by his family from marrying Veronica because her family is of humble means. Thus, he goes on to marry another woman of his status. Veronica and her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) must think of the future and their financial security, so Veronica's mother lays out the options. One of the few options that Veronica has in her time is to go to a convent, where she would be safe and protected, but it's not a life that fits her personality. So, Veronica's mother suggests that Veronica try to be a courtesan like her mother and grandmother before her once were. At first Veronica is less than enthusiastic about the idea of becoming a courtesan, but soon she becomes excited by the pleasures and freedom the lifestyle offers. Veronica agrees and her mother prepares her for that world.    Once she is a courtesan Veronica has new freedoms that she never had before. She is allowed to educate herself, a great privilege in a time when many women weren't allowed to be educated. She enters a luxurious lifestyle where she and other courtesans are allowed to go where even the wives of the noble men are not allowed. She is able to socialize with kings and royalty, and influence them politically. In this world, she again meets Marco and they have an affair during his marriage. Although Marco attempts to get to know his wife, he prefers Veronica over her. But the life of a courtesan is a dangerous one, as a courtesan could end up on the streets if careless or betrayed by a jealous and spurned lover. Franco's career involves her in politics when the King of France visits.    Veronica finds herself in danger and is attacked by the Inquisition for witchcraft. The fact that several tens of thousands recently died in Venice of the plague lends momentum to this search for a scapegoat. Veronica is dragged to court, where Marco attempts to defend her. At first her trial seems hopeless, but in the end all the men that learned so much from the pleasure of her company have her acquitted of her crimes and she and Marco are finally allowed to be together.
EzxeHsLHaa	The people who dislike this movie are probably fans of the novel by JM Barrie - the true Peter Pan story.    Problem is, that Peter Pan never grows up, so the whole movie does not make sense and breaks completely with Barries masterpiece.    As pure entertainment I guess it's not that bad and it surely has this Hollywood feeling, a nice story, famous actors, but for people who really understand what the Peter Pan story was all about .... It just doesn't do it.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Terrible acting by all involved.  The uncomfortable feeling of watching an old Robin Williams try to relate to the child characters - which never convincingly happened.  Special effects so cheap they wouldn't make it onto a TV series.  Jokes so lame that even the ancient Dustin Hoffman must have thought they were old.    And most of all, a fat kid turns into a ball and kills a bunch of pirates by rolling into them!  WTF??????|`|AA11166769	I saw it about 20 years ago. I thought it was OK, but I wouldn't say it was the best movie I've ever seen.|`|tLI94qWNaa	That movie is amazing, how could anyone not like hook, that just shocks me!!!  It is a classic in my family as well.    Its on AMC?!?!?  I am going to go watch it right now:D lol|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	One of my kids favorite, I only saw the whole thing recently-I liked it also|`|eVBUkO7aaa	I totally love Hook seriously though I agree who could not love it especially since Robin Williams is in it|`|9Y56hQRlaa	I like that movie!!|`|XmOJ2846aa	thats one of my fave childhood movies! I bet id still watch it if it was on tv or something|`|5PatAvshaa	I love that movie! I watch it all the time, usually around xmas. Dustin Hoffman is gr8 and so is Smee! It's a classic film. I guess if you grew up as a kid watching it, you'll always love it, but for someone who's seeing it for the first time when they're older, they probably wouldn't feel the same. Oh well. Looky looky I got Hooky!|`|eGW4X9pgaa	I liked it ...  Disney, humor, fantasy, fun ...    some people don't get the whole fantasy thing ...  some people don't like robin williams b/c of his political views, regardless how well he entertains ...  and in general, I often find myself disagreeing with reviews ...  some of my favorite movies have been slammed by "official" reviews and yet some movies they rave about (like "The Fountain", for example) I totally don't enjoy ...    just goes to show no one else can tell you what you like!!|`|36a4c3871d0748f9bc6bd28fba96940faa	LOVE that movie!!!!|`|u70TaWI5aa	All I got to say is RU FEE OOOOOOOO!!!!|`|ph4Htg02aa	That movie is gross. It sucks sooooo bad.|`|nJwSUv8vaa	I will preface my answer by saying Peter Pan is my FAVORITE childhood story. I have the novel Peter Pan and Wendy by J.M. Barrie as well as the children's book version of Peter Pan and the Disney DVD Peter Pan.    I can't stand the movie Hook!  Robin Williams was a horrible Pan, Julia Roberts was even worse as Tinkerbell and while Dustin Hoffman was alright as Captain Hook, I think Alan Rickman would have been a better choice.      Furthermore the movie was completely void of any of the magic the novel and animated movie have.  I still recall my absolute disappointment as I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie.  When it's on tv now I channel surf right over that station.

Green Day sold out and went mainstream and just wrote a bunch of catchy songs that none of their original fans enjoyed. and BMTH their new cd sounds way different then any of their old stuff. moral of the story is green day is horrible and bmth is amazing, though thasts only one oppinion. and its not acctually possible to compare the two bands musically|`|FyCU0RPOaa	BMTH.|`|ZiC5pl2Jaa	BMTH.|`|ZP30wbvYaa	Green Day|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Green Day     Even though I don't like either of them|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Green Day.
Mo0Md3c8aa	yes he is and im so happy, there is'nt anyone who could play Jacob better than him.|`|ar4B3rJJaa	Yes, Taylor Lautner will be playing the role as Jacob Black in New Moon. This was announced by Stephenie Meyer and Summit Entertainment on January 7, 2009. It was said that Taylor is currently bulking up for the film. They will be shooting in March 2009. I am so glad that he will be playing the role as Jacob because i personally think that there is no one else better for the role and that he really created the character well in Twilight.

I'm staying in, no matter what it takes|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Yeah but, ever since I've graduated, it really hasn't mattered to me much.|`|fLaFElk8aa	ALL the time. I hated school soooooooooooooo much.|`|0P5qBxiZaa	i always think about cuz i have no motivation but i stay in because i know i fill find it someday:D|`|0hVsZuEraa	never seriously.|`|aN3w9WzBaa	sometimes. i have a ****** for a teacher that always offers to get the papers signed for us to leave. i think he hates us   louie lou|`|F9UToz4aaa	Nope. However, a lot of stupid teenagers on here are.|`|ebaa7ca0b1b2e45ca08cf6fd5db01a30aa	no|`|lIQhB56Oaa	yeah.  and then becoming a stripper.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	no|`|wnD6ZMfBaa	Never seriously.|`|AA10269742	yea, because i see other people who havent gone to college making loads, while i know people who hold master's degrees that are working in walmart (why? idk).  it makes me really think what i'm going to school for and if i'll really make any money with a degree in my major (english).|`|UaJHq2vsaa	ya|`|i8EcDMdZaa	I've been kicked out then refused to go to any school when i was 12-14|`|lFqm9XlUaa	No, I mean I hate it so much and thought about skipping(never did either) but you know it is a really stupid thing to do. You go to school your whole life, what is the point of dropping out 3 years b4 u graduate, makes no sense what so ever. You can stick it out.|`|qDjQYDcLaa	yes, im a highschool drop out.|`|FG4hKNUyaa	no nvr i luv skool thts where i c frnds on a daily basis|`|J3lUKBKPaa	most definitely i mean i always hated school and got bad grades for the majority of my time in school but i ended up pregnant in the 8th grade cause i was doing things i had no Business doing thinking i was grown and at that time decided i really didn't no everything and decided i wanted a good life for my baby i am so happy i didn't and hope you don't either it seems hard and horrible but hey by the time your old enough to decide to drop out you are basically done with school and that means that all those years you have already finished were a waste|`|f4Ms77qzaa	Yeah, when I was bullied .   All the girls said mean things about me and called me teacher's pet, greety, lesbian and other horrible things. They forced everyone not to play with me and laughed at me . I didn't want to go to school. I cried often and I had to go to the office a lot . This happened to me in grade 1, and after I went to a different school same thing happened in grades 5-6.   Horrible memories.  :'(|`|RC2aQBkgaa	No, because as much as I hate school, it is good for me. I wil use this what seems like pointless knowledge one day to go to college and be successful and marry a good guy and have a fun well paying job with kids and I will be okay financially. Drop outs end up being the hobos who sit on the side of the streets begging for money with no clothes or food or anything because they are dumb and don't know anything so they weren't qualified for a job.|`|7bhhJLZaaa	SHYAAAA like today...schools boring and all, but like not like REALLLY quiting|`|X986b2AWaa	Yep, I really thought about dropping out of school, but that was when I was going through some things and feeling kind of down.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	I actually have. Now, I just think that I don't want to let my parents down. I want to graduate high school and go on to college and make a better life for my future family than what my parents had to go through for me and my sister. I don't want them to have to work till they're eighty, I want to help them out and not worry if something happened to them(;|`|bMGUY9gjaa	oh i would so stay home all day in bed if i could  but i can't!  oh well :P  xxx

ci64gIZ8aa	My favorite all of time is The Shawshank Redemption.  It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.|`|4IlFj8bxaa	Vanhelsin starring Huge jackman,it was great to see it on big screen. liked x-men and underworld too|`|28ZCfGWIaa	2001: A Space Odyssey|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	TITANIC. First saw it when it came out in 1997, i was 7 years old. My parents didn't care much about me, so i snuck in. I never cried so hard for a film.     oh oh!! Million Dollar baby & Forrest Gump too. :) Emotional.     Lord of the Rings & Star Wars (all of them)--yes, im a huge nerd.    For best animated film of all time--Toy Story. I'm in college right now, gettting a B.A in Illustration BECAUSE of that movie.|`|oVtvjSVJaa	Twilight becuz it was freakin' awesome!!|`|fAxif6Vqaa	Goodfellas because its outstanding directing,acting,cinematography,script and kick *** soundtrack|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Romeo & Juliet (1968)    It's been my favorite movie since I first saw it a little more than 40 years ago when I was in high school. I love it as much as I did the first time. At several theaters, I managed to see it 21 times, which was far more than people generally saw movies until they got into the habit via "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Summer of '42" then the Lucas/Spielberg era. Back then, it was highly unusual.     I still have everything I've ever collected on this film, including a theatrical poster, lobby cards and a pressbook a theater manager gave me when he noted how many times I attended. I even have the rare four-album set of the complete soundtrack~a rarity especially in that this is likely the only time this has been done: Every bit of the track is included~music and voices! You really can listen to the complete film!    "Romeo & Juliet" is like a tapestry that has come to life. It's visually stunning, filled with wonderful performances in remarkable settings. You could frame many images as art. The colors are jewel-like, both in the costumes and their surroundings. Back in the Sixties, every girl was in love with Leonard Whiting, and every boy thought that Olivia Hussey was the most beautiful girl in the world. I think many of us still cherish this film, especially judging by the many websites dedicated to it and not just in the United States. I've seen sites in Greek, Italian, and a number of other languages.     For me, it's one of those absolutely perfect movies. I've been a film lover for more than half a century, raised by a film buff who was raised by~yes!~a film buff! There aren't very many perfect movies out there, but this is most assuredly one.    If you'd like to sample it, here is the movie trailer and a couple of segments of the film:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LOfgaSvK...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNP81h1GJ...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbFCEVZK...|`|70MRFokCaa	any scary movies beacuse they make me jump out of my seat lol|`|ggR5FFDjaa	Hard to pick just one, Oh Brother and Blazing Saddles are a couple of the funniest, Unforgiven was the most real movie, Sling Blade was great also, very different.  Motorcycle Diaries is a fav also.|`|A4WrXbuQaa	SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE    From the outside, "Slumdog Millionaire" seems like a modern-day fairy-tale. But that's not Danny Boyle. With the story of a boy from the Mumbai slums who somehow makes it to one question away from 20 million rupees--it turns into a hilarious, moving, and rough epic of the corruption, poverty and love. None of the actors have acting experience and two of the child actors are directly picked out from the slums    With masterful direction with a surprising Bollywood kick... "Slumdog" is beautiful...at the same time... powerfully and realistically illustrating poverty. The writing doesn't try to be too arrogant but succeeds in being sweet, smart, and just so perfect. As for the score... electrifying! A.R Rahman keeps a furiously fast-paced beat that have you racing to buy the soundtrack on iTunes.    Ultimately, the film is extremely crowd-pleasing, uplifting, and epic. If you want to know why the film is rated R, the language is quite tame with 2-3 F-words... but the violence is rarely bloody, but sometimes disturbing. The film lightens up after the opening scene but there is some extreme violence--including a scene of electrocution, a man ignited, and other mild forms of torture. There are various fistfights and a raid. A teen surprisingly fires a gun but puts a cloth over the victim so we see little to no blood. Finally a man shoots one man and is then shot to death, but because he is in a bathtub of money, there is again little to no blood.    Everything about this film is truly amazing... you'll love it.|`|iFev4IF6aa	the best moviee i ever saw was hmmmmm.....  OLD YELLER its the bomb

45Db0MJGaa	All three have been revealed this week - and we have extra crew details!    30 January, 2009       All-new Red Dwarf channel Dave have released the first official information from the production of the new two-part special. And the big news is the title:    Back To Earth  It's been a decade since we last saw the crew of Red Dwarf, but while they may be older they're still none the wiser.    When Lister's busy day of annoying Rimmer is interrupted by a monstrous attack, it's pretty much business as usual - until a shock development throws Rimmer, Lister, Cat and Kryten back to planet Earth...    The two episodes, made by Grant Naylor Productions, star Chris Barrie as Rimmer, Craig Charles as Lister, Danny John-Jules as Cat and Robert Llewellyn as Kryten, and are written and directed by Red Dwarf co-creator Doug Naylor.       Take a deep breath, come up with some hilariously inaccurate theories about what this can all mean, enjoy the shiny new logo, then read on.    Full studio shooting at Shepperton (try saying that ten times fast!) is currently slated to begin Monday, February 16th, though there have been some early camera tests - check out Dave's exclusive image - and a single day of advance location work is slated for Saturday, January 31st.    In addition to these two shows, there are a couple of TV specials. The Making Of Back to Earth takes you behind the scenes on the new production; and Red Dwarf: Unplugged presents the cast of the show as you've never seen them before - no sets, no effects... and no cue cards.    reddwarf.co.uk can also announce some of the key crew for the project. Aside from writer/director Doug Naylor, the producer is long-time GNP producer Helen Norman alongside line producer/co-producer Jo Howard, a veteran of Series VII and VIII.    New to the fold is production designer Mark Harris, who is sure to become a fan favourite with his work here. Mark previous served as Art Director on Event Horizon and Quantum of Solace, as well as designing the 2005 Captain Scarlet series. Director of photography will be the eagle-eyed Andy Martin.    Another newcomer will be Australian Mike Seymour, an Emmy nominee for his work on Farscape - and an AFI winner for Best Visual Effects - who signs on as visual effects supervisor. More familiar faces return with costume designer Howard Burden and make-up designer Andrea Finch, two talents we'd frankly be lost without.    So there you have it. Broadcasting over four nights from Friday, April 10th 2009 on Dave, Red Dwarf is well and truly back... to Earth.    You'll be able to track production and discover all kinds of exclusives not only here, but also on joindave.co.uk.
