Also if its possible, are there any greener rose foods, pest killers, etc. that won't harm the earth or my roses? I appreciate any help I can get. Thanks!

20090202222735AAUQpoj	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Air conditioning problem?	Had notice the "green" wire was disconnected from "G" on the control board at the furnace.  I reconnected that and thought my problem with my A/C not cooling might have been solved -- went outside and found the outside fan unit was not running.  I pushed the fan blades in a clockwise direction with a stick and the fan started running -- went inside and it seemed like everything might be okay.  Went back outside 10 minutes or so later and the fan had stopped running again.   I should note that the outside air temperature is pretty cool this evening and we don't need a/c tonight -- I was just trying to work though the problem.   I know there are some relays etc. that might need to be checked outside -- just looking for some direction on where to start.   This is a carrier unit and the inside furnace is model# 58EFB075 - I also have a larger (twin) unit for my downstairs that is model# 58EFB125.   Where should I start outside?  Could the "green" wire disconnect have caused a problem with the outside unit?      Thanks,      Tim   timdaus@mac.com   timdaus2001@yahoo.com       or here...

Hi,      I realised yesterday that my Hotpoint Aquarius 1100 was leaking from underneath. Upon further inspection I have discovered that the tube running from the pressure switch has broken at the connection to what I understand is the pressure overflow (plastic larger tube connected to the drum?!).      I'm unsure which part actually needs replacing as it's tricky to identify whether there was originally a connector on the tube, or whether there was one on the pressure overflow.      Does anyone know the part numbers for these parts and the best place to source them from un the UK?      Many thanks
