In fact, if you read Limewire's website it clearly says it supports copyright laws and does not condone illegal activity. That does not prevent individual users from using it for illegal purposes, however.|`|6GB5P7ojaa	The Lime Wire is legal because it is only a file-sharing software but it can be vulnerable to viruses so don't use it.<br>  <br>  I suggest downloading iTunes.

Some podcasts are free, too.|`|gASz3hDWaa	Lime-wire doesn't store any files on it's own servers. They are on host computers of those who are joined to the Lime-wire network. Downloading files is not automatically an illegal offense and the terms and conditions of Lime-wire when you sign up are not to infringe copyright.<br>  Joining up gives you faster server speeds and better searches. You can avoid viruses by avoiding pornography, pirated programs and copyrighted files. Do not open downloads that tell you need to install a program to make the file you just downloaded work. The chances are these are virus or malware installers needing your permission to install themselves on to your computer.<br>  <br>  There is no 100% way of avoiding viruses but files that are supposed to be quite large say 100mb but the file download size is only 70kb usually points to dubious programs.<br>  Having a good virus and spy, malware protection is a must. Lime-wire also give warnings of files that it has flagged as possible viruses. Avoid these.

But the x2 is usually kewl, And its probably a 4pin on stock cooling, just makes sure your bios matches, and usually 40-50 is a good range for cooling. Also see if cool and quiet is turned on.<br>  EDIT:<br>  You should be alright, in your bios, their should be an option for a 3pin fan, three pin fans allow for fan control. You just have to manually tell your bios. The bios can detect alot more then it use to, but their are still some thing that is does not(with the exception of some high end equipment but even that isn't perfect). Fan speed for one, while their in their you should also make sure your memory is setup correctly, ASUS mobo's are famous for underclocking and raising interupts on memory.

So check out the disk if it makes noise alot ...go to service centre and ask them to replace . The last thing i would like to say u that ANTIVIRUS on 512mb is not worth and must remove the applications from startup which loads automatically when windows logon bcoz they consume RAM..100 mb idle memory is indicating that u r low on memory and need both  physical and virtual memory even more than that u r currently using .|`|AA11527636	512Mb of RAM isn't much by today's standard. Honestly, 2GB of RAM is pretty standard at present.<br>  <br>  Windows, depending on the version, can easily use 300 to 400MB of RAM doing it's own thing, so to say. This only leaves you with roughly 100 to 200MB of RAM for your programs. Any additional memory those programs need is then directed to Windows virtual memory, also known as the swap or paging file, which is actually stored as temporary data on the hard drive. Hard drives write and read data at an incredibly slower rate then physical memory, hence the system slowdown.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is to install more memory in your system. I highly recommend 2GB of RAM for your 32-bit Windows XP system. Also, if it's an old original Athlon XP, not and Athlon X2 (dual core), the type of memory you need is likely either DDR-333 or DDR-400, which will have 184-pins. You'll need to check your motherboard to see what it's maximum memory capacity is and under what configuration (ie. two 1MB sticks, four 512MB sticks, etc.).|`|BZsRtXpVaa	well, one of my pc's has the same specs as yours and is slow and here is the reason for mine;<br>  <br>  Firstly the FSB is only 533mhz, HDD is very old with 40GB capacity running at 7200 rpm, running xp with 512 ram (is recommended however go to 1gb or 2 for better performance), processor isnt dual core (should be the reason though), no video card (so increased pressure on the processor and ram to process screen)<br>  <br>  hopefully u dont have alot of intense start up items (if so delete), yes use registry cleaner and defrag harddrive but these minor things dont magerly increase performance but stability. so your better of with getting more ram and a video card to speed things up.<br>  <br>  also really depends what your saying is kinda slow?<br>  <br>  come on more info please like how long for pc to start up etc...|`|KsUXv6D2aa	To fix a slow computer you can go to <a href="http://www.regcleandownload.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.regcleandownload.com</a> <br>  Download reg clean for free.<br>  It can clean your computer and restore your system to optimum performance.<br>  It works very well for me.<br>  Hope that can help you.|`|0036303680ad306f84decbfaaae5d979aa	It could be hardware, best bet, get a live cd, test your memory, then boot the live cd, let it cache a few programs and see how performance goes.<br>  But that might be outside our technical knowledge, if you gutsy Ubuntu is probably the easiest live cd out their. And with your old hardware, I highly recommend at least giving it a test drive in live mode.<br>  <br>  But more realistically that not an option for you, and you don't want to give up windows..correct.<br>  <br>  The best practice is to install windows to one drive/partition and your data (music/movies/photos) to another drive/partition. Windows gets slow. Lots of things will tack on to it as you browse the web, install software and such and really slow it down. The best solution is to reinstall, but again this is the real world.<br>  <br>  So I'd have to recommend you get spy bot. Run it once, let it do its thing. When it is done go into advanced setting and look at what runs at boot. Investigate each thing and if you don't need it turn it off (verify if your not sure with google or here). Once you've done that you should see a HUGE speed increase, because their isn't so many background process's.<br>  <br>  If you running Internet Explorer install firefox, if your running firefox, install opera. If your attached to one or the other, clear all its history, completely remove it, and reinstall it, making sure to purge all addon's and cache.<br>  <br>  Also right click MyComputer>Properties>Settings>Performan... Button(same page as the boot button sorry I don't have a windows systems in front of me at the moment). set it for best performance (turns off alot of stuff you don't need to get stuff done, and with increase performance.)<br>  <br>  After following these steps you should have a much faster system, depending on wether you built it or bought it, it will probably be faster then when you first got it.

Microsoft Windows requires a unique serial key, which will be authenticated online.  If the key is a fake, or been used on more licenses than it is allowed, Windows will not run fully.  If you bought the software from someone for cheap, then you most likely got a pirated version of the software.  If you downloaded the software from somewhere without purchasing it, then shame on you for asking for help.

Like a week ago when i plugged in my flash drive the computer couldn't recognize it so i ask my best friend who is programmer and he said two possibilities <br>  <br>  1) If the flash drive is old and you copied and pasted a lot on it this may be the problem so even if the lights wouldn't went off the flash will be ruined with all the data on it so it cannot be saved anything<br>  2) Maybe it's just dust. Try open it up and blow on the components but be careful not to touch or damage anything<br>  3)Because the lights went off and the the computer was giving energy to the flash, the only possibility that it could damage it's at that moment you were transferring something to or out of the computer<br>  <br>  Unfortunately if 1) or 3) happened to you the files on it cannot be restored

AA10835644	Firstly unless you like lugging around large heavy laptops, netbooks are a great choice. Netbooks have some advantages and dis-advantages (however many of the dis-advantages are only seen by people who don't understand the point of a netbook).<br>  <br>  My knowledge of such machines is from being a very satisfied owner of an Elonex Webbook (with Ubuntu 8.04) since they first hit the shops last year. My only niggle with it was that by default the sound is turned down low, but the fix was easy. The Linux version was by choice, the reasons are simple, as Linux uses less system resources than Windoze it runs faster and with longer battery life than the same machine running Windoze. Also bearing in mind the limitations of a Netbook, it does exactly what I need it to do; browse the web, email, office work on the move (Open Office), edit photo's (the Gimp). When away from home or the office I can find wifi access points and check my emails (although 3G dongle compatibility is built in I don't use it).<br>  <br>  The perceived dis-advantages (by some) are:<br>  <br>  No DVD drive (the machine is not meant to be a media centre and any software can be installed either by downloading it, from a USB flash/pen drive or an external USB DVD when you get home).<br>  <br>  Rubbish sound from tiny speakers (what do people expect from such a small machine, use headphones they are way better than any laptop speakers (including Apple laptops)).<br>  <br>  Graphics (Err what can I say? did I buy the machine to play the latest games on the move? NO. If I want to play games I have a desktop machine at home for that with a comfortable chair and a 22inch widescreen monitor).<br>  <br>  The (real) advantages:<br>  <br>  Light weight and size (it can fit into a normal bag that doesn't scream HEY! I HAVE A LAPTOP, MUG ME and doesn't leave you with a sore shoulder after carrying all day).<br>  <br>  Doe's everything you need from a PORTABLE computer (by that I mean if you want to watch movies then a portable DVD player is way, way less than ￡/$100)<br>  <br>  At the end of the day it's your choice, but netbooks, unless you are someone who is impressed by size are what a portable computer should be.<br>  <br>  If you need more info contact me.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	The keyboards are a bit smaller, the screen sizes are a bit smaller, and they're generally less powerful. And there's no optical drive for playing DVDs and CDs.<br>  <br>  But that's the point.<br>  <br>  It's not meant to be a laptop. It's meant to be a netbook. It's for the net. It's for portability.<br>  <br>  It's something you can toss in your purse and run to a coffee shop with to check your email or your Facebook or instant message friends.<br>  <br>  Ubuntu should be fine. Notice how anyone who says it's complicated to use can't cite any real everyday examples. It's a point-and-click interface with icons that launch applications, and it comes with all the software you could possibly need on a netbook (web browser, email client, image editor, music player, video player, office suite).|`|044IeGstaa	Netbooks, and tablet PC's, (Small laptops) don't have as much power as their full size laptop 'cousins'.<br>  <br>  With an Operating System like WinXP, this can be an issue.

They're mix of portability and functionality is unmatched, not even by the iPhone (have you tried answering a dozen emails comprehensively in five minutes on a small 3.5 inch touchscreen?)<br>  <br>  As other's have pointed out, a netbook lacks processing power (most come standard with the Intel Atom N270 1.6GHz processor) and around 1GB of  RAM depending on model. This is enough for simple word processing and browsing the net, but you'd struggle to run Vista on it (hence why they come pretty standard with XP/Linux) or any kind of demanding game.<br>  <br>  Regarding the heat problem, that would only be on the models which have hard drives. You can get models with Solid State Drive. This has no moving parts and is very energy efficient. Unfortunetly it costs a lot to buy in and so you don't usually get as much storage space as on a model with a hard drive (the new Sony VAIO P Series is an exception).<br>  <br>  Check out our website for some ideas - I'd advise you against the Dell, it's a much compromised laptop, number #7 in our Top Ten Mini Laptops. I suggest looking at the Samsung NC10, HP mini 1000/Compaq mini 700, Asus Eee PC 901/1000 or Acer Aspire One.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|837xgMwLaa	XP is your best bet, 300 quid for a Dell netbook & XP is not bad but don't expect to be able to run tasking applications on the 1.6ghz cpu. They are good for online, music & should play movie files, but not from DVD as there is no DVD drive. The dells looks nice but the hard drive is limited, check out <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/152547" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebuyer.com/product/152547</a> I would say get a netbook over a cheap Vista laptop (a 400+ quid laptop with dual core should be able to run Vista properly) but don't expect it to be speedy & be prepared for no DVD drive. Get a cheap XP laptop with DVD drive if you can - most places sell Vista now tho.|`|Pvul1bWZaa	I just want to add that my 9'' screen laptop is better than my portable DVD player for watching movies.

If you have set up MSN for use with your webcam automatically and he has got a video call program running while he is using MSN the same as you then obviously he can see you.<br>  <br>  He can't hack into it. You must have had your camera switched on for him to see you in the first place.

And you're definitely sure you didn't accpet an invite to send webcam right?<br>  <br>  Well, yeah definitely warn your friend about him, he sounds like some kind of pervert.<br>  <br>  AVG should be enough to at least notify you if someone is trying to hack into your computer. Set AVG to run daily checks so you can also see if there are other potential viruses or spyware on your computer. <br>  <br>  You should also make sure that Windows Firewall is set up and running, that will provide a barrier to someone trying to access your computer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DhOjQM34aa	Omgosh that's really weird!!

However, I didn't think it would be possible from the Microsoft's Live network servers to be compromised. Therefore, check for any suspicious files. They usually get themselves to start up every time the computer start, so you might want to check the start up registry values.<br>  And it might be possible for him to access your webcam if you really accepted a server file from him. He's probably just downloaded it off some website... Not to worry though. A good antivirus should pick it up, or use a firewall, monitor network connections and pin the program down.|`|z6ETua0Paa	I had my account hacked in, so annoying!

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.<br>  6. Click "OK"|`|6b0HoguJaa	dont worry! this is a problem that occurs when u have too many personal information or too much things saved on their. like music or something. just delete a few things. all that saved things causes everything to slow down.|`|l6MioubMaa	people often take this route ,but fail to address the other issues ,try cccleaner its free and does work . also try this go to note pad type mystring=(80000000) then click file then save as ,in the resulting box change txt to ram.vbe and the save to desktop ,you will then get a little notepad system on your desktop click on this a few times this will clean your RAM and speed your pc|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Download and run spybot

9XLJBU7haa	I would start thinking about the components of the HR system.<br>  <br>  So typically a front-end which would be Web based in this example. So you might want to Google for AJAX, PHP, Javascript to see how those technologies could be used.<br>  <br>  For the actual HR system think about a relational database again something like ORACLE/SQL Server/Mysql. Have a look at the product description pages for a couple of them.<br>  <br>  the things like firewalls & encryption would be important but spending a lot of time on them probably won't get you a lot of extra marks.<br>  <br>  Both ORACLE & SAP (and no doubt many others) produce HR systems so they may also give you pointers....<br>  <br>  hopefully this will give you a starting point.

AbRfd29Haa	The peak demand from a nVidia Geforce 295 is 289W. So for two of them, you will have a potential peak demand of 590W of peak power demand. Unless the rest of your PC is good with just 110W of power (hint: probably not), you'll need a beefier supply. <br>  <br>  And even that's not a guarantee... you can't simply add up wattage of the items in your PC and assume you're ok as long as you don't exceed that of the power supply. Your power supply will offer X watts at +12V, Y watts at +5V, and Z watts at +3.3V, etc. You can't trade one for the other.... Ideally, you do a power budget for each current sink on each voltage rail (factor in that large supplies may have independent +12V rails... my main PC here has a 3-rail +12V system), and ensure that each voltage rail is not overloaded.<br>  <br>  Of course, most people just get a power supply so large, they don't need to do the math. Or they count on luck. Or their systems crash at odd times, and in a fairly short time, fail entirely. <br>  <br>  The peaks are hit primarily by using the GPUs... driving a monitor is all low-power stuff. So in fact, your CUDA application is more likely than not to push these toward their peak. With some of that stuff not used, you might never actually hit the peak, but you'll probably get close. It only takes a fraction of a second to brown-out your PC and cause a crash. <br>  <br>  If you're only running CUDA code for 15-20 minutes at a time, it would seem to me you might get by with a single 295 and 30-40 minutes at a time (or probably less, since your application is unlikely to get a 2x speed boost from the second card). <br>  <br>  And anyone spending $1000 or so (list) on graphics cards ought to just bite the bullet and get the 1000W+ supply, too. Also, if your time is critical enough for you to pony up for that second card, it's probably not worth wasting on power issues, either. You also need one PCIe 6-pin and one PCIe 8-pin power connector for each card.|`|woGeAtddaa	The 295 is basically two 260's sandwiched together, so those puppies are going to need 1000 watts.|`|hexzaIGgaa	First off...that is insane overkill. So, you pick up 20fps? LOL It seems that video card envy has replaced penis envy. I mean, if you want to drop the better part of $1K on an "increase in performance" that you probably won't be able to notice outside of benchies; go for it. In the real world, if nobody tells you what's inside the box, you will NEVER know the difference. We refer to this as the Law of Decreasing Returns...performance increases get smaller with each additional $ spent.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the simple answer is "NO." I would never run such a rig, but if I did, it would have a 1000W PSU...and that means NOISE (lots of it) and HEAT (lots of it).<br>  <br>  Look at a PCP&C PSU. For my non-SFF builds, they are all I use. You can cheap out with a Silencer 750W (I wouldn't) or go to 810W or 1000W or 1250W. You get over 750W and things start getting serious price-wise.<br>  <br>  BTW, CUDA will peak your power use (like the guy above me said). I applaud you wanting to do distributed processing for science, but this is a waste of $$$. Just send the $1K to BOINC or Folding@home.

ySKsOfIMaa	Looking around doesn't seem to yield any kind of exact result. However, Google alone has in the neighborhood of 350-400 PBs (PetaBytes) of data. Just in case, one petabyte is equal to a thousand terabytes.<br>  <br>  Considering that Google caches a lot of information on the internet, it's safe to say that number can be easily doubled. Take into consideration all the information Google has yet to get (along with videos, pictures, torrents, downloadable applications, etc.), and it's safe to say it's at least in the tens or maybe even hundreds of exabytes (1000 petabytes). This doesn't even take into account private or restricted content that search engine spiders cannot crawl, but couldn't be accurately estimated anyways (since, you know, it's private).<br>  <br>  To answer your second question... well, what does one call over a million 1TB hard drives?

kgnvDU0paa	www.livecdlist.com<br>  <br>  This site has a listing of just about every linux distro that you could possibly put on a USB drive.  If you're looking for something small, damn small linux would probably be the easiest thing to put on a USB drive, and certainly the fastest.  I wouldn't go with ubuntu (or edu, ku, or medi) if you professor is looking for something uncommon.  Those are likely the most popular distributions.  You might also try something KDE based (such as fedora).  These aren't nearly as user friendly as debian based programs like ubuntu, but it would look far more impressive if you can learn to use it.  If it were me, I'd find one of the smaller downloads and use that, just so that you're not wasting all your time downloading an image that it doesn't sound like you're actually planning to use.|`|AA10068419	<a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  Install what ever distro you want.<br>  <br>  If you have a whole weekend, you can probably do quite a few.......easy "A"

6YufKn6Faa	Hi.<br>  <br>  This depends on your Hard Drive Interface. ATA interfaces.. there isn't much of an difference.. a few milliseconds.. to maybe half an second. <br>  <br>  But considering you have a new Computer, it will be SATA II interface. <br>  <br>  7200RPM are around 2-6 seconds faster.. in seeking and latency over the 5400 RPM.. It is not fast enough to notice too much of an difference, but an second here or there isn't too much to worry about. If you had the option then go with it, if not, no problem. <br>  <br>  Benefits with 7200RPM.. Loading times will decrease. If you have a higher cache, expect less time when first starting up, or searching for files, or opening a folder, or even first few minutes of a computer game. <br>  <br>  But Ultimately...<br>  Think of it this way..  Transfer Speed (ATA to SATA II in terms of MB/S or GB/S) means Faster. <br>  Not Spindle Speed (RPM). There are 5400 RPM hard drives since 1999. The 5400 RPM Hard drive in 1999 can't match the speed of a 5400 RPM hard drive today, in terms of speed. Spindle speed plays a factor (small factor).. but only when transfer speeds are the same. <br>  <br>  Hope that Helps|`|e3a22386f5c6f18e62c9c97c3ced4a84aa	Notebook hard drive or the 2.5 in hard drive is built to run at 5400 rpm, so you don't have the option to upgrade to a 7200 rpm. There's only a slight performance difference compared to a desktop which uses a 3.5 in hard drive at 7200 rpm

8gC7nV4eaa	Unfortunately, no. And that's one of Apple's weaknesses. You can, however, go to the Apple Online store, and choose a Macbook. Click on the "Buy Now" button, and it will bring you to a page where you can almost freely change the specifications of your macbook, such as the processor, hard drive, built in software, etc. Your price will go up as you add things to your macbook, but at least you will have it customized to your needs. Then you can buy online (and only online) your customized MacBook. Hope this helps!!!<br>  <br>  P.S. if you want high RAM capacity, don't add it on the online store. They charge you more than what you should pay. You can buy RAM separately for a much cheaper price (they charge you $100 to upgrade RAM, but I bought mine separately for $30, and it's fabulous)

The cheaper ones are not capable of much other than word processing and surfing the web.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking of gaming other than relatively simple games, etc. you'd be getting a totally wrong type of PC.  They are primarily designed for school and office type work for "on the run" people and are not near as good a tool as the larger laptops are overall.<br>  <br>  So.... do you're proverbial homework on what the "netbooks" are really capable of before you spend your money on something that is going to lose its' luster in a week or two.  Don't get caught up in "it's what the other kids have" or "it's the latest thing on the market".<br>  <br>  If I were your dad, I wouldn't spend my hard earned money on something I know that you'll lose interest in within a month.

A1iDPPOeaa	If the plug to the laptop is on the BACK of the laptop, chances are the connector is broken.  Normally the connector is soldered to the logic board inside the computer.  When moving the laptop by lifting the front, it puts pressure on the plug and connection resulting in a solder break.<br>  <br>  Check the connection between the laptop and the plug.  If it feels "sloppy" that's your problem.  If it's still under warranty you may be ok, but you'll need to send it out for repair.  It's not an easy fix because it means that you have to tear the entire laptop apart to get to the part to resolder it.|`|0tKNkAMuaa	It could be the chargers problem or the computers try: <br>  1. pushing the charger in the computer more, move it around left, right  up, down see what happens. <br>  If that doesn't work:<br>  2. Push the other side of the  charger more in the wall, try it in a different plug. <br>  If that doesn't work:<br>  3. Turn off the computer, and un-plug the charger on both ends, leave it on a hard surface, (desk, wood or tile floor, etc.) for about 2-5 minutes.

Most batteries for laptops go out in about a year, depending on how much it is used   The easiest way to tell is that it does not charge.

17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Actually the term "low level" is a bit of a misnomer. The low level process first used years ago in MFM hard drives bears little resemblance to what we now call a "low level format" for today's ATA (IDE) and SATA drives. You cannot format the hard drive at low level. The servo, sector layout and defect management information contained in the low level format is designed to last the life of the drive. As such, this information cannot be overwritten outside of the factory. Although some drive manufactures and BIOS provided so-called "low level format utilities", they actually perform a write-read (Zero Fill) verify of the drive's user data sectors, and do not actually perform a low-level format. In the event of a corrupted master boot record or boot block virus, use FDISK /MBR command to restore the master boot record. If you need to low level format your hard drive then check the drive manufacturer and download such a utility from its website. Every drive manufacturer provides just such a utility. Below is a list of hard drive manufacturers with a links to low level format utilities. The only safe method of initializing/erasing all the data on hard drive is the Zero Fill option.<br>  <br>  If normal (high level) hard disk formatting is required, you can use DOS FDISK command to first erase and create partitions and then use FORMAT. It is also a good idea when you hard disk becomes inaccessible to see if it is just the system files that are corrupted. Most of the time, it is the case. SYS will do the job of replacing system files. Therefore, low level format is always of LAST RESORT when you encounter HDD problems.

LAN doesn't have to be web-based (i.e., can be built without the need for an internet connection ).<br>  <br>  An intranet is a web-based network that is owned by an organisation (typically, a large one). <br>  <br>  :0}|`|qu68Y2Ilaa	An Intranet is a type of LAN that is highly limited to local users only.It can not be given a link to the Internet otherwise it will defeat its difination & purpose.<br>  <br>  A LAN referes to a group of computers sharing a connection on a small scale network within an organisation, home, etc, and can still have the Internet connection in their Network stream.|`|YESUhp8gaa	They are basically the same thing, They are a network system that only a part of a single business, office, home network.

C8DOT8Y7aa	I prefer Hp And A Dell For a desktop since it is good.<br>  One thing is for certain, if you purchase a laptop from either one of the companies you are getting a quality laptop at a great price.<br>  <br>  They sell thousands upon thousands of laptops a day so they must be doing something right.<br>  <br>  The important thing to do is check out what both of them have to offer. For example...<br>  <br>  If you are looking for an entertainment laptop, check out both the Dell and HP Pavilion Notebookssections.<br>  <br>  They are both having new promotions on almost a daily basis. So see what looks most interesting to you.<br>  <br>  If you want your laptop to be able to hold all of your songs and videos and Dell is having a free 120GB hard drive upgrade, then you may want to go with Dell.<br>  <br>  The same goes for an HP promotion. Because these laptop brands have proven time and time again their quality, it may be wise to simply decide based on who has the better promotion at the time.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	you didn't provide any information as regards to spec and price. so can't tell you if its worthy or not.<br>  <br>  by the way, if this laptop is 200 dollars more expensive than a normal one just because of its fancy touchsmart function, dont buy it.|`|wlWJL33Iaa	What are your basic requirements?  That's the key.<br>  Do  you want the 'tablet' capabilities of this machine?<br>  Do you want the difference offered by twisting the screen so that it becomes flat?<br>  These are key questions that are the features of the TouchSmart that generally laptops do not have. This is important for you state whether these features are important to you.<br>  <br>  The machine is really a lot of fun.  The ability to twist the screen is not only convenient, it's great for sharing screen visuals in tight spaces (buses, planes, etc.) with others and you don't have to take up the space of a fully opened laptop.<br>  <br>  The capabilities of the touch screen itself is fun too.  Your finger becomes your 'mouse' or pointing device and that makes it easier to navigate.  One drawback is that if you have big hands with fat fingers, it takes a little bit more to accurately point / touch, etc.<br>  <br>  As for the pricing, it is coming down.  I don't think that as many people are running out to buy it as HP originally thought.  It's more of a 'toy' than a heavy duty workhorse.  For that reason people who need a workhorse can get that for less money and do without the bells and whistles of a touch screen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and see the link below.<br>  <br>  Cheers...

EMC7JwVBaa	It should say yes or no on the install EULA.  ATT will tell you if you phone them. I don't see why you shouldn't be able to use the one subscription on any computer you have- it costs enough.<br>  <br>  Don't let them jerk you around about their rebate. It's their routine to stall and tell you you did something wrong or ask for the barcode you already mailed to them and even lie to you. Back up all your documents and use certified mail. I went through that and everybody else I know went through it too. Don't depend on e-mail.Get them on the phone and make them give clear answers, get names, times and dates. ATT is very tricky and tries to cheat everybody out of rebates.

JV8lgDRCaa	HP|`|dkpIjt5jaa	There is really no best !<br>  <br>  Here is how to do more precise research to find the best one for YOU: The first step is to get information on the laptops that you are interested in and, as a second step, to search online at web stores (like Amazon or similar) or at retail shops (BestBuy, staples or similar) for the best deals on the ones you would really like to have based on your search.<br>  <br>  This way, you get the best working laptops at the best prices.<br>  <br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your research.|`|h1VGrOHuaa	Personally I would go with HP. It comes with a 1 yr warranty and  can be extended to 3 years. Most HP laptops now a days have the ability to have two Physical Hard Drives.<br>  <br>  Dell takes forever to get tech support for your computer. I had a broken headphone jack on it and dell was being very idiotic. I have been working on computers for over 10 years and they were saying i had a computer virus? You can see that the port was loose. I had two idiots from that company that didin't listen to the customer.<br>  <br>  I like HP because my DVD drive failed so HP was on the phone with me in less then 10 mins and gave me no problems on replacing the drive. Replacement works fine. It came with a great video card and many great options.|`|4K0FOiRtaa	it depends, if u dont mind having it ordered from dell.com then DELL, but studys show that HP makes the best laptops, but personally, I have an HP laptop and I am gettin a Dell soon.

The mailing address is hard and fast - if you go somewhere else, the mailing address stays where it was, but (within reason) you can take your phone number with you.<br>  <br>  Your phone number is allocated to you by someone else (akin to a DHCP server) and can change - if you don't go anywhere your mailing address will stay the same.<br>  <br>  Bring in DNS and that is like the phone directory...|`|AA11284831	Both.|`|CGJTKFLKaa	Mailing address.<br>  <br>  Mainly because stuff gets delivered to it.

2cq46sDeaa	Unfortunately, your program is really too large to comment on, but the fundamental problem is you keep calling main() when you want to redraw the menu.<br>  <br>  The type of program that you are writing should be structured as loop.<br>  <br>  You also need to be precise in function parameters - you are giving functions parameters that are not being used and returning values that are not being used - it makes the program less understandable as the reader has to follow the variables.<br>  <br>  I would write the program something like this<br>  <br>  int main( int cArgs, char **ppArgs )<br>  {<br>  char cMenuSelection;<br>  int finished = 0;<br>  <br>  while( !finished )<br>  {<br>  printf("\n\nWelcome to the BASIC AREA-VOLUME Finder!\n");<br>  printf("Press 'A' for AREA ;\n 'V' for Volume;\n 'E' for exit\n");<br>  scanf("%c", &cMenuSelection);<br>  <br>  switch( toupper( cMenuSelection ) )<br>  {<br>  case A:<br>    calculateArea();<br>    break;<br>  <br>  case V:<br>    calculateVolume();<br>    break;<br>  <br>  case E:<br>    finished = 1;<br>    break;<br>  <br>  default:<br>    printf( "'%c' is an invalid option, please re-select\n", cMenuSelection );<br>  }<br>  <br>  }<br>  printf("Thank you for trying my Basic Area-Volume Finder...Hope it helped you a lot!\n");<br>  return 0; //main has a return value<br>  }<br>  <br>  void calculateArea( void )<br>  {<br>  char cMenuSelection;<br>  int finished = 0;<br>  <br>  while( !finished )<br>  {<br>  printf("AREA\n");<br>  printf("a.

Functions should return.<br>  <br>  Example 1.1:<br>  <br>  void foobar (int x)<br>  {<br>    if (x < 0) {<br>      /* print some error message */<br>     return; /* this will exit the function foobar and continue execution at the place where foobar was called */<br>    }<br>    /* do some things with x */<br>    /* at the end of a void function we don't need an explicit 'return' statement.<br>  }<br>  <br>  Example 1.2:<br>  <br>  int square (int x)<br>  {<br>    int a;<br>    a = x * x;<br>    return a; /* we pass the number a to the caller */<br>  }<br>  <br>  int main (int argc, char *argv[])<br>  {<br>    int x = 0, y;<br>    printf ("Give me a number: ");<br>    scanf ("%i", &x);<br>    y = square (x);<br>    printf ("The square is %i.\n", y);<br>    exit (0) /* exit the program */<br>  }<br>  <br>  2. If you want to have the same part of the program executed several times. i.e. a loop, use the 'for' or 'while' statement. Avoid infinit recursion.<br>  <br>  Example 2.1:<br>  <br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int main (int argc, char *argv[])<br>  {<br>    int c = 0;<br>    while (c != EOF) {<br>     /* display a menu */<br>      c = getchar ();<br>      switch (c) {<br>  case 'a':<br>  case 'A':<br>    /* do something  for option a or A */<br>  break;<br>  case 'b':<br>  case 'B':<br>  /* handle option B or b */<br>  break;<br>  /* ... */<br>  case 'e':<br>  case 'E':<br>  c = EOF; /* set c to EOF to end the loop */<br>  }<br>  } /* after the option is handled we go to the beginning of the while loop */<br>  return 0; /* program exit */<br>  }<br>  <br>  Update:<br>  In your program, you keep calling the same functions again and again without ever returning. This wastes memory and can even lead to a stack overflow. For each function call the computer will keep the return address, the function arguments and the local variables of the function on the stack (in memory) until the function returns. While the user browses the menu, the stack will be filled up with useless data.<br>  <br>  If you like jumping around in the program, use the goto statement and some labels. I know that everybody sais that goto is bad, but until you learn the more elegant ways, you can experiment with goto.
0g7wdDrcaa	I've been asking myself the same question and have been looking for a good game creation system just to pass the time.  In my searching, I've found a program called "Platinum Arts Sandbox."  This handy program is a 3D environment creation program that basically allows you to create a massive world for your characters to investigate and search.  Change the landscape, add objects to interact with, go far underground or climb to the top of a mountain.  Whatever you think of, you can accomplish.

AA11922229	Yes, if only the keyboard is involved the laptop is repairable. When water flows below onto the motherboard it's a lost cause. Remember the computer has value as is for parts. Send it in to be cleaned unless you have the skills to assemble a laptop. You need to take it apart enough to get to the keyboard. If the part is beyond repair, then you might replace the keyboard yourself. You can order the keyboard part from the vendor at a reasonable price. This is a meticulous endeavor. You can find instructions on the vendor support site. Save every screw in a tupper ware bowl with a lid. Use the proper tools. Take notes and pictures if necessary. Assembly is just the reverse of a disassemble. Keyboards are accessible once you get the top cover off.<br>  <br>  If you are a novice, it's better to send it in for repairs.|`|ZMyABA8caa	try taking out the keys from the keyboard, literally pull them out, but before u do so, memorize or write down their order so u dont forget.

Look in the manual or on the Net how to do it on that particular laptop. Clean out everything UNDER the keyboard and the underside of it once it's out. I bet there's a lot of this sauce under the keyboard.<br>  If this doesn't help, buy a keyboard or even a broken laptop on eBay and replace. Of course, you can go to a computer repair shop and ask if they have a used keyboard.|`|gASz3hDWaa	The sauce has gotten to the keyboard contacts. You will need to have it cleaned out.

oLj0VTX5aa	1. Becareful of registry cleaners if you are unsure of how to use them.  I used a pretty nice one called "crap cleaner," it is free and it is simplified to use.  I use this in conjunction with Spybot Search and Destroy, also free.  Use the Search and Destroy, first.  Be sure to UPDATE and immunize first, then run it.  Run crap cleaner, after.  The crap cleaner will give you the option to create a back-up - when I first started using it, I did, but after, I avoided it.  It also gives you the option to review the registry entries or look for erroneous programmes you do not remember installing, and removing them.  With crap cleaner, I clean the hard drive first, and then I run the "issues" scan. <br>  <br>  2. Bit Torrent is safe to use, you just have to look at the source of the download, obviously if its some crazy sex site in Romania, it might be loaded with viruses.   I cannot suggest sites for downloading illegal files. Though, I prefer to use Utorrent, because it has a simpler interface and uses less resources. I also use a virus scanner, as described below. <br>  <br>  3. I used AVG free dition as it uses less resources.  It updates itself daily, and I have yet to have a problem.  If it tries to tell you your edition is about to be no longer supported, that's crap.  Choose not to upgrade, and after 30 days that notice goes away and it still updates itself.|`|GxXpvNIwaa	A good registry repair software can make your computer run better by eliminating crashes and instances where your computer fall down! When you de-fragment your registry, it should also optimize the way windows stores information necessary to the operation of the system. Registry repair softwares that are not well designed could cause more problems in the long run.<br>  Step1<br>  A good registry cleaner look for all potential problems, but sometimes, the registry cleaner that finds the most errors is actually doing the poorest job, since it might be showing errors when there really aren't any. Some tools does it intentionally as their developers set the tool such a way so that it can show user that it is good! But the truth is that many of the so called errors are false positives. Some poor tools even can’t properly identify problems. <br>  Step2<br>  But as it is not safe to repair registry manually, you should get an efficient cleaning tool. Fortunately, most registry cleaners allow you to test their product for free to see which one you like best. Be sure to find a registry repair program with a user-friendly and visually eye catching interface. Also make sure the registry repair software you choose has a vivid help file resource that is updated on a regular basis. <br>  Step3<br>  Again, look for friendly customer support. You should prefer product that gives you 24 hour customer service and it's ideal if you can actually talk to a human being over the phone. Look for a registry repair software program that's been around for a while. You should not rely on such product that doesn't have many reviews. Also, look for good companies that have reputation on developing such technical tools and read reviews of their previously developed products. <br>  Go to :<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a><br>  <br>  See the best registry cleaner.|`|NpZukuuraa	i've use a registry cleaner for a few years now without any problem. Though repair and cleaning are the only issues on purchaser's minds, the best software programs offer optimization features to supplement repair characteristics. Good software programs will have tools that will complete system defrag (to free hard drive space), remove Internet Explorer plug-ins that slow your internet, and that remove viruses and spy ware from your computer. Not only do you get effective repair options, now you also get Internet Explorer plug-in removers, evidence scanners and cleaners, registry defrags, junk file cleaners, all in addition to standard scanning features.<br>  <br>  Now you can get so much more for your money. The following scan categories should be included in the software: Shared Program Paths, Application Paths, File Associations, Active X/Coms/OLE, Font Files, Help Files, Toolbars, Shared DLL Files, Invalid Shortcuts, Most Recent Files, and Startup Files.<br>  <br>  The Automated System Back Up feature will saves your previous file "state" in case you are not happy with the changes made to your PC after the repair is complete. Sometimes changes made from repair are not what we expected. It is great to have the option to go back to the status we had prior to the repair in case we want to restore some of the files we selected to remove prior. Top registry repair software will ensure that you have a way to return to this previous state. This is considered the piece of mind attribute!. The source below will give you six criteria of a good registry repair software.<br>  <br>  Bit torrent is save to use only if you have a reliable anti-virus software. i've tried most anti-virus software and finally i'm using kaspersky as the best solution to defend my pc against virus and trojan.|`|AA10622261	1. I use CCleaner and Eusing for a long time and they never gave me any problems. If in doubt you can set up a restore point before cleaning up the registry errors they present. <br>  <br>  2. Any torrent clients (u torrent is the most popular) are safe in themselves the problem can be in what is downloaded through them. Some downloads contain viruses and trojans. You must read comments from other downloaders at torrent search engines eg BT junkie and Isohunt regarding each torrent. <br>  <br>  And after download always scan them with an antivirus before opening them.<br>  <br>  3. Kaspersky is the best but not free. The best free antivirus programs are Avast, AVG or Avira. Can only run one at a time on a PC.|`|Ru3PBiAbaa	There are no problems as such in using registry cleaners and bit torrents. If you have a good knowledge of system registry then of course you can use them. Though registry cleaners often report missing or unused or damaged registries that can be safely removed and completely remove a software from your computer. But if by chance a key component or some useful entry is deleted it can be fatal as you may end up corrupting your OS and then you might have to reinstall it.<br>  <br>  So use it but carefully and always trust the certified and authorised vendors as these programs may send away your personal info over the net and put your system at risk.<br>  <br>  As far as bit torrent downloaders are concerned download any of them but always make sure you have a strong firewall nd a working, up-to-date anti-virus and always select those files which have maximum seeds but do not always trust them as most of them are fake.<br>  <br>  <br>  As per my advice go for Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 as it can run on even the slowest of the systems and yet is very efficient.|`|f6jl6sLYaa	bit torrent is an ok software as far as torrent downloading is concerned.......<br>  u can use free download manager ...it also helps download .exe and other files from the internet and also helps download torrents....<br>  <br>  kaspersky is the bestest best in the market right now but technology changes everyday so u hav to keep urself updated<br>  <br>  norton 360 is a piece of crap now adays..it is heavy on the pc and despite the fact that it has so many features it is unable to protect fully<br>  <br>  norton internet security 2009 is good rather very good....light and has a good security mechanism<br>  <br>  mcaffe is very light and is moderate in it's approach towards cleaning/////<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  rest as i said above tech changes but as far my experience goes kaspersky works great with---xp, vista and now windows 7 too...i am using that|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	These AV`s are all free and good.

lE0WkLcAaa	"Data warehousing is the coordinated, architected, and periodic copying of data from various<br>  sources, both inside and outside the enterprise, into an environment optimized for analytical<br>  and information processing."|`|e295212ac619ad7dc5661979f2cf9cb2aa	a term used to  when having more than one database. a collection of db.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  Abbreviated DW, a collection of data designed to support management decision making. Data warehouses contain a wide variety of data that present a coherent picture of business conditions at a single point in time. <br>  Development of a data warehouse includes development of systems to extract data from operating systems plus installation of a warehouse database system that provides managers flexible access to the data. <br>  <br>  The term data warehousing generally refers to the combination of many different databases across an entire enterprise. Contrast with data mart. <br>  <br>  ===|`|5f8cace1691644ab12360590233ce03faa	Datawarehousing is taking data and placing in an organized repository or database that is acessible.  The accesibility is existent for various reasons Business Intelligence/Reporting, Audit Trails, Change Control, Version Control and Privacy Concerns.<br>  <br>  A datawarehouse can take data from many places or a single place and store it.  It is stored in such a manner that it is both secure and accessible to authorized entities.  <br>  <br>  Lets take the phone company for example.  The phone company has a system that allows customers to get billed for their services and usage. Customers have indentifiers that are unique to them such as their Name, Address, Social Security Number, Contact Numbers, Employer and such.  The phone company assigns an identifier based on what they do to the unique customer identifier.  This is an account number.  Everthing rolls up to the account number.  If a customer is responsible for six telephone numbers these roll up to the account number and the account number is given identity with customer information.<br>  <br>  This system may or may not take individual phone calls, known as records and apply a charge to each call based on the time, the day, the length, and the distance of the call.  This function would be determined by the manner in which the customer may have been contracted for a price plan.  (They may have bundles of minutes, or they may get charged by the minute) This function is called rating.    They also have a system that allows a customer's service to activated, deactivated and modified.  This is generally called provisioning.  Down the road when the customer calls in with a problem that his phone isn't working correctly the information is captured, routed to the appropriate point for resolution, the issue is worked until it is resolved and the information about the issue (a trouble ticket) is associated and notated on the customer account.  Every interaction between the customer and phone company is documented and stored.<br>  <br>  Now that I have given you an idea of the way the company does business and they use computer systems to capture the data.  Where the heck does it all go. Think of it this way:  Multiply the number customers x their address x their 2 phone numbers x their ssn AND multiply this x however many calls they made in a month x the time x the day x the rate x the type x length of each call AND dont forget the number of times they called in about thier bill x the changes that were made x date x time x the person making the change x action taken......I think you get the idea the amount of data multiplies reapeatedly.  They told two friends and so on and so on and so on!<br>  <br>  Do we dump it somewhere and when you need to know how many customers had the same issue during this period of time and the issues were resolved using what techinques in what period of time you hit a button on your PC and it causes the data to be accessed and presented to you in a manner that is relatable to the message you are trying to convey. NOT THAT SIMPLE.<br>  <br>  All the data points and pieces I discussed in the phone company scenario start out in what is called a system of record.  The live system which is the point of entry.  The data of the system is considered live data.  This is living breathing and changeable.  Everything change must be recorded with details around who what where when why how.  Once the data ages and is no longer living (meaning call records older than a year, account data inactive for sixty days or whatever the business defines as an approriate rule - governed by law too) it can be archived.  The archived data will never ever ever change again.  It needs to be stored again for a specific period of time.  It was never a good idea to dump papers into cardboard boxes and stick em in the back room and forget about them.  So instead put the data into a big database that is a warehouse which can hold TERRABYTES of information (a company like AOL TIME WARNER, one of the largest repositories of consumer data, has something like 45 different warehouses and each warehouse could be hundreds of billions of terrabytes).  The warehouses are virtual and labelled and there is a tool used to access the data.  This process is called querying.  The tools are so simple to use these days that you can literally piece what you want to know together using pictures or icons and then pivot the data to determine numerous outcomes.<br>  <br>  In summary, companies rely on huge amounts of data so their business can run effectively.  The data which is live must remain in the system of record until it ages.  The data which is no long changeable or has direct impacts to the bottom line can be archived or warehoused.  The data waerhouse can accept this data, organize, keep it readily available and present it in a way that is seamless to someone who needed something yesterday.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  I know this was lengthy but understanding and relating to an abstract concept is much easier when you understand business application.

qQmXMvNHaa	Well Here we go, some reasons that I share about not owning one, I have a really old one that works fine, but here we go (these are web published by yours truly).<br>  <br>  For Windows users Vista represents an impressive update to Windows XP. Featuring lots of glitz and a much more reliable underlying operating system it is a great offering if your computer has the horsepower to run it. But with all that change there are a couple other gotchas. First, it won't be available at retail until after the holiday season. Microsoft is providing coupons for upgrades, but if you buy a PC now you'd need to do the upgrade yourself. And that is tricky at best and downright error-prone. Vista is not compatible with all current applications and many vendors don't have Vista compatible replacements yet. The same is true for drivers. So attempting to upgrade an existing Windows install is quite an effort. I've done it three times and in two cases had to give up and do a clean install of Vista--then re-install all my applications. It isn't impossible, but you may have better things to do with your time. If you wait until January you can get Vista pre-installed and save yourself the hassle.<br>  <br>  The much awaited Core 2 Duo chips are out in a variety of Mac and Windows laptops. As predicted they do increase performance--mostly on media-related tasks--but they also turn out to consume a noticeable amount more power; about 20% more than the Core Duo chips they are replacing. The result is decreased battery time. Through clever power management innovations the loss in battery life has been minimized but the Core 2 introduction reverses the overall trend to lower power and lower battery life. Personally that's got me thinking it's worth waiting until the designs shake out and either there is a lower power version of the Core 2 Duo or some other breakthrough that increases battery life. The bright side is that the rush to Core 2 Duo laptops is providing some good short-term deals on laptops based on the slightly older Core Duo chips. <br>  <br>  Intel has accelerated its launch of a 4-way (4 processor core) CPU chip, codenamed Kentsfield, to the end of this year. That should mean both Mac and Windows desktop computers with 4-way processors in the first quarter of 2007. That's almost a full quarter earlier than they were anticipated. If you're not in a hurry to replace your current desktop, a 4-way machine running Vista or MacOS in early 07 will do a much better job of keeping up with your image heavy lifting. Image processing applications like Photoshop and image management applications like DigitalPro are becoming increasingly multi-thread aware so the more processor cores the faster your work will go. Dell has already announced (and previewed) the Dell XPS 710, based on the Kentsfield (Core 2 Extreme) chipset, but it isn't available. yet. <br>  <br>  Adobe will not be producing a Universal Binary (native) version of Photoshop for Intel-based Macs until the next major upgrade--expected to be "CS3" in the Spring. Until that time Photoshop won't take full advantage of the new Macs, although in fairness even the current version is quite fast on the new machines. <br>  <br>  Those are just a couple, but the overall message here is you buy one and spend a lot of money on it, but the second you recieve it, it is already out dated. So if you can live without one, or an older cheap one more power to you!|`|XmoKqfVXaa	wish i could give you reasons  but  i cant as i need one myself|`|yEzDz8P4aa	People without computers are badasses?

GnIxS7rRaa	How did you remove the security settings of the router? did you access its settings page? or did you just reset the router?<br>  <br>  Because what's happening right now, your computer connects to an available network which is owned by your neighbor since your pc cannot associate to your linksys network.<br>  <br>  And for your question, yes it is possible to reinstall the linksys router again. Use a computer that is physically connected to the router and type 192.168.1.1 on the address bar of your internet explorer. It will ask for username and password. By default, it should be <br>  admin (username)<br>  admin (password)<br>  <br>  or <br>  admin (username)<br>  password (password)<br>  <br>  Then just go to the security settings tab ..verify all the information there ...<br>  <br>  another way to reconfigure your linksys router is to load the CD that came along with the router when you first bought it. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps..

I7rS4vq7aa	Simply put, no.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can't upgrade the GPU card. Or, as you put it..."VGA card"<br>  The reason is because the laptop uses integrated graphics, and has no expansion ports. (pci, pci-e, agp, etc.)|`|sA7DuUUBaa	No sorry the only thing upgradable on a laptop is ram and CD drive or DVD drives which ever it has. If the Laptop has a upgrade memory slot (small square panel on back of unit)<br>  as all computers are set for MEMORY limit is double the amount of its Original memory from factory. for instance if it has 1GB ram then its limit is 2GB total by adding 1GB ram to it. if its 2GB ram then only a 2GB limit etc. if you want to upgrade your video card because you want it to have more MEMORY then by upgrading the ram will help the video MEMORY as long as its a share Video memory in most cases it is. But if its dedicated Video then the extra ram wont help it. But its likely shared like most all video cards are on PC.|`|jZ5MnD7Qaa	The Maximum RAM for that Laptop is about 4GB, I'm not sure if it has an expansion bay/slot.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|zVSg2GSjaa	You must contact the Toshiba support and ask them if they can do this.<br>  Because they are the only ones that have the right to do such a task on your laptop.

You can always do your homework at the computer lab at school even though this may not be convenient.<br>  <br>  Like it or not, Microsoft Office is the industry standard business suite in the real world.  All companies use the software as far as I know.  So you need to be prepared to function in the work world and this is the software you will need to master.<br>  <br>  Either at school, or if you can afford it, at home.<br>  <br>  Many years ago, more than I like to recall, I took a typing course in high school.  The school had these neat new IBM "selectric" typewriters that were a breeze to use.  Even back around 1965 they sold for around $500 (which is like about $2,500 in today's economy), so we had to do all our practicing and homework there at the high school.<br>  <br>  The Student edition of Office is about $150. and sometimes on sale for $89 or so.  You probably spend more than that each month eating out and going to the movies.<br>  <br>  It's all about priorities.  Microsoft is never going to give this away for free.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	open office is free and whilst not a 100% the full version is still very good

Hackers will use this critical security oversight to trick victims into allowing their garbage to be installed, with innocent looking (often mimmicing legit window notices) 'click to view' or 'you must allow Active X to view this content' or 'install the latest Java here' to that end.<br>  <br>  2)  Requesting files from Peer-2-Peer servers<br>       Because they use multiple 'peer contributors' to feed bits & parts of a requested file (music, movies, etc.) back to you, there can never be any kind of certainty about the status of the sender's file.<br>  Whatever they have =  you get: malevolent or not.<br>    <br>  Once downloaded to your machine, all bets are off about it's safety to open, transfer, use or re-send; and size of a file has little bearing on what it may or may not contain; scanned or otherwise.<br>  <br>  Use @ your own peril...<br>  <br>  3)  Relying on single malware defense method<br>      Many folks assume they are immune to infections when they have a 'Security Suite' (like McAffe, or Norton, etc.) and engage in risky behavior like going to known 'dark side' sites, or porn sites.  Security must be done in layers; user interaction with the system; and current threat landscape awareness.<br>  Because the Internet is so fluid, it evolves and changes almost hourly, and all users must stay current with all defense measures...it's just the way it is. <br>  <br>  *Prime Defense countermeasures*<br>  1) Use a "Limited" account to surf the Net<br>  2) Use Firefox, with "NoScript" add-on.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Set up a limited-user account and password protect your admin account.

When you are running cpu-intensive applications and the current in your house fluctuates, if the PSU can't handle it then you'll get weird behavior in your PC like rebooting or a freeze. In general, any PSU over 500 Watts will do but like I said, the higher the wattage the better (mine is 750W from Ultra).|`|TcxzbEaAaa	if the motherboard does not have a built in graphics card then when you bought the motherboard it should have a plan and a power output chart showing what sockets and capacities it has.<br>  if the drop in loader style of graphics card should also have some details about what type of cable and what type of voltage is need.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Look at the requirements of the card. The specs should tell you what kind of power is required.<br>  <br>  Then add in a few hundred watts for the rest of your system.<br>  <br>  Then buy the PS that offers at least that number. Frankly, the best thing to do is to get as much wattage as you can afford. The "additional" power doesn't get used if there's nothing that needs it, so it really won't cost you any more to run a higher rated PSU.|`|WeZcSZvKaa	The highest rating you can afford basically although 550 W covers most things.

Touch the metal frame of the computer case, to relieve your body of Static electricity.<br>  <br>  Break the plastic locking tab off of the trigger mechanism, of the can of air. This plastic locking tab was put there, to insure that the trigger wouldn't be depressed during shipping. Insert the plastic 'straw' provided with the can of air.<br>  <br>  Start at the top, of the inside of the computer. Hold the tip of the straw away, from the internal parts of the computer, about the length of your hand. Heel of your hand to the tip of your longest finger. Go across from left to right, or right to left. The choice is yours. Go from one side all the way over to the other side. Start spraying at one side, and when you reach the other side stop. Drop down a row. This row is a space in your mind, of what you think the spray of air will cover. <br>  Your deduction, will probably be pretty accurate.<br>  <br>  Keep going down in rows, until you reach the processor fan. At this point, you want to pay special attention to the fan, and the heatsink underneath it. The heatsink looks like a finned metal part.<br>  In-between the fins needs to be cleared of the buildup of gunk, also.<br>  WHEN spraying air at the fan, however, use Short Bursts!<br>  <br>  Squeeze the trigger in all the way, but let go quick. You are using short bursts on the small fan for the processor, because this fan is only designed to spin so fast.<br>  Spinning it faster than it was designed for, can lead to premature failure of the fan's bearings. (Premature failure. Means the fan will quit spinning, way before it's time)<br>  <br>  Go all the way down, until you reach the bottom of the computer case.<br>  Spray the bottom of the computer case out also.<br>  <br>  Now go up to the top, at the back, and spray your power supply out. Looking at the back of the computer, you will see a large fan. There may be a computer case fan also. You want the one where the power cord plugs in. Come back around, and find the power supply. Top/back of the computer case.<br>  Stick the straw in one of the ventilation holes, (Slots or holes) Spray the crud out of there the best you can. Come to the back of the computer, and spray the fan blades off, and the surrounding cage around the blades.<br>  <br>  Clean the computer case fan/s too.<br>  <br>  When using the can of air, the instructions on the can, advise you to not tilt the can. When doing a good job, it's inevitable that you will tilt the can. IT'S OKAY!<br>  When you tilt the can, some of the propellant will come out. It will dry.<br>  Also when using the can of air, you will notice that it drops the air pressure coming out after a while. This, is because the air is coming out of the can so fast, that the moisture in the outside surrounding air, is frozen. (See the frost on the trigger head, and upper parts of the can?)<br>  <br>  Set the can down, and let it warm up a bit. Ten minutes or so. Then you can use it again.<br>  <br>  When that processor fan and heatsink inside, becomes clogged with gunk, the cooling capacity of these components drops tremendously.<br>  <br>  The heatsink is attached to the processor, and draws heat away from it. It acts just like a small radiator. It is.<br>  The fan, blows the hot air radiated up from the heatsink, away from the heatsink.<br>  <br>  When a processor becomes too hot, (It has a maximum heat range), it shuts off. This is a Fail Safe feature, built into every processor made. It's there to keep the processor from burning up (Literally!)<br>  <br>  If the processor shuts off, you have no computer. When the processor cools back off, the computer can be turned on again.<br>  <br>  Solution?<br>  Clean the computer out, and the power supply.|`|r3ANv1bPaa	If it does when in Idle condition , it is set on power saving and if it does during normal operation , it means it has been affected with a virus, <br>  and if it is laptop ,, the battery may be faulty .. check it , <br>  I hope this will help you.|`|ncAiWIvWaa	It could be having problems saving application data.<br>  <br>  I would remove any unwanted applications.<br>  Download software to clear up the registry.<br>  Run a suitable virus and spyware package (AVG, Ad-Aware or Spy-bot).<br>  I would also chkdsk /f your hard drives.<br>  <br>  Also has this perhaps happened after you added something to your pc i.e. software? <br>  <br>  Perhaps depending on your windows edition rollback to a previous checkpoint/back-up to restore your pc to how it was before this started to happen (Careful to backup any important data).<br>  <br>  Just take your time and do one thing at a time and monitor the performance when it shuts down.|`|laofAjTAaa	make sure no power saving is setup www.computer-adviser.com/pc-entering-pow...|`|Onaigcagaa	Have you got it programmed to sleep' or on a power save configuration' this is only if your on vista.|`|2COaydcfaa	sounds like a problem with the battery|`|So1Da3dvaa	If your computer is going into sleep mode (after not being used for 10-15 minutes) just right click on your desktop, click on the very last option - on Vista it's "Personalize".

IM7nzdjbaa	Well my suggestion for you would be to advertise!  Go to the MySpace forums and find topics where people ask for MySpace help, layouts, etc.  Just post your page link or whatever there, telling them to come to your page "for all their MySpace needs", and eventually people will rely on you for layouts and stuff.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: you can also become affiliates with other MySpace layout creators to get your name out there more.

BGjNqDloaa	yes it will, only as a website. a much mroe dependable website to use is called www.torrentz.com it searches all torrent websites (including the main ones such as mininova and piratebay).<br>  <br>  what happens is the browser you use whether it is mac or windows downloads the links and sends them to your torrent downloading program such as BitTorrent. its more of the question that if it is not working it could be the program you use to download your torrents. other than that, all the websites do is supply the information on the seeds/leeches in order for you to obtain the file(s).<br>  <br>  what you can try doing is right clicking on the "download torrent" button and clicking "save target as" and saving it to your computer, and then trying to open it. once openned and loaded into your torrent program you can then delete the link you saved.<br>  <br>  ps.<br>  <br>  the piratebay.org has had some serious technical difficulties lately, many people are resorting to mininova and torrentz instead, much more reliable.|`|A5lLYd0Qaa	i would suggest using www.h33t.com it has Various categories of torrents... ranging from movies, to windows apps to MAC APPS... so it would work|`|QEQKFpgjaa	It doesn't Work On MACS :)

dca582dcac9ba5d7f83b88ba006f4da0aa	Okay hopefully you'll take this as positive feedback and its going to sound harsh but its what I do for a living. I hope you take it as its meant, a learning experience!:)<br>  <br>  First impression, its slow! I have broadband and it was slow loading which worries me a lot! Esp since not everyone has broadband or the patience I have.<br>  <br>  As a rule the colours you have chosen are traditionally used on gaming\personal sites.<br>  <br>  It looks old school. Good thing? I don't think so. What you want to portray is you're services as a developer and I don't think the design does that very well. It does look smart and clean tho its not all bad!<br>  <br>  There is typo's in the text on the front page, frankly I'd be worried about paying someone who can't spell check text before putting it on a site or in an image. Its welcome not weclome!:/<br>  <br>  You're page\site needs titles and you also have it in a table design which is considered very bad practice. You also have blank alt tags on all the images which doesn't help a blind person navigate around you're menu images.<br>  <br>  On the plus side I do like the navigation its plain and simple.<br>  <br>  As already said, its time you learned html\css the basics of slicing images and keeping them small. Also you need to get away from letting Dreamweaver do all the work, for example you have javascript rollovers which are all completely do-able in css nowadays and even work on very old browsers like ie5.5\ie6.<br>  <br>  Look and learn on the w3schools site in html, css sections (see links) and absorb all you can then when you've learned it all put it into practice on a site you're proud of...<br>  <br>  Some advice on learning, don't do advanced stuff before you know the basics. I don't see how learning vb at this point will help you. Its 100% possible to just use html\css to make a really nice site people will pay for. It wouldn't be a waste of time also having a look and starting to practice web standards now either that way there's no learning curve when you do learn the basics you'll already be doing them :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|SNZ88BfKaa	1. Use text, not images. That paragraph of text that is actually an image is ridiculous. It takes forever to load, and it's totally unnecessary. Use text. Always.<br>  2. Dreamweaver? Really? It's time to learn XHTML and CSS so you aren't dependent on Dreamweaver.<br>  3. Red on gray isn't super friendly.|`|peFufWeYaa	Too dark, man. I could not even read it, seriously. I would have to like close the curtains and turn off the lights in the room. You need to choose a lighter font or something.<br>  <br>  Loads fast here though, very fast. I 'm in California|`|FthSZ0ngaa	Hmmmmmmmmm........<br>  <br>  Due to all of the different scams and attacks made online, I am definitely not going to visit your website, as I do not know anything about you.  Also, your  web address is from TK, which is Turkey, if I am correct.  There are numerous sites from that reason that are serious security threats to anyone who visits them.  Not trying to be mean, but I don't see your website as being a true site, because no one offers their services for free, not even a Noob.<br>  <br>  Nice try though.|`|2K9pLrmSaa	It looks like your doing better than me, i think it looks pretty good. im ony making basic sites and not that up on how to do it but im going to start college soon. Feel free to e mail me maybe we could exchange some ideas as i have jobs lined up,Check out one im doing as a sample now  www.lowbudgetwebdesigns.co.uk|`|MR9iBgafaa	The simple to use menu at the top is good. I prefer the top menu to down-the-side menus.<br>  <br>  Depends on what you're advertising really - some products need pics and videos - eg food, electronics.  Other items don't need specific pics - eg adverts for councils. Just general marketing pics.<br>  <br>  Looks ok, need more info on the site.|`|o7NQufdTaa	Just a homepage? Hmm....You never want to open up something to the public that is still under construction. Might want to complete much more before you open it up. Maybe use a different text color, make the site a little more attractive, center the buttons and "Camm Solutions" banner.<br>  Or add a company logo into the banner with some graphics to even out the page. Right now it looks strange having everything in the center but aligned left to the text box.<br>  <br>  Just being honest, sorry if I'm critical, I took a few Graphics/Media design classes.<br>  <br>  There isn't anything wrong with dreamweaver, if you know how to use it properly it is pretty nice for simple sites.
4cdAy130aa	First please look for Bluetooth icon on your laptop keyboard - there could be switches to turn Bluetooth on. Also look at System tray if it is there then you have Bluetooth. <br>  If this simple actions won't reveal Bluetooth on your laptop perform the following: right click My Computer -> Properties -> hardware tab -> Device Manager.

Each one is different in how it does this or where it stores this information, however.<br>  <br>  Usually, to access your router, you open up any web browser and type the router's IP address into the URL box. More often than not, this pulls up a configuration dialog (possibly after requesting a username and/or password). If it keeps the information you're looking for, it will most likely be stored somewhere in here.|`|PPA30E8naa	just hit the network icon from start|`|260feace6d64b2faf51e9ce75a95f6bcaa	Click on start>run>type cmd.exe>ipconfig/all>look for your IP address, it should be something like this 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.1. Copy it and paste it into your browser, this will open your router admin. Now look for wireless settings and change the password. Nobody can connect to your network except the password is given to them by you. <br>  Remember - it is this area you can make changes and also if you activate your log all activities you will be able to know who is using or logging into your network illegally|`|ENvDT5vHaa	Once you've determined if someone else is using your router you can add a layer of security by only allowing known MAC addresses to access it.  As each network adapter will have a unique MAC address you can block all other traffic quite easily.  You MAC address can be found using the "ipconfig /all" command in the WinXP command prompt.  <br>  <br>  If no one else is using your network, but it's still being slow/unresponsive you may want to check if you have any spyware/malware on your system using up all your bandwidth.|`|TOkoHXRFaa	Will get out the router manual and check from there.

ySKsOfIMaa	Celerons have a bad reputation because the first ones had no cache. Cache is basically RAM that is kept on the CPU and that only it ever uses. This makes cache an order of magnitude faster for the CPU to retrieve needed information from than if it had to retrieve information from system RAM.<br>  <br>  These days a Celeron does come with cache on the CPU. However, it tends to be a very small amount - normally only 512KB of L2 and 32KB of L1 (which is faster than L2, but also more expensive) per core.<br>  <br>  However, for general purposes, a Celeron is perfectly fine.|`|I7rS4vq7aa	It's the cache...<br>  that's really the only reason.<br>  <br>  The Cache is tiny compared to the others and it can't allocate as much stuff to 'quick memory'.<br>  <br>  Yes, they last long as long as it has proper cooling.<br>  The laptop is going to be fine for school, decently fast.<br>  And that 4500MHD integrated graphics also has 128mb dedicated (as far as I can remember) Unless intel fully stopped doing dedicated memory.
ySKsOfIMaa	L1 (or level 1) and L2 (or level 2) cache could be thought of as RAM that is built into the CPU and that only the CPU will ever use. There is also L3 (or level 3) cache, however it isn't as commonly used.<br>  <br>  L1 cache is the fastest, but is also the most expensive. The price of a CPU tends to rise sharply with the L1 cache, which is the basic reason why you never see a CPU with very much of it. The other reason there isn't that much is because there's a physical limitation for how much L1 cache can be present.<br>  <br>  L2 is slower than L1 cache, but also is not as expensive. This is why you tend to see more of it than L1 cache.<br>  <br>  L3 cache is the slowest of all, but also the cheapest to produce (yet still more expensive than system RAM). Sometimes it's mounted outside the CPU itself, but is also sometimes built into the processor like L1 and L2. Not all processors have L3 cache.<br>  <br>  All levels of cache run at a clock speed much faster than your system RAM. This, along with the fact they are sitting right on the CPU, makes them an order of magnitude faster for your CPU to access than system RAM - it's like if you had a book right next to you rather than in the next room, or down the hallway. You can get to it and begin reading it faster.|`|0036303680ad306f84decbfaaae5d979aa	This is all simplified and not exact but the basics to get the point across.<br>  <br>  Harddrive, big and slow<br>  Ram, smaller but faster<br>  l2 very small but even faster<br>  l1 extremely small but very fast<br>  <br>  Opening a program<br>  Harddrive is read to memory<br>  memory to l2<br>  l2 to l1<br>  l1 to core for processing.<br>  <br>  Not exact but a high level view for a basic understanding.

The bigger the caches, the more information the processor can hold to calculate (effectively meaning faster processing).<br>  <br>  Anyway, the L1 cache is extremely important. Without the L1 cache, the processor will not work. However, as the L2 and L3 are generally more tied in to performance, advertisers usually leave out the L1 cache. For your information, the L2 and L3 are used to check for misses from the L1 cache. Other than that, the L1 cache remains the smallest and fastest cache on the processor.
AbRfd29Haa	nm = nanometer. This is an  measure of a specific standard feature size in the actual layout of the chip (l-effective).  Ideally (not always, but usually), a chip with smaller features will run cooler than the same chip with larger features. Most current CPUs from Intel are 45nm, while it's a mix from AMD between 45nm and 65nm. <br>  <br>  This is not directly related to your CPU socket. The CPU socket is usually given a standard name: AMD's use the AM2 or AM2+ socket these days, Intel uses the LGA775 (Core 2) or LGA1366 (i7) sockets, for the most part. That's the main thing to check. <br>  <br>  When upgrading, there can be other issues... new CPUs keep coming out, but your main board may not change. Newer parts may run at lower voltages, or have higher clock speeds, even if they're in the same socket configuration. So it's worth checking your main board's user manual, or the web site for the board maker. They may have a "BIOS update" which adds support for a new processor.|`|cKGVHDEzaa	no 45nm and 65nm are the size of the dies the smaller the die the more trasistors u can fit allong with memory controllers such *** ddr2-ddr3 along with l2cash and l3 cash i just upgraded from a 95nm amd 5000+ blk edt overclocked to 3.3ghz to a phenom 2 940 45nm overclocked to 4ghz the smaller the die the more head room u have for overclocking and performanse allong with energy the smaller the die the less energy u use to power that cpu a 95nm min voltage is 1.3 vcore stock on the 45 nm i beleave ite like 0.800vcor on idle hope i ancered your qustion|`|I7rS4vq7aa	Yes, that's what it means.<br>  But you can't only go off of the NanoMeters of the CPU, you have to go off of socket type too.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket</a><br>  <br>  Make sure the socket type, and size both match what you have now.<br>  Otherwise you'll need a new motherboard too.<br>  <br>  Also, the 45nm cpus run cooler than the 65nm ones.|`|0036303680ad306f84decbfaaae5d979aa	here is a picture to put it in perspective<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45nm" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45nm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65_nanometer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65_nanomete...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2008/02/13/wolfdale_shrinks_transistors/conroe-wolfdale.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2008/02/1...</a><br>  <a href="http://regmedia.co.uk/2007/09/19/idf_wafer_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://regmedia.co.uk/2007/09/19/idf_waf...</a><br>  <br>  45 is better, in terms of smaller and can fit more in same space. but probably not a huge difference as of today, vs say 90 vs 45<br>  But if i'm not mistaken amd is using 65 in the phenom and intel is using 45 in the i7|`|V3ULgX9eaa	You can fit a say a 45 nm cpu into a 65nm motherboard. as long as they are the same socket type.

This is simply not true! There's three really good programs that are free to the public with no strings attached! Use these programs together and they make up the perfect security system that rivals any paid program! They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before!

Break things up only when it makes sense. For example, compute_hours, compute_minutes, and compute_seconds should be combined into a single compute_interval or something like that.<br>  <br>  You'll basically need to to do a modulus division. If s is second, then s / 60 is the number of minutes, and s % 60 is the number of seconds after the minutes. Get the number of minutes, then do division modulus again to get the number of hour and the number of remaining minutes.

Messages may pop up on the screen once every few days or even once every few minutes depending on the nature of the problem. This can occur even if you are using a WiFi wireless network. How can this problem be fixed?<br>  <br>  Answer: Several possible causes of "A Network Cable Is Unplugged" messages exist. The error message appears on a computer when an installed Ethernet adapter is seeking to make a network connection.<br>  <br>  Try the following tips to resolve your problem:<br>  <br>      * Disable the Ethernet network adapter if you are not using it. This applies, for example, when running a WiFi home network with computers that have built-in Ethernet adapters. To disable the adapter, double-click the small Network Cable Unplugged error window and choose the Disable option.<br>  <br>      * Check both ends of the Ethernet cable connected to the adapter to ensure they are not loose.<br>  <br>      * Replace the Ethernet cable with a different one to verify the cable is not damaged.<br>  <br>      * Update the network adapter driver software from the manufacturer's Web site.<br>  <br>      * Change the Link Speed and Duplex settings (using Device Manager) to use "100 Mbps Full Duplex" or "10 Mbps Full Duplex" instead of Auto Detect.<br>  <br>      * Replace the Ethernet network adapter if it is a removable PCI or PCMCIA card. First remove and re-insert the existing adapter hardware to verify the card is connected properly. If necessary, also replace it with a different card.<br>  <br>      * The device your Ethernet adapter is connected to, such as a broadband modem or network router may be malfunctioning. Troubleshoot these devices as needed.<br>  <br>  Here is another site with tons of info<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/maintain/troubleshoot.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...</a><br>  <br>  I personally find it easier to call the router company and ask them.   I know Linksys has updated its software and I had a problem lately too.|`|bE9qW0p4aa	I hope this helps, It happens to me too often times, but I found the answer.

qeNrGoMsaa	Try disconnecting the power source to your router and then the modem, wait 60 seconds and re connect router first then modem power. That should refresh both. Make sure both computers are off first. Have you gone into the main computer and checked the connection? If not go in there and try to connect. Then try your laptop. It should work unless you are using only one user name. Try using the main frame as admin. Hope this helps? If all else fails call your ISP provider and they can usually walk you through.|`|e3a22386f5c6f18e62c9c97c3ced4a84aa	Even if your network cable seems plugged doesn't mean it is. If you PC is telling you that the network is unplugged, it basically guarantees that you will not be able to access the network hence the internet. Try changing the port (on the router) which your network cable is plugged into, and if that fails try changing the network cable.
JKfRtuHMaa	Often, people mistake the best for the most expensive.  True, dreamweaver is very good, but also just too darn expensive.  You can find different types of programs for little or no cost.

But there is also a program from coffeecup.com that I am pretty sure is free.  I would look into those to get first and see if it’s something you would lie to do.

I would pick a unit that has a rear 80mm exhaust sometimes those are best for these type of OEM systems since the chassis itself may interfere with a 120mm power supply unit.<br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-300ES 300W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151055" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $38 (+12v@288w/24A  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-151-055-04.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a> )<br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-350ES 350W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151038" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $47 (+12v@324w/27A  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-151-038-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a> )<br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-400ES 400W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151039" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $54 (+12v@360w/30A  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-151-039-10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a> )<br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-500ES 500W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151040" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $65  (+12v@408w/34A  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-151-040-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a> )<br>  <br>  So plug in whatever other upgrades you wish to get in the near future, and get one of the above based on your PSU calc total wattage.  So you can re-use it in a future pc, and don't discard the OEM hp unit it is still capable, just put it back in.  One advantage of these Seasonics, they are rated for 80+ efficiency so if you run it 24x7 it's more 'green' than the HP unit, less energy wasted in heat conversion, another reason for a warm fuzzy feeling?  :)<br>  <br>  The reason I tend to ignore the total wattage, modern ATX v2.x units need to supply the CPU and GPU power with the +12v rails.  So focus on this over the total wattage.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  <br>  "I need 26a on the 12v"<br>  <br>  That is the manufacturer recommended +12v rail combined power, it is largely higher than needed since they need to CYA how do they know what other components you have in your system?  They don't and assume a really high value.  You have to consider your system as a whole.  But the SS-350 unit I mentioned has +12v@27A so that will work according to them :)|`|SJM0rzHtaa	You don't need a new power supply to run that 9500GT.<br>  <br>  The 9500GT does not draw much power.  Note that it does not even have a 6-pin power connector.  Only PCIExpress video cards that draw more than 75 watts of power are required to have the 6-pin.  The 9500GT will draw less than 75W.<br>  <br>  The 9500GT is designed precisely to work with the stock PSUs in computers like Dells and HPs.<br>  <br>  The guy above who thinks PCIe v1.0 is not compatible with PCIe v2.0 is dead wrong.  They ARE compatible.<br>  <br>  If you use a PCIe v2.0 card on a v1.0 motherboard, the card will just default to the lower transfer speed of the v1.0 PCIe spec.  And that's not a big deal unless you are running a higher-end SLI setup, which you cannot anyway in that HP.|`|38LXFX1saa	If you really wanna get a power supply, go with a solid Antec one.

The video card your looking @ is as PCI Express X16 2.0. You might want to check on this. I don't think they are compatible. The listing I got could also be a "generic". Newegg is the best for researching all computer parts. It doesn't list the wattage of the power supply. You might find a video card that doesn't need extra power to run it. I hope this helps|`|V3ULgX9eaa	I think with that new graphics card you could run it maxed out!

Good signal strength should allow an easy connection. Limited connectivity means it is NOT getting any tcp/ip information from the router. This can be because you have not entered the correct encryption key, or there are no spare addresses in the router dhcp pool (often a problem if unsecured, others steal all your addresses and bandwidth) or a bad driver for the Wireless card. I have seen it on some laptops where the wireless switch is off, the receiver does not stop, but it is not transmitting to ask for the information.|`|UdBoESxQaa	Turn off everything, the computer, router and cable modem.

MUKhAsFzaa	Sounds like you are having spyware. Does it happen on any website or just one website? If it does for all websites, that means the spyware is installed on your local computer. It could be an add-on application for your browser, try to remove that add-on or reinstall your browser. You can also run a anti-spyware program to clean it up. Which browser are you using by the way?|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Yes, you have a virus, and it's no surprise that McAfee didn't catch anything.<br>  <br>  Antivirus applications are useless and don't offer protection, because they operate retroactively instead of proactively.<br>  <br>  Think about it. If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the malware is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #3 and #4.|`|Xi8LpZC0aa	Yes you have a problem,virus or spyware do complete scan of your system and check it out!|`|Ud68AWbYaa	install spy bot just search it and download, itll remove things even norton doesnt find, also download hijackthis and run a system scan the first bits tell you your homepage ect select ones you dont recognise as your set homepages (unless its microsoft) remove any of the o13 parts(unless running vista if so dnt remove gopher prefix) ONLY remove these by selecting them and clickimg fix this.|`|txC0y4BXaa	download <a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a><br>  <br>  run a full scan of your system.  if that doesn't work give an update.<br>  <br>  Get on firefox and download this <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/." rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplaye...</a>  that should fix your games/youtube problem.|`|aLY5zqDIaa	how i see u dont have a virus, u have spy ware of ad ware. which anti virus u have? try using bit defender or nod32 or Norton anti virus 2009 and run a full system scan. also try some online virus scan.

Read on, and I'll tell you why.<br>  <br>  Power supply can't support the mobo? (Motherboard)<br>  Why? Did you change the Psu out? (Power Supply Unit)<br>  Replace it with another one?<br>  <br>  Your Psu is bad. Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  It's the Electrolytic Capacitors in the Psu.<br>  Your Psu changes AC electricity into DC electricity. (Flashlight batteries are a good example of a DC electrical source)<br>  <br>  The final stage, of the Psu uses Electrolytic Capacitors. <br>  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capacitors_electrolytic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capaci...</a>  The bottom one is any example of the style used in computers. On the mobo and in the Psu)<br>  <br>  These little aluminum 'cans' are Filters for a Psu. They filter raw DC electricity into True DC electricity. They have an Electrolytic Paste inside that can break down.<br>  <br>  ("Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are constructed from two conducting aluminum foils. One of which, is coated with an insulating oxide layer, and a paper spacer soaked in electrolyte. The foil insulated by the oxide layer is the anode, while the liquid electrolyte and the second foil act as cathode. This stack is then rolled up, fitted with pin connectors and placed in a cylindrical aluminum casing."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolytic_capacitor)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyti...</a><br>  <br>  When the capacitor's paste breaks down, it forms a gas. The capacitor is shaped just like an aluminum Coke can, except the top where you would drink out of, has a flat cap. The cap has a seal around it. When the paste breaks down and forms gas, the gas pushes up on the cap, and breaks the seal.<br>  <br>  Electrolytic paste then starts oozing ot.<br>  The capacitor can function normally with a tiny bit of paste loss. As more paste is lost, the capacitor operates at a weakened state.<br>  Eventually when a certain amount of paste is lost, the capacitor fails.<br>  (Doesn't work anymore)<br>  <br>  The capacitors in a weakened state, will make a weak voltage rail.<br>  You have three voltage rails in a computer Psu.<br>  3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts.<br>  <br>  Lights will light up, Psu fan will spin, case fans will spin, harddrive sounds like it's running.<br>  <br>  ALL the lights on your computer, (Mobo, Psu, Power On lamp, etc),<br>  use less than 1 WATT.<br>  <br>  Each fan uses 2 to 3 watts.<br>  The harddrive is running in an endless loop. Probably uses less than 5 watts.<br>  <br>  NOW, when it's time for the BIOS program to start the Processor, (Right after the POST. Power On Self Test),<br>  the Psu 'falls flat on it's face'!<br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Because a Processor uses 55 watts to 125 watts. Depends on the processor. (Make and Model)<br>  <br>  The Psu doesn't have the power to turn it on, much less give it power to operate.<br>  <br>  The harddrive is running in an endless loop, because it's looking for the Boot Sector of the harddrive, and can't find it.<br>  Why?<br>  BECAUSE there's NO PROCESSOR operating!<br>  <br>  You need a good Psu.|`|7nimzIDsaa	Have you managed to power up the pc successfully before, as in windows was boot and your able to perform your daily operation on the PC.<br>  <br>  If yes, try resetting the CMOS and see if it helps, it could also be a potential power supply problem like you mention. Do get the PSU replace if resetting the CMOS doesn't help.<br>  <br>  If no, it might be a manufacturer's defect and do take the system back for RMA, and get it exchanged.|`|BiiSKOyqaa	If it made a shreaking sound I suggest you DO NOT try to keep turning it on.

(if your description is right). <br>  <br>  Anyway ONLY if you know how to, take off the case and check your computer for any obvious malfunctions. If it is obviously the power supply then I suggest you get another one as fixing these can be dangerous.

Z0lEv4Dzaa	I'm using C++<br>  <br>  We use void if there is no value to be returned to a function or method. Lets say, you wrote a function that when called, it is only to display/print some statements. It means there is no value to return to your main function. So you'll be using void.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  getsum (num1, num2);   //this is the function call<br>  <br>  int getsum(int x, int y) //start of function definition<br>  {<br>  return(x+y); //the value to be returned is the sum of num1 and num2<br>                    //x and y are parameters used to store values from num1<br>                    //and num2<br>  }<br>  <br>  Lets say a function is just to display or print some statements, you can use void to something like this:<br>  <br>  disp(num1, num2); //this is the function call<br>  <br>  void disp(int a, int b)//start of function definition<br>  {<br>  cout <<"The number in a is: " << a; //this only displays value of num1<br>  cout <<"The number in b is: "<< b;  //this only displays value num2  <br>  <br>  return;  //we returned nothing but still included here the return word to<br>             //give the control back to main() function. <br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  Its a good programming practice to use the word return every end of a function definition. We should use return word just to give the control back to main, whether we are to return a value or not. Use void if there is no value or result to be returned.<br>  <br>  Void means empty.   main()     is just the same with     void main()<br>  <br>  syntax of defining a function is:<br>  <br>  return data type   function name  (parameters here)<br>  {<br>  statement/s here;<br>  <br>  returned value;<br>  }<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|9XLJBU7haa	Have look at the Wiki definition here:<br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_does_'void'_mean_in_the_statement_public_static_void_in_Java" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_does_'voi...</a><br>  <br>  essentially use it with methods where you don't want to return a value.<br>  <br>  object.doSomething() <-- use void because we will rely on a try/catch to catch any errors and we don't get a result e.g. apply a change to a database.<br>  <br>  x = object.calculateValueOfPi() <-- dont use here void here because we need to store the return value in X.<br>  N.B. we need to define the return type where the void keyword would be|`|ZfxEGPT5aa	The keyword 'void' just means the method will not return any data (integer, string, character, etc...).<br>  <br>  So use 'void' if the method does not need to return data.|`|97ca6663adad94c1f5fa4d010bf0ce51aa	i think it is a bit redundant. at least in java c and c++. void means nothing<br>  void f() {}<br>  is a function that returms nothing<br>  <br>  int f() { return 42}<br>  is a function that returns a value

AA10464818	Bounce rate is not just for the homepage. It means that the visitor only came and visited 1 page of your site -- any page of your site -- and then left immediately. <br>  <br>  How do you define "high bounce rate"?<br>  <br>  Bounce rate could mean that the visitor has already found what they were looking for in the page they visited, so they already left. Or it could mean that they did not like what they saw or did not find what they need so they left.<br>  <br>  Look at other metrics of your site:<br>  <br>  - what is the average time on site? are they staying too short or just enough<br>  - what is the rate of return vis-a-vis new visits? are your visitors coming back or are they typically one visit and never to come back again?<br>  - what is the page per visit number? are they looking at more than 1 pages in your site?<br>  <br>  One problem with blogs is that they are harder to navigate, and difficulty in navigation is often a common cause of high bounce rates. Are the topics of your blog visible? Do you have a tag cloud that could at least help convey to users other topics of your blog? How many posts are in the homepage?<br>  <br>  And of course, better content. Title your post properly -- with the right keywords for SEO optimization -- as well as allowing you to properly convey to users what the post is all about. High bounce rates can result from different expectations of the page -- e.g. your title of the post (which is what they see in the search engine results) is different from the actual content of the site resulting in users bouncing away immediately from your page.<br>  <br>  Without seeing your blog, it's harder to give more precise suggestions. But I hope the above helped

2irfPomYaa	you go to control panel and go to user accounts and put a password for your account hope this helps|`|0bckNgILaa	Just lock it when you're not using it. If you have Windows, hold down Windows key and hit L. Next time you use your computer, just type in your password and you're back in. Just don't share your password w/ anybody.|`|1UX6rIFmaa	First, restart your computer. Before it finishes the beginning boot you need to hit a key to get to the BIOS. This differs depending on your computer model but the common keys are - Delete, F1, F2, or ESC.<br>  <br>  Once in the BIOS look for a security setting. There should be one that has a password feature. Input a password and the computer will not boot without that password.<br>  <br>  If you're using windows you can also put a password on your admin account and remove all other accounts, including guests.|`|t7sUZQvFaa	Go to start>control panel>dbl click user accounts and make a password and lock them out!

Pxh93GHcaa	There is no doubt on Nvidia graphics but as far as teh choice between Athlon and Centrino then I will choose Centrino. They have really performed well with one of my notebook. Their performace is far better then the other one but Athlon is little faster.|`|d20evTAwaa	i think that intel core is a bit better and go with nvidia try and get the 9600m gt|`|wIb3bXTFaa	well AMD owns ATI (or maybe the other way around), and nVidia has a contract with Intel (despite the fact that they make competing hardware... it's kind of a love/hate relationship) but generally nvidia cards are optimized for intel chipsets and processors.  Also, I believe Intel is pioneering 45nm technology right now.<br>  <br>  The Toshiba Qosmio line is pretty badass right now if you want a media pc, they also have a good gaming pc:<br>  <br>  17" screen, 4gb ram, core2duo, nvidia graphics w/ 1gb ddr3 ram ($1500)<br>  <br>  and the media pc:<br>  18.4" screen, 4gb ram, core2duo + quad-core Cell processor (the same ones used in ps3), nvidia 512mb ddr3 graphics card, 2x 250gb hard drives ($1250)|`|g5BFabTwaa	AMD athlon, and Nvidia works best for me :)

o7NQufdTaa	If it makes it that far and blue screens it is either the hard drive, or a stick of ram came loose. Seeing as how the ram is held in there pretty good and the hard drive is much more prone to damage....I'd say you'll be needing a new hard drive installed, and you'll need to order restore discs to get it up and running again if you have any brand besides Dell.|`|H5iVq0fwaa	take it to a computer shop, have them check its hardware.|`|61dbaafb1ec434cb3d4eddf1783c4f47aa	My friend, you have experienced the notorious "BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  HATEEEE to break it to you!!!!! this probably has to do something with the hardware... probably one of your components or RAM slots became disconnected when it fell... in other words, some probably became loose or disconnected!!!!<br>   open it up to make sure everything is still properly connected! (IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING!!!!!)|`|Iy0jPSJjaa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software. This  problem can be solved by uninstalling new software, updating device drivers and making minor configuration changes . From <a href="http://fixit.in/bluescreenofdeath.html" rel="nofollow">http://fixit.in/bluescreenofdeath.html</a> . You can also run a free registry scan using utilities from <a href="http://re7.info" rel="nofollow">http://re7.info</a>|`|AA10670145	if you dropped it, you most likely damaged your hard drive, but other things could have been broken as well.  try and run diagnostics on your computer either by booting with it or by using a disc that should have been sent with your computer.|`|txC0y4BXaa	Yes, you probably broke something internally.  Take it into a computer repair shop and have them determine what's broken.|`|j2z2qorwaa	I would assume that you likely jarred the hard drive.  If the blue screen is saying that it is unable to boot device than there is likely been enough hardware damage to the hard drive to prevent it from functioning normally.  This is just a guess based on the information you provided.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Carl

5zSSGKBpaa	That is why passwords for booting are important and not allowing the computer to boot from any other device. And using  a password for login is also important.<br>  Although the rule of thumb for security is if someone has physical access to the computer you cannot prevent them owning the computer.|`|aLY5zqDIaa	well yeah. this is a method of password cracking. in my school i once used a linux live disc and then got the password directory then i cracked the password. u can make linux in a usb drive once the usb drive it bootable

vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The cost to host a webpage can range from $0 through to $200 +<br>  <br>  Many web domains will allow you to host a free site, but in exchange for this you and those who visit your site are subjected to uncensored advertising, and/or bandwidth limitations.  Often, too, free websites have limited access to the types of coding they can use, such as perl, php etcetera.<br>  <br>  Sites you actually pay for, allow you to use and access scripts such as CGI, PHP, PERL, SQL etcetera which allows you to create a far mor dynamic experience for your guests, and usually will offer you a number of mailboxes also, plus you can share your space with others whom you might choose to charge.<br>  <br>  The final costs are determined not by the annual base rate, but rather by the amount of bandwidth your site requires.  So, before committing to a financial contract check how much a GIG of data transfer costs, and if there are any daily or monthly limitations.  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  TgTips|`|73nSUKNKaa	Well, depending on your area and which provider you use, it could be from 12 dollars a month to 99 dollars a month. If you're that crazy about a web page, go to <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucoz.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucoz.com</a><br>  <br>  The service is free, your site can have a forum, blog and up to 300MB worth of files and pictures. There are premium services you can buy, but that's another story. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your site WILL be branded, but not severely.<br>  <br>  For example, some free hosting sites like freewebs.com will make your site name like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/yournamehere" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/yournamehere</a><br>  <br>  but ucoz makes it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yournamehere.ucoz.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yournamehere.ucoz.com</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be .com, it can be .org, biz, net and lots more!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|81pm9Ckoaa	I recommend one of these: <a href="http://www.hosttell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hosttell.com/</a><br>  <br>  Powweb has the best offer right now. It's on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them. (like www.yourwebsite.com)|`|xTpADMajaa	average $5 per month|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	My favorite website to go to is Angelfire.

BGjNqDloaa	It all depends on your version of windows, they all work differently, lost recovery discs are rather difficult to replace, as they are created off of a spare recovery partition hidden on the hard drive. one program I recommend to restore the computer without getting the Blue Screen Of Dead, check out UBCD  at  <a href="http://www.ubcd4win.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubcd4win.com/index.htm</a><br>  <br>  that is a free program which walks you through how to create a boot disc to repair a computer with virtually ANY problem with easy to follow step-by-step instructions. BUT keep in mind in order to create the UBCD you NEED a windows disc that matches the version of your windows so it can copy boot files off that windows disc to successfully boot your computer into the operating system without any problems.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

C8DOT8Y7aa	I have an HP dv8000 with the same issue. My workaround was setting the computer to "hibernate" instead of sleep when closing the lid. Sometimes the sound won't come back on, and I'll have to re-start, but it "works".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Somewhere around 20% of laptops have this issue, in my experience. For those 20%, you DO NOT want to close the laptop without shutting it down first. There is no simple fix, there is no complex fix; it is some kind of inherent flaw that exists between the Windows Sleep/Hibernate issue and your particular hardware/software setup.<br>  <br>  Feel free to look for a fix, but from experience you'll just be wasting your time. This has been a problem for at least eight years--across many flavors of Windows, manufacturers, hardware sets, etc. At the end of the day, Hibernation is flawed.|`|THDeeEBNaa	vista is really prob first you can power on or off 5sce than will be star   <br>  if not staring than u laptop barties  open it and then close it

J6AAbZbHaa	Just check the cable between your PC and router, unless you're on wireless which just means you've got some other problem; password, IP settings etc. Check in the router instructions for initial setup, usually it should be pretty simple (well, to a nerd lol!)
p53Eu9tUaa	The most likely cause is an incorrect WEP or WPA key.  It must be exactly the same as it is on the router.  Pay special attention to 1, I, l and o, O, 0 ( the number one capital i and lower case L capital and lower case letter o and the number zero)  Incidentally you probably mean IP address rather than 1P address, which makes it seem likely you have  made a similar mistake with the passphrase (another name for network key).|`|HQNcH1T9aa	is this a wireless netwok<br>  goto the routers ip interface and goto 'Connection Type' and set it to DHCP, this will automatically assign the new ip address when it changes

AA10749709	No. This shouldn't happen. BTW what you mean by your wifi router is connected to your computer.<br>  Ideally your internet cable should be connected to the router. Your laptop connects to the wifi router and whenver the wifi router is on and your internet it should be able to connect to internet.

Make them Alpha numeric!

My best advice for you is to change a, the password and b, the secret question you set in hotmail. If you still get hijacked use a different email for a while and then the hijacker will leave your old address alone. Then you can get back on it.<br>  <br>  To reset your password go to...<br>  <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx?mkt=EN-GB&ru=https://login.live.com/login.srf%3flc%3d2057%26wa%3dwsignin1.0%26rpsnv%3d10%26ct%3d1236429286%26rver%3d5.5.4177.0%26wp%3dMBI%26wreply%3dhttp:%252F%252Fmail.live.com%252Fdefault.aspx%26id%3d64855%26mkt%3den-GB%26bk%3d1236429287%26lc%3d2057%26vv%3d650&lc=2057" rel="nofollow">https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.a...</a><br>  <br>  As for creating secure passwords you can get password makers.

It took a few downloads of fake Limewire Pros to find the right one but I eventually got it and its worth it! But then I tried to get it for my friend and I couldnt cause the download didnt seem to be there! Hopefully youll have better look. I havnt downloaded any bugs as of yet and I think Limewire Pro is way better|`|zxKhnbhNaa	Personally I avoid frost/limewire like the plague, it's full of viruses and malware. If you do choose to use it make sure you download a song that is about the right size for an mp3 (3-5MB)......avoid any tiny sized files as they will be anything but the track you want.  <br>  <br>  I'd get Utorrent, go to btjunkie.org or piratebay.org, try and find the album your after and once you click on the torrent link, tell utorrent to only download the track/s you want.|`|aHoUwtCvaa	I have yet to receive viruses from limewire or frostwire. Technically Frostwire is the better program, but Limewire has more items on it because it's older. If you're into mainstream stuff I would suggest Frostwire.

However if you're like me and you like less popular stuff and have retarded internet (i have dial up) I would suggest limewire.|`|V2iADQdHaa	Frostwire; it runs faster and it doesnt give any viruses like limewire!!!!!!it downloads much faster........|`|Jj9M9VRhaa	I RECOMMEND U FOOTSWIRE THAN LIMEWIRE BECAUSE LIMEWIRE DOES NOT WORK WITH MY OPTIONS LIMEWIRE DOES PUBLISH WRONG FILES WITH A HIGHER CAPACITY BUT I CANNOT SURE THAT I CAN RECOMMEND YOU FOOTWIRE IS BETTER THAN LIMEWIRE IM JUST SUGGESTING WHAT IS IN MY MIND|`|PfzYjPgsaa	Limewire has a new version 5 which works really well on finding non virus music.

The cost of in-state college tuition has grown 35 percent over the past five years. Health care costs have risen four times faster than wages over the past six years. And the personal savings rate is now the lowest it's been since the Great Depression.<br>  Tax Cuts for Wealthy Instead of Middle Class: The Bush tax cuts give those who earn over $1 million dollars a tax cut nearly 160 times greater than that received by middle-income Americans. At the same time, this administration has refused to tackle health care, education and housing in a manner that benefits the middle class.<br>  Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan<br>  <br>  Jumpstart the Economy<br>  Enact a Windfall Profits Tax to Provide a $1,000 Emergency Energy Rebate to American Families:Barack Obama and Joe Biden will enact a windfall profits tax on excessive oil company profits to give American families an immediate $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help families pay rising bills. This relief would be a down payment on the Obama-Biden long-term plan to provide middle-class families with at least $1,000 per year in permanent tax relief.<br>  Provide $50 billion to Jumpstart the Economy and Prevent 1 Million Americans from Losing Their Jobs: This relief would include a $25 billion State Growth Fund to prevent state and local cuts in health, education, housing, and heating assistance or counterproductive increases in property taxes, tolls or fees. The Obama-Biden relief plan will also include $25 billion in a Jobs and Growth Fund to prevent cutbacks in road and bridge maintenance and fund school re pair - all to save more than 1 million jobs in danger of being cut.<br>  Provide Middle Class Americans Tax Relief<br>  Obama and Biden will cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay.<br>  Provide a Tax Cut for Working Families: Obama and Biden will restore fairness to the tax code and provide 150 million workers the tax relief they need. Obama and Biden will create a new "Making Work Pay" tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit will completely eliminate income taxes for 10 million Americans.<br>  Eliminate Income Taxes for Seniors Making Less than $50,000: Barack Obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This proposal will eliminate income taxes for 7 million seniors and provide these seniors with an average savings of $1,400 each year. Under the Obama-Biden plan, 27 million American seniors will also not need to file an income tax return.<br>  Simplify Tax Filings for Middle Class Americans: Obama and Biden will dramatically simplify tax filings so that millions of Americans will be able to do their taxes in less than five minutes. Obama and Biden will ensure that the IRS uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre-filled tax forms to verify, sign and return. Experts estimate that the Obama-Biden proposal will save Americans up to 200 million total hours of work and aggravation and up to $2 billion in tax preparer fees.<br>  Trade<br>  Obama and Biden believe that trade with foreign nations should strengthen the American economy and create more American jobs. He will stand firm against agreements that undermine our economic security.<br>  Fight for Fair Trade: Obama and Biden will fight for a trade policy that opens up foreign markets to support good American jobs. They will use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world and stand firm against agreements like the Central American Free Trade Agreement that fail to live up to those important benchmarks. Obama and Biden will also pressure the World Trade Organization to enforce trade agreements and stop countries from continuing unfair government subsidies to foreign exporters and nontariff barriers on U.S. exports.<br>  Amend the North American Free Trade Agreement: Obama and Biden believe that NAFTA and its potential were oversold to the American people. They will work with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to fix NAFTA so that it works for American workers.<br>  Improve Transition Assistance: To help all workers adapt to a rapidly changing economy, Obama and Biden will update the existing system of Trade Adjustment Assistance by extending it to service industries, creating flexible education accounts to help workers retrain, and providing retraining assistance for workers in sectors of the economy vulnerable to dislocation before they lose their jobs.<br>  End Tax Breaks for Companies that Send Jobs Overseas: Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe that companies should not get billions of dollars in tax deductions for moving their operations overseas. Obama and Biden will also fight to ensure that public contracts are awarded to companies that are committed to American workers.<br>  Reward C

47656d33be33ab59b93a1031373f0c0eaa	I would not say so. Just the processor alone doesn't produce much more GFLOPS than the 2.4 GHz... If you want to upgrade from 2.4 to 2.66, don't ever do that lol. I think the 2.4 GHz one will  more than fit your needs. I think though that the 2.66 GHz one would  be a bit less hot since it has 45nm instead of 65nm fabrication process.

Some routers won't do that properly. Look into your documentation about "bridging".<br>  Also, you have to be sure to use different IP sub nets on the PC sides if bridging is not available. Routers do not like to see the same sub net on both sides, it just won't work because they won't know where to send the packets.<br>  However, if you manage to set up a transparent bridge, the routers will simply act as a wired connection, and IP addresses are transparently send across in both directions (one sub net seen both sides). So, it all depends on your router and what it can do.....|`|EwcDpHwvaa	questin is not clear<br>  <br>  run sh ip protocols<br>  and see static sigh [s]<br>  chech ur commands od staic route<br>  otherwise email me on arpitsharmarinku@gmail.com<br>  i will send you configuration.

NpZukuuraa	If you are looking for quality registry repair software to rid of slow computer problems, anti-virus and anti-spyware products have trouble detecting the computer irregular behavior, computer freezes and crashes are becoming commonplace, and performance is a problem in most applications. We all realize how frustrating and stressful that it is to deal with continuous computer performance problems and system crashes. Making a decision about what product would be best to fix the problem adds more to that stress.<br>  <br>  There are a handful of top registry repair products that can do a quick and effective job for you. In most of these products there is only a small margin that separates them. This article will show you what to look for when shopping for software.<br>  <br>  Feature 1: Download Simplicity and Ease of Use<br>  <br>  There are a few programs that are extremely difficult to download and even more difficult to grasp the features in the user interface. The top products are completely opposite. The download is quick with only a few clicks and the user window that appears has an easy to use layout with descriptions of each feature when clicked on. The premier registry cleaner software programs give descriptions of each feature once you download the user interface during the free scan process. There should also be an online help guide in case you get stuck.<br>  <br>  Feature 2: Include Repair and Optimization Features<br>  <br>  Though repair and cleaning are the only issues on purchaser's minds, the best software programs offer optimization features to supplement repair characteristics. Good software programs will have tools that will complete system defrag (to free hard drive space), remove Internet Explorer plug-ins that slow your internet, and that remove viruses and spy ware from your computer. Not only do you get effective repair options, now you also get Internet Explorer plug-in removers, evidence scanners and cleaners, registry defrags, junk file cleaners, all in addition to standard scanning features.<br>  <br>  Now you can get so much more for your money. The following scan categories should be included in the software: Shared Program Paths, Application Paths, File Associations, Active X/Coms/OLE, Font Files, Help Files, Toolbars, Shared DLL Files, Invalid Shortcuts, Most Recent Files, and Startup Files.<br>  <br>  Feature 3: Automated System Back Up<br>  <br>  This feature saves your previous file "state" in case you are not happy with the changes made to your PC after the repair is complete. Sometimes changes made from repair are not what we expected. It is great to have the option to go back to the status we had prior to the repair in case we want to restore some of the files we selected to remove prior. Top registry repair software will ensure that you have a way to return to this previous state. This is considered the piece of mind attribute!<br>  <br>  Feature 4: Automated File Selection<br>  <br>  If you do not know what you are looking for in file changes, do not worry. The software programs that exist are designed to not be overly assumptive and remove critical files. If you are an advanced user, this feature can come in handy as you can select files you want removed without having to do the tedious work of self-registry repair.<br>  <br>  Feature 5: More than a One Use License<br>  <br>  Since you will need registry repair functions as part of an ongoing plan, you will want to be sure that the license is good for a year. It is best to get in the practice of scanning and repairing at least once or twice a week. By having a long-term license you can continually maintain your PC.<br>  <br>  Feature 6: Great Service and Tech Support<br>  <br>  Many of the best products have fantastic help files and you may never need a person due to the simplicity of the download. Still, it is always good to send a test email to the company to see how quickly they respond back to you. Take notice about how prompt the response is and how professionally you are treated. This will show you how good of hands you will be in if you get stuck while using their product.<br>  <br>  There are a massive amount of products that are separated only by a small margin. A few of products are far supreme in the number of features and repair effectiveness for the investment. The ultimate goal should always be to get the errors fixed as quickly and easily as possible at the lowest cost.<br>  <br>  The source below is the best registry repair software in terms of features, effectiveness and value for your money.|`|AVtx2dzZaa	well I haven't tested it, but I recommend a total pc maintenance suite , as tune up utilities, and my all time favorate system mechanic.

In the coming years, however, residential IPTV is expected to grow at a brisk pace as broadband was available to more than 200 million households worldwide in the year 2005, projected to grow to 400 million by the year 2010. [5] Many of the world's major telecommunications providers are exploring IPTV as a new revenue opportunity from their existing markets and as a defensive measure against encroachment from more conventional Cable Television services.<br>  Also, there is a growing number of IPTV installations within schools, universities, corporations and local institutions.

Mac's are only voted as the number 1 laptop because it's just trendy, not because it's any more cost effective or any more useful.<br>  <br>  If you're using Photoshop and a bunch of design software like someone else said, a Mac might work better for you.<br>  <br>  If you're not using any of that, don't waste your money on buying a Mac.  If something goes wrong with a Mac, you get to buy a new one.  If something goes wrong with a Dell, chances are you can replace a part pretty easily.  Mac's are pretty notorious for not being able to replace stuff.  Don't let the commercials confuse you, the Mac's components are not any better than Microsofts, they just charge you almost twice as much for the name only.  Their new "green" computers aren't green at all, it's just a marketing gimmick.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line, you can get much more on a Dell at a lower price than a Mac.

Ns6I7MmBaa	It is possible, but probably complicated for a grandma to figure out if the Verizon wireless ethernet thing is a cell phone data device instead of local wireless to a modem/router with wireless networking.<br>  <br>  Basically she could enable ICS (internet connection sharing) for her Verizon device and connect an ethernet "crossover" cable from laptop to desktop.  If she actually wants to connect wirelessly from laptop to the desktop through to Verizon she would need a WiFi device for her desktop and connect laptop to desktop using ad-hoc wireless mode.  And there would be more to explain if she knows nothing about networking.  Too much to explain here.
xVfjkTyuaa	Above answer is correct, if you want 2 separate networks, you have to set up 2 routers, possibly in series. However, remember to use different subnets on the second router, like 192.168.2.1 if the first is 192.168.1.1. Otherwise traffic will not route properly from the second network.<br>  The other problem with 2 routers is that the first LAN cannot get to the second LAN, because the second router will block incoming packets. However, if the goal is to simply get to the internet, then it should work.|`|MxculX2Daa	Well you don't need 2 networks.<br>  You can connect to the same network with up to 4 wired machines and up to 256 wireless machines.<br>  <br>  In any case the router will only run one network.|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	It is my understanding that all wifi items can sign onto a protected network. You may have to dig into the instruction manual. Now WPA I'm not so experienced with but WEP does work. You can change to WEP perhaps. I wouldn't try to go unprotected unless you are out in the country far from other houses.<br>  However....You can daisy chain routers. Run a wire between the WAN slot of the new router into the existing router's LAN slot. Then you could have two wifi routers operating separately. You should set the two routers on different channels (1-11 are available) so they don't interfere with each other.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	It doesn't work like that. One router cannot run two networks. At least not a home router, anyway.<br>  <br>  What you can do is turn WPA off, so you are using a standard that your DS can connect to.  Just go to internet explorer and browse to the website <a href="http://192.168.0.1." rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.1.</a> This is a website stored on your router that lets you control your router and change its settings.

If you are intent on doing it you would need to get BT to put in a line and then contact an ADSL provider like Orange, Tiscali or AOL. they might have a nice half price offer but then you will be paying just as much as you pay Virgin and for a considerably inferior speed and service.|`|jg4GndUaaa	not sure about the cable part, but I wouldn't be surprised if you had a minimum contract length with virgin, because then otherwise loads of people would only stay for the half price line rental

Their operating system isn't targeted by hackers and virus writers.<br>  <br>  Another reason is that the functioning of a Mac is more intuitive and easier than PC based systems.  The thinking that has gone into the functionality of Mac is far more effective.  The folks at Mac built machines that operate the way people think.<br>  <br>  Go to a Apple store and play.  They actually encourage people to come into the stores and play with the machines.  The sales people are very knowledgeable and they can answer all of your questions.  In addition, if you buy a Mac, they will transfer your data, etc from your old machine to your new Mac.<br>  <br>  I bought my MacBook with Windows operating system on the machine, and I just don't use the Windows functions at all.  I find it slower and not as much fun.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|sRNgJ0e5aa	macbook for sure.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt even consider it just a brand name because its completely different thna any other computer. and yes, its worth every penny|`|And9dyrwaa	dell.|`|sPR3qpTMaa	MacBook definately.<br>  <br>  MacBook has Dual platform, which you can use Mac OSX AND Windows Xp.

BeKUypOraa	DIV layouts are more complex layouts. They sometimes require a person to know some html to be able to code the diffrent parts. They have a section for different things on there and must all be coded differently. A normal layout is just alot easier to code, and normally consists of a background or something like that. To write on that just follow what is on the "edit profile" section of myspace.

48b3edd2873299f4c358a97e93456e13aa	I had a similar problem on a Linksys WRT54GX4 SRX400. The wired and wireless features of the router share some electronics and use other parts uniquely, for instance the wireless radio. The problem in my case was software related. I disabled the daylight-savings-time-checking option in the router software and the download speed improved to be nearly equivalent to the wired speed. This router is rated at 240Mbit and I have the compatible PCMCIA wireless card.<br>  <br>  At another location, I have a Linksys WRT54GL which is only a 54MB rated router. I get the same speeds wired/wireless on it as I do on the SRX400.<br>  <br>  I suspect that the routers you are using are somehow reserving some wireless bandwidth when more than one PC appears to be connected (or may be reconnected) to it.<br>  When you have two wireless PC's connected and downloading at the same time, what speed does each one receive?<br>  <br>  If you can achieve 6Mb wired, I doubt that there is anything in the DSL service creating the limit.

BhNP2P8Xaa	First, decide if you want to combine functions on the servers. If you had to run more than one service on a system, I would keep the web and mail services on one machine, the file and directory services on another and the SAP on it's own. <br>  <br>  if you're using individual machines, your decisions will be a bit easier.<br>  <br>  All of these things require one primary functions for high availability: fast networking. Make sure they're all capable of at least gigabit speeds on their network adapters.<br>  <br>  Second, a couple of these things require rapid disk I/O: the database server and the file/directory server should have fast drives. This isn't as necessary on the web or mail servers, even with the amount of write the mail server will do. Reading data from a database or opening and updating a file need fast, reliable access.<br>  <br>  Finally, look at redundancy. If a server machine has a redundant power supply, that's good...keep them running if one fails. <br>  <br>  You might also want to look at drive capacities. SCSI is still probably the performance king on drive interfaces, but they can't match the capacities of SATA drives, and the performance difference has narrowed a lot, too. On some of these systems, you might want to consider data redundancy as well as power redundancy. How you do that is going to depend on how much data you expect to store on your drives. But having on-board RAID capability is something to consider. <br>  <br>  For example, if you know that you'll never store more than 500 GB of data on a single system, and the box can use multiple drives, consider using two drives with RAID 1 (mirroring). <br>  <br>  Most data setups use external storage and RAID systems these days, but I don't know if you're going that far with this project.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	First thing you need to find out is how many people at a time will access these servers ... that will determine the processors and Ram required ... next is how much Data will be stored and the expected expansion of the business, this will determine how much hard-drive space you'll need<br>  Directory Server and File server can be the same server ... mail server and database server ideally should be separate (you don't want an infection coming in through email to infect your databases)... web server should be a separate server ... check out IBM for good quality reliable servers ...

TWuk6cbqaa	The Binary Coded Decimal is a system where each digit of a decimal number is encoded with 4 bits of binary. Decimal numerals are 0, 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9.<br>  <br>  Each of these has its own 4 bit binary code (same as binary how that number would be represented in standard binary). For example 0 is 0000, 1 is 0001, 2 is 0010, etc up to 9 which is 1001, which is the max that BCD can encode in 4 bits. The difference between this and standard binary is when you consider an entire byte. One byte can encode 8 bits. <br>  In BCD, these eight bits are divided into two sets of 4 bits. Each 4 bit can represent one decimal numeral, so one byte can represent two numerals, or all decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 99 (four bits for each decimal digits), whereas in standard binary, all eight bits contribute to one number (note the number of decimal digits does not matter), with each bit to left having a greater significance. <br>  <br>  In BCD, every four bits is separate from the previous four bits. For example the decimal number 19 would be encoded in BCD as 0001 1001, whereas in standard binary 19 is 00010011.|`|b2279e5cc69cc91364de96b34bf0caaaaa	Instead of encoding the entire value such as 15 = 1111<br>  <br>  encode each digit<br>  <br>  so 15 = 0001  0101<br>  1------------^<br>  5-------------------^<br>  <br>  Google the "BCD clock" if you want to practice

rKjgUORFaa	I've recently bought a Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo laptop from Tesco and an Asus laptop from Staples both for under ￡300 and although basic both of which work perfectly fine. Some friends of mine recently paid over ￡800 for their laptop with a whole range of functions that they are never going to use or can be installed for free. <br>  <br>  For examle why pay for MS Office Suite when OpenOffice is free and In my opinion just as good.<br>  <br>  My point is to decide on what you want to do on your laptop and buy the cheapest one that fulfills only those functions that you need.

I believe though that they have a 30 day satisfaction guarantee.  I am very happy with the reliability and speed of it but the Fair Access Policy isn't very fair.  Any data transmitted to you is counted in the daily limit.  All videos, web pages, itunes downloads, packets going between your IM program and the server, http, ftp, everything.  They have a site that will check how many megabytes you have used up, but it has never worked for me.  Their tech support sucks, it's outsourced to the middle east. You either can't hardly hear them on the phone or you can't understand what they are saying because of the heavy accents.  <br>  <br>  All in all, the service is good but right now they just don't have the network capacity to serve all their subscribers.

ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	Sounds like this is a wireless router you are using connecting to two computers. Cable does go out once in awhile, nothing to do about that. Wireless signals are really weak radios that can be blocked by walls, floors, heating ducts,refrigerators, wireless 2.4ghz phones (which use the same bands) and other wifi networks in your neighborhood. Sometimes if I am standing between the computer and the router I loose signal strength. Also water (rain snow etc) can absorb the signal. Consider the location of the router and the computers. Also the router can work on channels 1-11. Try other channels. A program Stumbler from <a href="http://stumbler.net" rel="nofollow">http://stumbler.net</a> shows what networks are in range. Choose a channel that none of them use.|`|Xz9WMxhMaa	I've had a similar experience the last 3 weeks or so but in my case it did turn out to be a problem from the cable company.

vK53Hh8naa	How old is your router? Newer routers, following the security craze with WiFi hacking, are preventing access to configuration pages if the user is connected through WiFi. Maybe you could try to connect to your router through an ethernet cable.<br>  <br>  Have you tried other ports? The configuration pages on routers are served by an internal HTTP server. These servers however are sometimes running on different ports than the usual 80 in order to thwart hackers (noobs if they fall for it). If you are unsure, use Nmap to port scan your router and identify its available ports. These ports will be usually captured by a server, which means that if there is more than one port open, there are more ways into your router.<br>  <br>  If you happen to run Nmap, check to see if port 22 is open. This will usually indicate that SSH is running on your router and that means that you can login and make the desired changes to your router. Albeit, this is a little more complex but its a lot cooler when you tell your friends :)|`|PbfkwSmTaa	My router uses 192.168.2.1 for config but that differs to most routers. If there's something wrong it might help to mention your model and brand, but if you just can't get on maybe because of a crash try disconnecting the power or hard reset the device by holding the reset button(on the back and very small) and that will reset everything to factory settings(YOU LOOSE ALL PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS). Hope my answer will help.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Set router to DEFAULT.<br>  -<br>  Reset router: With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button 10-20secs.<br>  -<br>  Wait 60 secs.<br>  -<br>  PC Command Line:<br>  -<br>  Click [Start] - Click [Run...] - enter: cmd, Click [OK]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /release, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /renew, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  TEST: Login to router.|`|OfPQVR1Naa	This might be a security issue and is easily fixed, but first the reason:<br>  <br>  -Most newer Linksys routers default to 192.168.1.1 (older ones were 192.168.0.1). <br>  <br>  -The default administration password on Linksys Network devices is "admin" (sometimes you don't enter a user name, just the password, soemtimes the user name is administrator).<br>  <br>  -The default SSID (the name your wireless shows up as) for wireless Linksys routers actually has the name "Linksys" in it!<br>  <br>  When you install a Linksys router, if you do not immediately change the router's configuration IP, password, and SSID, then you are just asking for someone to get on your wireless and steal it from you.  You can't really call this hacking since it's more like an open invitation to anyone who's ever owned a Linksys router and took the time to read the user guide.  (It's like leaving the keys in your car with the window down).<br>  <br>  But, there's an easy way to get your router back under control....<br>  <br>  Every Linksys router comes with a RESET button on the back of it which deletes ALL changes and returns the router to factory default setup.<br>  <br>  The RESET button is located on the back of the router and is recessed for safety.  You normally need to use a paperclip to reach it.  Hold this button in for a minimum of 5 seconds to restore the factory defaults on your router.  Afterwhich, immediately connect to it and change the administration password. <br>  <br>  Once you have your router secure, I reccommend you check for unauthorized connection to your router.  Every wireless device connected to it will be listed by MAC address.  You can input a list of the MAC addresses of all your wireless devices and enable a MAC filter on the router that will only allow your devices to connect to it.<br>  <br>  I also reccommend you go to the Linksys web site and download the user manual for your router before you begin these steps so you can verify your particular router uses the default settings I listed above.  The manual is in pdf format and you can search it for "password" and "192.168" to find the default settings.<br>  <br>  Folow this link and enter your router's model # (like WRT54G2) to download a copy of your router's user manual:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support" rel="nofollow">http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/supp...</a>|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	It must be <a href="http://192.168.x.y" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.x.y</a> where x and y vary from maker to maker.<br>  If you are using wifi, try instead to wire the connection to the router. Next if that still fails, sounds like you have forgotten the router's address. With that you need to reset the modem back to factory settings. Press the reset button with a paper clip. Some routers need you to hold the button down 30 seconds. Use the users guide to set up again. If you don't have the user guide go to the makers website and download it.<br>  BTW have not used torrent myself but some of them are very buggy. You may need to find another source for your setup.|`|MxculX2Daa	Have you tried 192.168.0.1<br>  <br>  Start a command prompt and type ipconfig and hit enter.<br>  (get to a command prompt by typing CMD in the run box or the search box in the start menu)<br>  The item listed as "Gateway" is the IP address you should be using.|`|xVfjkTyuaa	Some routers will not allow config from the Wireless ports.

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either<br>  a film / video creator or producer, an artist (musician, singer, comedian, actor),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a 875x150px "banner" for your channel<br>  -- a mini-banner beside each played video <br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay" ?<br>  -- extra channel boxes: bulletins, profile<br>  -- automatic higher quality to your videos<br>  -- unique videos over 11:00 minutes long<br>  -- more options for your video thumbnails<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- unique skins/sizes for the video player<br>  -- the possibility of earning "ad revenue"<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner".

tW4NPnvtaa	A graphics card is the "Hardware" that your computer uses to show the displays that have been processed by the computer. However, one cannot just install a graphics card and expect it to work with installing any "Software". The graphics driver literally "Drives" your graphics card by (in a nutshell) translating what the computer tells it and sending it to the graphics card into a language that it can understand. Like I said, that's not exactly what a driver does but It's basically the idea. Without a graphics driver, your computer can only use your graphics card to it's minimal ability. It's important to keep your diver software up-to-date by going to your system manufacturer's sight or going to the website of the company that made your graphics card.<br>  <br>  Here are some links for popular drivers/graphics card manufacturers:<br>  <br>  For ATI/AMD Drivers you can go here:<br>  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pa...</a><br>  <br>  For NVidia:<br>  <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.asp...</a>|`|HVRNoPuoaa	Imagine a graphic card as a "Car" a car by itself cannot be of any use as it will stay parked in stationary position,  but if  you can drive and if you  are a driver you can start and drive around, <br>  Similarly the graphic card is  the actual hardware like the "Car" above where the display or monitor connects  and the driver is the software that drives or tell the Graphic card what to do and what to display on to the monitor  and this sits on the operating system of the PC  like Win XP.|`|e0GnTb95aa	Graphic Card Or GPU Is a hardware which processes Graphics and a graphic driver is needed OS to recognise the GPU.|`|MxculX2Daa	card is hardware<br>  driver is software|`|U8bjBIOxaa	A card is the piece of the PC you plug your monitor into.

SaeUxO6Gaa	It's possible to get some slowdown over time, but it's nothing in comparison with Windows.<br>  <br>  There are a few major problems with windows:<br>  1) People tend to run their computer as an administrator, which allows the program that you're installing to do whatever it wants to your system - including modifying core windows files and starting background processes that always run and consume resources without your knowledge.<br>  2) There's a centralized database of application preferences called the 'registry'.  Most apps add to it, it can become polluted over time.<br>  3) There are few guidelines and enforcement in the system regarding how applications should install and clean up after themselves.<br>  <br>  OSX applications are restricted in their scope.  They can't make system modifications unless the OSX prompts you for your password (so be sure you trust apps that do).  So normal apps are self-contained in the app directory and only output files to your user directory.  <br>  <br>  Un-installation is just dragging and dropping the app into the trash.  The app may store your preferences in the Library folder, dragging and dropping won't remove those files - but said preference files tend to be extremely small and won't degrade performance.  An application like AppZapper can help you find them if you want to totally remove all traces of an app.|`|BBnnSwK9aa	As long as you un-install Applications properly, OS X should never, EVER, behave like Windows!<br>  <br>  To un-install applications properly in OS X, delete the ".dmg" file from Finder > Applications, and then, just drag the ".app" file from the Applications Folder to the Trash.<br>  <br>  No need to Reboot even, unlike Windows.

Z6cmvV7maa	Intel G33 is actually not a video card,it is a chipset processor.  Therefore, you have what is called 'integrated' graphics..meaning the graphics are integrated into the central processor.  So you will need to purchase a dedicated video card that meets or exceeds the stated requirements for that game.  I would purchase the best card that you can afford...go to newegg.com for best pricing.|`|044IeGstaa	The Intel G33 is a motherboard chipset, that is soldered directly to the motherboard.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_chipsets#Core_2_Chipsets" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_chips...</a><br>  ('Chipset' or 'Chip, is a slang term for IC. Integrated Circuit,<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Circuit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_...</a> )<br>  <br>  This chipset uses the Intel GMA 3100 graphics 'chip'.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#GMA_3100" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#G...</a><br>  (Took you directly to info about the Intel GMA 3100. Scroll up to the top of the page, and you can read down for more info)<br>  <br>  What you have is Integrated Graphics. Also referred to as, 'On-Board' graphics. The reason why, is that it's a graphics chip soldered to the mother ->Board. Hence, 'On-Board'.<br>  <br>  Integrated graphics shares some of the computer's system resources.<br>  Namely the Processor and Ram Memory.<br>  Your computer needs these resources to run the Operating System and any program that you have running.<br>  Windows XP is an example of an Operating System. (O/S)<br>  A game is an example of a program.<br>  <br>  Games, require a lot of the processor resources of a computer system, and also it's ram memory, when using the On-Board graphics.<br>  (Integrated Graphics)<br>  <br>  This takes away from the processor and ram, being able to run the O/S and the game. The computer slows down. It will only run the game at low settings, or won't run it at all. The game manufacturer know what the Minimal requirement, is for a graphics 'engine' to run their game, and state it.<br>  <br>  Your mention of a Nvidia GeForce 6600GT, or an ATI Radeon X1600 makes me think you have a desktop computer. You can't change the graphics chip in a laptop. It's Integrated Graphics, and there are no graphics cards to install. I do know of two laptops, however, that use Graphics Cards. There are probably more, but VERY few!<br>  (Asus C90s and the Asus C90P)<br>  <br>  Buying a graphics card will help tremendously, when trying to play a game.<br>  Why?<br>  Because a graphics card has it's own processor (GPU <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU</a> ), and graphics ram memory. It doesn't need to borrow from the computer system's resources.<br>  <br>  Three things YOU need to know, before purchasing a graphics card for your desktop computer.<br>  <br>  1.I put YOU in capital letters, because it looks like the game manufacturer has stated, that you need at least an ATI Radeon x1600, or a Nvidia GeForce 6600GT, to play their game. <br>  These cards are Old news, and real cheap.<br>  This helps you in your search, for what kind of graphics card you need. <br>  <br>  2.You have to know what Kind of expansion slot, your motherboard has for a graphics card. <br>  Is it just a PCI expansion slot, or an AGP expansion slot, or do you have a PCI-Express x16 expansion slot?<br>  <br>  3.You need to know if your power supply, has enough power for the graphics card you will buy.<br>  Namely the wattage and the 12 volt rail Amp's.<br>  <br>  If I knew the computer model name and model number, I could tell you all of the above in No's.2 and 3.<br>  <br>  If I knew the name of the game, (Exactly) I could suggest some graphics cards for your perusal.|`|MD1kbWOXaa	U need to check whether any other game that supports the graphics card or else u can change that.|`|B3TMhN6Aaa	Intel G33 has an onboard GMA3100 integrated graphics, lacking certain crucial features that were introduced with the GMA X series.<br>  <br>  In short, to run anything that requires hardware vertex shaders or hardware T&L support, something better is needed, as the G33 / GMA3100 complies with the letter of DirectX9 support, but not with the spirit of it, as too much is left to software emulation.<br>  <br>  Most onboard graphics are inferior in performance to even the lowest current cards, so in some cases it is a performance issue, while in others, it is that required features are not present.<br>  <br>  If the requirements are Geforce 6600GT or ATI X1600, then that could probably be met by the lower end models of current cards - according to reviews, for instance, the Radeon HD3450 (lowest card 1 series ago) was already superior to the X1600.<br>  <br>  Another thing to note, ATI will be slowing down driver support for cards before the HD2xxx, HD3xxx and HD4xxx series, with older cards receiving only quarterly update drivers instead of monthly.|`|mxv6UyvJaa	You can look here: <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a> choose the game and it will scan your computer and tell you where you pass and fail on the requirements.<br>  <br>  I would say upgrade your video card because Intel integrated graphics are rubbish for gaming.

b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	The biggest advantage to building one is that you get exactly what you want & nothing that you don't.<br>  <br>  Most all manufacturers like HP or Dell include tons of "crapware" installed on their PCs. <br>  <br>  They do this because they receive royalties from the software companies to promote their products. This does help keep the cost of PCs down, however, it is quite time consuming to remove them all.<br>  Even more annoying, the recovery disks rarely contain just Windows & necessary drivers. Each time you do a recovery you get all that crapware re-installed all over again.<br>  <br>  Another issue with manufactured PCs is that they will always cut corners where they can. Most often with components such as the power supply & the video card. <br>  <br>  If you require mid to high level graphic performance you will most likely find yourself having to replace both of these, & that will easily cost you $150 to $200.<br>  <br>  If you do the math & add up the cost of all the hardware needed to build a comparable $600 HP PC you will find that building it yourself saves at least $100...... but, if you need to include the cost of a legal copy of XP or Vista there really aren't much savings.<br>  <br>  That said, it's worth building your own if you are looking for a higher end unit. There the savings will be significantly in your favor. <br>  <br>  So far as warranty...it's not an issue. All components purchased do also come with at least a one year warranty.<br>  <br>  To make a long story short: if all you need is an average PC for browsing, multimedia, internet & word processing ... get a cheap HP or Dell.<br>  If you are a serious power user or gamer .... build one yourself.<br>  <br>  regards,<br>  Philip T|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	It CAN be cheaper but that is not the main reason that Build all of my own machines.

For sure dell wouldn't even give you that option, to us normal users, the higher the ram capacity the better your pc will perform in general. That is however not the case here.<br>  <br>  2) Building a custom pc or some would call it a gaming rig. Pretty much requires you to be farmiliar with the field, acronyms such as mobo, ram, psu, hdd, gpu, chassis and etc... Like wise it requires the user to be hardware savvy. Have to do alittle readup and homework before purchasing and assembling, its a chore, but it does pay off.<br>  <br>  When i got my current system custom build, yeah i didn't actually build it from scratch, got the guy at the shop to do it for me. However every individual major hardware components was selected by me. <br>  <br>  These hardware components offered by market are way superior in terms of quality, functionality and variety, unlike a dell which supplies you 1 year of warranty that covers product and labour. Each individual hardware warranty holds at least 3 years.<br>  Especially you can always get the top of the line hardware for instance the GTX295, which is offered by most out of the box pc.<br>  <br>  Lastly, there are companies that does custom pc that offers some serious customization.

It will allow you to play your games with a lot better graphics and a lot smoother game play. I hope this helped.|`|b8VRlStoaa	How much are you planing on spending for this Dell ?

The same way a powerfull processor is important. the mhz thing on the porcessor like 1066Mhz is the sppeed of the processor. When buyinga  processor what mattrs is the soeed (mhz) and number of cores. The Core 2 Duo is a dula core processor and the Core 2 Quad is a quad core processor. more cors more power<br>  <br>  Motherboard: Well everything should be compatible with the motherboard. EVRYTHING PLUGS INTO THE MOTHERBOARD.<br>  <br>  RAM: more RAm u have more speed u get. Just like a powerfull processor. here are gaming RAms and normal value RAms.<br>  <br>  Hard disk: guess u know what that is<br>  <br>  Graphic card: just like the processor runs rograms the graphic card or GPU runs the graphics. No graphic card and u get a blank screen. Gt it. Better graphic card the better games you can play and teh better graphics u get.<br>  <br>  Now for the PC:<br>  <br>  I would suggest:<br>  <br>  Intel Core 2 Duo E7300 <br>  Nvdia Nforce 750i motherboard<br>  Corsair XMS2 800MHz 4GB RAM ( this is gaming RAM)<br>  320GB Hard drive<br>  DVD-RW<br>  Nvidia GeForce 9800GT 1GB 256bits (this is graphi card)<br>  Coolermaster CM690 case and 600watts powersupply<br>  <br>  If you want better PC then get:<br>  <br>  Intel COre 2 Wuad Q6600<br>  Nvidia NForce 750i motherboard<br>  Corsair XMS2 DDR2 4GB RAM 800Mhz<br>  320GB Hard drive<br>  DVD-RW<br>  Nvidia GeForce 9800GT 1GB 256bits<br>  CoolerMaster CM690case with 600watts powersupply<br>  <br>  <br>  I ypu arent sure about getting someoen t build youa PC then I guess you should buy the PC you mentioned. However it wont be able to play the newer games for more than year.<br>  <br>  ALso if you decide to get a PC built then you will have to spend less moeny. You will probabaly save 40& of your money.|`|Z6cmvV7maa	Not a bad machine at all.  I would upgrade the video card though to be able to play more advanced games.  The HD3450 is solid but it's a lower to middle range card...they are less than $30 at newegg.com.  Spend a few extra bucks and get a better Radeon ATI card.<br>  Also, I agree that upgrading the ram to 4GB will do wonders for Windows Vista.
xVfjkTyuaa	A router should do (routers have built-in switches). Depends on how you get your internet in the first place.

zorYTX59aa	There are a few things you should be aware of when you<br>  label your videos: "tags" are only the 3rd most important <br>  element in YouTube's search-results. Words in the titles <br>  are 1st, and words in the descriptions are 2nd.<br>  <br>  And way in front of those three different variables is your <br>  YouTube username. Thus, tags are actually in 4th place,<br>  and as such are the least important element in a search.<br>  <br>  (Whenever you do a search, how often do you get videos <br>  at the top of those results with no matching words in the <br>  username, video titles, or descriptions? Just about never.  <br>  If you ever do get results like that with no matches at all,<br>  those are the times when 'tags' are relevant in a search.)<br>  <br>  Thus if you would like your videos to appear near the top <br>  of search results, the ideal would be to have people type <br>  in your username first followed by the title of one of your <br>  videos -- if not some of the most unique words. Example:<br>  WOWZERS UNLEASHED<br>  <br>  If you don't want your username being part of the search <br>  (perhaps 'cause people don't know it) and you want your<br>  videos at the top of search results, then make your titles <br>  and descriptions as long as you can with as many 'buzz'<br>  words as you can. If for some reason you are somebody <br>  who's fascinated with tags, include them in to your titles.|`|MxculX2Daa	There are many videos that come up with that search phrase in youtube. I have jsut checked. Maybe you have a slight delay between uploading and going onto the web server.|`|b3qz5dH2aa	Well that name is probably taken by many other users' videos I'd try searching your account name and you should find it no problem.|`|vJbDoXkOaa	just look it up in ur own videos on ur channel. there are many videos with that name so it may not come up. its probably in your search but you'd have to search very deep in ur search

2vL8wOHZaa	I would build the first one but upgrade the video card to a 4870. The 4650 is a 128bit card and the 4870 is a 256 bit card. You will see a huge improvement in game play and graphics. The 4870 is also a faster clock speed and has more stream processors. It kicks the 9800GT's as* in games. I personally own a Sapphire 4870 and there isn't a game out right now that I can't max the graphics and eye candy on.

HyDtiSa8aa	If you want to get these results lets start with some very basic photography equipment.  First, a tripod.  Yes, you think you can hold the camera steady but "starting out" photographers will move the camera ever so slightly and that will show in the results.  Secondly, if you are using a digital camera, and who doesn't today, don't think that you are gaining anything by using settings to enable you to put a lot of pictures on the memory card.  Set the camera for the highest quality setting possible.  <br>  <br>  The act of taking the photograph.  Get the focus dead on correct.  Remember in viewing in the little LCD monitor on the camera it will look outstanding while in fact it may not be.  Many camera will allow you to zoom in on the picture in the preview.  Use this feature to get a closer look at particularly the eyes when taking a picture of people.  Get the exposure spot on.  If there is backlighting, set the flash to fire to fill in the light on the subject.  <br>  <br>  Once you get that part right, in an editing program, the picture can always use some sharpening.  The Unsharp Mask, strange name, is the best tool in Photoshop line of programs.  Do not sharpen to the point that halos or white lines are appearing at the edges.  Do the sharpening as the last act of editing.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, practice, practice|`|vxWspEHoaa	I learned a lot from Youtube!<br>  Just search for photoshop tutorials in there. <br>  :D
wF6eje9Maa	This will be down to water damage still on the circuits.<br>  If you are fairly skilled with computers, you can remove the screen housing and try using a hair dryer or something to dry the laptop completely. Ensure both the laptop is NOT plugged into the mains, and the battery is removed.<br>  If you still have a warranty enabled, you may be able to pull something off with them (rain damage or something) but you will have to make sure it falls inside the contract and involves water (the circuits discolour slightly to show water damage)<br>  If you have a desktop, you should also try using the VGA port and connecting a second screen to check if it is just a screen issue or the water has seeped onto the motherboard|`|AsV8BafMaa	Did you spill it on the actual keys? or was the lid closed? This happened to mine but the lid was closed, but the bottom did get soaked and to tell you the truth, i ran to pick it up, and just set it on my carpet and let my carpet soak up the water. then I just let it dry out before I turned it on. You should see if when you pick it up[while it is turned off!] if you can hear any liquid sloshing around. And like she said, take out the keys and let it dry. If this doesn't help, set it upside down, with the lid open, kinda like a tent so it's like ^ that and set it by a fan and let it completely air dry.

Your laptop is trashed

GQ6K85LPaa	If you're gpnig to be printing assignments a mono laser is the best bet, and use college printers for the occasional colour output.<br>  <br>  Laser is a LOT cheaper per page for printing, although the printers cost a little more to buy at first.<br>  <br>  Going wireless "might" seem a good idea, but a lot of people have problems getting themto connect reliably, so I'd always stick with USB or a network cabled one.|`|AA11296044	Lexmark cartridges are the most expensive on the market - just don't do it.<br>  <br>  If you don't need color - get a sweet little compact laser printer like a samsung ML-1630w. (retail $200-$250)<br>  <br>  However if you can live without a wireless printer you can - for about $150 less get an ML2510 (retail about $60 - ships with  500 page yield cartridge, replacement cartridge $70 yields 3500 pages)<br>  <br>  A laser printer only print black - however our of one $70 cartridge  you will get about 3000 pages.  Compare that to an ink jet where out of one $20 cartridge you will get 40-100 pages.<br>  <br>  For reviews I will normally go to Tom's hardware - however most reviews are sponsored, they are not going to give you cost per page.  They are not going to give your information on the reliability.|`|M2CWqhX0aa	You are right, lexmark is cheap and the cartridges are relatively cheaper than other brands out there.

7QTXV0Jkaa	Beyond the internet,it exists in your imagination.|`|MxculX2Daa	If someone creates an on-line persona that is different to their normal persona then I imagine it would be an expression of a part of themselves.<br>  <br>  For example I am normally very considerate, respectful and helpful. However, on some posts I have made (not on this site) I have been rude and unhelpful in a sarcastic kinda way.<br>  <br>  I thought that it was quite useful to be able to do this in an anonymous way because I could hide behind this fake persona. So I expect that part of me is rude and unhelpful but I don't use that part in my normal daily relationships with people.<br>  <br>  So maybe by being able to do that I was expressing that other part of myself in a healthy way that allowed be to release those feelings.<br>  <br>  Or maybe I am just a repressed psychopath. Who knows?
MjRomsRZaa	Yes you can. I've done it actually. You just put it in and start the installation.|`|7BNO3mNtaa	You can as long as the old computer has the system requirements to support Leopard.
rnfxNYx3aa	- As Facebook works to make itself more relevant and timely for its growing member base with a profile page makeover, attackers seem to be working overtime to steal the identities of the friends, fans and brands that connect though the social-networking site. <br>  <br>  Indeed, Facebook has seen five different security threats in the past week. According to Trend Micro, four new hoax applications are attempting to trick members into divulging their usernames and passwords. And a new variant of the Koobface worm is running wild on the site, installing malware on the computers of victims who click on a link to a fake YouTube video. <br>  <br>  The Koobface worm is dangerous. It can be dropped by other malware and downloaded unknowingly by a user when visiting malicious Web sites, Trend Micro reports. When attackers execute the malware, it searches for cookies created by online social networks. The latest variant is targeting Facebook, but earlier variants have also plagued MySpace.

Eventually you should be able to top up a few courses (and eventually) the MCPD.<br>  <br>  Me personally would do (in this order):<br>  <br>  Introduction to C#\VB Programming with Microsoft .NET <br>  <br>  and\or<br>  <br>  Programming with the Microsoft .NET Framework<br>  <br>  Programming a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Database<br>  <br>  Its a difficult question to answer without knowing what if any experience you have.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|MD1kbWOXaa	Hi<br>  I think u look on to become a developer in the .net platform so MC application developer will be better.

WxWiP3QJaa	Do the other networks need a password? Do you have it? Do they block undeclared MAC addresses? Does your hardware support that connection? Far too many questions about the other hardware that doubtless you will not know either... ask your friends and family when you try to connect, maybe? It is something they have done, so maybe they are the people who can help?<br>  <br>  <br>  -- Could be a MAC address blocker going on, whereby only specific MAC addresses are allowed to join the network. This really is a question you should be asking whoever set up the network... we will not be able to help! Same laptop, same hardware - no matter if they are not configured the same.
