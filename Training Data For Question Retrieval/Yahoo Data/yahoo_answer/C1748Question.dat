20090306163542AA2FkZa	News & Events;Current Events	Killing Palestinians doesn't count?	Is a ceasefire breached only when an Israeli is killed?      On January 27th media headlines trumpeted that Palestinians had broken the latest cease-fire: a bomb had killed one Israeli soldier and injured two or three.       Virtually every media outlet reported this action as a major breach in the ceasefire that had begun on January 18th: Associated Press, CNN, Fox News, CBS, the New York Times, The Washington Post, the LA Times, the McClatchy Newspapers, etc, all pinned the resumption of violence on Palestinians.      There's just one problem. Israeli forces had already violated the ceasefire at least seven times:   Israeli forces killed a Palestinian farmer in Khuza'a east of Khan Yunis on Jan 18   Israeli forces killed a Palestinian farmer east of Jabalia on Jan. 19   Israeli naval gunboats shelled the Gaza coastline, causing damage to civilian structures   Israeli troops shot and injured a child east of Gaza City on Jan 22   Israeli gunboat fire injured 4-7 Palestinian fishermen on Jan 22   Israeli shelling set a Palestinian house on fire on Jan 22   Israeli tanks fired on the border town of Al Faraheen, causing damage to homes and farms on Jan 24      Yet, Americans who rely on American media for their news on Israel-Palestine are being led to believe that Palestinians initiated the violence (the death of one Israeli soldier) that has now led to Israel's latest onslaught:      By the end of the day, according to reports, Israeli forces had already killed a 27-year-old Palestinian farmer by tank fire; had closed the crossings into Gaza, denying the entire population (1.5 million) access to desperately needed shipments of food, medicine, and other humanitarian aid; had launched a military drone that fired a missile into the city of Khan Yunis, injuring a Hamas member on a motorcycle and reportedly at least one Palestinian child nearby; had sent 20 tanks and seven military bulldozers into Gaza; and had occupied a Palestinian home near the town of Deir Al Balah.*      Sources:  http://www.ifamericansknew.org/
