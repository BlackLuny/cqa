o0oYsQM7aa	I can't use labels? Aw man, I got to think on this one.<br>  <br>  Our country was founded on dissidence. If you want dissidence, read Thomas Paine. I thought this was a dead issue. The PC police have moved on to better things by now haven't they? But then again, those fools in the congress are calling for hearings about AM talk radio. Freedom of the press ONLY applies to newspapers right?<br>  <br>  I feel it is critical to a free society to have dissenting voices. Note that anytime a dictator seizes control the first thing he does is shuts down the free press. Hmmm...my addled brain is making a connection hear with the "fairness doctrine."

4VzVfKvdaa	Here is a neat trick I learned early in my career.  Have most of your money put towards an allotment instead of a regular direct deposit bank account.  You still need to have the direct deposit account, but put most of your money in an allotment account.  The reason is, even if they screw up your pay, allotments are always paid...only yo can change or stop them.  Finance cannot touch them by law once you set them up. So next time your LES shows an error, you will still have most of your check.  One thing...allotments are usually paid first of the month only, but that makes it easy to budget.|`|m6C3pgChaa	I guess we've been lucky in that the only thing we had was they paid us DLA twice - we thought the payment was high though so we looked into it.

The BAH was messed up (even though we've had it for quite a while - one month it just wasn't there - who knows...). When we first got married, my husband was in Germany and I was in Arkansas and the finance over there told him we didn't even GET BAH!!! That one is my favorite mess up.

Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense.

They put it in pieces with other bills that don't have anything to do with health care and get little bites of their agenda each time. This time, they added more child care to an ECONOMIC STIMULUS package. They upped the income dollar number of those that qualify.

TsjqzanQaa	"Cate's" answer says that there are no nerves in the foreskin?      No wonder some women are so blase about chopping off parts of the male anatomy.<br>  <br>  They certainly don't choose female circumcision for themselve, no, that would be mutilation.<br>  <br>  But it's open season on the penis of defenseless infants.<br>  <br>  I say that any female who advocates circumcision and before she has it perpetrated on her son should herself be required by law to have a female circumcision, so that she can experience firsthand the '"benefits:" of circumcision.<br>  <br>  It could be argued that it's cleaner for a woman and looks better, as there are less labial folds to trap female smegma and dirt and bacteria.     It would decrease infections.      Why don't these women who extol the benefits of circumcision get them selves circumcised first?<br>  <br>  Oh, but no, it's mutilation to circumcise females.<br>  <br>  The legality of circumcision is highly questionable, as it's illegal in the USA to circumcise female minors, and yet it's not illegal to circumcise males.     We're supposed to have equal rights for both sexes, and as such male circumcision of minors must either be illegal, or female circumcision of minors must be legal.<br>  <br>  It's unconstitutional to have discriminatory laws.<br>  <br>  More individuals need to bring suit against the penis butchers for once and for all to put them out of business.<br>  <br>  But old wives' tales and outright lies about the so-called benefits of male genital mutilation die hard.     Especially since the media don't cover the adverse effects, which aren't disclosed by the doctors and are in fact suppressed.<br>  <br>  I am against female circumcision of minors, it is indeed genital mutilation.      There's no difference with male circumcision.     Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  I am all for a law requiring female adults who perpetrate circumcision on their sons and advocate the practice to be required legally to have one done to themselves first.      (It would never be passed, or even seriously considered, however.)<br>  <br>  I have restored my foreskin, and while it will never completely restore all of the lost sensitivity and function, it has really given me much more of an idea of what was destroyed when they mutilated me just after birth.<br>  <br>  Some stupid women (and some men, also) who think that circumcision is harmless and has some benefit are in the minority, and at least more people are educated these days, so that more people realize that a mutilated, scarred and partial penis can't possibly feel or function as well as an intact, natural and normal penis with a foreskin.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|kprKXEOSaa	What about parents who pierce their little girl's ears?<br>  What about parents who immunize their children, I mean, that hurts!<br>  What about parents who spank their children?<br>  <br>  Do you have children of your own?

I pray that right will never be taken away, even if some parents make decisions that I personally disagree with.<br>  <br>  Edit: My husband was circumcised, and I probably wouldn't have had our son circumcised, but the final decision was my husband's--I mean, I had heard all the information against circumcision, but I don't have a penis, so I thought the decision should be made by someone who did.  Our son had no complications.  Our doctor also recommended it be done.  Our doctor told us that there is a racial minority here in the area where we live who typically don't circumcise their boys, while the majority of other parents choose to have it done.  He said that he sees a lot of uncircumcised boys from that racial group that have to be treated for infections, while it is very rare among circumcised boys to have similar problems.

I personally would never circumcise my son(s) (if I had sons) because I wouldn't want to deprive him of the benefits of having an uncircumcised penis.  However, I once met this guy (when I was in 8th grade) who had his foreskin removed when he was 14 because it was extremely painful for him when he got an erection because the foreskin would constrict the head of his penis. So I think that parents should leave the foreskin where it was meant to be, unless complications arise like the one I've mentioned. You just have to make sure you keep it clean!|`|S6Z9wljdaa	Well those are some pretty good points.  I have to sons myself, both have been circumcised.  I did do some research before my first son was circumcised and I found that the uncircumcised boys/men have a much higher chance of catching disease through intercourse.

I do also have some friends that are nurses and they have seen the procedure and they do say that it is horrific but that they still think it is a necessary thing to do.|`|AA11987492	I have NO idea!<br>  <br>  You might like to look at this question that I asked a few months ago, very interesting!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am_JfejYUG_TqgQYLtS41G7ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081116114447AAHGS93">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|1nVoeYg1aa	Honoring a God-given command comes before individual rights.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	because until you are an adult medical decisions are the right of the legal guardian|`|QBUypAmAaa	I wish I knew why America stuck to such old ideals, I guess old habits are hard to break. That and America is one of the only industrialised countries which does not have universal healthcare, thus there is a profit in circumcision. If the USA did have universal health coverage, it is definite that the rates of circumcision would drop to maybe 10% like the UK or France. <br>  <br>  I agree with you 100% there are no benefits whatsoever, and there are so many alternatives which can be implemented than the entire removal of the foreskin by circumcision. Phimosis, paraphimosis, frenulum breve all of those can be corrected by non-surgical means for the most part or a simple corrective surgery that elicits that part only, not the whole foreskin. Circumcision is also no cleaner, as smegma though it seems dirty and I agree should be cleaned off, has many antibacterial elements in it. Circumcision also does not prevent against stds, condoms do that, and intact/uncircumcised males have no higher risks of things either like cancer or urinary tract infections, so all of the people saying that have false information supplied by those who support circumcision as it's sadly a profitable business suffice it to say. So really when will people get their heads out of the clouds that circumcision is a joyous, painless, and beneficial operation when it's not? It's cruel, barbaric, outdated, entirely cosmetic and unnecessary, I mean all the Health Organisations of the world, even the USA's don't even recommend it! So why?<br>  <br>  Also what I find sickly humourous in America is that female genital mutilation is outlawed 100%, yet circumcision which is mutilation of the genitals of males is not. And it makes no sense as to outlaw one thing and not outlaw the other, when in fact they are both the same thing. Female cutting is removal of the clitoral hood from the vagina, that is the female version of the foreskin, male cutting is the removal of the penile hood, which is a foreskin, see anything wrong with this picture? It's like people in the circumcising nations see circumcision as the only rite to becoming a man, and just expect males to buck up and take the pain and act as if losing the most important part of their penis is no big deal. Then they try to make it universal for all males in the nation so as it's not to be questioned, so they in turn think nothing is wrong with their penis at all, but it's not natural, the penis wasn't designed to be left out in the open air and rubbing against harsh materials like clothing at all times. Look at all the male animals in the world, all of them have the penis as an internal, covered organ. This is meant to maximise pleasure and sensitivity and to keep it protected, it's the way it's supposed to be, nature designed it so.<br>  <br>  The worst part about circumcision, aside from the fact that the benefits are nil and the complications too great, is that it worsens with age. A man who has been intact/uncircumcised, when he is 50 can still pull his penis out and feel great pleasures from sex just almost similar to when he was 20. A man who is circumcised and 50, will most likely feel very little pleasure from sex, will not find it enjoyable, and will more than likely suffer from some sort of erectile dysfunction, because his penis has suffered 50 years of become gradually desensitised. If you don't believe me on that, look at the hands of construction workers, they are hard and calloused from being in environments where they're constantly being used with rough materials, sandpaper, metal, rock, etc. And they feel very little with their hands, because of so much desensitising. Now I read someone comment on another answer arguing that "Oh well, does that mean we should cover our hands and wear gloves all the time too?" Well no of course it doesn't mean that, but the hands are meant to be external, the penis was not, so that's why it's unnatural to have the penis without the foreskin and uncovered at all times.<br>  <br>  I do know that, I will never circumcise my son(s). It was done to me without my permission and I hate it. It's his penis it will be his choice.<br>  I want him to be able to experience the best out of life and have all the options and opportunities open to him, and it can start with having a natural intact penis. I will teach him to use a condom to practice safe sex and how to clean it so hygiene will not be a problem. Besides when should the needs of the parents come before the child? That's really messed up, if you care for your child then do away with YOUR want to circumcise him, and leave him be let HIM decide that.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	Honestly, I don't know. When I saw this question I was hoping that some anti-foreskin answers would contain citations on the legality of infant circumcision, but all I see there is misinformed (well, UNinformed, really) drivel. I guess there are no laws protecting a parent's "right" to force cosmetic surgery on a child. Furthermore, doctors who perform circumcisions are acting unethically, violating basic human rights, and going against the following portions of the Hippocratic Oath:<br>  <br>  "To practice and prescribe to the best of my ability for the good of my patients, and to try to avoid harming them"<br>  <br>  "Never to do deliberate harm to anyone for anyone else's interest."<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  "To keep the good of the patient as the highest priority."<br>  <br>  Since no medical organization in the world has yet to find circumcision medically necessary, when a doctor performs one on an infant,  he or she is harming the child AND doing it for the interest of the parent, NOT the patient. And obviously the good of the patient is ignored since circumcision results not only in the loss of functional tissue, but possibly death, infection, and disfigurement. These are not acceptable risks for a cosmetic procedure when it is performed wthout consent on a minor.<br>  <br>  And for those anwerers who choose to lie to themselves and claim that cirumcision is not mutilation, take a minute to open a dictionary and look up the meaning of mutilation. It IS mutilation by all definitions.

AbRfd29Haa	He can sign an Executive Order whenever he likes. This has always been the case. <br>  <br>  The thing you're probably more interested in is the scope of these orders. An executive order is not a law, it's basically a directive to the Executive branch (which, due to the POTUS being Commander in Chief of the armed forces, includes the Military)... much the same way the President of a company might issue some corporate policy. An Executive Order can also clarify or add support to an existing law, but it cannot make new law. <br>  <br>  There is certainly potential for conflict... an Executive Order can't overstep the jurisdiction of the President. For example, George W. Bush issues Executive Order 13233, restricting public access to the papers of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Some organizations were working on challenges to this, but it was revoked by President Obama by another Executive Order. <br>  <br>  It is possible to challenge Executive Orders, though it's been extremely rare. Only two have been overturned in court, an order by President Truman and an order by President Clinton... in both cases, the EO was ruled to be establishing new law. Congress can also override an EO by enacting legislation, but it's considered highly unlikely if not impossible to actually do so, based on the politics involved. <br>  <br>  For quite some time, Executive Orders were kind of unknown to the general populace.

Now, abortion can only be made illegal if the Supreme Court reverses itself, or if the Constitution is Amended.   Republicans have never had the 2/3 majority in both houses required to propose the necessary amendment.   As for the Supreme Court, 7 of 9 Justices are Republican appointments, yet the Court continues to refuse to overturn Roe.|`|7SNe6SKTaa	I'm not aware of any candidate that is able to make anything illegal or legal. A candidate can not make a law, much less pass a law. If the candidate is a member of Congress he or she might propose a law, but getting it passed is the problem.

As long as they can say they're anti-abortion, they'll get votes.  If abortion becomes illegal, they can't say they're anti-abortion anymore.  And they'll have to think of some other way to get your support.  In light of this, abortion will NEVER be made illegal.  The Republicans had 6 years (2001-7) to make it illegal.  They did nothing.  <br>  <br>  In regard to the death penalty, I have no problem with it.  If a person is a danger to others and can't be reformed, what's the point in keeping them alive?  On top of that, I have no problem with abortion in the first trimester.  And I believe in doctor assisted suicide.  Death is a part of life.

He needs to speak positive words about the economy.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	He's being positive while sounding a realistic note. We are in deep trouble, and change isn't coming tomorrow, next week, or even next summer. I think he's striking the correct balance between optimism for the future and cautions about the present.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Perhaps this will give you some insight into one of the worlds slickest socialists. He is talking down the economy, he is talking about doom and gloom, and this is from the man that is about hope and change. The stock market has gone down more since  the election, then it has during the Bush years, even though some still blame Bush. When Obama speaks, or anyone speaks about the economy, they tell you it's going to get worse, before it gets better. What is his stimulus plan doing in the near future, and is it really stimulus. No, it is spending. There is a reason for all of this, and it is a socialist mantra. Spread fear, make people dependent upon government which they need to run their lives and save them from themselves.|`|2a8f342e5a607281058fdd923f98379faa	No,we are a bunch of nonchalant procrastinators who sit on the sidelines doing and hearing nothing.We do not get motivated unless we get kicked.It is not negativism it is reality.I am sure a guy like Madoff who stole 5 billions from his clients was telling everyone of them how sweet and beautiful everything will be .|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Obama is getting everything he asks for, and when he gets it he tells everyone that its getting worse.  It's worst that we ever imagined.  The economy will get worse before it gets better.  Much more still needs to be done.

My God, I hate to hear what he has to say!|`|9w9UHyCNaa	He's doing it to encourage everyone to start helping.<br>  <br>  Being positive and saying things would help a little bit, but not as much when you say "The time is now, everything is falling, and you need to get up."<br>  <br>  Actions speak louder than words.

e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	I was a meth addict for a long time.  So was my main dealer.  I found God, but that's not the cure-all for everyone.  Rehab was hell.  For my dealer, the best thing that ever happened was going to jail.  He had bad withdrawals and ended up in the jail hospital, and later psych ward of the local military hospital (his folks were ex-Army).  He was a spoiled rich brat that made tens of thousands of dollars on making & selling drugs in his mom's designer crock pots in a nice area of town.<br>  <br>  Being away from his parents and the drugs for so long helped him get off of it.<br>  <br>  Sadly, though, it's like the sex industry.  The money is just so good.  He went back to producing, trying not to do it himself, but eventually couldn't resist the temptation to get spun again.  He got careless and just got out of jail after a year a couple months ago.  I think he's doing ok.  I try not to have too much contact with the old crowd.  He wants to get off and stay off, but it's really hard.<br>  <br>  The stuff is plain evil.<br>  <br>  You have to think about your neighborhood, though.  He may be harmless, but the drug gangs are ruthless.  If someone doesn't like him doing so much business, his life could be in danger.  The lives of your neighbors are in danger.  How many times have drive-bys killed the wrong family in the wrong house next door to a drug dealer?  Think about them.  Being in jail might wake him up, and might save his life.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	A good person would file a report with the police, there are victims of his crime out there, hooked on the drugs he is selling, who might die because he sells them drugs.<br>  <br>  At 19 he is not a boy, he is a man, and entitled to go to adult prison.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AaXl3vcCaa	if he is nice and approachable tell him that you have heard neighbors talking about reporting him and they have proof and that he should stop if he wants to avoid trouble with them, if you are scared to tell him then calling the police is the only thing you can do|`|2MVG5StDaa	Nothing you can do but report it to police.

Our system doesn't work very well either.  It often takes weeks to months to get an appt. with a specialist, the costs of medical care are prohibitive for many and even with insurance, many things are not covered well.  For those lucky enough to have insurance through their job that is really good insurance things are pretty good here, but for the rest of us it basically sucks.  And it costs everyone a lot more overall because people who can't afford basic medical care often don't get treated early resulting in a MUCH larger cost later.  We all pay for the medical care that others recieve anyway, its just a lot more expensive and not as good.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	My mother is 85 years old, still in good health and has never had to wait in line since she went on Medicare when she retired.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who was in the military, still relies on his GI benefits and uses the VA hospital.

He didn't wait in any line.<br>  <br>  I know several government employees at various levels and they've never had to wait in any line for health care.<br>  <br>  All the above are perfect examples of government sponsored health care. In general, almost have the population already has it.|`|2Fb1mZIZaa	I live in a country with real, incorporated socialized health care. Despite the horrible quality and the mind-blowing waiting lines, the scariest part is that when government pays for your health care, somehow the government is under the impression that they definitively should have a say in how you choose to live your life. As a result, government, where I live, imposes regulations on what you can eat, how much you can eat, what means of transportation you should use etc.<br>  <br>  If you give government control of your health care system, you're not only handing over your health - you're handing over your entire life to the government. Forget the lacking quality - that's going to be your least problem!<br>  <br>  Keep America free! Liberty must prevail! God bless America! God bless the Founding Fathers! God bless the constitution!|`|7df8bfa5cc06495b9b1bd3a8c17c6ad9aa	the way some of you people demonize socialized health care you would think that you guys were getting checks from the insurance company's who for the past number of years have been jacking the cost of health insurance by double digits.  <br>  <br>  and since We the USA have never had socialized health care how is it that you know it will not work you all must be fortunetellers|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	HAHAHA.

The World Health Organization ranks the US healthcare system as 37th best in the world.

People will be going to the doctor for every single sniffle and pain they have.|`|5f9hg9craa	Why socialized healthcare does not work?<br>  <br>  Easy, like earlier someone said that people would be going to the hospital for small things. I find that socialized healthcare would work in some countries, but not in America or in Canada. <br>  <br>  The best way to answer this question you have to look at the people in the country. In Canada healthcare is free, however wait times and priorities are applied. So if someone who's finger cut off versus someone who had a sewing needle in the foot the person is going to get served first depends on a few factors time, priority and pain. However, Canada's health care system is abused, because people tend to do crazy stunts and think the hospitals will take care of it no charge.<br>  <br>  America's healthcare, now if it were to be socialized think of how many people would start going there for minor things rather than taking care of it at home. I would say America's healthcare is better than Canada, because if you have the money you will go first.<br>  <br>  Watch the movie S1cko by Michael Moore.<br>  -Edit-<br>  Looks like everyone here is here to speculate I think they need to check their sources, otherwise its all BS(BabyStuff).|`|c3vPZfghaa	People come from countries with socialist health care to pay for it here, because in socialist health care countries, when a 5 year old kid needs a kidney transplant, and a 80 year old with a lot of money needs the same kidney, the socialist health care system gives it to the child.<br>  In America the 80 year old man can pay more money and cling to a few more years of his withering life while depriving the child of the rest of theirs.<br>  <br>  In a few years, we are facing a problem of having the same problem you describe because we will not have enough doctors to provide service to everyone who needs to be treated. So health care prices will shoot up. It is estimated that 50% of the people who can currently afford health care will not be able to in about 10 years.<br>  <br>  Why is this occurring?<br>  Because providing funds for medical schools to build more and hire liberal professors is considered socialism by right-wingers who constantly oppose anything that is in their best interest.<br>  <br>  and BTW subsidizing health insurance isn't socialized health care, despite what drivel talk-radio pukes into your brain.|`|x12mMdApaa	the only thing I can say is ask the American vets, they go to the va for their health care I haven't heard any of them saying it a wonderful experience.|`|q9PVawNyaa	I come from a country with universal healthcare and it works. In fact it works in almost every developed country.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Not sure where you are getting your info but it is widely flawed and nonsensical.  I have close personal friends who live in Winnipeg and they are thrilled by the national healthcare plan in Canada.  They do not have to wait in lines for treatment.  For specialized care they wait no longer than we do in the US.  I recently had an MRI and had to wait a week, about the same wait as in Canada.  They live in Winnipeg, only about 90 miles from the US border.|`|6kCws524aa	Oh but is does work, all you have to do is to allocate 70 of your GNP to fund it or fund less and get medical care like that in Canada, UK and other foolish socialist countries.

If all you want is medical care for EVERY person, then socialized health care does work. It guarantees health care for all. However, if you want good quality health care, socialized health care can not work because it would not be cost effective for doctors and hospitals. Many people think that doctors charge to much for their office calls and that hospitals and labs charge to much for their services...and having a national health care program would eliminate that from happening...that is true. However, it would also eliminate the ability for doctors, hospitals and labs to give the BEST quality of care.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	I don't know of any developed nations who have a socialized medical program that results in "breadline style service".

bnJPvsVWaa	It sounds as though, in the PA case, they made an effort not to crucify her.  If the dime bag was noted, but she was not charged with possession, then she was given a pretty substantial break by the officer in question.   You will first want to contact the court (number should be on the Summons somewhere) and verify that disorderly conduct is the only charge.  If that's the case, you might ask for a postponement, until you can get the Maryland case out of the way, and then go back to it.  <br>  <br>  With a break like that, though, I doubt the DA/Prosecutor or the Court will have much interest in any further downgrade, even with a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  As far as the MD case goes, well...DWI isn't something they give you a lot of room to wiggle on, as someone could've very easily been killed.  More than likely, you can get the tail light ticket merged, as they probably only bothered wasting the ink in order to document their probable cause for the stop.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, regardless of how these cases play out, you need to give strong consideration to yanking her straight out of college and getting her straightened out.  College, despite the benefits, is smorgasbord of temptation and peer pressure, with almost no supervision.  If she's already gone to drinking and driving, and pot, then she's obviously not mature enough to handle it.<br>  <br>  If you decide to leave her in school, you would be well-served to remove her from your insurance and repossess the vehicle she drives, or you may well eat a hefty insurance surge, before the year is out.  Also, don't be surprised if she fails.  I'd drag her straight home for a one-chance-only shock treatment, and then kick her out of the nest and let her fly or fall.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	I love how you try to pass her off as  a model citizen.

AA11163314	The weight limits are nothing more than a screening tool used to determine who does and does not need to have their body fat percentage calculated.  <br>  <br>  And from the description you gave - it will be obvious from a single glance that your weight is muscle, not fat.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	Your low body fat in relation to your weight/muscle will help you out but you need to understand a couple of things I think.  For flying status and flight schools you have to pass a flight physical which is more stringent than just a regular military physical.  The rigors of flight and altitude on the body dehydrate a person faster, and cause changes in blood pressure and circulation and some other systems in the body.  That is the reason for this so while your weight is a little heavy it really will come down to some other things like blood pressure.  I only mention this as your BMI will be alright but you may want to shed a few pounds of muscle and work on your cardio more.|`|1405b50b88ea3467bfb41d06509736e6aa	Your weight is fine, especially with only 12% body fat. <br>  <br>  Your height should be fine too, but you'll need to get your anthropometric measurements taken, ie: sitting height, reach, etc to make sure you'll fit in all aircraft. <br>  <br>  At 210, you'll be a tight squeeze into most single seat fighters/attack, but you'll work around it (like, twist your torso sideways when you bring the canopy down on a F/A-18). <br>  <br>  Talk to an Officer Selection Officer if you're serious about the flight program. The Marines offer a flight contract, which provided you pass all the physical requirements, will contract you to go to flight school once you pass Officer Candidate School and The Basic School (for Lieutenants). <br>  <br>  good luck.

G6yyceAxaa	His reaction was support of the land being taken, however the reason given was that he didn't want to see the tribe wiped out like the Mohegan, and Delaware tribes.  the fact was that the Cherokee had prime farm land, and had developed modern farming techniques and were standing to make lots of money.  also, in the Mountains of Georgia, gold was found and that has always been a reason to displace indigenous people. as far as the war of 1812, they fought for the British and the US. so that was not a reason, just depended on who asked first, and who paid the most.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	It really was not seizure of their land those that had title to land were allowed to stay <br>  A Jackson backed the Indian removal act These Indians sided with the Brits in both wars the young would also go out on raiding parties as an act of manhood The Indians that signed the agreement with the U S government were all killed on the trail of tears or after they arrived There were also 2000 black slaves on the tail of tears Most of it consisted of a boat ride
OiAl6w48aa	Bank accounts, stocks, personal property, etc., can all be attached and garnished with the appropriate court orders (generally, a judgment in favor of the creditor).  Your age does not enter into the equation.<br>  <br>  As far as social security, etc., there are very strict rules about garnishing that and SSI.  You should have a help line you can call and talk to about that.  I doubt they can legally garnish either of those sources in your situation.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	No.  Disability and SS cannot be garnished because you have to have a certain amount of income before you can be garnished and both of those do not meet that amount.|`|ypvcnd47aa	I don't think you can garnish goverment checks and they should be pleased your trying in theses hard times its just sad the way things work .good luck .|`|7HdgMaOnaa	just think if all the illegal immigrants were not feeding off of the health care system.... you could prob. have saved a ton of money.
T8nap2Pnaa	Yak Rider is right on all counts. In my experience, most people get their waivers eventually. To a large extent the time frame depends on who's doing it. USCIS offices do their own waivers at their various offices overseas and the time varies a great deal as these are small offices, so if one person is away on a temporary detail, it makes a big impact. CBP has a central office for waivers in Minnesota and those go very quickly. USCIS says 6 months as a default response.   Since most waivers are based on the  extreme hardship the US citizen would experience if their relative didn't get the waiver, it can certainly be useful to have an attorney help you prepare the waiver request. Otherwise, they don't have any role in the decision.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	You are at the mercy of the adjudicating officer.  You see, an I-601 waiver is a discretionary relief.  That is, the Attorney General has the total discretion whether or not to grant the relief.  You may not appeal such denial and no court has jurisdiction to hear your appeal.  As such, you are at the mercy of the adjudicating officer.  If there is emergency reason, your immigration attorney may request for expedite approval, but it will also be a request.  <br>  <br>  Because I-601 waiver is extremely difficult to obtain, and you must meet strict criteria in which you must show that the denial would be an extreme hardship to the U.S. citizen and Perm. residence spouses, children, parents, or other family members, you should contact an immigration attorney.  Further, the application process is different from each U.S. Consular Office and the Immigration Court.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Steven Pham|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	It depends on the office where it's filed.  People who have gone through the process generally say "about 6 months."<br>  <br>  It's NOT incredibly difficult to get approval.  It's not easy either.  The I-601 process should always be done with the assistance of a good, experienced immigration attorney.  The attorney should conduct a comprehensive interview with both you and your spouse.<br>  <br>  Use an attorney who is a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ailalawyer.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ailalawyer.org</a>
e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	You won't do time in juvy, that's for sure.  You're 18 now, that means hard time for drug crimes.  Your mom can call the police and have you arrested.

Your parents don't have to get you a lawyer - they can let the public defender handle it.<br>  <br>  They can kick you out, too.<br>  <br>  I doubt that will happen just yet.  I think they'll just try to convince you to quit.  From there, if you can't quit, rehab is an option.  If that's still not helping they can get tough on you - call the cops & such.  If you get arrested and convicted of a drug crime, you don't qualify for financial aid for college.  You will have to put down this information on college apps, job apps, credit apps.  Yes it can make it harder to get a car or house or credit card - you'll at the very least end up with a super high interest rate.<br>  <br>  You need to decide whether the consequences are worth the temporary fun of getting high.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	They could report you and let the cops search your room.

Re9Pdfxbaa	I agree. The smoking ban (UK) was argued on the basis of Bar Staff in pubs were "forced" to work in an unsafe environment due to "having" to breathe in smoke.(Passive smoking) Then all the non-smokers lobby spouted there angst > "Why should we have to sit in a pub filled with smoke" ? WELL, WHERE ARE THE NON-SMOKERS ??? you don't see them in the pubs now because hundreds of pubs are shutting down on a weekly basis since the smoking ban. I agree with you. <br>  I respect non smokers I wont even smoke in my own house if my friend, who cant stand smoke, visits. Its a matter of respecting others. Publicans should have been allowed some discretion on this.

The President probably dislikes the racist rhetoric just as much as we do.<br>  <br>  I suspect this is because SOME of the african americans who voted for him have what I call a victim mentality. They blame all their ills on the fact that they are black...therefore must have been victimized by whites and that being victimized is the cause of their lack of success. President Obama is absolute proof that being black is no excuse for failure or laziness or not getting an education or not treating your family right or not supporting your children. He is the poster boy for what a black man can achieve....and he has been black all his life too.|`|TEsq9K54aa	Apparently NOT!  Don't you know by now that society views racism as the biggest sin of all?

Wouldn't that be racist if you did not? Blacks have griped about just about every other president we have had and nobody even mentioned the word racist. The word has no color in it, only the people who bring it up. <br>  The important thing to remember is that Obama is the President of the United States and we(the citizens) elected him to the office. If we elected him because he is black and not an intelligent, capable leader, then we made a big mistake.<br>  He is eligible for any and all criticism that he earns. He wanted to be president and he chose to run. It is up to him to do what he can do. <br>  If there is more trouble and he has no working solutions, the people and the press will turn on him, black or white.|`|hmLo323Uaa	You absolutely have the explicit right to criticize ANY elected official within the bounds of legality.

If they paid you back, great, they suck but at least you got your money back without spending way more than a $100 to get it.  If they don't pay you back, then you still know they suck and you shouldn't waste your time over $100 to deal with idiots.  Either way, you never allow them near enough to your money again to scam you.
0jmVA50Jaa	It is not ok to use that old , old term.    No one should do that.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	No.See this is a bit tricky. Black people can use it but if everyone else uses it they are instantly labeled racists. This is not right. Either everyone can say it or nobody can.

And?|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	How is that a partisan issue? And why do you care?|`|S3ktbzDNaa	Word usage and offense gets kind of complicated. Usage of a term by those who mean offense makes the term offensive. Usage of the same term by those who are it's target reclaims the term. One pretty successful example is the word "queer". It literally means strange. It was used for a long time to refer to homosexuals as strange, intending offense. Homosexuals started using it to refer to themselves. Now, in a context where offense is not intended, many homosexuals won't take offense. It's been reclaimed.<br>  <br>  The 'N' word has a much longer and more offensive history. If it is ever successfully reclaimed, then you and I can start to use it, so long as we don't intend any offense. I don't think that will happen any time soon.<br>  <br>  You can use it in the course of discussion of the word, of course. If it weren't for the fact that Yahoo's automatic filters aren't too bright, I would have used it in this post. However and use directed at a person or group of people (as opposed to referring to the word itself) by me or anyone else who is white would be highly offensive because of the history of the word.<br>  <br>  BTW, depending on the context, black people using the word can be just as offensive.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Liberal here...I have always thought that if the African American community wanted that word erased from the English language then they damn well should stop using it themselves.<br>  <br>  I still use the word...but have never directed it's usage towards a black person. You think black people get upset having that word directed at them?...you should try to tag a white person with that label. Lots of lazy, no good, ignorant and worthless white trash people in America are quite derserving of the label...mostly all white Republicans living in the Southern States. <br>  <br>  The word, to me, indicates a specific stereotype that is not limited to being used only against specific black people.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Depends on how you use the N word . Im white surrounded by blacks get along great with them . Sometime they call me the N word and sometimes i call them the N word and we all laugh and carry on . But i have seen whites try to use the word but they use it to put an entire race down not just one individual . Very hard to explain kind of like talking a different language where the word sounds the same but has a totally different meaning and used improperly offends people|`|NszF4opeaa	Liberals, ugh.<br>  <br>  Here in Hawaii, white people are outcasts. We call them 'haoles'. So are blacks, which we call 'popolos'. Asians and Pacific islanders are pretty much the norm here. In different countries they have names for Americans and such, like we've developed different names for different races. Why one race gets more precedence over another is beyond me.<br>  It should only be offensive if someone says it in an offensive way, such as "you f***ing haole". Most locals here use it as a reference like "look at that haole over there". Then we all know who they're talking about. It's not meant to be offensive. But some people are too sensitive, boo-hoo.|`|F4E48G3Taa	Yes it is.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Your theories are not supported by facts.|`|AA10761951	When Afro-Americans call each other N*ggers, they don't mean it in a bad way.|`|5fLEd3o5aa	All liberals don't have that mind set and why are you so bitter?|`|DIPHEZfHaa	It's never okay to use the "N" word, but it takes one to know one.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Which looks more like a human being: a chimp, or a gibbon?<br>  <br>  My money is on the chimp.|`|pzaAIlCBaa	Yes, only us ******* can say ******.|`|f9crUDTwaa	No ..

In my observation, it is perfectly acceptable for blacks to use that term to one of their own...but not acceptable for a white person to use it when referring to blacks. This is no different that any other "nickname" type of thing. I don't mind being referred to as a honky by another white person, but would probably take some offense if called that by a black person.|`|tvNkizDraa	Only in face-to-face interactions, on the internet NO.

No income tax due, if you don't earn any dollars. Then we'd no longer be supporting loads of parasitical govt programs.<br>  <br>       Unfortunately, neither idea is workable.

Under normal circumstances, the ability to issue debt is necessary to raise funds for national defense during war, and to support the government during times of economic downturns when the tax base is otherwise diminishing.  As for our economy suffering, you have seen nothing compared to the ruin that would follow repudiation of the debt.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	You can't "repudiate the debt" because you don't make the spending decisions.

For example, could pacifist refuse to pay for military spending?  Could vegans refuse to pay for farm subsidies that support cattle farmers?<br>   <br>  <br>  Almost every spending decision is opposed by somebody in almost every bill.

If a person is a thief you cannot be around them without knowing that the moment the opportunity occurs they are going to steal something from you.  You have to be alert to every move they make, and on guard all the time.

The difference really, is that the grand jury will look at everything that's available as evidence, and confirm whether or not you should be brought to trial.  The grand jury can't convict you - they can only say "trial" or "no trial".<br>  <br>  If they decide you should go to trial, then you'd start the whole criminal proceedings from the beginning.  If there wasn't enough evidence for the judge to proceed with a trial, it's not likely that the grand jury will have a different opinion.|`|8hAhmlJjaa	The prosecutor takes a case to the grand jury when he is unsure if he has a case or not.  The grand jury hears the evidence and decides whether or not to issue an indictment.  An indictment means that the grand jury felt there was enough evidence of a crime to have the case go to a full trial.

iWLeHnlnaa	That is a very good question! One thing is freedom of speech, another is when that speech is focused on creating and spreading hate. With immigration issues today, it has gotten worst.

Whether they be the Black Panthers, KKK, Italian Americans, or even the Communist party to name but a few.  They are all equal in this country.  As much as they may aggravate me, I will fight to the death their right to that free speech.|`|AA11634870	Many years ago I was in a large city and visited a friend in his suburb next to this city. On that weekend a neo-nazi march was planned. When I saw my friend he wanted to go and his mom a concentration camp survivor complained "you boys will just start trouble" he was a member of the JDL (Jewish Defense League) at that time. We went and yelled and cursed them, standing next to us was a French newsman and photographer and camera crew. He ask us if we hated them and if we lived in this town, my friend said yes. He explained that the town had decided to ignore it and not incite the many Jewish people there. The Frenchman said "this would never happen in France, we fought a war over this" . This happened many years ago in Skokie Illinois a suburb of Chicago.<br>  I wish to add one comment of my own, yes I believe in freedom of speech but the ideals that a country goes to war over must never ever be surrendered to a mere concept. Without substance truth is merely a word. When men and women of good faith fight for the lives or the freedom to just live, we must not dishonor those who gave their lives for the unfortunate. I have killed vietcong under orders as a solder but I always wanted to kill those who committed genocide.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	Although most western countries have democratic beliefs, no country is a TRUE democracy, where by all speeches are tolerated.  That also applies to the U.S.  Most countries, such as France and the U.K., are not actually a democratic country; but rather, a socialistic state.  Therefore, the freedom of speech is much more restricted, as it may incite violence.<br>  <br>  The U.S. does not curtail the freedom of speech, so long as it does not incite violence.  As such, people are free to hold and inspire their peronal and plitical beliefs.  However, they cannot incite violence.  For example, a person can say, "I believe and support Nazism," but cannot say or advocate, "Because of such believe, you should Kill ...... and lets make plans to do so."  Doing so would incite violence and cause disobedience.  The same can be said about fighting words, such as "F_ _ _ You."  As such, you can call a cop stupid (though it is not a good idea to do it in the officer's presence), but you cannot say "F U."  In doing so, you can be arrested for disorderly conduct and/or incitment of violence.  <br>  <br>  So, there is a limit to free speech, and aspounding beliefs, however distasteful it may be, is not against the law.

If they can start censoring one group of people that will get the ball rolling.  The majority of people hate Nazis.

All men and women are created equal here, and we all have the right to free speech, no matter how stupid our words may be.  It has to be so for everybody.

Their presence at the recent oil refinery demonstrations proved that. Men had the right to check whether they had been unfairly barred from those positions, but they used the platform to whip up jingoism.  None of those men objected to Global rules of employment when they made a mint working in Germany, Saudi, Dubai etc. in better times!

Because the major diseases and cancer would be found and treated before major surgery's and therapy's were required. My mom is a perfect example of what preventative care can catch... A few years back she was diagnosed with cancer, but because she saw the doctor regularly they caught it in it's early stages, she is cancer free and has been for over 5 years now and didn't not have to endure years of chemo or radiation that insurance would have had to help pay... then a year or so ago the doctors found out she has diabetes... again, found before it got out of control... it was caught early enough that she can control it with diet and excersize, meaning that insurance does not need to pay for insulan (since she does not need it).... is people would realize this than health care costs in this country would lower significantly.|`|KOecCLjLaa	The U.S. model is based upon pushing drugs and medications without much care to the people taking them.

Be prepared to reduce everything you do for him down to the bare minimum and only increase it as he plays by your requirements.  Until he is paying the rent, it's your rules and you rule.  Sounds like he has lost (or never had) a lot of respect for you.|`|CIyuis2haa	Age of consent in the United States refers to the age where a person can give legally give consent to having sexual intercourse. Under that age, a person does not have that capacity and if you have sex with them it is considered rape and you can be convicted of rape, even if the person tells you they are over the age of consent.|`|fWP8aBpsaa	In addition to what Mickey T and Why? pointed out, it is worth noting that from a legal point of view, only he is legally capable of consenting to sex once he personally is above 16.  <br>  <br>  That is, if his girl friend is below 16 he can technically be charged with rape.  This is unusual when the age gap is small, but can happen if, for example, the girl's parents push the issue.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	sounds like a brat to me---cops are getting tougher on parents for underage drinking, --good for you, and about the sleepovers-good for you----if you allow it and somehow he gets a STD, gets her pregnant, he'll probably put it back on you and say you should of not let him do it.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	it's the age of consent to have sex. doesn't entitle him to anything but sexual activity. no overnights, no drinking, just sex within a reasonable age range|`|a6k5WZxGaa	Sadly no.

He still can't legally drink, and you still have legal jurisdiction over where he goes and what he does.<br>  <br>  When he turns 18 he can legally do whatever he wants (except drinking alcohol, which I personally think doesn't make much sense), but if he's still living with you, there's kind of an implied contract there--he's not legally required to follow your rules, but neither are you legally required to provide him with free housing at that point. So you two can work it out. :)|`|g7M1DxFCaa	In the UK:  The age of consent (16) relates only to sex.  The age of becoming an adult is 18.  The age of criminal responsibility is 12. The age for drinking alcohol in the home is 5 WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE PARENT/GUARDIAN although it's illegal to buy it under the age of 18.  As previously said though, it's your house and he should respect that or consider finding somewhere else to live.  Your house and you're the boss.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The age limit for drinking in the home is 5 because there's nothing wrong with a child drinking a small amount of alcohol with a meal, normally diluted.  This is quite normal family behaviour throughout Europe.|`|shtP63traa	He is incorrect.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	no it's the age where you can be said to understand what you are agreeing to and you don't need the permission of an older person, tell him that while he's in your house he follows your rules....otherwise he'll have to leave|`|3qLIRorjaa	To me, the legal age of consent is when the child reaches adulthood, 18 in the UK.<br>  <br>  Until then, although sex is legal at 16, he is still under your care until he's 18.|`|8gaPElwxaa	Age of consent means that you are old enough to take the consequences for all of your actions|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Is he out on his own?<br>  You have the money--you make the rules.<br>  Or tough love and have him move out.

kPG2g4iSaa	Your understanding the "most people hated the rating while they were in" is quite correct. However, a lot of those that hated it while they were in, including yours truly, now look back on our service with great fondness. Basically, we didn't know how good we had it. We failed to recognize the value of doing a tough job with some of the highest quality and dedicated professionals you would ever want to meet. Don't get me wrong. You *will* work hard and work long hours. But, you have some of the best advancement opportunities and reenlistment bonuses in the military. See the first link and note any rating that ends with "-N" is a nuke.<br>  <br>  No, it's definitely not a bad job. Yes, there will be times that you think it sucks and will wish you had never raised your right hand. I did. But the training you will get (that won't cost you anything) is some of the best available anywhere in the world.<br>  <br>  Just don't screw up your chances by getting multiple speeding tickets, getting popped on a piss test, goofing off when you should be studying, etc. Nuclear Power School is tough, no doubt about it. The people who don't make it, though, get dropped because of lack of discipline (see list of ways to get dropped above). If the Navy lets you into its nuke program, you have the brains. The only question is: Are you disciplined and mature enough?<br>  <br>  Knowing what I know now, I would do it again in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  On an SSBN (Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarine) you will be on the Blue crew or the Gold crew. You will do a 60 day patrol then the boat will return to port. For the next 30 days, your crew and the oncoming crew will "refit", or prepare the boat for the next deterrant patrol. For the 60 days the other crew in on the boat, 30 days will be dedicated to training, going to schools, etc. The other 30 days will be R&R. This is the time that you will be able to go on leave, and your working hours will be greatly reduced. When your boat returns, you will assist the other crew in preparing the boat for the next patrol. Then you will do another 60 day patrol, completing the cycle.<br>  <br>  In a 1.5 to two year time span, other nuclear ships will be deployed overseas for a single six to eight month period. 10% to 20% of the days deployed will likely be spent in liberty ports. Liberty port visits typically last three to five days. For the remainder of that period, your ship will be in and out of port about 50 - 50. At sea periods can be up to a month long and as short as two or three days long. For some real world examples of in port and at sea times, follow the second link to any SSN or CVN ship and if you can decipher the naval gobbldygook, you'll have the best possible idea of in port/at sea time.<br>  <br>  As a nuke, you will be the first on, and the last off. As an example, when I was aboard the USS Enterprise, we (nukes) had to go into an at sea schedule on a Saturday if the ship was pulling out on Monday. When we pulled in, we typically got off the ship eight hours after everybody else. Nimitz class carriers likely won't be as bad because they only have two reactors each to start up and shut down - Enterprise has eight reactors.<br>  <br>  Follow the third link to find a blog of sorts populated with stories mostly from former Enterprise nukes. The best stories and entries are nearer the end. This site will give you the best conceivable insight into what is is to be a former navy nuke that can serve as an effective proxy of what is was like for the authors *as* nukes.|`|8om6eMvnaa	Nuclear Power is not a rating, it is a field.<br>  There are three ratings in the nuclear field which are ET, EM, and MM.<br>  Of those there are 4 basic NECs, or Naval Enlistment Classificattion Codes.  These designate the ratings as a Reactor Operator for ETs, Electrical Operator for EMs, Mechanical Operators for most MMs, and Engineering Laboratory Technicians (ELTs) for some MMs.<br>  <br>  As a nuke you will not be at sea any more or any less than any of the non-nuclear power ratings on the same ship.  You will be operating and maintaining the propulsion plant.  The basic job description is to push the ship through the water.  The sailor steering the ship, the ones manning the weapons systems and the Commanding Officer will spend just as much time as you will at sea.<br>  <br>  As was said already, Nukes are the first onboard to prepare for an underway and the last to leave when back in port.  In general you will work more hours both at sea and in port than your non-nuclear shipmates.  And if you're on a carrier, there are a lot of smaller ships that are at sea with you.<br>  <br>  I got out after my first enlistment.  I'm glad I did.  I'm also glad I did it and knowing what I know now if I had it to do over I would.  It was great training and experience that has sustained me with very good employment since I got out.  No sugar coating it, the job sucked a lot of the times, especially during ORSE work-ups.  It has its rewards, but they are subtle and only noticable in hind-sight.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	It's a hard job, long hours, and the first sea tour is long.<br>  It's also about the only career track where an enlistee can become Chief in eight years.<br>  Being part of an elite group is never easy.|`|4uike3ARaa	It can be a great job. Going into the nuke program pretty much insures you're going to be attending various schools for the next two years. During that time, you can alter the odds towards having a bit more fun by volunteering for subs. More pay, less time at sea, overall. Unlike carriers, our balllistic missile subs go on set deployments. Stay away from the carrier navy, if you can manage it.<br>  Getting out of the nuke program, once you've signed the contract, is (almost) impossible. <br>  I managed to get one recruit out of it, but it took months, about an inch of paperwork, and the agreement of the Boot Camp Commander AND the Admiral at the Naval Training Center. His was an extremely special case - he wanted to be a SEAL, his father was a Senior Chief in SEALs, he was qualified to go to SEAL training, and his recruiter said, "Hey, if you want regular MM, you can't go for six months. But if you agree to go into nuke MM, you can ship tomorrow and get out of the program in boot camp." <br>  If you haven't already raised your hand and taken the oath, you can maybe persuade your recruiter to change the contract. Especially if you call it a 'deal-breaker.'

hOIBHhBraa	Your parents only want what is best for you, that is obvious, anyone that loves you does. However, following your dreams and the things that you want to do is a part of life. You need to go out there and trip a few times, make your own experiences and mistakes even. This is what makes people grow and become the great people that they become someday. If being a navy seal is your calling, then do it because if you don't, you going to regret it for the rest of your life. My husband wanted to join the marines back in 2006 when I was pregnant with our first child and I was horrified so he didn't join. 2009 comes around and the marine "calling" comes back to him. There's certain things that you can't take away from people. Your parents love you and eventually they'll understand that you had to do this for you.

You cannot pick the best, because not all have the same mission.<br>  <br>  The Navy's mission is naval meaning the ocean and lakes.

There main job is just to get uo to land and fight the enemy. and they do that great.<br>  <br>  Marines are similar to the army, but are not TOO reliable on helicopters although they use them. Marines are more like Navy infantry. Marines travel by sea and fight on islands mainly but they also fight on land. they are the best at amphibious landings.<br>  <br>  the Air force is a devoted air power. They have all the transport Air crafts, spece,, and fighter planes. Yes the Navy has fighters but the navy also has to focus on the SEA as the Air Force is more devoted to the sky and beyond. they are the best at that.<br>  <br>  and the COAST GUARD is a great too.

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	There are to many people who already believe that Marijuana is a drug and should never be used or you'll die. Therefore there will always be a bigger following for those who smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol since its the "Legal" alternative. People have been brainwashed by the government for far to many years about Marijuana that is would be to late to reverse the effect set in most minds.<br>  <br>  As for them not being able to control people behind the wheel who are high, that is false. Yes they have breathalyzers, although a police-officer can regulate those that are high, whether it be from pot or cocaine. Its called "Driving under the influence of a uncontrolled substance" which relates to drugs and narcotics. I say narcotics, because many people think narcotics are the same as drugs, they are not. Heroine, Coke, and Meth are considered Narcotics, while Cannabis is not.<br>  <br>  If a cop determines you are high, you will be charged the same as if you were driving under the influence of alcohol. If the cop does not determine you are under the influence of a drug / narcotic, then that probably means you were good enough to drive int he first place whether you were on something or not. If a cop cant tell your high then your ok to drive in my opinion because that means you passed your tests they gave you. If you can follow a finger, a light, or do the obstacles they have you do,t hen you can follow the road.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	not for me|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Well, I know a lot of people who would prefer pot over alcohol, considering that pot doesn't make you physically sick the way alcohol does.<br>  The biggest concern that I and the people I know have about pot, is how we're going to be able to control people who get behind the wheel and drive while under the influence of it.  With alcohol, they have breathalyzer tests, but they don't have anything as of yet to test for marijuana.<br>  I'm not against the legalization of marijuana, but I think we need to have a way to handle the people who will inevitably use it irresponsibly in place before we legalize it.

California for example. <br>  <br>  It's never a good idea to transfer a firearm to someone who's obviously going to use it for some illegal purpose. You could and probably should be held liable.

Not to mention all the other energy fluctuations during the oil presidency. ) <br>  3. Bush's lack of oversight in Wall Street.<br>  4. Super Deficit Spending for Wars with nothing to show for it.

Economy would have been relatively strong anyway since Clinton had cut capital gains taxes and initiated other reforms, but Greenspan fueled the fire.     Greenspan raised rates in '99-'00 and that popped the NASDAQ bubble - but Greenspan didn't let the correction last as long as he should have, and cut rates right away.  He then kept the rates low, in fact cutting further, after 9/11.  All the artificially cheap credit fueled more asset bubbles - namely commodities and housing.   They were popped by the rate hikes from '04-'07.   And now the govt is trying to solve the problem of popped credit bubbles by pumping more fake credit into the system.<br>  <br>  There's always greed.     Only when there's easy credit does it form bubbles.

Others had their payments become to high (ARM) as the fed raised interest rates to control inflation. <br>  <br>  After months of foreclosures killing the housing market, the financial losses on the over speculated houses placed many major financial institutions in grave danger of going bankrupt.<br>  <br>  This dried up bank loaning capital, causing, companies to halt expansion due to lack of available capital. <br>  <br>  This caused the major job slowdown. <br>  <br>  This caused a psychology of the market fear of significant downturn, consumer spending plummets. <br>  <br>  This worsened the business profitability outlook, major manufacturers now face major trouble (GM, Ford, Chrysler)<br>  <br>  The condition became self perpetuating in this manner.<br>  <br>  Democrats took office and continue to badmouth the economic outlook.<br>  <br>  Psychology of the market remains in a death spiral with economic conditions.<br>  <br>  What caused housing over speculation.

The headteacher and deputy because the success or failure of the school depends on the personal strength and professional capabilities of these two. <br>  2.

One day, I came across a black kid who said a curse word a little too loud.  He was not cursing at anyone, not being threatening or anything, it just came out like everyday speech.<br>  <br>  I called him on it, telling him that it was a family place and that he couldn't be cursing like that.  He nodded his head yes, and said "mmm hmmm."<br>  <br>  All of a sudden a police officer (officers were sent to work with us on weekends) comes up from behind me and yells at the kid that he needs to say yes sir to us.  The officer surprised both of us, and so the kid was too suprised by what just happened to say anything.  So the officer throws him down to the ground and arrests him for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest!<br>  <br>  We go to court, and that police officer finds two other officers to corroborate his story that the kid tried to attack him, even though those two other officers weren't there.  Imagine what would have happened to the kid had I not been there to tell the truth.  He would have been convicted and tossed in jail, and then he never would be able to get a job with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest on his record.<br>  <br>  He would have had to steal just to survive, because he has to eat.  That is just one example, but those officers did that kind of bullsh*t all the time.  And the judge would not always side with the truth; a lot of black and Hispanic kids got screwed over because of this kind of thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And you guys don't know, because you refuse to accept the truth.  You think racism is gone, that it doesn't matter now because we have a black president.  Even the fact that you bring up he is half black shows your racism.<br>  <br>  The fact that he is half black is true, but it is how you bring it up that matters.  You bring it up because you believe that black people voted for him on his race; that they aren't intelligent enough to vote on the issues.  You are trying to use it to hurt black people emotionally, trying to say they didn't get what they wanted because Obama is not fully black.  They did get what they wanted, which was someone other than a person who would follow Bush to a T.  That is what they wanted, and that is what they got.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eric Holder is correct.  The American people are not cowards because they won't deal with it, but because they still hide themselves from the truth.  White culture is willing to accept black people that accept white culture as their own (like Bill Cosby and Colin Powell), and those black people should be celebrated for having succeeded.  But those black people who succeed in their own culture are regarded as the downfall of society, morally bankrupt, etc.<br>  <br>  It is not enough to accept black people on their skin color and their ability to survive and thrive in white culture.  That is part of it, but not nearly all of it.  Their culture must be accepted.

aR1OiJ7Waa	USA?    Here is the breakdown:    Basic Pay: $1588  Housing: free for enlisted.  If you're married it depends on zip code.  (90210 is $2000 a month)  Sustenance: $300  Miscellaneous entitlements: $400    If you are deployed:  No taxes  Hazard Pay : $225  Hardship pay: $100  Family Separation Pay (if married or have kids): $250  Per Diem: $90    Ask a recruiter what language and Infantry bonuses are available.  As of last year it was $20,000 and 40,000 respectively.  There is also special language monthly pay if it is a requirement of the job.      For the Army you can stats as an E-2 (Private) if you recruit a friend, an E-3 (private first class) if you recruit two, were an Eagle Scout, or did JROTC or have an A.A. Degree, or start as an E-4 (Specialist) if you have a college degree.  With the degree you can also apply for an OCS contract.  All of the above will increase your pay.      If youre in Army Infantry, you can expect to be an E-5 (Sergeant) in less than 5 years.  That is a major pay increase from Private.      Also, it should be noted, that as an enlisted Soldier, you don't have many expenses.  So your pay is mostly disposable (or savable).  And in addition to all the 3-day weekends you will get (minus weeks in the field), you get 30-days paid vacation a year.  Free medical and dental as well.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	If I can remember its way more than any of us earned, maybe except for deployment, but in garrison you collect around 1500 a month after taxes and have no real expenses, free housing and chow.  At this time its easier to get to E-5 in 3 years in the army than not to, and at that point you can bring in around 2100 a month after taxes, or more if you live off post with BAH, but the extra expenses about equal out.  As far as bilingual if you don't need it your job, i.e. you speak spanish and aren't in a spanish speaking country you don't get anything.|`|UDak8Zm1aa	Look you don't come to the military to make money, we have medical, dental, vision, hearing benefits, we also have a free fitness program, you can travel all over the world, get free lawyer council, the list goes on man.|`|5no3MzSPaa	i have heard it is 20k for reserves a year and up to 80k full time. where i heard this i cant remeber probly a pamphlet.|`|N10yPTPnaa	Depends on if you're enlisting or commissioning.    Just type in "army paychart" on google. The pay is pretty much the same for all branches.    Payday is on the 1st and 15th of every month.|`|VPsVyI6Daa	Military pay, no matter the job and no matter the branch is based on a lot of "do yous?"  For instance:  Are you married or do you have children? If you have "dependents" as they are called, than your base pay usually doubles.  Rank also determines pay. Entry level without dependents is going to be barely anything (but they are providing you with food and a barracks room). As your rank increases your pay increases.  You also get allowances for: being outside the Continental US, being deployed, having a dangerous rate, being in a war zone, being away from your family, etc...  Allowances are also awarded on whether or not you live off base (amount of money received depends on the living expenses of the area). All in all, depending on how many of these you qualify for, you could be bringing in some good dough - it all adds up!  But if you're single, just joining - don't expect much. Before I married my husband he was bringing in about 600 a month entry level (Full time active duty navy corpsman). Now, as a Petty Officer 3rd class, with dependents living off base - it's about 2600 a month.|`|3xTNOevjaa	They're usually between 1k-2k a month.

E9XL5x3Paa	Not unless George W. Bush is a Jew.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Iraq War did have an effect on the economy. In fact, every single problem we have was either created or intensified by the Iraq War.<br>  <br>  Bush wanted to fight the war, but not raise the funds (taxes) to pay for it. So he had to borrow the money from other countries. They were willing to let him have it, but at a rather high interest rate.<br>  <br>  What did that matter to Bush? This war was going to be over in 6 months anyway, right? Only it wasn't; we are about to enter our 6th year there, well past the 6 months envisioned by Bush.<br>  <br>  Bush had to go back and keep borrowing more. But as he kept borrowing, the other countries began to grow concerned that he could not pay back these amounts. They were still willing to take the chance, but wanted to raise interest rates even higher to account for the risk of lending to someone who was borrowing so much. What could Bush do? He was committed to both the war and low taxes, so he took the money.<br>  <br>  He borrowed so much that he turned the $4 trillion National Debt he inherited from Clinton into nearly $11 trillion. In 8 years, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what all 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.<br>  <br>  Such a huge rise in the National Debt scared investors away from backing the dollar, which dropped to its 16 year low. Incidentally, anyone remember who was in charge 16 years ago? That's right, George H.W. Bush. But I digress.<br>  <br>  A currency is the backbone of a Capitalist economy, so when the dollar faltered so did the economy. Businesses had to use more dollars to make the same products. Oil is also measured in dollars; so with the drop in the value of the dollar, it took more of them to equal the same barrel of oil. That meant higher gas prices. And the combination of higher cost of production, as well as higher cost of shipping and transporation, forced businesses to raise their prices at the stores.<br>  <br>  They also had to cut expenses, and the biggest expense they cut was payroll; in other words, they laid off employees.<br>  <br>  But employees are also consumers. With the job losses and higher prices, they had to cut their spending. There's your problem with Middle Class spending, the biggest driver of our economy.<br>  <br>  With less sales being made, and by extension less profit, businesses had to cut even more jobs. There's your problem in the job market.<br>  <br>  With less profit coming in as well, investors began to stop investing in businesses. If you were an investor, would you invest in a company barely making a profit? How about one making an out-and-out loss? There's the problem in the Stock Market.<br>  <br>  Employees are also bank lendees. When they lost their jobs and their savings, they started defaulting on their loans all at the same time. Home loans, mortgages, student loans, car loans; they all started defaulting at the same time. There's your problem in the financial sector, the real estate market, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the auto industry.<br>  <br>  Every single problem we have was either created by how Bush handled paying for the Iraq War, or was exascerbated by how Bush handled paying for the Iraq War.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	No.<br>  <br>  Reported.|`|2b7VqUXXaa	No, they most certainly are not to blame.

He wants to give borrowers and lenders money that made very bad choices and the rest of the nation gets to pay for it.

c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Yes - then it was overturned. <br>  <br>  Google it<br>  <br>  Impeachment and trial in the Senate<br>  Main article: Impeachment of Bill Clinton<br>  The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the mid-term elections. Though the mid-term elections held in November 1998 were at the 6-year point in an 8-year presidency (a time in the electoral cycle where the party holding the White House usually loses Congressional seats) the Democratic Party gained several seats.[19] To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame duck session in December 1998.<br>  <br>   <br>  The impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presiding.While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to Monica Lewinsky during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000)[48] brought by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.[49] The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.<br>  <br>  The Senate concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty-five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty-five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50–50.[|`|LiRcparVaa	yes but it is impeached, he was impeached by congress, then when the impeachment was sent to the senate for action, none was taken, so he basically wasn't punished|`|8T1eMJAHaa	Yes he was But he was not thrown out of office that would have taken guts on the part of the Senate which they did not have.|`|AA11119186	Yes he was.|`|UdERC367aa	Yes.|`|AA12148387	Yes|`|lBFVy8uUaa	think so..|`|LzPhdri5aa	Yup.

Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  We have good alternatives. Life without parole is on the books in 48 states. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	No, I don't.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	No its humane the killers and baby rapers being put to death didnt blink an eye when they were raping and slaughtering others!DON'T DO THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Not inhumane  but, due to the number of innocent wrongfully executed and the expense of executing someone I have become more anti death penalty.<br>  <br>  For exapmlpe it cost Florida tax payers over 5 million dollars to kill Bundy, let the little creeps sit in prison getting beat up on a daily basis for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/accueil/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/ac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/</a>|`|um87XJvmaa	No, I don't think a needle in the arm is inhumane, but there are people on death row who are not guilty of the crime that they were charged with.

2G8lOPN8aa	If it were my child I would have her do the recorded interview because I think it is important to have sufficient evidence to secure a conviction on this pedophile so that he doesn't get off on the charge.  It's also important for the girl to understand that the law is on her side and there to protect her--she will see that justice is served to protect the innocent.    Parents can remain with the minor during the interview--and can have an attorney present as well.  Her recorded testimony can be used in court and may exempt her from needing to testify live in court.    If there were someone earlier who had been preyed upon by this man--had they come forward to notify police and provide sufficient evidence--he would not have been free to pursue the 13 year old girl in question.     However, I do not think that the minor can be mandated to give a recorded testimony. I would consult an attorney.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	So, you don't want to protect the child from the pedophile...Why?|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	yes the parents can say no|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	She probably doesn't have to if the parents say no. however if it were my kid I would want her/him to speak with the cops.

However, while it is understood why you don't want to do it you really do have to think about others your age who may come into contact with this individual as well. Ask yourself if you really want this to happen and if what you have to say in the recorded statement can be of assistance in preventing this from happening to anyone else in the future. Please give the request for the recorded interview serious thought and do what is right to keep this person away from others like yourself.|`|6oddWhmBaa	you dont have to if you dont want to  its all in your human rights  :)|`|AA10032971	You can refuse. If I were the child, I would respond to a police interview about a pedophile. My parents would have to be present as well. Otherwise, I wouldn't do it. Also, it is important in helping to take the pedophile off of the street and place him or her behind bars. Remember this, What shall we then say to these things? If GOD be for us, WHO can be against us? - Romans 8:31  The Lord daily loadeth us with BENEFITS, even the GOD of our salvation. Selah. - Psalm 68:19  I wish you much success and peace. God Bless.|`|Y5xD5kOOaa	It is very scary I can imagine for you and I am sure you just don't want to think about it anymore.  Have your parents ask the investigators why they still need more from you and have them explain how you are feeling.  They do need your help in order to put the pedophile behind bars and keep them there.  You don't have to do it and your parents can say no, but maybe first find out what they need and see if they can do it in your home again instead of the station which is more scary for you.  My thoughts are with you and I hate that anyone has to go through something like this.  Keep open conversations with your parents so that they can help you deal with this over your teen years!|`|KmH3AsbZaa	No you dont  have to do anything that isnt against the law. You can just decide to not go. Then again why would you? i can understand if you have personal reasons to not want to have that person behind bars but is that whats best for them or you? I think thats what you should really be worrying about. Whats best for you in the long run.  Good Luck i mean it.    P.s. if you ever need anyone to talk to im here.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Yes you can say no and so can the parents, but if you are needed for the investigation then all they have to do is get you legally supeanid to court and then by law you have to come and answer their questions. I actually went through this myself so i know you probably just dont want to talk about what happened but you really could give them information that could save someone from this pedophile. good luck.

Once they are citizens then they will have full access to every program there is including our medical facilities (not that they don't cost us billions already) and the costs for our medical will skyrocket.<br>  <br>  4.

3FoU68xuaa	Well it will depend on the laws of the state you're in because it's different in each state..Ok considering that you are a minor and that it was a small amount moneys worth, that works out in your favor immensely! You will get off lightly, no doubt. I can almost guarantee no possibility of any sort of jail time! i too have been arrested for shoplifting MORE THAN ONCE and actually, they are light on you the first time, especially since you are underage. They almost for sure wont give you jail time since it's your first time. They will either make you take a diversion/prevention class and/or a certain number of hours of community service. (I don't know how it works in your state, but for me, when I took the class, they expunge the whole thing off your record so you wont have a record after taking the class!) On top of those things (which it will likely be one or the other, not both) you will also probably be required to pay a fine, or even restitution to the store from which you stole. If you get caught next time though, then you might face a little jail time but even then it'd be a bit unlikely!<br>  <br>  Also, although being put on probation is always a possibility, I wouldn't consider it to be a likely outcome, mostly because that is kind of a heavy penalty for a first-timer, and is usually reserved for 2nd time offenses, and is used more as an alternative to facing jail time. Do keep in mind that it's always a possibility though, and they will pretty much ALWAYS opt to give you probation before you'd ever get jail time!|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	You most likely will not go to jail if what you are saying is the truth, you don't have a record already, and you don't do anything stupid again.  It will go on your record for sure.  Remember the difference between being sorry for the hurt and damage you have caused (which I believe you understand), and simply being sorry you got caught.|`|sO8imc8Waa	Maybe community service or a fine? Maybe neither, but it will go on your record and if it happens again then you will face some consequences. Jail is not the case. You have to be 18 to go to jail. I just hope you will never do something like that again! Remember, you are ripping hard working people off. How would you feel if someone stole something from you?|`|kbGOMwi7aa	dont apologize to your mom|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	You will not go to jail - <br>  <br>  You will pay a fine and restitution to the store even tho they got everything back.<br>  You will probably be put on probation. <br>  <br>  My sister's friend got caught stealing false eyelashes.  My sister had no idea this was going on (so she says) and my mom had to pick her up from the store.  They both had to pay 101.99  - 100 was the fine and 1.99 was the price of the eyelashes.  So the store made out like a bandit, because after they caught the girls the taped up the eyelash package and put it back out on the shelf.  So the store made 205.97 on a 1.99 item.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Children do not get sent to jail.  You could end up in Juvenile detention if you keep doing stupid things, but basically the juvenile justice system is set up to educate the child and to prevent the necessity of taking them out of the parent's home.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, relax, you will probably be placed on probation for about 6 months, and have to do some community service, maybe take a class on theft education.<br>  <br>  You will have to pay for the stuff unless the store got it back.<br>  <br>  After you become an adult if you don't get any charges by the time you are 24 years old your juvenile record will be "sealed", meaning that things you did as a child will not follow you into your adult life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Yes, you will serve 90 days in prison and restitution with probation.

Q1MI6L96aa	It all depends on the charges that will be filed against you. It is difficult to predict what can happen, though your family will need to hire an attorney to defend you, which is yet another cost, plus court costs - unless you are found not guilty - the cost to family members due to time away from work to be at any hearings and possible fines/penalties that you must pay. <br>  <br>  Yes, it was stupid...but it sounds like you believed you had a free supply of stuff through the store and you would never get caught.

The one announcing that he's coming back is for other folks.<br>  <br>  Your kids need to know that daddy's home from a very long, very hard day at work. He loves them --  and you -- very much. But he may need a little time to readjust. Yesterday, a loud noise meant "incoming" and impending doom... and he probably thought of you. Today it means somebody dropped something or fell down. For the last hundred years (it seems) he's been up to his eyeballs in stress.

AA10032971	You need to document everything that is wrong with the landlord's promises. This you should have gotten in writing in the first place. However, you should go to the legal aid people since you don't have much money. If you do indeed indicate that you have money, the legal aid folk will charge you for their services. I wish you much success with this. Say a little prayer on this concern. Remember this, What shall we then say to these things?

A lot of the swimming is done with a helmet and flak jacket on as well. As long as you are a fair swimmer it should not be a problem. Just qualifying is not that hard, it gets tough as you move up to the higher levels where you have to save others, or prevent them from trying to drown you.<br>  <br>  P.S. There are several swim qualification levels. They go from 4-1 if I remember. 4 being just able to keep yourself afloat, and 1 being a proficient swimmer able to escape from someone who may be pulling you under. There are a few levels above these for instructors and such.<br>  In boot camp you may have a chance to qualify for levels 4,3 and 2. Sometimes they do level one but often they don't waste the time. You are supposed to requalify every year, so if you want you have an opportunity to advance.|`|0szdPqI0aa	Colin b is right.<br>  <br>  but what he means by moving up higher levels he might mean when you try out for a special unit.

I had to wait 5 years to see a pain specialist. 3 years to see a rheumatologist. If you shoot yourself and rely on government health care, you will bleed to death long before you ever see a doctor. In fact you will be a decomposing skeleton before they even call you back. You people need to know what you are trying to inflict upon the American public. We veterans are suffering under a healthcare system that is entirely incapable of providing even the most basic of needs. And we are prohibited from using outside health facilities. Most civilian doctors will not even provide treatment to veterans in emergencies. They just push us out the door and say go to the VA. And the VA does nothing. They turn people away at the ER and tell them to try back tomorrow. Believe me people, you do not want free healthcare. The cost is way too high.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	Free health care is not a right?????

He falls ill from a treatable disease that is not covered by whatever minimal state health care you have. He dies, a human tragedy. His family ends up on welfare so your paying for them. His children have no positive role model and think that welfare is good enough for them. They are more likely to turn to crime and you will have to pay for more insurance, police and prisons. <br>  <br>  These children will have more children with the same negative outlook and you will have to pay for them as well.

They are not connected in any way. I am geussing that you wanted to get conservatives to click on this with the way you worded the question.  The problem with that healthcare system is everywhere. Look at Canada and countries in Europe.  There is a reason why those people travel to the USA to have surgery.  Also we turn out practically all new medicines that are introduced to the world every year.  That is due to the fact that these companies that sink billions of money into the pill research know they can turn a profit if the meds work.  Where as universal healthcare would stagnate these developments.  Also waiting list horror stories are easily found in these countries.  One man was told he had to wait a few years to have a surgery to fix a problem after he was told that problem would kill him in 6 months.  They even have companies that are a type of liason to the patient and refer them to Hospitals in the US so they can have surgery immediately, but the patient has to pay for the surgey himself.  I feel that none of this will change any minds, but just remember the old saying "nothing is free".|`|TRIsFGmsaa	First things first, were americans and we sure love our guns.<br>  second, how is that strange?

hOIBHhBraa	Obviously someone has to do it and people don't appreciate the fact that there are a lot of men and women that do it, they put their lives on the line for this country. The whole fight is stupid in itself, America needs to stop putting their 2 cents into every other country's business, however we also have to be alert because we don't want another 9/11 incident. Respect is something we should all feel however for these soldiers because what they do is not easy. They don't get much. They pretty much live like poor pesants. My brother is in the national guard has been for 8 years and is currently in iraq for the second time. Things are much better than they were in 2003 but things still arent easy. While we sit here in America, living life and complaining about bills, they do all they can to stay alive to come home to their families. Its tough and its not a joke. My husband is a marine in training and lets just say that im terrified of what can happen and where he could be sent to in the future, but that's life and all we can do is apprecate and respect the people that do what they do to make possible living our everyday normal lives.|`|DWGqak0aaa	Personally as an American, I feel good about our soldiers fighting for America.

e80d865060201c6543892c88a41bba3caa	Copyright exists automatically in any artistic work the moment it is created.  There is no legal requirement to register it anywhere although there are companies who will do so.  They are pretty much a waste of money.    Trademarks are a different matter and must be registered and comply to certain rules and regulations (see this site http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm.htm)    If you are a limited company then your company name is registered with companies house and no-one else can use that name, (for a limited company) but it could be used by a sole trader if it was not trademarked. (http://www.companieshouse.co.uk/)    Unless you are a large corporation then policing of trademarks is virtually impossible and expensive.  Even the big ones get ripped of on a daily basis.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	I am not sure of the law on this one but the best way to prove your "idea" "creation" is originally yours is to post it to yourself in a registered envelope and do not open it unless crucial. This way you can prove the date you created your logo etc beyond dispute.|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	A trade mark can be any sign which distinguishes the goods or services of one undertaking from those of others. It can be a word or a picture. It can be a shape of a container.   Two reasons. Registration grants a statutory monopoly to use of the mark. You can use the registration to prevent others from using the same or similar mark on the same or similar goods or services. Owners of well known marks can even stop others from using their mark on totally different goods. Also, probably more important to the smaller trader, the first person to register a trade mark in good faith can use it to stop someone who started to use the same or similar name earlier but who didn't register it  The problem is that under the Trade Marks Act of 1994 it is the first applicant who is deemed entitled to any registration not necessarily the first user. Therefore, I cannot really advise anyone to use a trade mark on an unregistered basis because if someone else did get a later valid registration, that could be used to prevent further use of the unregistered mark  Once the new trade mark has been chosen, it is very important to get a qualified professional to conduct clearance searches to see if the trade mark is free for use. As discussed earlier, the statutory monopoly granted by trade mark registration will be infringed by unauthorised use of the same or similar trade mark in respect of the same or similar goods or services. The main mistake the amateur searcher makes is to consider only whether anyone has registered exactly the same mark and not if there is something similar. This is dangerous. Companies like McDonald's guard their trade marks very jealously indeed. They are likely to be very unhappy about any trade mark beginning Mc or Mac, especially in the foods classes. We spent many years battling with them to prove that our client McChina was entitled to use that name. Moreover, a registered trade mark which has become well known in the United Kingdom will be infringed by use of the same or similar mark on totally dissimilar goods where the later use takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to the distinctive character or the repute of the well known registered trade mark. With this in mind we regularly conduct searches of the Trade Marks Register in the United Kingdom and in most other countries around the world on behalf of our clients.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	Intellectual Property comprises two arms:    (1) Copyright  (2) Industrial Property    (1) Copyright ? is implicit. The moment you create something (writing, painting, drawing, song, video etc), you own the copyright to it.  You don't have to register it, but you do have to keep some sort of record that your work was created at a certain date in case of challenges.      (2) Industrial Property comprises: Trade Marks? (names, logos etc), Registered Designs ? (the shape or design of something) and Patents (how things work). All have to be applied for and fees paid. The first two can be renewed ad infinitum; Patents have a life of (I think) 20 years.     Note there are overlaps between Copyright and Trade Marks and Registered Designs.     If you are seriously considering creating something, get advice on how to protect it. The British Library in St Pancras have a whole section devoted to Intellectual Property with very helpful staff. All advice is free.    http://blpc.bl.uk/    Also visit the IPO:  http://www.ipo.gov.uk/|`|lBxjORCwaa	There are a lot of questions here.      The answer to your question about the symbols is that you put others on notice that you have a registered trademark by adding the ? symbol next to your name, or using the letters RTM.     But wait till your trademark registration is completed before you do that as its a criminal offence to pretend you have a registered trade mark.      In the meantime the TM symbol can be used to indicate that you are using the name in a trademark sense - although it does not necessarily mean that your claim is valid.  For example, someone else may have better rights over the name.      The copyright symbol is only relevant for works which can be protected by copyright, and names are not.

He's just another right wing pundit trying to vilify our tax system.  Taxes are, and always have been, monies we put in to the system, for communal good.  We always have been somewhat capitalist, and somewhat socialist.  Without taxes, or in this rants case, without taking care of our lower middle class when the markets are crashing, we'd have huge overcrowded slums, with gang violence and whatever else.  We dont want that.  our streets are paved with gold.  We are the Shining City on the Hill, as Reagan liked to say.  Our taxes pay for clean streets, for police, fire, military, schools, parks, libraries.  We've got good living in every corner.  Take away taxes, or helping out your neighbor and you basically get India.  A tiny wealthy elite, who have most of the country's wealth, living in gated communities, and everyone else makes 2 cents a day.  No taxes, give nothing back, just take all you want.  You just have to look the other way, driving to work through masses of underfed barefoot peasants.  Like in the movie Slumdog Millionaire.  But the rich can be as selfish as they please.  Go ahead be a murdering tyrant.  hoard your wealth.  have your private security guards, and fire protection system, and helicopter landing pad.  Just isolate your self from society, and let the poor slave to serve you.  Just not in our country.|`|8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	I disagree with your word "rant."

Finally, someone who is telling it like it is.  People need to be accountable for their actions and lose the sense of entitlement that they "deserve" everything. People made choices to get into mortgages and now they have to deal with the repercussions of those choices.  Bailing them out only reinforces poor behavior.  We have consumed ourselves to death over the past decade and now we get to live through the "hangover" that goes along w/ that.  Aspirin will only mask the problem.|`|uEyxjAdcaa	Loved it.

Adolf Hitler     That's why...    A:~)|`|OZFhyEw4aa	President Obama has mass appeal because he speaks like he cares, he has a very down to earth, honest and sincere way of speaking. He talks about the real issues, the real problems facing us and he has some very good ways to solve our issues. He is just, he has a way of speaking that says so much about his eloquence, intelligence and ability to lead. He is middle aged which we all can relate to young and old. I wouldnt find it uncomfortable to have lunch with him I am sure he had alot of women that just loved so share their issues with him in college. Obama has finally given us hope that he is working for everyone, not just the rich, not just the poor, not just the white but all colors. He is a fine example of a father, a husband and a great sense of humor. We are very very lucky to have him as our President.|`|399be115381734eda49e566fc563731aaa	It was the liberal kool-aid.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	He was marketed like a new soft drink.  Journalist who were supposed to report news became cheerleaders, gushing and drooling themselves.  He was perfect for the shallow, not very deep thinking "Rich are Evil" MTV/BET generation who think 'war is bad' but abortion is cool!    There were those who sincerely voted for him because of his skin color alone (racist behavior) and those who voted for him because they thought he'd pay all their bills and make them rich (no joke).  There were those who voted for him because he gave pretty speaches that pretty much said nothing.      So 'mass' appeal?  He was thrown at us by the media like crack from a drug dealer.  We were TOLD he appealed to us....and if he didn't, then WE were bad for not seeing the Emperor had no clothes.|`|dwVnRNxvaa	Because he is friends with Chuck Norris.|`|ERVib5gYaa	Well he is charismatic and quite charming, I was hypnotized myself once and the media are helping him alot by putting him on this pedestal - 'The man that does no wrong'.

If the phenomenon only now bothers you, too bad. Should've spoken out against it and tried to stop it long, long before. It's too late for simple complaining directed at one icon.    You'll have to take on the movement of snuffing out the icon culture on the grand scale.

Bush was touted as Messiah by RELIGIOUS leaders, he was really seen as someone that will deliver America from evil liberals that kill babies.    The only deliverance Bush did was to the ultra rich with his tax cuts.    Obama appeals to the young and the independents that had enough with the corrupt Republican party, and until the Republican party have a massive reformation with a real conservative value (rather than the neo-con values they rely on Fox news and Druggie Limbaugh to brainwash their followers with), then Republican party will stay in the crapper.  The same can be said about the Democrats. If they don't clean up the government properly then we'll see their majority get chipped away too.|`|93HyAM60aa	He is an ultra-liberal, and so the media worked diligently to elevate him above his contenders while vilifying anyone opposing him. Since most people rely on the mainstream news outlets for their information, they bought into what was offered lock, stock, and barrel as being 'popular opinion'. The media will continue to prop this man up no matter what he does or doesn't do because they agree with his socialist policies, and so it would take monumental failure that even the press cannot cover up for the American people (and the world) to even hope to change their perception of him when his policies ultimately fail. But then again, his policies will not fail to accomplish what he intends to do in cohorts with the media - they will only fail the nation.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	Because he is a damned good liar.

This is just a figure head that the MSM has forced down our throats and those with no abliity to think on their own has swallowed every lie that the media has pushed in front of them like it was warmed pudding.|`|kMYE3vV8aa	Because he was a pop icon, he was new, fresh, "different", and he motivated the otherwise unmotivated masses to rally to his side.  He is the perfect used car salesman, the problem is everyone who voted for him bought a lemon.     Many people are easily persuaded by celebrities.  Why do so many people value the opinion of Brad Pitt???  I don't understand that mentality.  Obama didn't fool me back then and he doesn't fool me now.    Wake up America!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Well its not him, people were just sick of screw-ups of Bush so he was the best bet besides him.|`|XAetFJXsaa	He's appealing to the masses because plain and simple America was ready for a change...change that Obama promised to bring.

kprKXEOSaa	Self defense is self defense.  Just make sure you have an equal reaction.  I mean, if she slaps you, you don't punch her in the face and knock her out.  If she kicks you in the shin, you don't punch her in the gut and then give her a left hook to the jaw.    If a girl is just being chopsy, I wouldn't recommend hitting her back.  If she is really attacking you, yes, defend yourself.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	To add to what Wendy said the laws in my state are about the same and sex is not designated. You can use an equal amount of force used against you.|`|VH8q5HPaaa	Yes but only depending on the given situation and action of recourse.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Yes, but make sure you have witnesses.|`|zhk8o514aa	Anyone has the right to defend themselves.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	as a mom of all boys this has always been my advice on that IF SHE HITS YOU LIKE A GIRL you know swinging her arms aimlessly then put your hand on her head and gently keep her at distance but IT SHE COMES AT YOU LIKE A MAN WOULD closed fists with perfect aim hit her back depending on her size and strenght   and make sure she hits you first then it should be considered self defense      LET'S RODEO SAN ANTONIO YEEEEE.....HAAAAA|`|LCHnUuS6aa	As long as what you do is 'reasonable' and 'defensive' then you would be ok, particularly if your attacker had thrown the first punch or whatever.  Better to restrain rather than retaliate though as the law is very hazy.  I would say to any girl who wants to have a crack at you quite clearly that, if they hit you then you will strike them back, and they are liable to come off worst.  I have seen a small number of young men physically bullied by girls because they have been brought up never to hit a girl back, and I think that is wrong.  If a boy hit you, then you would feel bound to hit back, I don't think girls should be allowed to feel that there won't be a physical comeback.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Legal definition of self-defense:    "A person claiming self-defense must prove at trial that the self-defense was justified. Generally a person may use reasonable force when it appears reasonably necessary to prevent an impending injury. A person using force in self-defense should use only so much force as is required to repel the attack. Non deadly force can be used to repel either a non deadly attack or a deadly attack. Deadly Force may be used to fend off an attacker who is using deadly force but may not be used to repel an attacker who is not using deadly force.    In some cases, before using force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to the aggressor, a person who is under attack should attempt to retreat or escape, but only if an exit is reasonably possible. Courts have held, however, that a person is not required to flee from his own home, the fenced ground surrounding the home, his place of business, or his automobile."    So yes, you can legally defend yourself IF you are repelling her attack.  However, if you hit back after being attacked that does not classify legally as self defense.  It makes no difference if either party is male or female.|`|JL0Pqw9Xaa	Absolutely not hit once ..If it was repeated attacks yes.  Unless that is she gave you a real debilitating  blow..you could kill her under self defense.  If she hit you with her fists not..any weapon  involved it would be justified.|`|AA11124254	You may use force to defend yourself if being attacked, but you must use a measured response of like kind.  Fists = Fists, Knives = Knives, Guns = Guns.  When dealing with a female (typically, but not alway smaller and less strong than a male) you need to take into account her size and ability.  If a girl attacked you, I would just use enough force to restrain her and prevent her from hitting you, not strike her back.|`|AszvaBsxaa	no just tell|`|WozkziRFaa	Yes. Of course you are allowed to Defend yourself. Don't let her hurt you.|`|ejoBcPDZaa	Damn, if you live in the states and your life is being threatened you could even shoot her dead.|`|YJsxrBbvaa	In most places if you were defending yourself and trying to get away Im sure it would be considered defending yourself.  However it really depends where you live.|`|AA11206283	Of course. Keeping in mind if it gets to a police action or a court charge, you will be severly disadvantaged if you have to resort to violence to defend yourself against anyone; much less a woman.    It's a fact.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Yes but only with equal or lesser force, if its more force then what she is using on you then you are assulting her ,  you are no longer defending yourself.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	You could, but you just know most people will side with the girl when she breaks down crying and then you will be the monster regardless of what actually started it|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I dont ever like to hear of a guy hitting a woman, but one time I saw a big mouth ***** get up in a guys face that was having an argument with one of her guy friends and threaten to kick his ***, he told her to back off this was none of her business, then she slapped him, so he hauled off and punched her square in the nose and knocked her out cold, it was funny as hell, because she really asked for it....  there was about twenty people standing around and nobody said a thing, the two guys fininshed their argument with her laying on the ground....
PgFYPZg2aa	Yeah, but it makes them feel better, actual statistics aren't important to them.  They also like to put a crimp on small gun shop owners who had a rough time getting through the assault rifle ban, because people with those plunk down good money on ammo and magazines that the gun store owners make a decent profit on, never mind that you usually see weapons that can be concealed used in a criminal manner.  Of course if this makes you mad don't look up the guy in Wisconsin who was arrested for being a former felon owning a black powder rifle, you know he was up to no good with that.|`|9a525103a8f9794c8bbbfec452cdfc7faa	They think that by making the people go through a big hassle to own them legally it will keep them out of the criminals hands.

There are gullible idiots who believe that Obama does not want to take your guns. I will be very kind and say that is debatable based upon his prior history.    What is NOT debatable is the fact that there are members of Congress and many outside the belt that DO want to separate us from our guns...ALL guns. They see no reason why we should have them, not even for hunting or pleasure shooting. They would be ecstatic to totally disarm the population. These are not fringe nut jobs but mainstream politicians and well organized groups. These people are a lot like the Muslims and their goal of world domination. They are patient and are prepared to take years to achieve their goals.     When we are sufficiently disarmed, we will be at the total mercy of local, state and Federal authorities.     People better start paying attention to who they are electing.|`|w5sK75MPaa	Yes not only are gun rights going to get worse but already with the last administration we have lost basically all of our privacy rights due to the laws passed on terrorism.

Our govt is slowly taking our freedom.|`|Q7ovix19aa	We have a right to even fully automatics but politicians constantly violate that right.  We have that right so we can enforce our other rights against their betrayal, and to stop them from abusing us in other ways.    They have been squandering our taxes and putting us into ever greater debt since long before I was born.  Ultimately they will need to take most of our income and assets to cover the squandering.  They are taxing away half of those now.    They know even the unconscious masses will become furious when they realize how they have been impoverished by the politician racketeers.  They want us unarmed when that happens.|`|0OQ9EdLOaa	Obamanazi, you start off with that and would like and intelleget answer, so here goes i'll go slow so you can under stand, that maybe a bit difficult for you with you nra membership past due. i am sure you would use you semi automatic firearm for sport or to protect your home. let me see sport one shot one kill or cripled animal that runs off to die, i dont see a problem there im a hunter(love hunting).protect the home pistol, shotgun or ball bat, again no problem, help me see you biggot what you would need to have an assult rifle for. you make no sense and are just to stupid to look past nra pride( i would be a member if it was not for radicalist like you) yes protect the right to bare arms but not the right to own a tank, and that is what the nra wants.|`|0s190C7Zaa	With bigger government comes more taxes, confusion, more spending, stupid laws, and less understanding of our fellow man.|`|gRtmFa1maa	I am all for people having rifles for hunting...I find it questionable that anyone needs to have a semi automatic weapon outside of the military.     You can yell all you want that the constitution gives you the right to bear arms. That was written over 200 years ago before semi-automatic weapons. When this country was a vast frontier and you pretty much were on your own in protecting yourself. I don't know how they would feel about the general population having such powerful weapons. I also question the general populations intelligence in handling these weapons. My husband has many friends that collect guns...and even they have been careless with weapons. Left them in cars to be stolen ect. I really think they should be reserved for trained professionals.    The murder rates have gone up in certain urban areas. Philadelphia had it's highest murder rate ever last year, earning it the nickname "Killadelphia". You might want to look elsewhere for you statistics besides the NRA website.

But if you look at all the ridiculous salaries CEO's and Officers make( many were just bailed out ).Just Imagine how cheap goods would be if they made reasonable salaries. They work in most cases, less than blue collar workers do, with benefits blue collar will never see. If you make your money by investing that's' different. You should not be taxed for taking risks. Big risks with little payoff would cripple us. I think if a business wants to pay outrageous salaries, it should also pay outrageous taxes, to pay for the health care of the blue collar people below them. Greed is destroying us. I hate the way most big business treats you like your disposable. If thees huge corp's pose such a economic threat, we need to start limiting the size of corp's.

I'm not a government worker...and neither is my husband.  I'm a stay-at-home wife.  My husband works his rear off in a metal shop every day.  We bring home *nada* extra--only enough to pay rent and groceries.   HOWEVER----I stand *firmly* by what I said above.  Why? Because I happen to be a believer and I think too much emphasis is placed on all this. We pay taxes out the wazoo too, you know!  However, we don't think *twice* about who they're going to.  They're going to other human beings who are less privileged.  Our tax dollars go to the incompetent, the competent-but-lazy, the welfare mothers, and the mothers who are widows and have no choice but to ask for help.  I just think it's getting really *old* listening to people scream about something that in the scheme of things isn't worth it.  Life is too short not to enjoy the simplicities of it, and instead spend your time venting about monetary things.  You can't take it to the grave.    ***************    I read this the other day also, and agree with it wholeheartedly.  I'm tired of hearing people whine, moan and complain about having to pay taxes for the needy, paying taxes for the welfare recipients, paying taxes for this and that.  In my opinion----if you don't want to help your fellow man (regardless of whether or not they deserve it)---then exactly what sort of human being are you??    I believe what the deceased doctor is stating, is that people need to stop whining on BOTH fronts, and start acting.  His last words said it all, and the ones previous to it------it would be "about the end of any nation" if people were to stop working, to pay taxes, to help those who cannot or WILL NOT.  Those who cannot---CANNOT...those who WILL NOT.....WON'T.  :)  Nothing is going to change that because people are who they are and it's time to stop whining about taxes----suck it up and pay it.      Life is too short to fret and stew and hem and haw over taking care of other people when we should be doing that anyway!!  ...just my opinion.

His large ears contribute far more to him looking like a chimp than his ethnicity. Plenty of white people look like chimps. It makes sense that we all look like chimps. They are our closest living relative.

8MUj24s6aa	I got this from another answerer on Y!A  This is a post from an Australian police officer...    Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the now available data  from Down Under. It has now been one year (12 months) since gun   owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal  firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing  Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.     The first year results are now available:  -Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent;  -Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent;  -Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent);      In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up      300 percent as compared with the last one year period when private      ownership of a firearm was legal.     (NB: the law-abiding citizens did turn in their personal firearms,      the criminal element did not and thus criminals in Australia still      possess their guns.)   -While data for the 25 years preceding the confiscation of privately  owned guns showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms,    this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months as criminals   now are assured their victims will be unarmed.   -There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults   of the elderly, while the resident is at home. Australian politicians are   at a loss to explain how public safety has  decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in  successfully ridding Australian society of guns.'   -This story of well intentioned government intervention in the   rights of lawful individuals to own and possess firearms won't be seen in the  mainstream US media or on the American evening news. Senator Obama   who advocates a similar confiscation in the US will not be reporting   any of this to you. But, the Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the   hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws  affect only the law-abiding citizens.    Americans may want to take note before it's too late!  http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm     Freedom only works for those who fight to keep it.    "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson|`|i6d582PFaa	yes but it'll be more fun seeing them trying to physically take the guns away.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Hey, dukemack, why don't you do a little research and check out the Supreme Court's latest decision in the case of Heller v. DC...you know, the one where the Supreme Court specifically stated that the 2nd Amendment applies to the individual citizen and not the collective state, and that "a well regulated militia" refers to the individual citizens?    Bet all that's news to you.    UPDATE:  Hey, Secular, lemme ask ya a question.    It's Friday night and you're leaving the mall.  You're walking through the parking lot to get to your car when two thugs appear from behind a van to your left and stand in front of you.  One of them has a knife and says that if you don't hand over all of your valuables, he's gonna cut you.    So here's the question:  HOW IS CALLING 911 GONNA HELP YOU AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME?    Do you even think that the bad guys are gonna wait while you stick a cell phone in your ear after they see you dial 911?  No, they're gonna cut you three ways - long, deep, and constant.  And this scenario is not something I made up - it happened to me in Hampton, Va a few years back.    How did I handle it?  I drew my legally-carried concealed weapon and convinced the thug it would be in his best interest for him to drop the knife and disappear.  He did.    OK, so let's go back to the "two minutes away from a police station" thing you said.  Do you have any idea just how much damage someone can to do you and/or your house in two minutes?  When you're enjoying a nice massage, two minutes goes by in - well, two minutes.  When you're in a deadly or threatening situation such as this, two minutes is a lifetime.    As the old saying goes, "When seconds count, the police are only minutes away!"  I mean no disrespect to the police, but that's just the way it is.  And any cop will tell you that as well.|`|50zbKv0jaa	how is any of that related to the second amendment, the amendment doesn't allow for unfettered Access for everyone just to use in militias    i just reread it not a mention your right to sell arms or our right not to be licenced|`|19L99wvCaa	Do you really want psychiatrically unstable people to be able to legally possess firearms?

PS great loking bills - I will contact mjy reps - lets get these passed.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	No where in any of these proposals is the mention of gun ownership restricted.  It's simply the SELLING of the guns that's in question.  Some people with medical or prison records should NOT be able to buy a gun.      Sorry, but I agree with the proposals for the sake of community safety.    I have a Concealed Weapon Carrier Permit that I recently had renewed.  That required two weekend classes and a background check and proof of competency with the weapon.  I did not mind the course at all.  ANYONE who owns a gun had better know how to handle and store the weapon; too many are mishandled or stolen.  This requirement is not an infringement on my right to carry a gun.|`|JYkbmHH6aa	Some people are so brain washed in YA they think it is a good thing to take away our protection against the tyraney of our government.

I see these people that sleep till noon and spend the free money on stuff they don't need. Also a lot of them will steal from the store even when they have a bank envelope with a few hundreds in it. Don;t take this the wrong way. There are people that do need help out there but there also a lot that are just using the system to not work. What did they do at Jamestown. When the capt went and lived with the indians to promote good will he told the people at the fort to finish it. When he returned they were all laying around and he had to make a rule that if you don't work you don't eat. We humans are actually mostly lazy and if we didn't have to work we wouldn't. we would just sit and play the xbox or ps3 all day. Back to the people at the stores now. I would watch these people come in and are able to work but don't. They would come and steal and when caught they get a smack on the wrist. If caught again they get a fine which they would pay for with items they steal and sell. If caught again they get a little jail time. While they are in the jail they continue to get the checks direct deposited into the account so when they get out of jail they have about 3 months of money. I would watch as they have a block party with beer, wine, booze, pot, and crack with loud music. All courtesy of the taxpayer. I was in a city smaller than Atlanta called Macon and I had over a thousand people arrested in just 2 years. If the store you run is high theft and the store shrinks out then everyone ast the store is fired. So the shoplifting is not a victimless crime. The president needs to address this propblem of people living on the goverment. This is a lot of money. If the president made a program where people that were able to, are bussed to a job such as picking up trash, painting stripes on the roads, fixing road signs, cooking and cleaning for the disabled, babysitting for welfare to work people, etc. then you would see a lot of people get a real job. At walmart my loss prevention associate would catch 100 customers a month, I would catch 100 customers a month, and my other loss prevention associate that was not really good at catching people would get at least 25 himself. Now take a superwalmart and multiply that by 3000 and then take a dollar general and add 15 people a month times 3000 and take a family dollar and add 15 people times 5000. That is only three chains and you see what an epidemic it is. If we were to stop the shoplifting by half the stores could lower prices like crazy. We need as a nation to stop talking about the crimes in other countries and stop hiding the oners here. The time is to fix this and watch as the deficit slows and could even become a surplus. I know that there is other problems out there but why not eat the elephant one bite at time and see it disappear.

October would be month ONE, Nov month 2, etc.<br>  As far as the 'loose lips sink ships' comment, here in S.E. Virginia it's in the news when a ship will be back. This weekend the the Eisenhower will be leaving Norfolk along with some other ships and some ships from Mayport. That's all in the news.  I am going to the base tomorrow to see the Ike off.  One of the kids I used to teach in Sunday school is on the Ike, so I'll be with his mom, dad, and sisters on the pier.  The following site tells ALL about it.

dPLkNRNuaa	The vast majority of college students come out of school with massive amounts of debt and no job.  Welcome to the grown up world. <br>  <br>  It's possible that you don't have a job because you are a rotten interview.<br>  <br>  You want to sue someone else because you can't get a job? What that tells me is that  you do not accept responsibility for your own fate. You  are quick to pass the buck and make excuses and look for someone else to blame for your failings. Not attractive qualities in a tight job market. <br>  <br>  If you want to get a job in this market - it takes work. It takes hustle. You have to network. You can't just sit at a computer filling out on line job applications. You have to speak to people. You have to take any job you can get. You have to be willing to start at the bottom. If the only job you can get is in the mail room - then take it. Then you make sure you are the best employee in the mail room. You work harder....better then every one else. Eventually, that work will pay off. <br>  <br>  My company recently had 1 opening. We got over 200 resumes. Now....what are you going to do to stand out - what makes your resume worth picking out of that stack of 200 and calling you for an interview?<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	You could sue me because i disgust you with my wrinkles.

VSmQWuhEaa	I had hoped for months. But now that spendulus is law, years would probably be more accurate.<br>  <br>  A fever is good though uncomfortable. To bad a fever can kill true, but in general, the raised body temperature slows the rate infection can spread, and gives the body a chance to fight it off. One may take medicine that reduces a mild fever, it will make them feel better, but will slow their overall recovery or eventually allow the infection to kill them all together. <br>  <br>  So it is with the economy, as markets collapse, they are trying to adjust themselves back to where they should be. The more we allow them to do this on their own the faster it will happen. But if the pain becomes too bad, we take that stimulus medicine, it reduces our pain, but lengthens the recovery, by prolonging the market adjustments. The trick with a fever is managing it, keeping below dangerous levels, but allowing it to fulfill its purpose. We need to stop looking at the government as a cure, and start recognizing, the markets will heal themselves in time, and that government can only reduce our symptoms some, and that in doing so, make our recovery longer.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid it will be several years.

Second, when will we recover back to 2007 levels of output? <br>  <br>  The answer to the first question is basically "anytime we want, plus nine months." I don't know if the stimulus package is enough to compensate for the demand shortfall, but I fear that it won't. We'll probably need another $1 trillion purely in investment spending. After that, it takes 6-12 months from the time it's passed to the time it actually begins "stimulating." <br>  <br>  To the second, the answer is also variable, but probably 3-6 years, depending on policy actions.<br>  <br>  Not particularly optimistic I know, but that's the truth.|`|V4BaRBtnaa	I think the economy will bottom out later this year, or early 2010, and the slow process of recovery will mid to late 2010, just in time for the mid-term elections so the Democrats can maintain control.

RD5sTZaFaa	If you have a case pending in a court it is improper for you to write to the judge.  It would be considered to be "ex parte" communication, and neither you nor the prosecutor is allowed to talk to the judge without the other side present.<br>  <br>  It is also improper for you to write a letter on behalf of another person who has a case pending. <br>  <br>  If the case has already been acquitted by the jury then the judge is free to talk with you, but probably won't want to.<br>  <br>  The court is not able to exonerate a person without a verdict of not guilty from a jury, unless there is a trial without a jury and the judge finds the defendant not guilty.

Zrq8vjaXaa	How long or how short an officer interview your application does not reflect the qualification in which your are applying.  The important is, whether you have provided sufficient evidence to show that you have a bona fide marriage.  That is, you need to present evidence to show that you entered into a good faith marriage.  Second, you must present evidence to show that you are eligible to obtain permanent residency.  The sponsor application, Form I-130, if approved, simply shows that  you have a good faith marriage. The application for adjustment of status to a perm residence must demonstrate that you are qualified, and that you are not a removable or inelligible alien.  Those have different criteria.<br>  <br>  If the officer thinks that you are ineligible, he/she will send a notice with intent to deny at a later time.  If the officer need more evidence, he/she will send a letter titled, "Request for Evidence," and demand additional documents and proofs.  Finally, I have many clients whose interview were 5-10 minutes and they get the approval notice.  The officer only has 10-20 minutes to review and qualify each application.  if the initial evidence is insufficient, they will put it at the bottom of the pile.  As such, creating more time and delays in your application.<br>  <br>  If you need more information, please contact the U.S. immigration attorneys at the source below.  Only your lawyer can review the documents and make determination whether you still need more evidence to show that you are eligible for a green card.  The links below will also explain in more details on the requirements.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Steven Tuan Pham|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Tell her not to get her knickers in a twist.

xZwwb3kVaa	Well if you are talking about all Shops, most of them were closed down as they had nothing to sell. A lot of Factories were taken over, converted into munitions either the big stuff or components for various War Companies. I worked on the Bomb Gears for Lancaster Bombers, and nearing the end of the War I was on the Avro.. a small fighter for the RAF. We were on Rations as regards the Food situation., and it would surprise a lot of the People today what we had to live on. But we survived as best we could, and I was only a small girl then, but it is still vivid to me. People were allowed  2ozs butter... 2ozs of tea, 4ozs of meat, and anything you could get on the black market that was eatable, As for clothes you got a book for them as well, but could not buy any as the Shops were also empty with no stock.I would not want anyone to go through that in their lifetime, We were like that for six years, and it was awful.But at the time we had it to do so that our Troops could be fed as no food was being grown in the Country, as the Farmers were helping the war effort.

XLXncQu9aa	Actually marijuana is legalized.  The only legalization it has is if your doctor deems it necessary.  If your doctor prescribes it for you then that is the only time it is illegal.  However what you don't understand is that marijuana can actually do more harm than good, and it can actually harm others.  Here are some harmful side effects.         * distortions of perceptions, thinking and reality      * Difficulty in forming concepts and thoughts      * Poor concentration      * Mental confusion      * Loss of motivation      * Wide mood swings      * Aggression and hostility      * Depression, anxiety and paranoia  * Regular use during pregnancy can lower birth weight and cause abnormalities similar to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (small head, irritability, poor growth and development.  * Can destroy the number of chromosomes, resulting in cell abnormalities and impaired function.     Now you say that it should be legalized, but do you know how dangerous this drug is?  What is to stop an individual from driving under the influence?  Marijuana is illegal because of the harmful effects it can have on you and others.  It alters your state of thinking, and it can cause problems for others.    Edit: And about alcohol, it may be legal, but that is because it is not as dangerous to one's health as marijuana is.  Also there are sanctions on the amount of alcohol one can consume in public and not be arrested.  The dangers of marijuana far exceed the dangers of alcohol.  The government wouldn't put that power in the hands of individuals knowing the harm that it could do.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	WHY IS THIS QUESTION ASKED SO FREAKIN MUCH? Its illegal people just get over it. if alcohol was illegal people would be ranting and raving about that too, but its not so nobody cares that alcohol is more dangerous and its legal! People need to quit acting like the "illegal" factor is actually stopping them from smoking it. As for Micheal P. He is stupid and should know better! he is an athlete, how does he expect to be able to swim and hold his breath for a long time  if he's smoking anything.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	go see "numa numa nerd" maybe this will change your mind (an argument to keep it illegal)|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	For the Fed Gov to declare it legal would be adimitting they have been wrong for the last 70+ years.    And they would never admit that.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	It's illegal.     If you or others don't like it, move to a place where it is legal (Amsterdam). If you want to fight to make it legal, go for it, but don't try to justify others breaking the law.      There are always laws on the books that some people don't agree with. That's not an EXCUSE or JUSTIFICATION for breaking it, just because you don't agree with it for one reason or another.    You don't get to pick and choose which laws you will follow and which ones you won't just because you don't LIKE IT!!!    If you break the law, you pay the consequences. Period. End of story.|`|VH8q5HPaaa	Because anybody can grow marijuana themselves and thus it makes it a difficult substance for the government to add taxes to.|`|LRrBkzaUaa	It's illegal because it wasn't popularised by white people but was introduced by evil foreigners.|`|dRiBGoJkaa	this is a question that has always perplexed me, i think it's due too mis-education about the drug being dangerous and a gateway drug too others, all these claims aren't fact just peoples opinion.  Cannabis is relatively safe it doesn't dramatically increase the chances of developing mental health disorders, it isn't a gateway drug, socially it does very little harm compared too say alcohol.  As an adult i object too be told  what i can and can't do, but then who listens to what a Government says?|`|HAGjS33naa	To answer your question is SIMPLE!!     Yes alcohol is bad too, same with smoking, but what's the difference with marijuana you say?    Lets say one day you fall ill (self-inflicted remember) because of your drug taking. Why should the NHS fund your recovery?     OK you say why should the NHS help smoking/alcohol related disease then?     Difference is Cigs and Booze is TAXED in UK. So they're paying in advance in a sense, for any later health problems they may incur.
DTSUJe2oaa	This should help.~  a) Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 - Makes it and offence to discriminate against someone because they are gay (or straight) when offering goods or services. E.g. Two gay men cannot be refused a double bed at a guest house if there is one available.    b) Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 - Makes it an offence to discriminate against someone because they are gay in the workplace. E.g. A gay guy is not allowed to go on training courses because he is gay, his straight colleges are allowed on training courses. This is an offence under this law.    c) Equality and Human Rights Commission - This body now covers all kinds of discrimination in UK society including race, age, sexuality.~

See the Goverment relies on people to drive it's economy.    c) Everybody would start taking it, so then in order to make money the goverment would have to put a high tax on it, however it would then be double standards because the goverment would then have to put high taxes on currently legal drugs.    Jack D, I couldn't disagree more with everything you just said.    a) Yes, it is grown by criminals in other countries, but if the government made it legal, it wouldn't buy it from other countries, it would produce its own. There is really no reason to buy something from another country when you are perfectly capable of making it yourself.    b) Tell me how this is different from alcohol, television, the internet, or video games. Because it makes people de-motivated is not a reason to ban something.    c) Its not like they don't already put a tax on tobacco and alcohol.

The thought process was that since it was mostly Mexicans that smoked it, and they didn't want the Mexicans to come and take jobs, then if they outlawed it the Mexicans would leave. This started the 'Reefer Madness'.    Didn't work, Mexicans didn't leave, people got scared, and now they just feed us propaganda that has not been proven. What is proven though is that it has health benefits, including helping the brain to conserve memory in Alzheimer's patients.    My theory now is that they won't make it legal because it's so easy for the public to make themselves they'd have trouble taxing it.    So instead they throw away 300-400 billion dollars a year fighting it.|`|vR0FRRtoaa	it can be the cause of mental illness like Schizophrenia.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	This question has been asked a million times.  One possible answer is the hemp from the marijuana plant is too valuable and versatile to allow the public to have.  Clothing manufactures and cotton growers might be forced out of business if it became widely available.  It's also easier to tax and regulate alcohol.

Edit: Pookie B, if only it was as simple as that...|`|TntKAGLDaa	I would say that this child's birthday is included with the holidays because each parent will want time with the child to celebrate. Not a holiday per se but it fits in that category.  I would say that the contract is worded to allow the two of you to attempt to come to some sort of civil agreement on your own instead of being babies and running to the court all the time to set things in stone for you. I hate custody agreements mainly because parents think that children are something to fight about. Unfortunately it's usually the mother who fights with the father about whether he will see his children or not. I would suggest the two of you sit down over lunch or something and discuss personal plans and preferences for the aforementioned holidays. For example if you have your celebration for Christmas mainly on the Eve then you could say you want the child to be present in the evening and the father can have the child on Christmas day. Either way, it needs to be worked out fairly and civilly. If you really can't come to a conclusion then I would say request a mediation session through the court house and then file the agreement so that neither of you can go back on the agreement.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	The agreement is trying to get the parents to act as adults and not have to have everything dictated by the court system.  If your mature enough to procreate - then you are supposed to be mature enough to compromise!    In general holidays are "switched off" -- meaning Parent A gets the holiday and then Parent B gets that Holiday the next year.  Ideally though - the parents should try to work together as much as possible so that the child doesn't grow up in an environment where they are being shredded by their parents bickering and childish behavior.      The child's birthday is a holiday to the child -- and to the parents who will both likely want to spend this happy day with their child.    Compromise -- remember that you two are the ones who don't get along.......don't torture your kid for the next 18 years by arguing over things like this.|`|HlYzvJ51aa	It means:    B) Parent A picks the holidays they want in one year, then switches with Parent B the next year.

She had them xmas and thanksgiving last year so this year I get them xmas and thanksgiving. And the good faith thing tells me that both of you should be able to look past your differences and make sure that this is being followed properly. And pick in good faith what holidays you will get the kids this year...and what holidays he gets them this year...then just switch them around next year. I would make sure eeach of you has them on a major holiday this year...wether it be xmas, thanksgiving..easter...    I hope this helps.

He was involved in preventing regulation of F and F.  He was a partner in a law firm that SUED banks for not giving out enough "affordable" loans to people who couldn't pay them back.  He wanted to "spread home ownership around" and his buddy (Johnson) at Fannie who was his advisor in this area, resigned in disgrace after "accounting irregularities"|`|T0pkW783aa	Actually, you are 100% wrong.  Obama is the one who wants to tax, tax and tax some more; take from the rich (who already give up 40% of their income to taxes) and increase their taxes some more, then turn it over to those who don't even pay any tax (spreading the wealth); and where do you suppose that money will actually go?  Obama has promised to increase taxes and he will surely put us in a depression.  He wants to cut military spending when it is necessary to spend during times of war; he is willing to cut veteran's benefits, servicemen and women's supplies and also cut the spending for our defense protection.  What is he thinking?  The generals who are in charge of the military say this is a terrible idea and will put our military in harm's way.  Taxing the health care will be far better than taking away many of the services we now have and who do you think will pay for all the health benefits that Obama has promised to everyone, including all of those who are here illegally??  Obama is a socialist and has even studied Marxism and socialism, and has admired the writings which he discusses in his book.  Who actually is the Socialist?? Obama!!|`|HI0oQriqaa	was that McCain who said "share the wealth "? was it McCain who said government will give money to people who don't pay taxes? was it McCain who offers free health care run by the government?  one of us is mixed up . |`|3OZoLNM2aa	not!!! redistribution of wealth is socialism|`|WZXboi4Xaa	seems to me that the bush admin is buying it all up.

This is just one little example in a multitude of situations.  Medicare, disability and food stamp fraud, millions lost every year!

Obama was telling the mayors of various cities that he expected them to oversee the stimulus money spent in their towns to see to it that they spent it properly and efficiently. In otherwords, he expects them to be accountable. I think that is a great idea. I didn't vote for Obama but I do like his attitude of self imposed responsibility.

You should base your opinions on the real thing. Not the show COPS or the unrealistic tv dramas.     I say you go to your local department and ask if they have a ride along program. Try it.     The police do everything they can to "PROTECT" you. Even at the cost of losing there Job, House, Family and prob much more.  We live in a LAW SUIT happy society. And the police are put out over and over again because of little cry baby criminals who say that the police beat me ot the police teased me.     The cry baby never says "I deserved this a$$whoopin because I was selling dope to school kids and when the cops came I fought with them".   NO, you never hear that but still, WE lose it all because of this crap.    Now ask yourself..... WOULD I RISK IT ALL FOR SOME PETTY CRAP THAT THIS PERSON PUTS NO EFFORT TOWARD STOPPING.?

Let me tell you a little story about "risking it all".  I have a friend who was a police officer for only 3 years. During that time he:  -Used his body to cover an innocent person during a shootout, he himself getting shot in doing so.  -Ran into a burning building to save two people, getting cuts and burns that required 6 months full healing and 48 stitches.  -Had to kill someone in order to save another life. He now has to live with that guilt, that isn't easy FYI.  -covered another police officer (who didn't have his body armor with him) during a shootout, getting injured from shrapnel in the process.    This is just one of the cops i know, and all of them (about a dozen) have done things like that. So are they really not "risking it all" by doing that?  They DO run risks, and in fact often more than men and women in the military (not trashing them at all, just telling you what they do).  They have to deal with the very worst of society and guess what? People don't like them and get mad and have a beef with them because a police officer pulled them over and gave them a ticket.  Nobody has a beef with firefighters, or EMTs, or military. Why is it the police officers who are out in the night, dealing with the worst of society so that you don't have to, that get the finger from so many people?   They are away from their families, often having to come home late. That friend i mentioned had to go out to a scene at 3 a.m. because nobody else was available.  I completely respect those guys.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	no,where i live i am lucky to see a cop 2 times a week.and if i wasn't driving.i would never see one.i think and know that they can't be anywhere near here if i called .it would take 10 minutes minimum.that's why we have guns and dogs.|`|9b46fa1bcd4de3f2eed9af5a9e409c3eaa	i feel the police do as much as they can despite being hampered by political correctness and financial constraints.most services in this country are limited by do gooders an bean counters.|`|QBYz4oaCaa	The only time i see a cop is on all the new cop  tv program's   I think its a insult to the paying public for them to spend so much time on showing us how good the police are or how good they can look.the cops love it they must say to their wife's you watch me Darling I'm on TV tonight  I don't want to see them on TV i want to see them back on our STREETS.

oBL3AtRfaa	It depends on how intractable and severe the mental condition is. <br>  <br>  Sick people who have people in their lives who love them and treat them kindly have a definite advantage over sick people who don't. But sometimes the people who love them most don't have the knowledge or skills necessary to help the person get better.<br>  <br>  I've heard of ECT being used to help some people with depression. I've known people who've had it and they don't remember it afterwards. And it does seem to help some people. And medication changed my life and that of many others. But I wasn't warehoused and kept on drugs. The meds and short-term therapy were part of my recovery, but I had to learn some skills my loved ones would not have been able to give me, simply because they had not been trained in how to treat depressed people. And they were a little too close to the problem. It was better for me to work with someone to whom I was simply a client. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, the love and support of my family made it easier, but I really don't think it would have been enough.|`|AA10381258	I have bipolar disorder, so I feel very qualified to answer this. I think psychiatry is being handled extremely well. EC therapy is very rare these days, most places wouldn't even consider using this method. Being stuck in a hospital is only the way emergencies are handled now, except in the case of people who need constant permanent care that their family cannot provide. Most treatment of mental health disorders is now on an outpatient basis. Also, most psychiatrists will not even treat a patient with medication who refuses therapy sessions to learn how to deal with their emotions. I'm not sure where you got your ideas about how mental health disorders are treated, but your view is rather skewed.

There are statistics on the rates of denial and approval by state. However, nationally, about 70% of all applicants are denied initially at the disability application level. <br>  <br>  Of those applicants who have been denied and decide to appeal, there is the option of filing what is known as a request for reconsideration. A reconsideration is handled in exactly the same manner as the initial disability application. A disability examiner will gather the available medical records, review them, and then render a decision. Typically, a reconsideration appeal will be decided more quickly than a disability application (which can take, on average, about 3-4 months). However, the majority of these appeals are denied. In fact, an even higher percentage of them are denied than the initial application, roughly 85%.<br>  <br>  Those who decide to appeal a second time (the best way to go) will be requesting a hearing before a federal administrative law judge. This level is very different from the two prior levels. You actually meet the decision-maker. And you and your attorney get to submit medical evidence in your favor, including medical statements from your physicians that your attorney, if he is competent, will acquire. <br>  <br>  Regarding representation, you are not required to have an attorney. And at the first two steps of the process (the disability application and the reconsideration appeal), an attorney is not necessary for many claimants, though some will benefit from this. <br>  <br>  At the disability hearing, though, it is very unwise to go unrepresented and those who show up at hearings by themselves will often be warned by the judge that they should reschedule their hearing and use the interim time to look for an attorney (the judge, in effect, is doing the claimant a favor).<br>  <br>  Regarding how long it will take to get your back payment check, this is anyone's guess. After a hearing decision has been reached by the judge, the case will go to a payment processing center where things are usually backlogged. You can sometimes see benefits just a few weeks after you are approved, or after a few months. But this is also where it can be beneficial to have an attorney, because this individual can do followup calls to the payment processing center on your behalf.<br>  <br>  To answer, your first question, though, yes, most people will have to appeal. But...30 percent of those who file will be approved at the initial claim level and will not have to worry about filing an appeal.|`|AA10337794	yes I got turned down the first time I applied , so I got a lawyer it took for me about 2 years  to get a hearing  then it took about another year before I was approve for disability , yes I won and it took about  5 months before I got my back pay , but part of that was because nobody told me I was supposed to sign  some papers , not even my lawyer said anything until I called Social Security myself  then they explained what the hold up was , when I called my lawyer then he told me  about the hold up|`|H7SQEM4Daa	It took me two years till I was approved for disability.

She opposes restrictions on U.S. arms transfers and police training to governments that engage in gross and systematic human rights abuses, such as Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Israel, Pakistan, Cameroon and Chad, to name only a few. She insists upon continuing unconditional funding for the Iraq war and has called for dramatic increases in Bush’s already bloated military budget. She has challenged the credibility of Amnesty International and other human rights groups that criticize policies of the United States and its allies."|`|EObwbJgUaa	look i'm defiantly not a democrat, and CERTAINLY not a clinton supporter, but what exactly do you propose we do?

b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	For the first time in its history Britain has come up against a very peculiar situation , Invasion of foreign immigrants combined with a very deep recession , When the recession  really begins to bite and thousands lose their homes the fact that 3.5 million jobs are filled by foreign labour will become a very real issue .And the fact that a British government is looking more favourable on foreigners and to the extent of allowing a PC brigade to destroy our institutions and culture while encouraging theirs , All these things combined could very easily lead to violence on a large scale .

A couple of years back there had been a murder in a house, in the UK..                              Forensic team arrived, all the high tech' gear ready, they started, hundreds of hours overtime work, they were looking for any little clue, hairs etc.                               They finally completed this 'fine tooth comb' job, the police gave the all clear, so cleaners could come and clean the place up.                                After a hour cleaning they moved the settee, there was a body behind it that the police  'Tech' team' had missed!                                I also watch a lot of American detective programmes.                                 Fact is nothing like these portrayed programmes.     I now sit and watch these movies  just knowing that a member of the public will point the finger .                                    So the police have the answer, all they have to do then is find the proof, hard work is'nt it?

So, negative Bushspin is the safe road for them. They all agree: Bush and his administration must be destroyed and utterly defeated.

However, what Americans have a problem with is paying taxes that go towards ridiculous things that allow other Americans to abuse the system (like unregulated welfare) or that waste money. <br>  <br>  I highly doubt you are accurately summarizing this "study" you read. No one wishes they paid more taxes or likes paying taxes. Maybe all these liberal celebrities should spend their money giving to homeless people and single mothers rather than spending it on all of their name-brand clothing. Maybe people that can't afford to feed their children and have to get food stamps shouldn't be allowed to purchase a big screen t.v. or XBox 360. <br>  <br>  I'm equally tired of Democrats thinking that the world revolves around making everyone "equal" and thinking that it's the government's fault you have bad credit and can't pay your bills.

All you have to do is run in through a search engine and see that it is made up. Second if the institute is made up so is the study. Also, the manipulation of any survey poll is easy. The easiest thing to do is decide what you want the outcome to be and then ask the right questions to the right people and you have the data to fit your answer. Now for people that actually “want to pay more”, guess what, send as much as you want to the IRS, there is now lay that says you cant over pay.  A few months a go I saw an interview with one of the former heads of the IRS and he was asked how many of the people that say they want to pay more in taxes actually have, the answer was zero.
2zGSdDvIaa	Not an easy answer.    In concept, yes they could have avoided war with the US.  difficult but doable.  FDR was itching to get into the fight...    Lend lease was under full sway etc.  Arsenal of democracy and all that.        For the Nazi's to have avoided war with the US, they would have had to change who and what they were.  They would have had to have been willing to expand more slowly taking on fewer enemies at one time.  They would have had to have completed their development of the atomic bomb and gotten their long range bombers in action (proven)  before Japan attacked the US.    Japan would have had to have been willing to delay action to set them on a direct course of war with the US.      The best way the Nazi could have avoided war with the US would have been to spend a great deal of money in US politics to strengthen the pacifist movement.  Then the US would have been removed from the picture by not supporting lend lease and staying out of the way of Japan and Germany.     Of course had this succeeded then the entire world would be under the bilateral sway of Germany and Japan.  The Natzi's needed more politicians like nevil Chamberlain.

U.S Neutrality was slipping away as early as August 1941.

America would have been forced into it sooner or later.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	Yes, they could have avoided war with the U.S.  or at least be in a position of power before hostilities started.      Hitler could have crushed Dunkirk before the evacuation.  He should not have hit Russia, but finished England off.      As for the alliance with Japan, Germany declared war on U.S. mostly because we were already active in the war itself.  We had spent record sums of money on a arms build up before the war.  We had shipped mass amounts of weapons to England, and our destroyers were in the thick of the fighting in the Atlantic by running convoys with England.  I dont believe Roosevelt would have allowed Europe to fall to Germany peacefully.        Jane- the zimmerman notes are from World War I.

Your question implies that you think the United States declared war on the Axis Powers as a group after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  Not so.  The United States declared war on the Japanese Empire on December 8, 1941; and the German Reich declared war on the United States a day or two later -- a huge mistake on Hitler's part.      Churchill wrote in his memoirs that when he heard of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he went home that night and "slept the sleep of the saved," because he knew that the United States would then enter the war and then the outcome would be foreordained.  He knew that Great Britain could not be defeated with the United States as an ally.

As some have said, the terrorists have won if 'Gitmo' is symbolic of how America reacts to events that were literally caused by OUR invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan,    What good will closing it do? Well, for one thing, when we leave and give that little corner of Cuba back to its rightful owner, we can take down the 'virtual' sign that says "Al Qaeda Recruiting Station... come and stay awhile..... maybe years. We'll waterboard you, shyt on your Quran, keep you incommunicado from your family and let you rot here in this tropical Hell. What's not to like.

Not leaving your house because you THINK there is a terrorist standing on the corner shows fear.  The terrorists have won.    EDIT: I can't believe the ignorance I'm seeing here. Closing Gitmo doesn't mean letting all of the detainees go free, it only means putting them into the U.S. Justice system where they will actually be put on trial instead of being held for years and not being able to put them on trial.  .|`|A6q6Ravhaa	Obama wants to score points, points with who i dont know, he might as well bake them a cake  and tuck them in bed each night|`|K6KeN7sgaa	Do you understand what Guantanamo Bay is, and what has been occurring there?

Just more proof that people that voted for Obama were voting for an image, not a qualified politician.  Maybe next time people will think before they vote.

They won't get involved in the more complex issues that they have just spread them around the country and given them rights, attorneys and due process. Guantanamo is a symbol like Abu Grabe that Obama wants to look as if he abolished...along with all of the other "ugliness" of war.     He is getting into the nuts and bolts (kind of like getting a bike and then realizing you have to assemble 3047 parts before you can ride it...and if you do it too fast, thoughtlessly, or make one mistake you could crash and get hurt or worse)...he is finding this out now...the bike box is open and slowly parts and nuts and bolts and instructions are being laid out on the Oval Office rug...it is probably depressing.

It will also be your patriotic duty to pay more taxes. Its only fair that you should pay more because you will get less. All will be in these voluntary programs except of course the politicians.

If you are 17 then in many localities you will be able to open a full bank account anyway. If they demand to see a scanned document you can just send them a fake scanned id (Google+Google images+ Photoshop), it is not that difficult.<br>  <br>  If they don't ask for a scanned document and only want a number, of course you can give them a fake number. More importantly it depends on the type of product you are buying.<br>  <br>  By the way in the 1/1,000,000 chance you get caught for whatever reason, the maximum sentence won't be anything great as you are under 18 and the federal government does not have jurisdiction over minors.<br>  <br>  Also, UPS and Fedex may (rarely, in my experience of ordering alcohol) ask you for id, a low quality fake id will work (as they personally don't care) or have someone else sign for it.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	The process that you are describing is criminal in nature.

By comparison, Obama is spending more money, faster, even less wisely, and with less oversight, to solve a much smaller problem. The New Deal prolonged the Depression by up to seven years - I shudder to think what the New New Deal will do.<br>  <br>  Prediction: Last week's porkulus bill will not be the last, nor the largest.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Both saw government as a tool to attempt to remake all areas of society.  Both saw government programs and spending as the only answer to hard economic times. The programs that both put into place are meant to last for ever. We still have New Deal programs such as social security, the securities and exchange commission, FDIC, and of course Fannie Mae. Likewise programs from the Obama stimulus and any other programs both economic and social are intended to last well beyond this problem.

yhFJzscmaa	This Government growth bill under the guise of stimulus package, that is going to burden our grandchildren or more, is more likely to kick us into a Depression. Why?

t3QAaSN9aa	President Obama is the first African American president.  That is an historically important fact.  This is a nation that has had many very serious racial problems in the past and to ignore the fact of the first African American president would be just hypocritical and unbelievable.    That said, the people who voted for him would have voted for a Democrat anyhow, regardless of color. Obama just happened to be a charismatic candidate and received a lot of attention because of his historical candidacy.  Some people of course would not vote for him because of his color but such individuals tend to be conservative and vote for Republicans anyhow.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	His race did play a huge factor towards many Americans both Black & White & a little in between but he mostly good because of feel good messages....he chanted change change change but yet he didn't stand on any substantial issues|`|KasFZL7laa	this is about 3 months too late buddy.|`|2CxfFENRaa	We don't care what color he is, we are mad that America just elected the worst President EVER just because he is black.

I wonder what that means.|`|avlFGsMAaa	He would not have been voted in if he were black, he is a novelty.  HIllary would have won because she would have been the novelty.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	At the time when President Obama was born, and he's only 47, going on 48, if he or his father lived in much of this country they could not have eaten in many resturants or even used some men's rooms, or rented or owned property in some areas, even in the North.     In most states, his parents' marriage would not have been legal. In Hawaii, where he was born, they were more open about racial intermarriage.     Would people have voted for him if he were all White, some probably would, some did vote for him because of race. Some would have voted for Hilary because she is a woman if she had been the candidate.     As for people voting on racial, ethnic or religious lines, some people voted for JFK in 1960 because he was Catholic, some voted against him because of it. Some voted for Jimmy Carter because he was a born again Evangelistical Christian, others voted against him because of it. There were those who voted for Obama because he is Black and those who would not vote for him because of it. There are many reasons people vote for candidates, ethnic background, religion, what state they are from, age, etc. Some voted against McCain because of age.     Yes, a great deal is made of his race or bi-racial heritage. Much will be made of race until Black Presidents become as common as Black athletes, nobody thinks twice today about an African American baseball player, but when Jackie Robinson played in the 1940's it was a big, big deal. Things change with time.     The biggest problem is, when President Obama makes a mistake, some will blame his race. When Bush made a mistake, at least white people did not blame his being white for something stupid.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	half white/half black..that is the reality and truth of who Obama is.|`|MiulNPYNaa	he's half white half black :P|`|r9lfDeRmaa	deep down people are still racists, and mean people of every color, and when someone who is a minority gains a position that is respectable it all starts over again.

I don't know who would or wouldn't have voted for him based solely on his race[races] .|`|TQge2oBVaa	First off, he hasn't been in long enough to be called "a very good president", and also, he hasn't been doing very good so far.    The democrats are using that as the reason why people didn't vote for him and don't like him. I am NOT racist, and I chose not to vote for him because I don't like his ideals (or lack thereof), NOT because he is black. I think having a black president would be good, as would having a women president so that it isn't an abnormal thing, HOWEVER, I want that person to be a good leader, and Obama doesn't seem like he is going to be. I don'g think many people would have voted for him if he looked white. It is all a stupid popularity contest, and his color won it for him.    And NO I am not republican. Picking sides is stupid, as eventually it gets to you, and you have problems with picking someone because they are on your side, and NOT because they have great ideas like you are SUPPOSE to.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	where have you been the last 10,000 years?        you telling me people all of a sudden are racists like this is something new???|`|0RvtrkYOaa	Seems like the only people who care are the liberals and the media.|`|h6R23ysuaa	He IS white!

yX4xVukPaa	These days things are quite heavily controlled by the CPR (Civil Proceedure Rules).   1. Each party must disclose to the other material relevant to the case (a general rules which applies to all civil cases). There are a handful of exceptions, for example legal privilege.  2. Depending on which track the case is assigned to, there are default provisions for disclosure, ordering and exchanging reports and supplementary questions and so on. In simple PI cases there's likely to be pressure to instruct a single joint expert.    There are "tactics" to litigation, but by and large they are based on second-guessing the court's decision - who will win on this or that point of law, what the appropriate quantum of damages is and so on. Parties are encouraged to settle early in various ways - a negotiated settlement involves less risk (in terms of costs) than a full trial.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	There is an obligation under the rules of civil procedure in England and Wales (and other common law jurisdictions) for a party to reveal to his opponent documents which are damaging to his own case as well as those which help his case. If a solicitor were discovered to have concealed medical reports which just didn't happen to suit his purpose, there could be very serious consequences for him or her. For this reason, medical reports will be passed on when received to the other side. Most of these cases tend to be settled out of court on the basis of counsel's opinion.|`|KpDfWlxVaa	The Solicitors on both sides get all medical reports. In my husbands case the two barristers met on several occasions to discuss the case.  you'll probably find the barristers know each other and usually they will discuss an offer without going to court. My husbands case dragged on for 7 years he accepted the offer although his barrister wanted to take it into court. we felt that he had been through enough over the 7years thats why he just accepted the offer. According to his solicitor it was up to the other side to decide when the case would be taken to court so we weren't prepared to go through anymore waiting.  Good Luck hope your case is a lot quicker
3WYcPsm4aa	Look at active duty military rank structure.  A Sgt. is an enlisted rank, and a Lt. is an officer rank.  A 1st Sgt. is the person who deals with the discipline and morale of the troops.  A Lt. is the bottom of the officer food chain, where all officers start out.    So...Highest rank to lowest with those 3:  1st. Lt.  2nd. Lt.  1st. Sgt.    ETA:  You can.  But, remember, with power and leadership comes responsibility.  Use that power wisely and be a good leader and role model to the "enlisted" members.  Obviously you were chosen because you showed good leadership skills and a positive demeanor.  Do not let your commandant down, nor the other under your command.  Do some research and see what it means to be a good leader, not just a power hungry teenager.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	It goes First LT, Second LT, 1sg. The officer ranks are always higher than enlisted personnel. Technically speaking you can. However for a C/2lt to boss around a C/1sg is very rude. The Cadet First Sargent has more experience than the Cadet Second Lieutenant.|`|V8oGPynoaa	Currently the military is under a new policy where you can't smoke soldiers anymore. Its a whole troop moral thing, which is a shame. So yes you can make them do push ups, but you have to get down and push with them. Thing like calling them to attention, parade rest, and ordering them to fall out are a definite yes. It really all depends on the policies of your command.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	First Lieutenant, 2nd Lieutenant, First Sergeant.      Sergeant is the lowest because it is a non-commissioned officer.  2nd Lieutenant is lower than first lieutenant because it is the first officer rank and Lieutenant is higher than them both. Look at your own link and it shows the ranks in order.  General, Colonel, Lt. Colonel, Major, Captain, Lieutenant, 2nd Lieutenant etc.  The E-3's etc are even lower as they are enlisted ranks.    the ranking system is a hierarchial structure and in the army it is tacked to paygrade.  Just the tradition we have developed and inherited from many years ago.      Edit, yes you can tell your lowers to do push ups, but it would be a quick way to get fragged.  Leadership requires responsibility, and the best leaders lead by example.|`|5pioWG30aa	I was in JROTC.  The ranks of ROTC is just like the ranks of the actual military. Lieutenants are officers, and are appointed ranks. A First SGT is a noncommissioned officer, and is below the rank of officers.  So the rank order is 1LT, 2LT, then FSGT.     An Officer can order enlisted troops to do pushups. However, the correct way to do this is to have a senior SGT ( like a First SGT) handle disclipline. The officer sets the example, gives orders, and controls troops thru NCOs. The senior NCOs are your assistants. Tell them what you want, and let them handle the troop problems. The First SGT will use his assistant SGTs ( SFC,SSG, SGT) to deal with problems.    Do you ever see a battalion commander ( Cadet Colonel) train cadet privates?  No, he/she does it thru Cadet Lieutenants and Cadet SGTs.     Learn to use your NCOs to get things done.

fWP8aBpsaa	Prescription prices in the UK are fixed for all items.  The cost you pay is the same regardless of what it actually costs the NHS.  For some items this a matter of a few pence, for other items this is tens of thousands of pounds per treatment.  So as far as the cost you pay goes it is swings and roundabouts.<br>  <br>  The cost the NHS pays is of course a different matter.  However, it is worth noting at this point that the NHS's sheer size allows it to negotiate significant discounts on prices for medications.  If you want to sell your drug in the UK you have no choice other than to negotiate with the NHS.<br>  <br>  NHS policy is also to prescribe generic versions rather than brand names where generics exist.  A generic version is exactly the same chemical, just it doesn't have a brand name on the box or bottle (e.g. Fluoxetine as opposed to Prozac- Prozac is just Fluoxetine in a fancy box).  When a drug comes out of patent anyone can produce a generic version.  This works in the UK because drugs firms are not allowed to advertise prescription drugs directly to the consumer.  That means non-medical professionals don't go into a surgery demanding a particular treatment they saw advertised regardless of whether it is what they need or because they believe it is in some way better than a generic version.<br>  <br>  As for drugs currently under patent.  Particularly with some HIV drugs (in some African countries HIV infection rates are around 40% and it has brought life expectancy down to the early 30s) , African nations ignore patents and just produce their own generic versions.  Problem is for the UK and the US is that type of policy only works well if you have next to no products of your own under patent.  Otherwise other nations retaliate by allowing a breach of your patents.<br>  <br>  Food might me be cheaper, we probably have western subsidies to blame for that (Look up the likes of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which guarantees prices for farmers).  However, on the flip-side, we also earn more.  In many countries people work for a pound/dollar each day.

T8nap2Pnaa	You keep asking the same question, but the answers can't change. If you really want to get a definitive answer, consult an immigration attorney, but you'll still get the same response. You can't file for a fiance as a green card holder. If you move to Belgium before you become a US ciitzen, you won't get your citizenship. They don't do naturalization overseas except for active soldiers and their spouses. If you're out of the US for over 6 months, you'll mess up your chances to get citizenship. So, unless your fiance can find some status of his own to come here, and people have given you a number of suggestions, you're stuck for the moment. If you did marry him now, you could file an F2a petition for him in the US, but it would take 5 years before it was valid for use. If you became a US citizen, that would upgrade the petition to an IR-1 which would be valid immediately. If you end up doing that, be sure to tell USCIS about your petition so they can act on it.|`|AA11459642	you have to get your citizenship first b-4 you apply for anything.|`|AA11966821	Since you are on a green card, an extended absence can constitute abandonment of your residency.  No citizenship.  Start from scratch if you change your mind in the future.<br>  <br>  After you become a citizen, you can apply for a fiance visa if you plan to marry.  You will need to prove that it is a long-term, committed, "till death do us part" relationship.  And you must prove you have sufficient income and assets to support him and guarantee a $30,000 bond.  It takes about a year.  If approved, he can enter the US, you have 90 days to marry and file for his spousal visa.  He can probably remain in the US while that application is pending.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you're Belgian, he's Belgian.  Assuming he has a job in Belgium.  Why don't you both live and work in Belgium without the expense and hassles?  Plenty of Americans would give their eyeteeth to be able to live in Belgium -- nice place.|`|AA12075268	I would suggest you to petition of a fiance visa and get marry once your partner is here. I believe the process might be longer if you do it back there. Taking in consideration that you are not a US citizen yet, that means that it would take you even longer. I would advise you to wait to do this until you officially become a citizen, once you are naturalized, the process takes so much shorter. Good luck.

In short, I don't think Communism actually exists. Or at least not the way that the original writers intended. It is a flawed ideology because it is TOO idealistic.

The leaders in a state that is "communist" such as North Korea or the former-USSR have TOO MUCH power and it turns authoritarian or totalitarian. Therefore, I believe moderate opinions have more credence simply because we have seen this over and over. Argue anything from leftist socialism to conservative capitalism and I'll listen to your viewpoint. But argue communism or fascism and it has little weight to me.

When you go in front of the judge, try to sound at least a little remorseful.. and I would leave out that you "just wanted to see if the jigglers worked."  Get a lawyer.  It's out of your hands at this point, all you can do is look forward and learn from your mistakes.|`|cvVMJQRZaa	I was told that you could Get anywhere from probation, to 1-6 months in jail just for opening the lock. but it all depends on what your friends told the cop about you. that night.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Because of the value of property stolen...you are looking at a conviction of a misdemeanor.<br>  <br>  A misdemeanor offers up to one year in jail, fines, and court costs!<br>  <br>  In all honesty...I don't see how you could victimize somebody and then whimper like a child after the fact.<br>  <br>  If you want to play "thug" you go to jail like a "thug." <br>  <br>  Hopefully you've learned from your mistake!|`|AA11742929	First of all, the cop won't be the one sending you a letter to appear in court. The courts will send you a notice to appear. It wouldn't hurt to call a lawyer,and get free advice on what kind of jail time you could be facing. It's always good to talk to a lawyer for advice.<br>  You shouldn't have to tell you employer about the probation.But you may have to explain why you need to take the day off work, to go to your probation officers. It's best to be honest up front.
OiAl6w48aa	I don't think anyone can authoritatively answer that.  My guess would be millions.

7DuVshl5aa	Hmm, this seems strange.  First off, if you work and earn your own money (and thus file taxes each year), you should claim yourself as a dependent -- and make sure your deadbeat parents do not claim you as a dependent on their return.  (If I were you -- 17, out of the house, with parents not helping me, I'd also send a letter to the IRS alerting them to look out for my parents tax return to make sure they don't claim you).<br>  <br>  Second, talk to a financial aid counselor at your university.  If what you write above is true (you get no help at all from your parents and don't even live with them), you are most certainly NOT a dependent.
T8nap2Pnaa	So sad, too bad. Doesn't seem like the ICE agent used any force, and he didn't actually arrest and cuff him inside the church. He asked the man to step outside, and he complied. It also doesn't seem like the ICE agent went to the church with the intent to arrest this fellow. He attended church, saw a man he knew to be an illegal alien he had previously deported and a former felon as well. I'd say that's hardly the same as planning a raid on a church, just to bust a bunch of illegals.  Sounds to me like the ICE agent did the best he could under the circumstances.

Tz4N1fpvaa	my answer to this is.<br>  <br>  Yes. I work in the heart of Washington D.C. Obama won it 90% +. In the inner city area, i heard over and over, about how how we were going to finially have a black man as a president. So yes race is a huge factor as who won this election. 80% of a race votes for someone, that shows a very racist accord. If 80% of white people voted for McCain then you would hear the NAACP screaming bloody murder over and over how the white racist community went against Obama because his color..<br>  <br>  So yes, there is more to this then just just people voting for someone about his policy. I will point to one of the comments made in this to prove that there is many issues with race still.<br>  <br>  The term African-American. Shouldn't the term be American of African decent. The country you were born should be first. No i am no black. No i am not racist. I didn't vote for Obama in this election, but give me Powell any day of the week and i would vote him in office. <br>  <br>  There is no such thing as reverse racism, there is only racism btw.<br>  <br>  Long Live unity..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|1cUgE6sZaa	Not me.

But if people judged him based on "he's black and he made accomplishments X, Y, Z and seems to be good for A, B, C." then it's not racist.

Obama was elected because he was by far the better man. McCain and his moron bimbo running mate were a joke. McCain should have been indicted and jailed years ago because of his involvement with the Keating 5. McCain was a traitor to our country for selling us out during his time as a POW (why else do you think his records were sealed.)<br>  The moron racists come on here all the time and ask why Obama has not produced his birth certificate to prove his citizenship. He did produce it and it was authenticated.<br>  If you want to attack or belittle Obama based on facts of his record (facts not innuendo or fantasy) fine. But anything other than that is pure racist crab. Why don't you get a set and admit that you hate him because he is black.<br>  By the way I am white and am proud that I supported Obama. I couldn't care less that he was black. He was just the better man for the job.|`|GPWqokuzaa	while there might be people who voted for him cuz of his color, most wouldn't because he is our present day JFK. Countries around the world were burning McCains picture! The fact that Obama won will let America reclaim its rightful place of being a land where every man is free (until proven guilty without any reasonable doubt). The fact is McCain supporters that change might scare you and you might not agree with his tactics and humor, he will do great overseas and at home, well you have america's voice supporting him.  Stop looking at race and look at his character. McCain is the one who attacked, and poked at Obama as Obama rose above it and just kept stressing to the voters what he believes he needs to change. Give it up you lost republicans and we're not gonna listen to your stupid hes socialist n black and he eats babies. |`|AA10420013	In my opinion,  yes they would.  Lets face it,  many did vote for him just because he is 1/4 black and for no other reason.  And I too feel, if he was white, he would have lost the election, but that is opinion.  Some believe the election was fixed for him to win and it was just a mock to fool the people.  We will just have to wait and see what he tries to do.  I did not vote for him and will not support his government in any way.   Jan 20,  I will consider America under communist rule.|`|z0jgt5qUaa	If people didn't vote for Obama because of his race, than why did so many blacks  show up at the polls who had never voted.   It's not because all of a sudden they became patriotic.   Isn't it obvious they voted for him because his color.  They forget that he's not black he's biracial.  |`|MMbOuf9Xaa	I think Mr King would be thrilled that a black man had been voted into one of the worlds most powerful positions. I doubt its racism. It would be racist not to vote him president just because of his skin colour. I don't think it matters anyway he was a better candidate in my opinion. |`|fpNorwP1aa	Maybe but their definitely stupid. Their policies and integrity should be your guide. Make an informed decision.<br>  <br>  P.S <br>  I voted for Obama|`|Xd0HKmfvaa	No...white people voted for Obama too...that's like saying white ppl cant vote for John McCain.<br>  <br>  but dont worry im white and hate mccain and love obama.|`|abX9Zgkoaa	im white n voted 4 him...just becuz i dnt lke republicans cuz most of them 4rm wat ive heard n experienced are stuck up rich ppl that dnt thank ne body under middle class shuld be helped.|`|VGnY2EV1aa	People who vote for someones because of their skin colour are idiots and shouldn't be allowed to vote. |`|bd8ddb9eb038ef9f856e9df91dca21c6aa	I dont think it was a racist move but I do think it was because of his race.  Make sense?  I think the African-American(I hate hyphenated race crap, we are Americans)voted for him mostly because he is black.  And why wouldnt they?  What a more powerful way to show equality than to have a minority "race" be in power of the most powerful nation in the world.  I would say though that not all voted for him because he is black.  Some voted because of the current situation.  I voted for McCain, not because Barrack is black, but because I believe the security of this nation would be better served under McCain.  I do believe though, as Will Smith said on Oprah "All our excuses are gone now"  Thats right.  No need for affirmative action, no need for the NAACP, you wanted to be treated as equals, the playing field is equal now.  I am happy for the people who needed this to happen to feel equal, I am afraid for the nations security.<br>  <br>  Prophit, I am sorry but the excuse you used to vote is ignorant and irresponisible.  You voted on what you heard?  C'mon.  Do some research.  Here is one non rich guy who was raised Republican who's family HAD to hunt for food, wore plastic shoes that cost $1.50 at Normans, wore hand me down jeans, the nicest car we owned was a 1973 Buick rusted out bucket of bolts and had to spend my summers harvesting wood so we could cook and keep warm in he winter.  Is that the Republicans you HEARD about?|`|kteusmjUaa	No. we are not racist. I am african american. I don't care if the person running instead of Obama was white. The thing is that I am a registered Democrat who doesn't want another Republican in office. Obama being black was just a plus for the African American community because for so long the white man has always been in charge and to be a black man in office makes us sit back and say wow! is this real? Blacks have struggled for years to get where we are today. MLK's speech was inspirational for all.<br>  <br>  So just because I have democratic views, and the person running is black makes me racist? I don't think so. Lots of whites voted for Obama as well. The majority wins and we need change regardless of his skin color.<br>  <br>  Im not gonna lie there are ignorant people out there who voted because Obama is black and i think that's just as sad as people not voting for him because he is black. They are not looking at the issues. The same goes for McCain, some people voted for him because he's white and they don't want to see a black man president. Some don't vote for him because he is white. Sadly there are still racist people out there.|`|vPhVkYUUaa	i guess the fact that he is black should be completely irrelevant. he should be voted in because of his policies and capabilities.<br>  what you are saying is that the fact that he is black worked positively for him. obviously this would be the case with other black americans but they were not the only people (and i am sure there were a few who didn't vote for him) who made him president.<br>  <br>  i think he comes across as a young family man with ideals and values. <br>  <br>  i think if you can say for sure that he was voted in because he is black then yes it is racism, but towards mc cain.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	i don't think they would be considered racist.<br>  but it isn't really fair that he won because of the color of his skin.<br>  there are a lot of people who told me he didn't but i truly believe he did.<br>  he seems to have a nice character but McCain was the American Hero.<br>  he deserved to win.<br>  so i really don't think it was a fair race at all.|`|XkXxaDi3aa	I agree with you, Obama wouldn't have won. Although the people who are uneducated on the subject would probably still have voted for him on the account of him being a good speaker, and younger.<br>  And of course why would the liberals want to vote for McCain? So it's a weird idea. I really couldn't say who would've won. I know a lot of people did vote for him based on race though. I was called racist for voting for McCain, which I was very mad about.<br>  I find it to be racist, yes. There is racism against white people which some don't understand. |`|nbSp469Waa	I know for a fact some people did.  I was in lin at the store and overheard a woman talking to the cashier, she was talking about the election, and said she didn't know anything about either candidate, but voted for Obama because "the country needed some color in the white house".  Which I think is super ignorant, I think when you vote a man into office, you need to vote him in for what he stands for.  I voted for Obama, not because he has white in him, which a lot of people are forgetting, but because I feel he can most relate to people my age.  I agree on a lot of what he stands for, him being part white or black had NOTHING to do with it.  |`|fba450c791c2e5aa34640f936bd5aad7aa	Man you should of wrote that for McCain to run on! He may of won. Oh well give the guy a try{lol see what they voted in},see how screwed up the policies are he has they never worked and never will well its only 4 years.Then Palin can run by her self and all them Dem's will be falling all over themselves to vote for her,lmao...couldn't of said it better myself..|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Give it a rest, dude. The election is over. Let's get on with it. BTW, I am white, retired, and overjoyed that Obama is our President - Elect.
Tz4N1fpvaa	the answer is 271, but every 10 years this number will change, as the population of each state changes. in the 1990's the answer was 198.<br>  <br>  Is it fair, that depends on if you believe that every vote should count, or just the electorial college! I think that the total population should vote. in the current system, less then 1/6th of the population can vote for someone, and they could become president.  That means a clear minority could put someone in office. So is that fair? no, but there is something that could be done about it. The people that didn't vote for the person who won, could get enough votes to impeach/or remove from power in a special election. Just ask Grey Davis of California (and Arnold). He was removed as gov. before the special election put Arnold in.<br>  <br>  So its not fair, but the system does give the people a way to stop this from happening.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Yes, they have enough to win, and yes, it's fair.  They have far more than half the population.  In fact, it's the big states that get cheated by the electoral college.|`|shtP63traa	271 votes.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's fair.  It's what the founding fathers intended when they defined the electoral college in the constitution.|`|iT1YKghxaa	It is fair because it is still based on population, even though it is possible for a president to win without having a majority of votes.

History has showed us that those who serve do not necessarily make better presidents than those who have not served.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  Lincoln never served (3 weeks in the state militia doesn't count), FDR never served. John Adams never served.<br>  <br>  Nixon did.  Carter did. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No, I have never served.|`|Qy174ujuaa	Yes, and no not yet, october im enlisting army|`|LxVnBHI9aa	Yes... <br>  <br>  Going to boot camp April 27th.|`|GXilXsghaa	Yes...|`|cic4J2hzaa	i think so yes|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, certainly not.  That would eliminate every woman.  Military experience is not needed to be president of any country.  In fact, some of the worst dictators have been former military leaders.<br>  No, I was not in the military but my husband served two years in combat in Korea and he is of the same opinion.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	No. Some of our greatest presidents never did. Bush "served" in the military (if you can call going AWOL serving) and he was a train wreck.|`|AA12281247	As a former spoiled brat who survived 4 years in the Navy, I agree that nobody should be allowed to serve in Congress or as President ( includes VP, nu?) unless they have served in the armed forces or had a child who served.<br>  Ignorance on the limits of military power gets leaders into political trouble, recent examples abound.<br>  Read the pretty good book ( terrible movie ) "Starship Troopers" wherein only veterans of government service are citizens, all others residents. <br>  Without the demonstrated willingness to serve, the desire to lead is suspect.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	No.<br>  <br>  I am a veteran and would like someone who has served to be president, but I don't think it should be a requirement.<br>  <br>  The President should have military advisers.  People who are Secretaries of Defense, and others (Sec. Navy, Sec Army) should be veterans.<br>  <br>  The reason I think civilians should be able to be president is because even though being Commander and Chief is a big part of the presidency, there ae other areas the president has to be good at. Balancing the budget, foreign policy, domestic policies and other stuff.<br>  <br>  I don't want the military to run the country. We don't need to be in a dictatorship or have a Coup. That is why we are allowed to freely elect our leaders.<br>  <br>  Running the country and protecting the country are two different things. I would vote for a former military person if they met all other requirements and I thought that they could do the job.<br>  <br>  Former Navy Corpsman (14 years of service.)|`|A728LXj6aa	No.  Why should they be?  The President is in charge of all facets of the United States, not just military action.  Should he also need to be a lawyer to understand the bills he passes,  or a teacher to truly know how to improve our educational system, or a foreign diplomat to know how to deal with other countries?|`|LwPcGpAOaa	No, and to the person who said this would disqualify women.  WHAT?  Women serve too.  I worked with them for 8 yrs while I was in.
673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	If you owed back child support and were expecting a tax return you probably will not be getting it.  In TX if you are behind in child support they hold your tax return and send to the parent it is owed to.  It is then subtracted from the total amount you owe.  Hope this helps!!!|`|jKDZlgMiaa	If the mother of your child has taken on the responsibility of raising your child by herself, can't you at least take on the responsibility of getting your child yourself (making the short road trip) without the ex having to do even more?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you were minimally involved in the entire divorce and the custody issues. You should have asked at the time of your hearing that travel be divided. You can go back to court but there's no telling what the judge will decide and that could be more of hassle than just doing the driving yourself. You'll figure out a way if you want to do it bad enough.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Basically, reasonable visitation rights are the state mandated visitation rights that just about every non custdian parent gets if theres no prior agreement worked out before court between parents which is usually every other weekend and every other Wednesday and alternate holidays and birthdays. Now you can request the courts to help compromise travel time and mileage, but no guarantee youll get it. now as for your tax refund, the amount will be placed against what you owe and chances are that should bring you up to current with no more back support owed and your current support payment should be readjusted to reflect the paying of back support.

You liberals can't back up ANY half witted argument on this one.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	What's the matter? Don't you like the way he is cleaning up corruption? As far as I'm concerned, he can be both financially responsible and he is improving his own career chances for something better. I would vote for him for president in a heart beat.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	With the Governor what you see it what you get watch out dems in 2012!|`|lpwcqkNbaa	Mostly his own career he has set eyes for Jindal 2012|`|a6k5WZxGaa	I think the GOP governors are buying into the madness... its just a political stunt.

0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Human rights must be upheld and China must respect the rights of the people over the interests of the government.|`|PBrDYFNwaa	You don't owe an allegiance to any one but yourself.  Human rights is a difficult subject and is often used by people and government who have their own agenda for attacking another country or part of society, while human rights in their own back yard is being ignored.<br>  <br>  Just jumping on their band waggon can often make life much harder for the people they are claiming to help.  It can often offer false hope to people and get them killed and make life harder for those left.  Just reading your question shows you have not thought much about human rights and don't know much about the subject.  Why pick China when they are not the only abusers of human rights?  We should always stand up for human rights but first consideration must always be that we don't make conditions worse for those we are trying to protect.<br>  <br>  Changing the attitude of people every where so they look at their own back yard first and stop the abuses from within is more important than attacking from the outside.   I have talked to Chinese people and Chinese soldiers who consider Tibetans to be rubbish people but I  also talked to American and Australian soldiers after the Vietnam war who felt the same way about the Vietnamese.  Until attitudes within a country changes stopping human rights abuses is difficult if not impossible, as attacks from outside can unite those within against the people you are trying to protect.<br>  <br>  People every where have a right to food, housing, medical care, education, respect, work and protection under the law. If your country is not providing those you should be doing some thing about it before shouting about other countries|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	The Chinese people have little human, or civil rights. Their government keeps them from being free. However, the Chinese middle class is growing faster than any country in the world. They are allowed to own stores, businesses, buy homes and have many off the same luxuries we have in this country, as long as they play to the tune of the Chinese government.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there is also an extremely high poverty level in China, which includes most of its population outside the big cities and in the rural areas. <br>  <br>  I feel we should cut off all relations with any country that keeps its people under the government thumb, but thanks to Bush we owe God knows how much money to the Chinese government which makes us keep our ties with them open. Just another Bush disaster. One of hundreds he created for us.|`|TrgbEjXoaa	We should abide by the human rights rules we have demanded for our own citizens.  Owing allegiance means owing loyalty, and I don't think we owe a particular loyalty to the Chinese.  We should be humane, decent, use diplomacy instead of bombs, just be good people.

He’s supported a tax increase on guns and ammunition. He has voted against self-defense in the home when he was in the Illinois State Senate,” she noted. “Over and over, Barack Obama has voted against the Second Amendment.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Joining the NRA chorus is the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) that points to a couple of Obama appointments as indicative of the coming pro-gun control administration, <br>  <br>  <br>  The nomination of Eric Holder for the post of attorney general of the United States sends an alarming signal to gun owners about how the Barack Obama administration will view individual gun rights, the Second Amendment Foundation warned in a news release. <br>  <br>  <br>  “Eric Holder signed an amicus brief in the Heller case that supported the District of Columbia’s handgun ban, and also argued that the Second Amendment does not protect an individual right,” argued SAF founder Alan Gottlieb. “He has supported national handgun licensing and mandatory trigger locks. As deputy attorney general under Janet Reno, he lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would have curtailed legitimate gun shows. <br>  <br>  <br>  “This is not the record of a man who will come to office as the nation’s top law enforcement officer with the rights and concerns of gun owners in mind,” he observed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Holder’s nomination -- like the appointment of anti-gun Illinois Congressman Rahm Emanuel as White House chief of staff -- tells American gun owners that Obama’s campaign claims supporting the Second Amendment were empty rhetoric,|`|F5GyrdQfaa	In what way?

After all, the deficit is merely a single-year figure, and so it would be silly to compare that to forty years of spending.<br>  <br>  However, to address your question, since foreign aid amounts to less than 1% of the budget, and the interest alone on the national debt it about 12%, it is obvious that the debt absolutely dwarfs the foreign aid totals.

28yMpUfSaa	"The terms were apparently first used in the French Legislative Assembly after the revolution of 1789. In that context those who sat on the right side of the assembly were steadfast supporters of the dethroned monarchy and aristocracy — the ancien régime — (and hence were conservatives) while those who sat on the left opposed its reinstatement (and hence were radicals). It should follow from this that libertarians, or classical liberals, would sit on the left." - Sheldon Richman <a href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0706b.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0706b.asp</a><br>  <br>  By the way, the question never mentions "the founders."

LJkPRqN0aa	first of all its nice to know that you know it was stupid. stealing can become an addiction if you didnt know that already. so i suggest you get some help with someone to talk to about that. secondly you could get probation but there is a real posibility that you could go to juvi not JAIL just juvi..but since it is your first offense you will probably do probation and community service. usually your school grades will have nothing to do with anything....school credentials doesnt get rid of the fact that you stole something or a number of things...|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Well usually crimes like that aren't considered jail time unless it is $300 or more. They will probably give you a warning, or community service or something. Just let this be a lesson to you and know not to do it again. I know that lots of teens have that stealing phase, but the important thing is getting over it.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	do what your mom says, and the cops and the judge|`|flkVehA9aa	You are a juvenile and this is your first offense.  You will probably get probation.  Probation just means they are going to watch you very closely to make sure you don't do anything else stupid.  If you do something like this again it will be very bad.   <br>  <br>  If you were an adult it would be much worse.  You would have a criminal record and it would be very difficult to get a good job and support you family. <br>  <br>  Don't ever even think about doing something like this again,  It can completely mess up your life.  Be thankful that we give kids a second chance.|`|TxIa3s5Faa	I am a manager of a store so here goes.You wont go to jail for this offense You will get punished, most likely you will have to do community service.

Guess you better get a baby sitting job to pay them back. And that's if anyone will trust you in their homes not to steal from them. See how this works. Now people you know wont want to let you out of their sight. if you'd steal from a store. whats to stop you from stealing from them..you will need to work at getting TRUST back in your life,|`|6Gfz125Paa	No, you won't go to jail.

What's the matter...didn't like the answers?
uSeApMt9aa	First offense retail theft?. I doubt you will get probation. You will probably get a 6 month continuance where if you stay out of trouble for 6 months all charges will be dropped. If you do go on probation you will need to show up to court every week and sign in till you serve your sentence. You will need to pay usually around 30$ a month fee. The fee can be more or can be less. Since you are a minor there is a chance of getting put on CHINS. Child in need of service. Meaning the courts will monitor your school work. Give you a curfew which is usually 6PM. And some other rules to abide by. You do seem sincere in your apology. Just realize you made a mistake and it CAN'T happen again. Also they may drug test you randomly. <br>  <br>  <br>  Forgot to include the tips- Just listen to the judge and your lawyer. Show respect, always say your honor. Not mam or sir. They respect your honor mostly. Sincerely apologize for your mistake. And kissing butt won't hurt.

C=SPAN hosts would be fired if they showed any sign of partisanship whatsoever.  Brian Lamb is the father of the channel, but most of their hosts are far less petty than Larry King, who runs a for-profit, entertainment show.  C-SPAN is not for profit.

They don't use pundits or opinion people, only the actual government employees and officials whose job it is to do the work.  It's up to the viewer to understand, and make judgments on how to the vote or which programs to advocate for, and which arguments don't hold water.|`|JpvXhgmraa	Well it certainly isn't Sean Hannity or Bill O now is it?<br>  <br>  I don't know though, I don't watch Larry King, he's boring to me|`|y9vqyqeNaa	Larry King is great, but the most unbiased newsman around today is Jim Lehrer.|`|iLCfU1rTaa	yes he is pretty non biased.

64ef40bfea69a52c85daf6104a54abbfaa	I've only lived in a small town in Alabama for a couple of months but I notice that in my apartment complex there is caucasians, africans, and latinos all in the same building and there seems to be no problems but everyone pretty much keeps to themselves. Before I moved here I lived in by Detroit and people pretty much kept to themselves also but there were no huge issues besides gang related issues.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	Although I am in the North, in Philadelphia, we are highly segregated here.  Read Jonathan Kozol's SAVAGE INEQUALITIES for descriptions of how segregated the school system is.  We have a 50% dropout rate in our public schools.<br>  <br>  I happen to be white and live in a white area.  I was SHOCKED last year when a black family tried to move in....the ROWHOUSE WAS TORCHED and racist graffiti was found in the neighborhood.<br>  <br>  What year is this, 1908?  Wake up, people!  Stop being ignorant, prejudiced, closed-minded, gang thugs.|`|tUq6qU3Naa	It does not appear that the blacks are in favor of integration.  When 90+% vote for black, Oprah forfeits her 'neutrality'  to back a black, 95% cheered for O.J';s release,  the majority of his congregation  cheered for Rev Wright, and follow Jesse Jackson over the cliff.  And NO ONE pays homage to the 370,000 Whites that were killed to free the slaves.  Integration of your neighbor hood is the death knell of your home value and your safety on the streets.  As well as  peace and quiet in your home area.|`|NyQjxmydaa	It's pretty much the same in England and the world come to that,<br>  but there's no profit in that so the governments and the liberal nanny hug a this that or the other try playing the integration card when in fact we are more akin to follow our animal cousins<br>  you don't get Lions laying with Elephants but they live along side them<br>  most races creeds tribes etc will find protection in being with their own kind, about time those in charge ? started realizing it|`|otKIUViRaa	I believe people have come together to make a change in our government and race relations have improved.

I sincerely wish we could just get the hell past all of this and treat each other with common dignity and mutual respect. With those two principles in mind perhaps we could all perhaps be a little more forgiving of the occasional sip that might occur.The unfortunate part is that there are individuals that make a living out of  raising cain over the slightest infraction perceived or real empowering and enriching themselves in the process.

My words haven't been written in the dictionary.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	If they don't want it, they don't have to take it.<br>  <br>  But I suspect that the part they are rejecting (unemployment benefits money) will tick off enough of their constituents that they will change their mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And what Bobby Jindal (LA), Mark Sanford (SC), and Haley Barbour (I believe that was his name, Mississippi Gov.) is complete bullsh*t.  Either take the money or don't.  Either support this stimulus or don't.  They are waffling because they want to take credit for all the benefits that the package will bring, while still being able to attack Obama.  They need to quit playing games.<br>  <br>  Mark Sanford has already lost my vote over his foolishness.  If he chooses to take no money, I'll give him another chance.  If he chooses to take all the money, I'll give him another chance.  But if he is going to continue with this bullsh*t of his, and that is precisely and totally what he has been doing so far, then he has lost my vote.  <br>  <br>  <br>  And if they won't take the money, then I know plenty of other states will take it.  Probably states like New York or Massechussetts, the states actually paying for this stimulus so that South Carolina and Mississippi can benefit.

Zdj6wmaiaa	I think its a good point, and really a bailout of this magnitude is essentially nationalization without the safeguards in place.

The problem is that we do not have enough of these qualified buyers and so as the inventory of unsold homes keeps growing the price of homes keep declining. <br>  <br>  That makes the qualified buyer wary of jumping for fear that the housing crisis will continue to drift downward, which is a self-fulfilling prophecy because unless qualified buyers start buying the real estate market can only continue its decline. Hence the tax credits for first-time  home buyers in the economic stimulus bill.<br>  <br>  It's a foreclosure crisis until qualified buyers come back into the marketplace, but they won't buy their way into the game as long as the market for residential real estate resembles a Catch-22 situation. In fact, as first time buyers it serves their interests to see the real estate market continue to fall to lower and lower levels. That hurts the value of homes owned by responsible homeowners as much as the value of homes owned by irresponsible homeowner. <br>  <br>  You can't protect home values by harping on hanging the irresponsible out to dry. Without qualified buyers to replace the irresponsible homeowner you leave all homeowners out to dry.

The best thing that could happen right now would be for Obama to stop the quick buy and sell of stocks that is being done by speculators. It is affecting grain markets as well as the stock markets in a negative manner. Obama should immediately pass legislation that requires that ALL investments be for long term....at least a minimum of sixty days...but preferably a year. That would end the wild fluctuations and allow the market to correct itself based on simple supply and demand....which is the way it should have been in the first place.

AA11414292	It would depend on the circumstances,<br>  If you have given the police the need to search you the quite a few thing could be classed as an offencive weapon and a pocket with a blade under three inches could be taken to be a weapon in a public place.<br>  years ago the defence used by Teddie boys who used to carry a variety of knifes was " i was carrying it to peel fruit" which was covered by the law but not now. As I have said if you are carrying a knife to not get in to any situation were you could be searched IE Airports Police stations Court building's or any government building.<br>  Its a troublesome time .<br>  Oh and the rubbish about Muslims any body could find them self's the wrong side of the law it they are stupid enough to put them self's in that position.<br>  To our law friend its one thing to have it in a book but its the interpretation of the law what really counts|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	No problem with bladed weapon legislation, as long as the blade is under 3" and doesn't lock. It could, depending on the circumstances, be deemed an offensive weapon.  In other words if you took it out with you on the town, in clubs & pubs etc. you have no legitimate reason to have it with you and can be "done".<br>  <br>  On the other hand there is an allowance in the legislation for old boys who of habit have always carried a penknife, or granny who always has a little knife in her handbag for peeling fruit and cutting a nice slice of cake.  In short, it depends. <br>  <br>  I always carry a leatherman type tool, with blade, on me during the day, it's handy fxing recalcitrant machines, on the boat, in the garden, in the car etc., but I wouldn't dream of taking it with me when going out for the evening.|`|ZK23yWZqaa	Not if you are an illegal immigrant, a Muslim or one of our so disadvantaged black youths.   If you are white, a boy scout or need it for work then watch out.|`|ZH91TAHPaa	No!<br>  Any more than 3 inches and it's illegal though!|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	It is illegal to carry any knife or bladed object, including a pen knife, without a good reason.  So keep it in your house unless you need it for a particular reason, and try not to take it out without some kind of proof of why you are carrying it.<br>  <br>  Usually the police don't really care about penknives, but in the current climate if you are caught with it without proof of a good reason for carrying it you would probably be arrested.|`|Oyktk3rHaa	i wouldnt tell anyone that u have it but yeah|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	No<br>  <br>  You will have to surrender it temporarily if you enter a Govenment building, such as a Courthouse.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	no its ok as its below 3.5 inches.<br>  Also its not against any 'law' to carry weapons ,its against an 'act' .There is a big difference.<br>  Also you can carry any size knife with a 'lawful excuse' which is very open and leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre. Eg If I buy a machete legally from a shop then obviously i can carry it home (even on public transport) as i have a lawful excuse that i have to be able to transport it home.
85kWzSzuaa	Nobody ever really talked about it. I think there should be an investigation into what happened that day. Was it a terrorist attack? Was it George Soros? Was it an international conspiracy to weaken our economy? Why does nobody care about this?|`|HlTF3X3Baa	here's an answer I gave, to a different question, but I think it's related.<br>  <br>  I usually don't give much credence to conspiracy theories, but this crises is suspicious because I think there IS a coalition which has the means and motive. The way the price of oil collapsed so rapidly is a clue.<br>   <br>     The coalition is the democrats ( with much support from the very wealthy, and how about all that govt. employee pension money) and middle east/ muslim countries. This is enough money to provide the means. The motivation is obvious- political victory. That covers means and motive. Creation of economic distress is a strategy popular on their side. (google "cloward- piven strategy", also marxist tactics)<br>        Of course I have no proof, and I don't know if proof is even possible. But :I think it's highly suspicious the way that oil prices were bid up so steep and rapid, then collapsed. Did the mere possibility of our government discussing the removal of  restrictions on drilling do it?(which would increase supplies far in the future)  I think the public clamor for increased drilling was too repugnant to the global warming wing of the democrat asylum, so that strategy was abandonded. Rapid selling of large holdings is likely to depress the price - large holders wouldn't be rapid about it , unless they KNEW that the game was over.<br>       And then there's the bank failure aspect. Banks are in the business of loaning out more money than they actually have. The amount they are allowed to loan out is a multiple of the amounts deposited with them  Any bank can be put right into bankruptcy by enough rumours causing depositors to withdraw their money. What I would do is this: Deposit large sums of money with the bank. The best time to do this would be when they are on top of the world - this will allow them to get overextended. The mark to market rules, allowance of naked short selling, and elimination of the uptick rule created an ideal environment. (SEC is run by govt. employees dwelling in the urban east - whose side are they likely to be on) Then, during the almost inevitable decline which follows a peak, withdraw the money. start rumours that large deposits are being withdrawn. Buy a bumch of low priced puts - investors watch for this kind of thing, and will say "wow somebody put down a big bet that lehman is going bankrupt soon". Selling of lehman shares will drive the price down, they'll be unable to raise money by selling shares. Credit rating agencies will downgrade ratings. <br>        The exact timing of the banks demise is uncertain. Notice that Lehmans collapsed Sept. 15th. That's where the markets really went downhill.

To me if it comes from the earth there is no way the government should be able to tell you what you can do with it.  Only in the case that it is 100% natural though.  Coke and Heroine and Meth all have crap added to them and those are stupid as hell to do.  Weed doesn't lead to anything else if your smart about it.

347fb8576a811fa85542bd830925e112aa	Great Question and one that needs to be revised at times for Ron Paul and his supporters millions of them by the way believe in the constitution no matter how much main stream media likes to discount the most important and relevant document ever to promote individual freedom for all.<br>   If anyone were to read "a foreign policy of freedom " a book written on all his lectures and speeches to congress one would know he is indeed a genius or a prophet. For this man has predicted everything that has occurred from  these corrupt governments we have been given in the last 30 years, that has veered so far from the constitution it now ranks the USA as number 37 on the most free countries to live in.<br>   There are many notable people that supported Ron Paul but we wouldnt know this by watching our TV's for instance:<br>  the Late Ronald Reagan<br>  Bill Maher<br>  Pat Buchanon<br>  Jesse Ventura<br>  Mike Gravel<br>  John Mayer<br>  Neil Cavato<br>  Tucker Carlsen<br>  Ed Asner<br>  too many more to mention but this short list gives the diverse and intelligent showing again that freedom brings people together and when you call Ron Paul supporters crazy your dam right. We are crazy for a man that has held public office for 30 years and been honest and does what he says he will. Never once going against the rule of law set forth by the constitution. Tell me just one that has not veered from the constitution and been more of a fighter for the American peoples best interest. You would have to be crazy not to be a Ron Paul supporter for it is he and only him you could call a statesmen.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Because some mainstream media outlets told them to think like that.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul is actually awesome and extremely principled.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Republicans passed him off as a nutjob BECAUSE he didn't buy into <br>  <br>  their war in Iraq<br>  their war on drugs<br>  their war on the middleclass|`|LBjRXESIaa	The corruption in the government has corruption in the media. Corrupt friends stick together.<br>  If Ron Paul were to get elected it would bring fear in to the chain of corruption. <br>  Look at people like Mrs Bill Orelly. He is a big ignorant childish d*ck. This is who people look up to and respect. America has lost it's control and it's way. If George Washington were to run in modern day times, he would suffer the same results as Ron Paul.<br>  By calling names it takes the focus of all the corruption and puts the focus on little things that keep immature minds off corruption.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	It only seems to be Americans who think he's a nut, and only Republicans at that! It's probably because he's done what no other Republican dares, and stepped outside the Party line. What he says makes perfect sense to the rest of the world, and standing up as the lone voice of reason never won anyone any friends! (well, not in his line of work, it didn't)|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Because he is a true individual, not somebody (like McCain) who is willing to compromise everything in order to fit into the mold required by his party. ∠°)|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Well with gold at $1,000 I think it's clear that he knows what he's talking about.
Ft78AcWjaa	In terms of size of armed forces, Iran has 600,000 troops compared to Israels 200,000.<br>  <br>  In a conventional war (no nukes), the land battle could be won by the Iranians, ie a ground  invasion of Israel would be possible, Iran could just swamp Israel with troops.<br>  <br>  At sea and in the air Israel would win easily as of course they have tons of US sponsered technological hardware.<br>  <br>  Ultimately Israel would win because: <br>  1) Israel wouldnt think twice against using nukes.<br>  2) "Zionist" (you know what I really mean) controlled america would stick by israel no matter what<br>  <br>  Make no mistake though, if that war was to happen it would be carnage and Israel would lose thousands of troops as well as Iran.|`|0Yyl68oDaa	That depends on when and how hostilities start.    Iran is already waging war against Israel via its proxy, Hamas.   The current American administration has given green light to Iran to continue its goal to destroy Israel.   <br>  <br>  While many (reform, conservative(liberal), and JINO Jews vote for Obama, he is not trusted by the Orthodox who actually support Israel.  <br>  <br>  I sadly seeing Obama, sending Carter to the region to inflame the problems.   Carter's Anti-Semitic rants in his talks and books have not be received well by Israelis or Orthodox Jews in America.<br>  <br>  I can conceive that this administration will withhold support for Israel if and when Iran actively  bombs another pizza shop.|`|diZoW49Zaa	Israel, it would be no contest. Israel don't screw around with ground troops in conflict like that, they would air strike any offensive weapons or troops that Iran was able to muster until there was nothing left but goo and glass.|`|tZabic1Xaa	Israel would use there usual cowardly tactics fo airstrikes etc. And as the guy above me points out, they have a huge nuclear arsenal.|`|fyhl3TQgaa	Israel, without question, they're by far the more capable force, with international backing.|`|98JZcrO6aa	Israel, they have the USA backing them and it isn't sure whether Iran has nukes whilst Israel definitely has them.|`|7EkeIcw4aa	I'm sure all the democrats here and the staff at yahoo answers want Iran to win.|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	Israel for sure! They have God behind them, and no man can defeat God.|`|uZ1kI4BUaa	It does no matter who "wins", the matter is that USA and Israel will get more enemies. Is simple arithmetic: More bombs dropped=less friends for USA.<br>  More children killed by your army=more terrorists against your country.<br>  If USA changes its behaviour: more hospitals for poor countries=more friends for USA.<br>   Math simply. God bless you. Is it so hard to do?|`|NEkssyeAaa	Silly question.

It's called air superiority, and in modern warfare, if you don't have it, you don't win. The idea in warfare is to kill the other guy without him having even a shot at you. Nothing fair about it, but c'est la vie, c'est la guerre.<br>  On this basis alone, I give the edge to Israel. They have, by far, the best equipped and best trained Air Force in the entire Middle East. Never mind nukes. Never mind the US helping out.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	I hope Israel would, if they don't they'll fire off all of their nukes and that would be a very bad thing.<br>  <br>  Check out the "samson option"|`|6wSmZrrsaa	OF course Isreal will win, the only question what will we do when Russia trys to enter the war and help Iran|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Neither.

(No-one  would have put the genius Paul Erdos in a position where he could have done any harm, and Heisenberg was an enthusiastic Nazi).<br>  <br>  As far as Einstein had any political ideas, they were a commonplace mish mash of the socialism of the early 20th century, parroted in endless journals and lecture halls around Europe by a million small minds.  <br>  <br>  You can read them here:|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Your question is absolutely funny I nearly p**d in my pants.|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Einstein of course.

hmA8nfA2aa	Any branch would be great. Having military experience almost always gives people an edge when trying to become a police officer. Having military experience is a great asset if you want to become a police officer. It doesn't really matter what branch you choose. You should explore all of them, and try to determine which one you would enjoy more. If you want to become a police officer, you should also consider earning a college degree before, during, or after your time in the military. Many people earn college credits and/or degrees while in the service. There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a police officer. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer.

Good luck!|`|ZRc8wz3Oaa	I work for a retired chief for one of the toughest cities in California. I have no personal preference but my chief always says the best military person for a police officer is an army or non at all. The problem with military lifestyle is you see that most often they are use to a black and white standard. In police work you have to use a lot of discretion and make your own decisions while sticking within the law and department policy.

AA11494150	No, you will not. Simply being at a party is not illegal. However, if you are the owner/renter, you can be charged with providing alcohol even if you are not drinking. <br>  <br>  The first thing our department does when investigating an underage party is separate the drinkers from the non-drinkers, and send the sober ones on their way, or call a parent to pick them up. <br>  <br>  However, many people have planned on going to a party with no intent to drink, but peer pressure can be strong and they wind up drinking anyway. Your best course would be to stay away.|`|AA12041870	If you are underage at the party, if the party gets busted, you will go down with the rest of them.|`|owzmt7lDaa	What you should do is go and enjoy, if police breakup the party and you are detained you are only obligated to give them your name and address (possibly another piece of id), but you are not obligated to give your DOB or consent to anything else, then ask the officer if you are free to go. You still may be detained however the charges will either be dropped or your lawyer will be able to get you out of it due to a lack of evidence. <br>  <br>  Remember this tip it is the Terry Stop law.<br>  <br>  PS As long as you didn't consent to Breathalyzer or lie to a police officer about your identification you will be ok.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	Someone I know, who was over 21, went to a drinking party and didn't drink.

You leave him alone!|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	Then how come the polls are still favoring his presidency at 60%?  I would think he'd be in the 40s.|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	I work with 50 people who all voted for Obama, and they all still support him. So my unscientific study trumps yours.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	It's been 30 days....I gave Bush longer than that.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes, I still support Obama.   He has been in office just for a month, and has had some serious issues in front of him.   I don't understand why anyone thought that Obama could magically fix everything and make everything better.<br>  <br>  Does anyone here honestly think that McCain would have been doing any better with the economic issues.  Especially since he admitted he didn't understand the economy as well as he should.<br>  <br>  Between the two choices, I am glad that Obama is in the hot seat and not McCain at this point in time.  <br>  <br>  Like I said, it's only been a month.  Give the guy a chance at least.  <br>  <br>  I didn't vote for Bush but I gave him 3 years before I decided he was an awful POTUS.|`|8b599d1b072318cc6f3477236affec7eaa	I support him still, yes. It's great to see how he has done more to tackle the country's woes in his first month in office than Bush did in his entire eight years. It's never easy cleaning up after the elephant has stomped through and created a mess but someone has to do it. <br>  <br>  And sometimes the best decisions are not always the most popular ones. Americans went on an unchecked orgy of consumerism in the past decade with no thought for the morrow. Who the hell did they think was going to pay for all this crap? That it was all going disappear into some vortex never to be heard from again? Credit cards, mortgages, golden parachutes, inflated housing prices, etc.?  Let this be a good slap on the wrist for those who created and contributed to this fiasco and a wake up call to those who sat by idly watching it happen.|`|nRszNpotaa	I'm brave enough to admit that people who support Republican Cons or Democratic Libs have been making a mistake for quite some time now and "We The People" have gotten little of any Government "For The People"!  <br>  <br>  When will people on both sides be willing to admit they are ill informed and too loyal for their own good and very good (in their undying loyal ignorance) for the politicians who don't mind.?|`|YCL50xgnaa	I still support him and have no problem doing so.  I'm getting a good laugh at the Republican tools falling all over themselves in their attempts to 'save' their pathetic political careers by catering to the radical right-wing minority whiners (all whine, no solution), all the while holding their sweaty little palms out wanting some of that stimulus money.  Why do Republicans hate their country so much?|`|DoHaUEziaa	Honestly yes. Seriously though, if I were your boss, I'd tell you to either get to work or find another job.

If you don't have a solution then you're part of the problem.|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Yes, Neocon. I still do support president Obama. Why is that Neocon, anyone must admit that they made a mistake. Your question is purposely misleading in order to make people believe that Obama is bad president. Isn't it, Neocon?|`|PC3zDev1aa	He has followed through on every thing he said he would do. I am more than satisfied. I am support our President in his efforts. I only wish more people could give him more than month in office before passing judgment.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Since I'm not a Republican I will support the President. I don't think his current stimulus plan will help anything, but I don't want him or the country to fail.|`|2rcSILkWaa	I realize that may be hard for those with limited mentality to comprehend, but those of us with functioning brains are fine with everything so far.|`|vqaleXR6aa	I'm going to keep it short and sweet Obama has done a dame thing wrong.HELLO wake up people since the election my school went from 97% obama to 100% so ur studies are wrong get a life I LOVE OBAMA not in that way though!|`|wgUxC9CXaa	I never voted for him, so I have no regrets.<br>  <br>  I am LAUGHING at the fools who did as they shake their heads and look confused and hurt.|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	Thats correct.  If they dont admit "buyer remorse" at the moment,  They will eventually.|`|12m9145haa	His approval rating has dropped to about 67%|`|o0JEkGCjaa	I sure can.<br>  I seriously, without one doubt in my mind, trust him.|`|1CidOxbyaa	obama supporters are stupid. they think that just because we don't like him its because we are racists. i bet half the votes he got were from white people not wanting to be racist.|`|6asLzGV7aa	He by far better than Bush.<br>  <br>  He's cleaning up Bush's colossal mess.  It's going to get worse before it gets better.<br>  <br>  Just think, if Bush wouldn't have been president we wouldn't have to worry about a stimulus bill.
Gezfmghuaa	Short answer, nope.<br>  <br>  Unless contractually obligated, an employer is generally not obligated to give you any hours, under the law most states are considered 'employment at will'.   Under FMLA they are required to offer you an equivalent position (waitress) but the 'at will' status applies to all of the waitresses there, so they are covered.|`|AA10045620	They do not have to give you the same hours you had before you basically left their employ.  They do not have to even give you a job of any kind back to you.  They needed your hours filled and did so.  You should be lucky you are getting any hours there.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	no they have to allow you to come back to work but don't have to give you many hours. i think you need a better job. <br>  it also may be do to the economy maybe its slow and don't need much staff.|`|0DOZKXwRaa	Depends where you live. Some places they have to give you the same conditions as befroe you left, and some places they don't even have to give you your job back. <br>  Can you survive on less hours than you used to have? Could it be that the business is just slower because of the economy?|`|aFC72tLZaa	In this economy, thank God they are giving you any hours.
iHna2K7Gaa	I can't answer your question, but I can tell you that you have NOTHING to worry about. I went through the application process in high school SO WORRIED that I wouldn't get the scholarship, then I came to college and they let pretty much ANYBODY into the program. Unless you're wanting to get into West Point, then you should do just fine. The university ROTC programs try to get anyone they can (especially nursing majors) because they get more funding that way.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, feel free to message me. :)

a66nvk0taa	Jules bad news I'm afraid:<br>  Applications for the 2008 Work in Britain program are no longer being accepted. As a result of changes in UK immigration rules, the present Blue Card program ends on December 31st, 2008. However, the deadline for the issuance of 2008 Blue Cards has now passed and we regret that no further cards can be issued. Anyone already holding a Blue Card has until the end of the year to enter Britain (see below re Entry Clearance).<br>  <br>  Since 1966, more than 200,000 US students have spent up to six months living and working in Britain through this program. Taking part on Work in Britain has enabled thousands of participants to experience Britain from the inside while working in every kind of job from interning for Members of Parliament, to serving at a Buckingham Palace banquet, to a summer job in the city of London, to a housekeeping role in a Scottish country house hotel and so much more!'<br>  <br>  Discussions are currently under way between the US and UK governments regarding future reciprocal work program opportunities for young people. It is hoped that an agreement will be reached in the near future and that the BUNAC Work in Britain program will be available to US participants for 2009. Please watch the BUNAC website for an up-to-date information on the program.<br>  <br>  UK entry deadlines<br>  The Blue Card must be activated within a semester of your last period of full-time study in the USA or university study abroad program, and in any case, no later than December 31st, 2008. Participants planning either (1) to arrive in the UK on or after November 26th, 2008, or (2) to temporarily leave and then return to the UK after that date must obtain Prior Entry Clearance* from a British Consulate before November 26th and before leaving the USA. If this applies to you, please call BUNAC for further information.<br>  <br>  The Blue Card is valid from the day you first enter Britain and expires six months later whether you work or not. Although there is no minimum participation time, unless you have a pre-arranged job and accommodation, we suggest you plan to go for at least eight weeks.<br>  <br>  *The entry clearance fee is currently ￡205 (approximately $435) plus postage. Entry Clearance Visa processing is currently taking 4 weeks.

It's easy to be critical of a new president, and he is a Democrat so if you have conservative Republican values, then he is going to be on the "wrong" side of many of your concerns. However, I can honestly say that Bush did not create all of our problems, I think many were born under President Reagan, President Clinton just rode the wave, and things fell apart under Bush. Our problems begin with unregulated big business. Capitalism is great, but people will always figure out ways to make more money, so they have to be regulated to protect the common good. I don't feel sorry for Obama, he has accomplished a huge stimulus bill, which was in part needed, but I don't think our bureaucratic government can handle the challenge.

6OLiuM9Gaa	I think it depends upon how much you want to keep your stuff, and how long you intend to be in the Navy. <br>  <br>  Storage can cost a couple hundred bucks a month if you have a large space. However, if you're only going to do one hitch in, and then get out, and if you REALLY want to keep your stuff, it might be worth the expense to you. <br>  <br>  If you're not sure how long you're going to stay in... that is, no definite plans, storage is still an option.<br>  <br>  But if and when you plan a Navy career, then sell everything. It'll probably hurt at the time, but, believe me, (1) you'll get over it, and (2) you'll pick up what you need when you need it. I know one young lady who was stationed in England for three years. She picked up about $30,000 in stained glass windows. She said, "Guess I have to buy a house to put them in." So she did. Rare instance... she was already pretty wealthy... and so were her parents. But I'll bet that if she didn't pay cash, she purchased her "place" with a VA-insured loan. <br>  <br>  Caveat: Even if you rent storage there's no absolute guarantee that everything will be as you left it. There are floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, dust, humidity -- too little or too much, heat, cold, and critters that can wreak havoc with your possessions. You'll want to insure it... heavily... against everything... and that'll cost too. <br>  <br>  I was Navy for 25 years. The first four I was enlisted. During that period I lived almost totally off the Navy. When I became an officer, I thought a car would be a good idea. But I furnished my apartment from a Navy warehouse... a buddy of mine ran it. People stored some stuff there and left it for about 10 years. He wanted to get rid of it. It wasn't really too posh, but it was functional and the price was right. I kept some of it for a few a couple of moves, but I gradually replaced it with newer hand-me-downs. Kind of a skin-flint? Maybe, but over the 25 years I was in the service, I was able to save about a third of everything I made. That's the idea of living "frugally." <br>  <br>  In Boot Camp, you can't have a car. When you get to your first duty station (probably an "A" school), you'll be allowed one. You'll live in barracks on base until you make E-5 (depending on your command). Then you can get a modest stipend for living off base. But, remember, in the regular Navy, you can expect to be at sea about a third of your life. So, if you're in for four years, for 15 months your 68 Mustang will be sitting on a pier or in an open parking lot on base. For long periods of time it won't be washed, maintained, or driven.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	The mustang is worth putting into long term storage until after you graduate from your class A school. You should be able to drive it on base after reporting in to your first command. The other sentimental stuff I would keep in storage too. At least until after I reported in to my first duty station. <br>  <br>  I sold my 1970 Dodge Charger SE when I first joined the Navy and regretted it. Unknown to me I could have brought it on base and kept it and done the maintenance/restoration at the auto hobby shop.|`|AA11696297	actually i've had great luck with (non-climate controlled) storage facilities, have to choose wisely.  but do the math, are you willing to add the cost of long term storage to these items?  how long will it be there?  would it profit you more to sell what you can, buy some long term CDs?  remember, we're talking two, three, four years, or more. a hefty storage fee, or money in the bank?|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Truthfully, if your single, <br>  <br>  sell all your furniture, you won't need it, nor will you have any place to use it.<br>  <br>  You'll be living in a barracks for at least 2 or 3 years.<br>  <br>  Long term storage cost around 100 a month, for climate control.<br>  <br>  You would spend more for storage than the furniture is worth.,<br>  <br>  The car, you can rent a Storage unit and put it up on blocks.<br>  <br>  And then go pick it up after you get out of A School.<br>  <br>  If it is there for less than a year, all you would need to do, is put some fuel stabilizer in your gas tank and run it enough so it goes thru the system ( 15 mins )<br>  <br>  And put a cover over the car.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	I would look at all the "long term" storage places in town, they'll usually let you "tour" where your stuff will be beforehand.<br>  <br>  Or, Before I left for boot camp, I sold a lot of my stuff I didn't really need to help clear the clutter.

Supporters and critics of the administration are tripping over themselves to blame the deficit on tax cuts, the war, and a slow economy. But the fact is we have mounting deficits because George W. Bush is the most gratuitous big spender to occupy the White House since Jimmy Carter. One could say that he has become the "Mother of All Big Spenders."<br>  <br>  The new estimates show that, under Bush, total outlays will have risen $408 billion in just three years to $2.272 trillion: an enormous increase in federal spending of 22 percent. Administration officials privately admit that spending is too high. Yet they argue that deficits are appropriate in times of war and recession. So, is it true that the war on terrorism has resulted in an increase in defense spending? Yes. And, is it also true that a slow economy has meant a decreased stream of tax revenues to pay for government? Yes again. <br>  <br>  But the real truth is that national defense is far from being responsible for all of the spending increases. According to the new numbers, defense spending will have risen by about 34 percent since Bush came into office. But, at the same time, non-defense discretionary spending will have skyrocketed by almost 28 percent. *****Government agencies that Republicans were calling to be abolished less than 10 years ago, such as education and labor, have enjoyed jaw-dropping spending increases under Bush of 70 percent and 65 percent respectively.*****<br>  <br>  -- 2003 (Rep. congress)

No, they don't give temporary receipt for your EAD but they will give you a Welcome Notice as a resident.<br>  4.

You are the innocent in all of this nastiness and i hope to God that the social workers etc that have since got involved have arranged counselling for you? The detective on the case should have sat you down and explained everything to you about the court case, what will happen leading up to it, during it and after it and who will be in the court room for the duration of the case! If he hasn't done any of this then you have the right as the victim to ask for someone else to be assigned to you for the duration of the case. You will not have to give evidence in an open court love, you'll be videoed and that video will be used in court as your evidence. As for the media, your legal team can prevent any intrusion by the media by asking for the case to be heard in a closed court - you are intelligent enough to request this now, don't wait until it eventually reaches a court room! The detective in charge needs sacking really for frightening you like he has, he's talking total bulls**t and has only added to your already troubled mind. You should have a social worker that you can speak to you at any time of the day or night so please call her and discuss any worries you have, we're always here for you i hope you know that but some of us come on line at different times and so you may not always talk to the same person - you can always e-mail any of us that have left e-mail addresses, we're not all legal eagles but we've all got hearts x look after your good self and make sure you eat well and if you've trouble sleeping then ask your dr for sleeping tablets - theres too much going on in your life for one so young - God Bless x

CowgOqXTaa	Depends on State law.    In my State, purely as an example, a man can be the legal father of a child, and obligated to pay child support, in four ways.    1) If he is married to the mother at the time the child is born, and does not dispute parentage within six months.     2) If he adopts the child.    3) If a paternity test shows him to be the biological father.    4) If he publicly acknowledges the child as his over an 'extended period', and establishes a father-child relationship.     2 and 3 are the law in all States. 1 and 4 vary by State.    Richard|`|kDxljPUnaa	You are not a bad person and this is a good question. Thank you for asking.   It really depends on the man. If he has bonded with the child would it really depend on the legality of the situation? He would accept the child as his own. Especially if the childs' mother is there to reenforce the family unit.

Legally speaking through DNA testing..if a man is found that he is not the father he doesn't have to pay child support..but on the other hand, if a man loves a child who turns out not to be his, he can still morally support that child with love, money, and a stable life.

(Its a long shot)  Good luck.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	I would make very sure what he has is really asthma and not a seasonal allergy. If he is playing Lacrosse I doubt he has asthma. Is he taking medication ?<br>  <br>  If he really does have asthma that is permanently disqualifying from all branches and is not waiverable.|`|dGlhYAmVaa	No asthma in any branch of the military.  If he can get along without an inhaler, then he can get in if he doesn't say anything about it at MEPS.  Yes, this means lying.<br>  <br>  But, like I said, only if it's not required.  But not if he's going to die at basic training because he lied at MEPS.<br>  <br>  I used to be an Army recruiter and one time I had this kid that wanted to join.  He said he had asthma.  So I pressed him on it and asked for details.  He said he didn't need an inhaler.  So, I asked what the doctors told him.  He said that the doctor said he has asthmatic symptoms.  So basically he just gets bad colds.  This is a case where I flat out told him not to say anything at MEPS.  He signed up 4 years ago and is still in the Army.  But, he was never told categorically that he had asthma.<br>  <br>  Another guy said he had asthma and used an inhaler.  So we went jogging so I could see how he does.  He needed an inhaler after a few miles.  I told him to try again in a few years.  I don't want some kid dying at basic because I needed to get my 2/month.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	No Asthma is not wavierable...<br>  It is a disqualifier from enlistment...|`|XWUJIfwJaa	well i just got back from the navy recruiter and he asked me about asthma i dont have it but im sure there are certain procedures...<br>  <br>  i am thinking that they will let him join and hopefully ill be in boot camp in a couple weeks so if we end up being in the same group ill look after him

bf45coU8aa	In the United Kingdom, the MPs of the House of Commons can call a vote of no-confidence in the government at any time.  However, given the government's inherent majority, this would be difficult to pull off.    The uninformed would assume this is a failing of British democracy, when in fact it is a factor in every single parliamentary democracy in the world.  It's very hard in every parliamentary democracy to trigger a no-confidence vote, as party discipline is strong in every one, and the government usually has a majority.    So no use moaning about it.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	this law is not for the US|`|LRbxal5Faa	In the USA, anyone who cares enough to take the time to get involved can give a vote of no confidence any time they want. If you have taken the time to build your knowledge base, that base will include a growing sense of when and where is the most effective time and place to do so.    Or, you can simply follow in the Lazy Boy(tm) tradition of criticizing whatever comes to your attention. You can even call posting a question on Yahoo Answers your political activism of the day.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	If you mean in the UK then that has to be done by the MPs the public can't do it.  You need over a certain number of them to call for the vote, then Parliment has to vote on it.  It's rarely used because normally any MPs who do this soon find themselves thrown out of the party and they're all too spineless to take the risk.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	MP's can table a motion of no confidence in the government and if the majority of MP's support it, a general election can be called!|`|7fXuH1R3aa	Now.|`|BquqToGaaa	In 2016|`|URO3gDXcaa	check your local laws.
AA11622716	Failure to appear is a separate crime.  The sentence for that crime is determined by the judge.  There is no standard sentence.  So, the simplest way to get before the court, without going to jail first, is to go to the court that issued the warrant.  Go in the morning.  Go on a Monday if possible but definitely not on a Friday.  Tell the clerk you have learned of the warrant and you wish to take care of it.  In most cases, you will see a judge that day (although you will have to wait around until all those who showed up have been heard).  In most cases, the court will then quash the warrant and accept your plea to the traffic crime.   In rare cases, the bailiff will execute the warrant and you spend the night in jail before seeing the judge.  That is why you should no go on a Friday as that could result in spending the weekend in jail.    If you wait to get arrested, you will definitely spend at least one day in jail before seeing the judge.|`|8cfc10dab38df4e4d9f262d6ef27039faa	yes you can, just contact the court|`|IpkUUxdNaa	yes you should be able to just contact the Court; be aware however that your licence may have been suspended and you will also have an administration fee to reinstate it as well as the amount for your fine
tvQStwpGaa	You don't enlist as an officer. You go to boot camp and then go to OCS (officer candidate school)|`|vwZvxNevaa	If you join up with the marines, they own you! No college until their done with you. The marines is hard core. It isn't for the faint of people. My brother and cousin are marines. Yea you can go reserve but my advice is just do your college.
RjUhISEIaa	RTJ, you need to consult with the base legal affairs folks. Have them tell you what you can and should do to bring this matter to a halt. Remember, if it gets to court it could become much nastier than it is now and that won't do anyone any good.|`|AA11622716	Because of the first amendment (in the u.s.), a lawsuit for slander requires proof of false statements; of fact -- not opinion; reflecting on your character; the statements being uttered; and heard by others; and believed by those others; with tangible financial losses as a result.  I can't tell if you can prove each of those, but that is what it would take to prevail.|`|2aERh7hlaa	If you can prove it I believe you can sue her for slander and possibly get a restraining order.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	sue for slander or call your local police department and file charges. let your military boss know about it|`|Gezfmghuaa	Given that the state agency has not acted, its obvious they believe the claims to be specious.  With that in mind, unless she produces actual evidence, I wouldn't be too concerned about criminal proceedings against you.    That said, there are real and significant consequences to her actions, emotionally and as you noted with your reputation.  I can't imagine the kid is enjoying it much.    While damages would be hard to prove in a slander case, you certainly should seek base counsel's assistance in requesting a restraining order that prevents her from making any such claims without corroborating evidence|`|MOALBorJaa	Yes. You very likely have a very strong case for defamation of character. Consult a local attorney. If they are unwilling to take the case, possibly because the size of the recovery would not be big enough, see if you can consult with someone either in the JAG corps or if there is another military legal group who handles cases for military personnel in private matters. Be sure that you are guaranteed attorney/client privilege in all your communications. If they won't help you, you might consider filing charges with the local police department against this woman for filing false statements. If she has complained to the state, then her allegations were very likely made under oath.

9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	I think it is unlikely. Any foreigner wishing to work in Malta (even for a short period) needs a work permit, for a start. In addition, anyone seeking to appear in a court of law would require a warrant to practise at the Maltese Bar, for which the requirements are very stringent, as you will see on this link, including an in depth knowledge of the Maltese language. http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/legal_p...|`|e0e60d0a8bb22bb26e2cdd7f9b7023e4aa	Of course you can use an English lawyer, but they might have to then employ a translator as most courts would speak their own language. If you have a strong case against someone or some company, a consultation with a Maltese Lawyer first and obtain his/her advice. They are not fools. Generally the Maltese are very fair minded people and again, if you have a good cause for bringing this case to court, you would be dealt with quite fairly. Maybe you should have explained your problem a little more for me to understand what your case may involve. Best wishes.
