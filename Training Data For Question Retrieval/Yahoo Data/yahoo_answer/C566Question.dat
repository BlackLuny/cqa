The first time I was sick was a couple of Mondays ago, then I was sick that Wednesday, then was fine the rest of the week. The week after the same thing happened and I even got sick around the same time which was kinda scary. This week I was not sick on Monday, but was sick today after having a big breakfast. I eat a lot of junk and fatty foods, and I know that isn't good, so please don't give me hell about it. But I've always been like that, so why I am getting sick now then after all these years? After I am sick I feel fine after that, and get on with the rest of my day. What's strange is that when I am usually sick (around once a year if that) I am bed ridden for days. With this I'm not. I have been dealing with a few probs with my girlfriend as of late, but nothing I can't handle but it may be in fact stress contributing to it. I'm visiting the doc tomorrow to get an official diagnoses, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has ever experienced this before?

20090310033039AAcGyeM	Health;Mental Health	Can someone please explain this personality trait or disorder?	My husband had been emotionally abused as a child, suffered from panic anxiety disorder for 20 odd years because he never sought help, always thought he was just cursed in some way. Gets angry and has terrible outbursts, feels the need to control most situations and people. Feels like failing at something is the worst thing that can happen to him, so he is a perfectionist. Always has to be busy and takes on more than he can handle, most times starts something he cant complete.   Has a low self esteem which is his inner true self and not how he portrays himself to the world. To the outside he is a larger than life successful businessman and has a 'perfect' life. Has a need to put himself down/self pity when he is wrong without actually doing anything to change weaknesses. He is clingy and demanding and smothers me for fear I may leave. (Yes we have issues)   This last one I dont understand, he gets an idea in his head and will turn over every rock to validate his opinion on something, for example, if he feels I need something he will go out of his way to do it for me and if he fears my need for space translates to wanting to be single, he will do everything in his power to validate that for himself, even if it means we have a fight over something he overhead/misunderstood/misconstrued. Is he feeding his own insecurities for some kind of confirmation for himself? Like people who always complain 'I never do anything right' and then go on to say all the negatives that has happened to them. Is this a security blanket and what for? Overall he is a good guy and has a good heart, is very giving but sometimes it comes with a price   Thank you for your time

Ok I am pretty overweight, I have not changed any of my eating habits or lifestyle and I have gained weight since spring of last year. I had a partial thyroidectomy in May of last year and they said my thyroid was still working, well then I moved and my insurance doesn't cover my thyroid again until July so I can't have it checked and I think thta is why I have gained weight.  I think it's either not working or REALLY low. (it runs in my family).  I really want and need to lose weight, I eat healthy lots o fruits and veggies, I am bad on the weekends I know that, but I do watch what I eat for the most part.  I can't afford th gym right now as we're buying a house, so I do lunges and push ups and my ab roller at home. i can't walk as we live in a not so safe neighborhood, but as soon as we move I can. I just need advice. I konw there aren't any magic pills but is there anything that might help a little or help boost a weight loss...I feel like I have no control over my body anymore...

20090310052343AAxNkF8	Health;Mental Health	What are some medications used to treat extreme irritability?	Most likely it is associated with bi-polar disorder or something to that effect.  I've done a lot of reading, and yeah, a lot of my family would like me to get help.  I did get treated for this for a while, only it was more for depression, so it turned out not to help me and then I gave up for a while.      The drugs I have read about used to treat this -really scare me.  Lithium, risperdal, seroquel...I don't wanna take those!      I can remember that xanax really reduced my irritability and seemed to help, although reading about it later, it's obvious you can't stay on it forever and it was also addicting.        Anyone with any information on what I should know about treatment of bi-polar, please know that your help is appreciated.

20090310044151AAY0iO6	Health;Mental Health	The long-term effects of severe bullying...my story, advice needed. READ?	in a bad mood right now and thought that i would share something with you all...      When I started high school age 11 I was a happy kid, had some good friends and alot of girlfriends in my first 2-3 years of school but then after family problems I moved city far away and went to another school there. well when I first came here people decided it would be funny to nickname me something pretty degrading...purely out of envy/jealousy I think although i obvo have no control over a school full of people I don't know...well for the next 2 years where ever i went lads would shout this name to me...thus making me embarrassed and quite around people...they would be all "why dont u talk much" (well duh if you called me by my name maybe i would)..well anyway this miserable mood these people put me in and low social status forced upon me made me not so popular with girls I knew as no girl wants to go out with the person everybody makes fun out of.      so from all of this over them 2 years I became a very angry person behind closed doors, and to the people who didnt really know about how people knew me around my age range I was a nasty person..always picking fights drunk and what not...in a small sense the bullied becmae the bully..      this stopped when I left school and went to college...I initially thought I would make new friends and things to do here but I was wrong...I then met a girl who was alot older than me and I had my first sexual experience since i was about 13 (i was 16 by then)..this girl was the super pretty sl**ty girl and she really liked me..although she was very schocked at the fact I had nobody..well guess what...she leaves once she realises I have no friends or anything to give her...i mean what girl wants to waste her time helping a lad when she can get the same lad who doesnt need it.      well after that for the next 2 years of college my life became nothing...I had no real friends in the city I lived, I became extremely lonely..I used to walk around the city centre about 3 times on a saturday just for something to do, I attempted suicide a couple of times over these 2 years and nearly compleetd it once but somehow I stuck my fingers down my throat and it all come out...I felt guilty at the time I guess.      well now I left this town behind and in a new place at university...loads of girls are showing interest, I have some nice friends now but for some reason I feel compltelty worthless...girls smile and hint for me to come over but I freeze up inside..im not ugly at all..I should have great confidence but memories from that old town overwhelm me still...I'm slowly getting better but there's a part of me that tells me it never will.      things are getting bad now though...I've decided after 4 years of been this lonely...only ever having 1 girl in this 4 years and been so sad and down on myself I need help...otherwise I will finish this life cuz i see little point in anything anymore      this is for all those who read this...think twice about the way you treat people you dont even know...this all might be laughable towards you as i;m probz just a hormone raging 18 year old but i feel like taking my own life becuase of how people treat me...I never done anything wrong towards anbody..treat girls with repect unlike the countless ones who dontyet still have beatiful girlfriends.      if you made it through all this rant well done...consider yourself lucky...      it''s noww 11am here...and it's time for my bedtime..cause this is how it is for me lately...sleep all day awake all night

I actually sprained it by attempting to walk on it while it was asleep (stupid, i know).  The doctors put a half-cast splint on it and gave me crutches, after they reviewed the Xrays.  They said it was just a sprain. The doctor told me to do the RICE thing for the first couple of days...I think she said 4 or 5 days.  Im so exhausted hopping around on crutches.  Is it time to take the splint off and start working the muscles?    Thanks.

20090310044702AAguMFl	Health;Mental Health	Panic attack at work - Your opinions?	Hi, I just started a new job 3 weeks ago, and everything was going ok. I started to have a minor panic attack in the morning, after feeling really frustrusted about having to do a job I was never expecting to do before I took the post, and it was a similar task to the one I'd "escaped" from years earlier. In the afternoon there was a more severe attack that occurred, after thinking about the other tasks I have been put in charge of. So many things have come at once, and it feels like I cannot cope.       After fleeing to my emergency room (home) and calming down, then I contacted the boss, to explain what my thoughts were and it would be wise to take a few days off. We agreed that it would be best to take a day off, and reduce the workload if need be.      At university all is fine, and the huge demand of the subject is manageable. Although I've already done some research on the field of anxiety attacks etc (although not spoke to a health professional yet), it concerns me whether this will turn into a long-term issue.      I feel so incapable right now, and wondering to what extend the boss may be thinking this too. It would be interesting to know, and much a relief if he has met someone in this kind of sitution before, what's more, been able to continue.       I would like to know if anybody else has come across this type of predicament? And how was it overcome?      Many thanks

20090310051205AAxiA6a	Health;Women's Health	Spotting while taking Seasonique- and sex?	So I've been taking Seasonique for almost 3 months now. I didn't have any problems until about 3 weeks ago when I started spotting, and haven't stopped since. It's not heavy, but its not light either. I know this is normal while taking Seasonique, but 3 weeks straight?!   Anyway, the major point I'm trying to make is that my boyfriend and I had sex on one of my very light days when I didn't notice much spotting. However, after a while, I noticed that I was bleeding alot. Not brown like I have been spotting, but red like a normal period.   Did I hurt myself? Was it safe to have sex if I was spotting? Did I just make it worse? I'm really scared and worried I may have hurt my cervix. I just hope I don't have to go to the doctors for this.   The bleeding has calmed down ALOT, now its back to what it used to be, but I have crampy sensations. Nothing serious, though. Just annoying.

Letter of Appreciation to My Wife   For Bravery Fighting Breast Cancer      Becky, you are my hero!  I am so proud of your strength, courage and bravery that you are showing daily, as you have fought breast cancer.      The road has been difficult filled with physical and mental pain but you walked on tackling the monsters of the disease.  First it was getting diagnosed; being poked and probed, x-rayed and scanned numerous times.  And the effects of chemotherapies are still haunting you today,  the mastectomy was scary but you pulled through it in flying colors.  Radiation is peeping around the corner ready to pounce on you, but we have confidence that with help it will not be as bad as the chemotherapy was.        Courageously you fought them off and continue gathering your resources; the love of friends and family along with their prayers have proved to be an impenetrable shield that protects you in some of your darkest moments.  The team of doctors and professionals are top-notch and their expertise provides a secured knowledge that there is hope of a complete recovery from this disease.      I appreciate how you get up every morning facing cancer head on!  I know how you were thrust into fighting this disease and you have learned through reading and research the best ways for you to combat cancer.  I thank God that he gave you the tools you needed to pull through this and I believe it was your sense of humor and the ability you have of finding laughter in all situations.     From the chemotherapy ward through surgery and now with the upcoming radiation treatments you have been able to laugh at cancer face on and    Overcome this monster with faith, hope, and love.      You are my love,       Your honey forever      Dave
20090309155026AAktIyv	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Could this be related?	My daughter has been having cold hands and seeing specks of green light everywhere all the time (like film grain in a picture only lighted).   We have taken her to see two different optometrists, both have conducted thorough examinations of her eyes (pupil dilations, vision field tests, retinal checks etc.) and neither has found anything abnormal with her eyes, other than the fact that she is very nearsighted (it runs in the family). She frequently has unclear vision and feels faint and dizzy after standing up. She also feels tired much of the time, but it does not impact her very significantly. These only started after she stopped eating meat, around 6 months ago. She is 13. Could this have to do with her not eating meat, and aside from eating meat again, are there any causes (deficiencies etc.) and cures?    If this helps, she is 97 pounds, and 5 feet tall, which would be a normal BMI for her age.   She also got a blood test, I'm not completely sure what she was tested for but the test results came and said everything was normal, except for slightly low levels of red and white blood cells

I hoovered my bed and washed my sheets the day after I came up with them, but I still am getting them over a month later.

I also found a small bite like lump in my armpit, which is itchy. Washing powder hasn't been changed and I don't think im allergic to anything. I took antihistamines and they reduced the swelling of a swollen one. They generally aren't very big, apart from one.      Could anyone help me with what they are and how they could be treated?

I just ate some chocolate chip cookies and drank some soda about twenty minutes ago or so.       I have always had problems with something that everyone but the doctors think is hypoglycemia. I would pass out if I hadn't eaten (mother couldn't provide, not my fault) and even when I do eat it still stays very low. Once I checked my sugar after eating some candy and it was only 53.       I am not over weight, I am the opposite I am on the low end for my height.      I have always eaten junk food and I heard that doing so could lead to hypoglycemia. I never ate real food growing up only pasta (because it was cheap) or candy that my grandmother would buy me.       My question is, is it normal to have a lower blood sugar and if so why when the doctors tested me did I come up as being fine? Should I believe the doctor or trust my instincts?

I dont have any siblings. My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more. Shes coming to me for the weekend and my skin is so bad...please help me..  She even gets so far as accident and emmergecny and gets checked out over and over again in attention seeking behaviour taht keeps everyone worried.  Please help

20090309144411AApZsF0	Health;Other - Health	Is this a worrying thought??? (please read)?	My best friend has been dating a lovely guy for 2 years. They're both 23 and both were virgins when they met. A year into the relationship, she went on the contraceptive pill and they became sexually active. About 2 years before they met, he was seriously ill and had to have a blood transfusion. I don't wish to say this to my friend, but I was watching a documentary recently about people who contracted HIV through infected blood after having transfusions. As far as I'm aware, neither of them were tested for STD's before they started having sex (which she told me is WITHOUT condoms as she is on the pill), as they were definitely both virgins. After seeing this documentary I am worried sick for both of them, but I wouldn't want to put these thoughts into their head. What would you do? Do you think there would be any cause for concern??

We haven't really talked about it since and since then my self-harm has got alot worse.   Last week she was upset and told me how she felt she hadn't helped me enough. She also told me that she has been feeling depressed lately.    I've asked her to meet with me tomorrow so I can find out whats wrong and try to help her.   But she's reluctant to tell me as she never wants to put anymore "burden"on me and mak things worse. But I care alot for her and I feel alot of guilt for not noticing that she was upset sooner...to wrapped up in my own depression.      So how can I be there for her and be strong enough to help her when I'm not strong at all emotionally right now?      What can I say to make her realise I need to know, not to worry about me?       What should I do?      I'm worried that she might turn to self harm again after years of beating it.      Please help   thanksx

He is a bit introverted, but don't think he will let you walk over him. He has a good career, a great girlfriend, a nice home, car, bank balance, regular Church goer.... in short, your ideal all - round accomplished man.      Yet, he says he feels depressed for no reason at all. He says he has analyzed himself and finds no reason to be depressed, and that this fact makes him all the more agitated.      I suggested he see a psychiatrist, and pat comes his reply, on my face... "What am I wearing a skirt ?"      How do I help such a man ? We are childhood friends and I just cannot see him like this. I have tried talking to him about this, but he says he has nothing to tell me as such, just that he feels down most of the time.      Thank you so very much for your time and effort.

Well, can you red this first to get the whole point or idea of this person, you don't have to but it would help:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...       Okay, so now the thing, today i was sitting in french class next to this guy, our seating plan is arranged that way. And then he took my pen and stuffed it in his mouth and slobbered all over it(im not kidding) and he scratched me with it, he did it again and again, and again. Next period i noticed that there was a small amount of blood in one of the scratches in the spit-filled pen he took. I got freaked out and washed my hands and arm, a little , but this happened  about 40 minutes later.       My question is, can i get HIV from this, or any other disease, my om isn't home yet, so when she is im telling her, i am a hypochondriac, so i do come with these stories a lot to her, so im afraid she wont believe the seriousness from this.. I am scared, now what should i do?      * i remind you that the scratches were filled with his spit. if you read the previous question you would understand my concern.thank you

If ya'll have any questions, just ask.       Not looking for joke answers; I just don't want a Chinese torture trap on my dilly next time. Or are condoms supposed to be like that? I don't know, I have to admit sexuality activity is pretty new to me. So, yeah, is there a site anywhere where I can just punch it my "measurements" and get the right condom?      Thanks in advance.

Well, after a while it starting to REALLY hurt. I brushed my teeth and all, but it still hurt.      It only feels better when I put my finger on the spot and put pressure there, or when I bite down hard. The gum that hurts is in between my two teeth.   I have braces and an appliance, by the way.      Note - This pain is like my man-period. It hurts once every month really really badly.      Can someone tell me how to make it stop?

I have already missed two periods, and have taken more pregnancy tests than are imaginable (including 2 urine tests at the OBGYN, a blood test, and an ultrasound, and close to 8 OTC pregnancy tests), all negative.  I have never missed a period before.  I am currently taking microgestin 1/20, but I am not using any other form of birth control.         During the evenings I start to feel nauseous and extremely tired.  I have pain coming from my ovaries and regular cramping pain.  I am not spotting.  The ultrasound detected a fibroid on the outside of my uterus, but otherwise it came up normal.      A friend tells me that I am probably developing ovarian cysts that did not show up on the ultrasound because they were too small (she's had this experience on microgestin).  Has anyone else had this problem before?  If so, what are your recommendations?

I was in school today and I was fine in the morning.    then I went to science and I had to print some homework off by the end of the day for my teacher, i did it straight after the lesson, but as I went to hand it in I was shaking uncontrollably I ran off and I didn't go back, then I went to my next lesson, I had history, we were just watching a dvd, and taking notes, half way through the lesson I got a note from my music teacher, asking me to see her at lunch time.   I have been involved in music a lot throughout the past 2 years, recently though, I don't know why, maybe because of bullying, I have been really quiet, as I was leaving a lesson, a few weeks ago, she asked me what was wrong and I said nothing, so she just said okay.   she put me down for singing in a competition, even though I had told her I didn't want to do it, I was too nervous and I don't think I'm good enough.   anyway, when I got there I stood outside for a while, trying to calm myself down, but I went in, regardless, she closed the door, and just started with, okay, one of the reasons I've called you here is because the woodwind teacher would like you to return your instrument, I decided I was terrible at it,and that I couldn't carry on trying to play it. so I said okay,  she then closed the door fully and moved further away from it,  I stood there and she sat in her chair, at this point I started shaking, she said she was very worried about me, that my confidence had dropped, that I wasn't the same person I used to be and that everyone was worried about me, she asked how my grades were and I told her I had a 96% on science, 94% on maths, so she said okay. she continued for a while, saying this and more, I continued to shake,uncontrollably, trying my best to hide it, she said she knew I'd had a hard time with the girls in my class, and told me that I was always welcome to go up to her room at break etc, I couldn't of course, it'd make me feel like a huge social outcast. so I insisted that I was fine, but I continued to shake, I felt my knees weaken, but I managed to keep myself looking normal.   she mentioned that I didn't do a lot in her cass the day before, "I was talking" I lied.then I said I had started again a few times too, also a lie, I had spent the lesson staring at my piece of paper, thinking.   she said the usual, any problems see me, that sort of thing, etc etc.   I said okay, she just said come and see me on monday, I'll help you pick a song for this competition, even though, I don't even remember agreeing to do it, I just said okay, and goodbye and all that stuff, and left, but I don't know why I was shaking, at such silly little things, like handing in a piece of paper and going to see my music teacher, who is also in charge of the more able and talented group, last year I got up on stage and sang, and I wasn't even nervous before hand, now, well, I am, very nervous, any ideas why this is?   thank you   Surfysez      oh and I did hand in the science homework, but I waited until my science teacher had gone home, and a caretaker let me in, and I put it into the box, what do I say,sorry sir, I came but I was too scared to hand in a piece of paper???   how pathetic am I ):   he's the sarcastic type who wouldn't understand :(   the kind of person who reads your testmarks out in class,which has never been a problem for me, as a straight A student, but for others it is very embarrassing, he insists that the people who have struggled with a topic, were too lazy to revise, and I just don't know what to do,   what should I do?   any ideas why I was shaking?   please help!      thanks a lot!!!

20090227144357AA4HkPL	Health;Diet & Fitness	To lose weight faster: eat then burn cals, or not eat and not burn the cals?	Hypothetically, if I were to not eat all day (and so burn e.g. 2,000cals on my daily business) would I lose more weight than if I were to eat ONLY a 250cal chocolate bar but then burn an extra 250cals, which should even it back out to 2,000cals burned? Or would it work out the same?      I'm asking because lots of these 'fasts' and 'cleanses' claim you lose more weight in a e.g. 10-day period than seems to be possible, especially since things like the cayenne-syrup-lemonade actually contains quite a few calories. How on earth do people end up losing 10lbs in 10 days and why doesn't this seem to be possible if they consumed the same amount of calories they would get from the lemonade, but in solid food form? Is there something about a liquid diet that makes you lose weight quicker?

Does anyone have enough knowledge and experience with this kind of stuff to help me? I would greatly appreciate it! :]

I bought a few candies and one Russian one that was like a long waffer fulled with a cream. I took probably two bite and opened the wrapper a bit more to see some mold [little green dust like things] The women said they were fresh and that they were from New York. Do you think that since they most likely were made in Russian that I should seek medical attention since it might have something that my immune system cant handle from Russia? I think im just overreacting but Id much rather be safe than sorry.

20090309160811AAA8okP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Feeling full and a little sick?	Hello, I have had these symptoms not too long ago, although now is not too severe as last time. The first time this happened about 3 weeks ago, I was just sitting in the car and started feeling uncomfortably full. Like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet and ate way more than I should have. I got home and just lied down for a bit. The only thing I actually ate that day was two pieces of pancakes. The strange thing about this is, I have not been sick since I was 9. I am 19 now, but I just tried to walk off the incredibly sick feeling for hours, soon I just sat down and passed out, I was sick and full feeling for around three days. Now it has been almost three weeks and the symptoms are coming back. But it seems they're coming back at a very slow rate. It's been almost three days of feeling slightly sick, and a bit full. But there are some new things. Even though I feel full, I am still hungry if I don't eat. And I can stomach everything I eat, but I know I didn't eat enough to make me as full as I am.

I have taken up running in the last week to try and tone up a bit. I have never been a sporty person and have to admit that the most I did was cycle to college and walking.      I run for around 20-30 mins a day and I am planning to build this up over time, but I have found that after running I get this sort of ache in my lower back, sort of where the back bends in if that makes sense.      I have tried to warm up and warm down after running.       I also have a bit of an ache on my hamstrings but I was expecting this.      Is this serious?   Any advice?      Thanks xx

20090309122824AAyfrIR	Health;Women's Health	Yeast infection and Monistat 3? Please help...?	Alright so I had been having symptoms of a yeast infection (itching, some irritation, increased discharge) for about a week until I asked my mom about it. We called the doctor and told her my symptoms and that I've never had a yeast infection before and she told us to go ahead and get Monistat 3. Last night I inserted my first cream-filled tube thing. I also used the external cream. I went to bed right after. I almost couldn't sleep the rest of the night because the itching became so bad. Now it's the next afternoon and all day I have had really bad burning in and around my vagina. It's also very red and irritated down there. And the itching has also increased a ton. I'm worried because this is very painful and distracting.       Is this normal? Since I've never had a yeast infection or used Monistat before I don't know how much the burning/itching is supposed to increase before it gets better....Before using the Monistat I didn't even have any burning. Does this mean it's working? When should I start feeling some kind of relief?      Thank you so much for your time and answers.

I've had eczema since I was a child, I've tried a variety of creams in the past and was never successful in treating it.  I have persistent rashes on my arms, and my skin is dry in general and often cracks on my hands unless I really keep up, using lotion...      I haven't spoken to a dermatologist or tried any real regimen to treat it for quite some time.  I'm not sure any treatment would entirely rid me of rashes...  As such, a few questions...

I was really excited about it until suddenly the idea that my eczema might put me at risk...  A little searching and a plethora of articles, and a few questions here, indicate it would in fact be risky for someone like me to be working in the medical field.      So now I'm deflated, depressed and unsure.  Is this a real concern?  I don't generally have open wounds.  Even so, is this the wrong career for me?

I can't afford to go to a doctor, let alone pay to be made even again.Just to get my annual mammogram and ultra sound cost me $800.00, an additional $250.00 for an annual pap smear from my gynecologist, and another $200.00 just to have my cholestrol checked.  All this I have to pay out of pocket on top of the $500.00 I pay out monthly.      I am currently applying for SSDI but have been warned this will most likely take 3 to 5 years if I ever get it.  No lawyer will take my SSDI because they couldn't make any money off of my small work record.      Is there another type of lawyer to go to over being left disfigured while I wait out all these years to see if I get my SSDI.  It already doesn't look good, they never gave me a confirmation #, and when I called they said they mailed it out.  When I spoke with the 2nd supervisor she said a confirmation was never mailed out as of yet. They get away with lying, and I feel deliberately don't like me because I'm a fighter.  I don't mean to be, but I'm left with no other choice. All my faxes were just ignored, and they say that's OK. The supervisors could care less.

20090309123509AAThBr5	Health;Mental Health	What would cause someone to not admit to any physical weakness?	I'm asking on behalf of my brother. Ever since childhood he would deny being tired/sick/in pain even if he was obviously lying.  He's not an egotistical or competitive guy or anything like that, he is a very sweet caring person. He is quite stubborn though, even though I don't think that's the only reason he acts this way toward physical weaknesses.      The reason I am asking is because I am very concerned for him. I think he may have diabetes, or some other serious health problem, but he won't admit anything is wrong with him even though it's obvious that there is, and he gets defensive and says I'm just worrying too much when I tell him he needs to see a doctor.      I'm really worried about him. Why does he act that way, and what can I do to help him get help?      Thankyou.

I am a healthy 20 year old man prone to pneumonia. I get it almost every year. My chest has dull pains preceding the incidents. The center around the deepest part of my chest near my sternum. This has been going on for a few years. I smoke rarely, but hardly ever do anymore. Could there be a more serious disease at play. Right now I am in the beginnings of a cold and I felt the dull pains that come and go. My coughs are relatively infrequent, and cause hoarseness. I have significant post nasal drip as well. There is definitely a fever, and I don't have much of an appetite. Any thoughts? Could I be very sick?

20090309131052AAyfN3Z	Health;Dental	Braces Cleaning Ideas?	I'm a 20 year old guy and I got braces put on about a week ago. The most frustrating part about them though is figuring out a way to keep them clean.      I have all the tools I need - proxy brush, Sonicaire, Waterpik, floss, etc... But actually the biggest pain I have is when I'm at work and out. Due to the nature of my job (security/emergency response), I don't have a set 30 minute or hour break. Our breaks are NOT monitored and therefore sometimes I can take a longer break and sometimes it gets cut short due to something that comes up. Sometimes, I am not able to get to a bathroom and brush my teeth after eating. Sometimes I may have to eat and go directly out and deal with people. Orthodontists recommend brushing after every meal but this isn't always feasible. On the other hand, I don't want to walk around with stuff stuck in my teeth at work so is there any tips you guys have for this? Most my friends say that they didn't brush after every meal with braces and were fine. Should I carry a mirror around or are there any techniques you guys use? Thanks.

20090309130845AAigL6h	Health;Mental Health	I haven't seen my counselor for 3 weeks. I'm starting to feel crazy?	Is this normal? I've been seeing him for a few months for social and general anxiety and I am making some good progress but he had to go on a little break because he's having a baby, which was fine at first. He instructed me to work on my own for a couple of weeks but lately I've been stressed overwhelmed and avoiding things, I'm also more quiet at work. I'm getting really anxious to see him and at the same time thinking that maybe I should go a different route and that I should go see someone more hardcore like a psychiatrist. I don't know.

One of my major symptoms is feeling like I am going to faint. I get so faint that I have to lay on the floor. The other night I really felt like I was truly going to loose consciousness. I am wondering about the following:      -Is true fainting only when you fall on the floor without even realizing it?      -What is the difference between being lightheaded and fainting?      -Has anyone actually fainted when they were laying down?      -Has anyone truly fainted during a panic attack?      Thanks. I am under a doctors care, but am wondering if anyone who suffers from panic attacks share their experience?

Hi there,      I am just writing to find out if anyone knows a solution as to why I seem to have a line running from the inner corner of my eye down to my cheek, it's like an engravement in my skin... I've never EVER had this before so I don't know why it's come all of a sudden. It's a pinky / reddy colour and annoys me ALOT.      It makes me very self conscious and some days it is worse than others so I am just curious to know if anyone else has this "problem" and if there are any ways to get rid of it? It makes me look like I've got eye bags etc and I would prefer if it was gone!

I have some blackheads and pimple scars on my forehead and on Saturday i tried to pop a blackhead right between my eyebrows. I used 2 q tips to pop it and it needed a lot of force. Anyways, it caused scaring (sorta like a red burn-type thing) and it looks really bad.       I tried everything....lemon, tomatoes, pimple cream, honey, olive oil, baking soda and water paste and nothing really helps the scar that much.       Does anyone else have any other ideas, preferrably something that works well overnight. thanks!
