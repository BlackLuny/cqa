20090226192742AA10hdW	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Best time to plant Kitchen Garden in Virginia?	I live in VA and want to plant tomatoes, Bell peppers and basil. maybe some flowers later. I have a tiny patio so all I can do is plant them in pots. I would like to know what would be the best time to plant these in my area. Also, can I use the same soil as last year. It looks fine. But last season (my first stint at gardening), I had planted the seeds which grew to healthy plants but I couldn't reap the fruits as they were too raw and the air got too cold. This year with your help I want to do it right. Thanks in advance.

20090226193843AAT8qWE	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Help with regrowing a garden?	I've looked on google, and have tried my hand at looking in books as well, but I thought perhaps someone here could help me out.      I'm writing a story, where a character wishes to fix up a garden. It was her mother's, and had been exceptionally well taken care of for a very long time, but when her mother left, the garden was left completely untouched(for around 12 years). The people living in the home wouldn't even go passed it if they could avoid it.       Now, this girl has grown up in the city, and knows nothing about flowers or herbs, or growing them. Her best friend however, specializes in plants and gardening(her family owns a florist/landscaping shop/business) and would know exactly what to do.       I, myself, can't garden to save my life, I can't even make grass grow. So I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me some tips on what the girls would have to do? Or maybe a few sites?       The garden was placed in the back yard, a large space of even land, fenced in. There is a koi pond, and a few 'strategically placed' trees.       Any help would be greatly appreciated.

20090226194438AArEhOI	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my room 5 degrees hotter than the other rooms in the house?	My room is unbearably hot and muggy. Our air conditioner is broken and we've been trying to tough out those warm days where it gets hot inside the house. I can't imagine how summer's going to be. It can be 70 degrees outside, and it'll be a warm 75 degrees in the house, but my room? ...easily 80 degrees.       You feel it when you walk passed my room. I have my standing fan on and my ceiling fan is in working condition but all it seems to be doing is blowing hot air. I took down my door. I can't open my window because the mosquitoes attack you.      Why, why, why, why, why is it so hawwwwt?   I just don't understand. The sun doesn't shine directly into my room during the day. The kitchen should be hotter if that's the case. It has more windows. If anything, I'd just really like to have a better understanding of why my room is noticeably more hotter than the rest of my house. Any speculations?

I'd like to try planting pepper seeds (sweet banana and jalepeno), and was planning to start from seed in one of those mini-greenhouse deals, then transplanting them after approx. 6-8 weeks. Since I live in a cool mountain climate in Arizona with very poor soil (mostly granite based) and am currently living in a rental house with only a little room for gardening, I thought I might be best off if I plant them in pots (?).      Since I'm a novice gardener and could use all the help I can get, I thought I'd ask if anyone out there has any advice on starting pepper seeds! I've heard that it's best to water them from below (but I'm not sure how best to accomplish this), and possibly to keep them warm with a heating pad - has anyone actually tried these methods? Can anyone recommend any better/hardier varieties of peppers to try, given my climate/environment?

20070619145157AAleol4	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	A basket that produces powder?	My mom bought a small African-style woven basket.  What's strange is it produces a fine, yellowish powder that looks like corn starch.  We have it on a table and after about a week or so, it sheds about a quarter of a teaspoon of this powdery stuff on our table.  So imagine how it would look, if you don't clean it up, having a good amount of suspicious-looking powder on your living room table...       I think she bought it at a flea market or something and has had it for about a year now.  We can't figure out why or how it does this.  I haven't tasted it the powder (and I don't plan to) and it doesn't seem to be harmful.  I've tried google searching, but I'm not even really sure what to search for.  So any chance you might know?
