20090203151126AAjS6Gi	Pets;Dogs	My dog is scared of just about anything and everything.?	I have a shih tzu female about 6 months old or so and she's scared of like anything, she never puts her tail up because of it. It might be because we've had a hard time keeping her up to good standards as in potty training and what not, we yelled at her a lot about it, but not ridiculously. Now every time we walk up to her she gets down and puts her head to the ground like we're gonna yell or stomp at her.      Her mom is our other dog and we've had her for three years and she was never like this.      Any help on how to get her to over come her fears?

Our floors are mostly carpet and my dog has been peeing around the time we usually take her out. Usually we are just about to get our shoes on or something to walk her and then she just pisses right in the floor. She's done it like 15 times at least in the past month and I need help because our pet of 11 years might just end up in a shelter. We've put her nose in it and everything, plus she's been trained. I don't know why she does this, it seems so spiteful.

20090203151834AAucIwO	Pets;Dogs	Do you think she'll be okay?	My dog ate 50g of fine dark chocolate about 40 minutes ago. I once read that 20g of cheap milk chocolate can be fatal to a dog of her size (11lb).  My mum took her to the vets and just phoned to tell me that she was given an injection to induce vomiting.    So now my student savings account is now officially empty, since apparently it was my fault for leaving the chocolates out, I have to pay the vet fees D: which are way more than they should be because it's an emergency vet (it's 11pm here)    I don't know when they'll get home or what's happening so I'm kind of panicking.

I found a paint/TB cross weanling colt that would be amazing but I'm just wondering if that is too young. It is already trained to lead, pick up its feet, etc. I understand that I wouldn't be able to ride it until its about 3 years.       do you think i would be ok with a weanling or should i get a 2-3 year old? I've been around horses since i was 7 (i'm 15 now). I know it takes a lot a of time and patience to train a horse.       don't just say i'm too inexperienced to train my own horse..because i know i can do it!!      so what do you think??

20090203152906AAVEA4U	Pets;Cats	Will a male cat get along better with another female or male?	I dont want to say whole story. I will say a tiny tiny part though.    I found a cat 3months ago, had an owner but I couldnt find it . My mom is allergic so we are her temporary owners. One of my friends wants another cat.   He already has a cat, that is a male. My temporary cat is a female. So will that mean they will adjust to each other sooner, or not? Will they get along better or worse?      how should we introduce them?      Anything I should know about introducing two adult cats?      My cat I am quessing is about 2 years old maybe a little younger or older and His i think is from 3 to 6. So will it take them longer to get used to each other?      How long do you think it will take for them to get used to each other?      how long do you think it will take for my cat to adjust?

Anyway its connected with a UV sterilizer and the canister just doesn't seem to be strong enough to push the water up through the output hose; however, when i put the output hose lower and leveled where it doesn't have to work against gravity it just continuously siphons water. Note the canister seems oddly quiet you struggle to hear it at all, only if you put your ear on it you can hear it. Any Ideas? Is there some sort of extra pump I can get just to get the water moving through the tubes?

20090203153534AAsoDP5	Pets;Horses	Why do so many people want to breed?	Hello,   I'm not going to hate on you if you want to breed, that's not for me to do. I really don't think people should be breeding when there are good quality horses going for really cheap because people can't feed them. If you say "I'm going to breed my mare" I'd probably respond "Sweet, with who?" But what i'm thinking is..."Go save a horse!" I think the ONLY time you should breed is when BOTH the mare & stud are very accomplished. ;] This isn't really a question but I want to see what people say.       Thanks for your input

20090203154712AAvtlTA	Pets;Cats	Question about cat's accessibility to water?	I live in an apartment, and I have been told that the tenants around me have cockroaches. I have noticed a few. When I moved in the problem was bad, but the building brought in an exterminator and they went to each suite, and I didn't see any for a long time. Now I have noticed here and there a few again. I want to stop this before it gets out of hand, and I have eliminated all sources of food and water. However, my cat's food and water is left out overnight! She normally finishes what's in her food bowl by nighttime, but I'm worried about taking her water away at night. I want to empty the water bowl so they have no access to water. Will taking her water away at night be a health hazard for her? Extra info: she had a bladder stone a few years ago, got it surgically removed. She needs to have access to fresh water all the time - will taking her water away harm her?

Well, on Sunday he ran away. They had him for almost two years. It is winter where we live, and they really want their cat to come home. He does not have a tag, or microchip. He is lost.    I need tips on how to find him. I know to put up flyers and stuff, but what are some tips about looking for him. I was thinking that they look at night, because cats are more active at night. I suggest they open a can of tuna, and they walk slowly around the area, looking for him. Is that a good idea? What are some ideas you have? All help would be great, thanks :)

20090203154605AAhN4Su	Pets;Dogs	Ah! HELP! Potty Training!!!?	Here's a little background info on the issue...      My boyfriend and I have a Westie, Oscar. He is basically potty trained just has a few forgivable accidents every now and then but that's fine because he's not even two yet. We decided to get another puppy while he is still a puppy himself. Her name is Scarlet.      Scarlet is a Yorkie/Maltese/Pekingese. She is about 11 weeks old. We got her and the breeder said that she was about 80%  potty pad trained, we brought her home and it was more like 50% tops.       So our problem is... we want her to go potty outside. We are trying the crate training. Her crate is actually our 1/2 bathroom with a gate up, she has her food and water in there because they are less likely to go potty where they eat.  She has never had an accident in the crate. We take her to go potty and say go potty go potty go potty if she goes potty then she gets to be out of the crate and play for awhile if she does not go potty then she goes back in the crate and we try again about 20 mins later. She will not go potty all of the sudden!! I put her outside and she just sits & shakes (it's freezing out by the way, we're in MN). Then I feel bad because it's so cold and put her back in the crate and try again and repeat and repeat. She still will not go and I'm afraid of like a urinary tract infection or holding in her poo too long.      Am I doing everything right? Any suggestions?! Any help at all would be sooo great!

20090203155112AAUdaHh	Pets;Cats	My new kitten licks windows from stress. Any ideas about changing behavior?	I adopted two sibling male kittens when they were 12 weeks old. Both eat and drink well. Although he didn't do this at his birth home, the smaller kitten immediately took up licking the aluminum sliding glass door frame and the aluminum framing around windows, and the glass of each. If it leads to the outside, this kitten licks it (these kittens are kept indoors). The kittens were born in a house and stayed in the same single room until we adopted them at 12 weeks old. They weaned at around 8 weeks. It is clear that the kitten is licking in response to stress. When he tries a new activity or when something changes in the room, he runs to a window or door and licks for three minutes. He will not let anything distract him. His brother tackles him when he starts, but he will not play. If I offer a fun toy, he will not play. If I pull him away, he moves right back. I do not scold him. I've cleaned all the surfaces that he licks with plain water, so at least he will not be ingesting something bad, but at some point, it would be nice to use cleansers in the course of housekeeping. I would be concerned about leaving any residue if kitty is licking. We have only had these kittens for a week and a half. I'd like to help my poor window licking kitten adjust so he doesn't need to do this. I am toying with the idea of applying a bitter deterrent to the surfaces, but I'd rather give him a better way to displace his anxiety so he stops on his own. Suggestions?

20090203161922AAsdI0P	Pets;Dogs	Does it get any easier? Shelter Workers?	Today was my first day at my new job, and I know that everyone says it's hard to work at a shelter. But does it get a little easier once you're used to animals being surrendered and the ones that never leave? It was so hard not to cry when a cat was dropped off today, and the cat has no idea what's going on but I know it's parent just left him to us. And the cat totally shuts down and doesn't want anyone to come near him/her because they've never been forced to live in a kennel. Or the dog that's been there for 5 months and isn't showing any progress in it's stranger anxiety and might not be able to be adopted? How do you cope? Do you let yourself cry sometimes? Or do you hold it in?

I've looked through all the pure bread dog breeds in all of Australia 4 or 5 times each just to make sure I find the right one and I just can't get over the Australian Kelpie. I love their looks, especially the pointy ears and all the color choices. My family and I already have a miniature Australian shepherd. I looked on pedigree.com.au and it says the kelpie has excellent compatibility with other pets and animals which is a plus, but then other sites said that they get aggressive when bored. I also have 5 acres of land with a barbed wire fence around it so it could get away if it ran off, but training or a long chain could accommodate for that sort of thing. Any help???

He limped, holding up his back left leg, for about 5 minutes. The next day and a half everything was normal. I noticed him limping again right before bed, but stopped after only a few minutes. Again, I noticed it today, but then later it is as if it never happened. He still runs and tears around the house. He is only a year and a half old, and other than when I see him limp, no behavior has changed. I've yet to check his paws and nails, but after doing some research, I'll do that when I get home. There is also no swelling, so I don't think it is broken. I'm wondering if I should take him into the vet? But when I see him run on it...I assume it can't be THAT bad. What do you think?

20090225065552AA4IUeM	Pets;Dogs	Free Feeding Vs Scheduled Feeding.?	Well i have been free feeding my dogs since day one. I have always had fresh food and water for them to eat at anytime in the day if there hungry. Well Taco my chihuahua and Precious my chi-poo are great on it! Taco is in perfect weight, not to skinny, not to fat i mean perfect! Precious is the same way. She is perfect. Has a good body, not skinny but no extra fat.       Now Taz my pom has a show coat. So he has this really thick flowing long coat. So naturally you cannot tell his weight by your eyes alone. I check him every now and then to make sure he is eating well, i weigh him also and he seems fine, well was i wrong!!      For the summer about a week ago i decided to shave him down completely and let him have a break from his show coat. I left about an inch. Well i bathed him and accidentally cut a piece of his ear off!! I know i blame myself :( well....when i dried him off and put him down i was like OH MY! He is a fatty!! He looks like an obese chihuahua now! My friend has a chihuahua that is obese and i always make fun of it :P I always tell her that him being fat is not good for his health and can take numbers off his life. Well now my pom looks like his twin. I couldn't believe it. So thats when i started to investigate. Well to my surprise Taz loves to go over to the food bowl and eat his little heart out! I have never noticed how much he eats. So now even though the other two are great on free feeding. I need to get them on a schedule for Taz'es sake.       I have no clue how this is done. There all toy breed dogs. If your a schedule feeder can you please tell me your schedule? Also if you don't mind could you make me a schedule or show me how. I just want to get an idea. Any times of the day. I have my own times so works not a problem. Any time of the day thats best to feed i will. Just any recommendations please would be great. Also how much should i feed? Precious is 14 pounds. Taco is 8 pounds, Taz (the smallest of them all) Is 9 pounds weighs more then Taco yet is much smaller then him.       They are fed Nutro Ultra Holistic. How much should i give each of them per serving, how many times a day and at what times?      Thank you. Oh wow i wrote a lot! Sorry for all that, i just want to get every last detail in, to give you guys a better view on it. Thanks again!

20090304181549AAIHv6n	Pets;Dogs	When should I start giving my puppy HEARTGUARD?	My shih tzu puppy is 14 weeks old.  He is up to date with all his vaccinations.  He also gets regular vet visits.        I wasn't really informed about heartguard yet.  Only that I needed him to have it as well.  Now my question is, when should I take him to get Heartguard?      I know it is for heartworms, but can you please explain to me how Heartguard works?  Is it injected, orally given, etc?         I apologize I don't know much about Heartguard.  Please bare with me. I am a new pet owner who is doing her best to be a good owner.         Thanks in advance.
20090304175754AAPKHug	Pets;Other - Pets	Can you keep a wild bunny as a pet?	Ok, so my dog was in the backyard and it attacked a baby bunny.  It is either in deep shock or it is wounded, and I was wondering if I clean it up and keep it/feed it in the proper conditions, can it be kept as a pet.  I don't mean for 8 years, just until it gets better, would it be ok for the baby bunny, as there was no mom or anyother bunny around.  This is serious, thank you.

20090304183403AA69SEA	Pets;Dogs	"Justice For Regina", Torture?	I just happened across this on one of my rescues websites, has anyone heard about the Justice For Regina campaign thats happening in Spain, and pretty much in every other corner of the earth?      Basically, in Spain a shelter was broken into by a group of vandals, and a single dog, Regina, was bound by wire and sexually abused (I'll refrain from further detail, its bad), and had her head bashed in.       How bad does the world have to get before masses of people stand up and change it? How many animals must suffer at the hands of cold hearted demons before someone can stand up and stop it?

20090304175348AANa0bV	Pets;Dogs	Is it safe to move 5 week old puppies outdoors?	I have 8 Australian Shepherd pups and they are getting to be a big handful, especially in the house. They ruined the carpet, and it smells awful. mother dog keeps escaping and so do the puppies out of their exercise pen, and today they tore up the house while I was sleeping. They are still pretty small, they will be 6 weeks old on the 6th and I am wondering how they might handle the cold? I live in Cali and it gets about 35-40 at night. They are not use to being out there so. Also is it ok if they are with their father in the outdoor pen? Mother will be with them but I am not sure how things go with dad if they are together a long time. He seems good around them when they are all playing outside and seems sorta afraid of them. He is a very gentle dog. What do you think to both of these questions? Thank you very much.

20090304180650AAr5nRs	Pets;Horses	Question on horse behavior?	Do you think all horses (meaning all breeds etc,) are born with the same potential to have the same awareness in a natural environment?   I have heard that arabians for example are more aware than say, a big warm blood. Do you think this is true and if so why? Like if arabians evolved in hot climates (hence why they are called hot bloods), do you think that had an effect on their "awareness" vs. the cold environment of the cold blooded horse?

20090304175604AAeHiNJ	Pets;Birds	How do my friend get his budgie to trust him again?	Yesterday, there was a little tree incident. I was at my friend's house and he let a bird out, but he didn't realize that the wing feathers grew long again. He let the budgie out outside, thinking he won't fly. But then the budgie attracted a couple sparrows. The budgie flew up to his tree to talk to the sparrows. He got him down by shaking the tree.  And also his little sister scared the bird and it kept opening its mouth. It used to be nice, but now, the bird bites when you do step up.

20090304180727AA00e5q	Pets;Cats	My unneutered male cat always meows..?	He is around one year ten months old.   He is unneutered, as I said.   He is always meowing. He has always been loud, but he does this meow all of the time.    He very scared of everything so, if you stay still and you watch him, he opens his mouth and meows and closes it. They are quick meows in themselves, but he goes on with it for a long time.   He doesn't seem to do this when he is on my bed. He purrs a bit too much when he is on my bed, and sometimes pees.       I think that neutering him should take care of this, but what do you think?      If it means anything, we also have a female spayed cat and another unneutered male.

And the owner of the dog showed me proof that he had had his rabies shots. Do I really need to go to the doctor? I don't have health insurance. Can I just take care of this myself now ?

We had to buy him a big crate, because he isn't good if we leave him around the house (chewing up things, chasing cats, etc.). Anyways, so about 6 months ago our boston terrier came up to the crate to sniff it. Our husky charged at him and was attacking him very violently. He actually did quite a lot of damage! Our boston terrier had a huge slit in his throat that almost killed him! I don't want this to happen again (it has, but not AS bad) but i don't know how to stop it. We tried hiding the crate somewhere else, but our husky still was protective of it behind something! We need help fast before something else happens! What do I do?

20090304184508AAaJnS4	Pets;Other - Pets	Why do you think my rabbit died?	I had a 2 year old American Dwarf Rabbit and he died Monday. I live in New Jersey and the weather has been weird here but the temperature in my house has been about the same. The rabbit lived in the house and he showed no signs of being ill. I recently found out that the pet store I bought him from gets their puppies from puppy mills and they might get their rabbits from a place similar to puppy mills. I didn't feed him vegetables that week because I ran out, but I don't think a week would hurt him. He always had clean water. I did recently buy a new food for him because it was cheaper but the people at the pet store said it was a bit better for him then the stuff I was giving him because it has more nutrition. I told the person that I haven't given him vegetables for a week and he said if im feeding him that it will make up for some of the nutrition he lost for not eating vegetable. I bathed him 2 weeks prior to that and he jumped out and he landed weird but he acted just fine so I assumed he was okay. I felt him for broken bones and he didn't react like we was in pain and I didn't feel anything. I checked him the next whole week for bruises and found nothing. If you need more information let me know. Thanks!

This morning, I noticed a sudden deepening of color on one of the goldfish that hadn't been there the night before. The fish is orange, and the top of it's body has darkened into a burnt orange/ reddish color, which has now spread to some of it's fins. The fish doesn't seem to be acting any differently, although it does rest at the bottom of the bowl often.   I was wondering whether or not my fish could be sick, or what this could be. I searched online, but none of the descriptions of illnesses in goldfish match the discoloration on my fish's body, and I'm not sure if it could be due to the water because my other goldfish does not have any markings on it. If my fish is sick, is there anything I can do or buy to help it?

20090304200241AAbXTAd	Pets;Dogs	Is there anything I can do for this puppy?(long story)?	I live in Berkeley, CA. I grew up in Minnesota. I'm a pretty down to earth person.      I love good people and I love animals. I've a got a black lab/pit bull mix named Daisy who's 16 months old and she's a my wiggly buddy. I like to take her hiking with me and I like her to play with her dog friends at the park. I have a few close friends who are homeless and they have dogs and they have a real good relationship with their dog. Probably even better than what I have with mine, they do everything with their dogs and they keep them and take good care of them and work with them to live and they live a long time. (one of them is a 14 year old and still kickin' GSD/Rottie mix and his owner lived in an apartment above where his dog was born and when he met the puppy one day he said it just looked him in the eye and came up to him like they were gonna be together forever and so the guy picked him up, asked if he could have him, and they've been together ever since.)      Sorry for the longness of this, I rant.      Anyway, so when you have friends that are homeless, you get to know a lot of the other homeless people to. Some of them aren't such great people. There's this one 40 year old man who's always being mean and nasty to everyone. He has nothing to say that isn't sick. But I always just avoided him, and he wasn't like hostile or anything, just a nasty druggie who may act tough but he's HONESTLY just really weak. So I really don't like this guy to begin with. Well, one day I was in the park with my dog and I saw some traveling kids with some puppies. I knew I wasn't in any place to be taking on another dog, but I wanted to go check them out and see which one I would get if I could, and just in general observe the different puppie's personalities and imagine how they'd grow up. Well this little black girl puppy with I white stripe on her chest just walks right up to me and looks at me and genuinely seems to be very happy on my lap, and she's wiggling and licking me and rolling everywhere. Some of the other puppies were prettier, but she was just like my dog was when I got her, and it was so nice to see another dog with such great personality. I reluctantly put her down and hoped she went to someone nice. Since they were just being given away, I considered just taking her for free and trying to find a good person for her myself. But practically at the same moment that thought crossed my mind, here comes the nasty mean man and HE'S just gotten that same puppy. This feeling of sorrow came over me. It seemed so horrible that such a sweet innocent dog would have to be with such a cold person.      And as she's been growing up, I've seen how he treats her. He's always choking her because she wants to play with other dogs, and meet people, he doesn't train her, she never gets off the leash to play, and she's real high energy...she's way too thin, and he just really doesn't seem like he cares about her at all.      I want to do something for this dog. I don't know if I can report something or if maybe do you think I could buy her from him? I think he would sell her to me if I offered him a good chunk of money. I want to help this dog but I don't want to mix with this person too much. I don't even know if I could keep her but I know I could find her a better person to be with, someone who could appreciate her. Even through the cruelty, she's still so sweet everytime I see her. And she's even got Pit bull Chow Chow and Boxer in her, also lab. But she's just the sweetest thing ever.       What should I do?

Our other dog 1 yrs and 5 months old. He is very fisty, not socialized, and was caged by his previous owner for the first 3 months of his life. I really don't think my father likes our youngest beucas HE didn't pick him, he didn't raise him from birth, and he expecs him to be just like our older dog.       My father like to rant( about our dog )to people when they comment  on how beautiful our youngest dog is....       http://s254.photobucket.com/albums/hh95/...    ---youngest          http://s254.photobucket.com/albums/hh95/...  ---oldest         He treats my older dog better. by letting him sleep in the living room ( which normally is the kitchen) petting our oldest dog ect...      he constantly yells at our youngest dog.... treats him like the step child.. ( never hitting by the way) he is extremyl unfai and bluntly says how much he dislike him...      my mother loves the youngest dog.. its her dog...      She s told me when i move out i can keep him... i love him to death. I really believe that with formal training and socialization he would be a good dog....         my youngest knows thats my father doesn't like him YET he follows my father round everywhere. I don't get it.       He is very rambuntious and i think its becuase he dosn't get everything my oldest dog gets that makes him such a pain and making him do all these "bad things". chooses on things EXTREMLY EXICTABLE... ect.       a little help please.

20090304190517AAjerkR	Pets;Dogs	Need help with a leg splint...for rehabilitation therapy?	I just brought my little sheltie mix home from the vet. She is 1 1/2 yrs old and in great health. She recently slipped off the bed and landed wrong. Well that bad landing caused a luxating patella in her right hind leg. It isn't too serious yet, I am thinking grade 1 maybe 1 1/2. The vet said to get her seen by an orthopedic vet for consult(doing this regardless, I just like having questions and info ready so I don't get "played") and that surgery would most likely be needed but it isn't a pressing issue. Well she is my little girl and I will do what I need to for her. I have been looking online and have read several things about treating this with therapy. What I am wondering is if you have treated your dog with therapy what was the outcome and if possible what was the routine, I do not have swimming as an option. I was also wondering for those of you that have done the surgery what was the outcome and if possible what was the cost for the procedure, gotta know how much to set aside if it comes to this. I really appreciate your help, I know that therapy can work wonders, especially for a healthy fit dog, so I would like to try that first and if it comes down to it I would get her the surgery without thinking twice. I just don't want her to be put through the pain of surgery when they vet said she isn't in pain currently. The vet even showed me how to pop it back in if she doesn't do it on her own. I guess I am just hoping I can "tighten" it back up and just keep her healthy without going under the knife. Thank you I am just worried about my little girl.

20090304185620AAf4W6m	Pets;Dogs	Best training route for my puppies?	I've decided that I need to step it up a little bit with my dogs and their training so I've been looking into different training groups and the one that really had amazing results was Sit Means Sit. Yes, I know they use negative reinforcement, but they also use treats. And yes, I know they use "shock collars", but I have felt one on the setting people are SUPPOSED to use it on (on my neck!) and it is nothing but an annoyance. No pain whatsoever. That being said, I still have some doubts.      Case 1: Oliver    He's my youngest dog, almost a year now and being a puppy, he has ADD. :P I know that he's going to be unfocused for awhile since thats just how puppies are, but I would really like to harness some of his energy and use it towards obeying commands. He has no focus whatsoever the moment we step outside for a walk. Here's my problem: I would use treats/praise over and over again until he learns BUT when I try to give him a treat, he won't even look at it xD He has NO interest in the treat whatsoever when we're outside. Just all the interesting sights and smells. :3 I think the collar would really help because it'd be an external irritant (as in he wouldn't feel as if I was actually punishing him; I would never raise my voice to him or say 'no', I would just use the collar) and one that he couldn't ignore, unlike a treat. How do you get a dog to come in a busy dog park with treats when the dog doesn't even care about 'em? :] The only reason I'm hesitating is that I don't want my dog to turn into a robot where he does each and every little thing I ask and nothing else. I want his personality to be there because he's an amazing dog and my best friend, not a tool for me to use. (I'm 16 years old, so I consider him a friend ^^) All I really want is a little more focus in distracting situations. Any solutions? Will it just take practice, over and over?      Case 2: Jake     Jake is my older dog. He is around 6 years old now. (Don't know specific age for both dogs because I found both of them wandering on the street as little pups.) He has a HUGE problem with aggression towards people and dogs. He is very territorial and protective of me, which doesn't bother me while I'm in my own home, but when I take him for a walk, he growls and barks and pulls on the leash whenever someone walks by. Other than that, he is very well trained and really smart. He learns very fast and knows that my family and I are the alphas. No worries there. I really would like to be able to take him to the dog park without him killing people or other dogs D: (No, he's never killed someone lol) I love that he's a guard dog, I would just really like to be able to control it; he guards when I want him to guard. However, when I think about putting him in the Sit Means Sit class, I could almost cry! (I love my dogs) He's old and has done sooo much for me when I didn't do my best job of training him. (I was younger and had very little patience ): ) He's loyal, smart, and responsive (except when there are people coming near me). I'd feel bad for putting him through all the stress of some stranger handling him and forcing him to obey. Then again, I feel bad every time I go to the dog park and can only take Oliver, leaving Jake watching us leave through the window. (Such a sad sight!) I think he'd be so much happier if we could conquer this aggression and let him play with people and other dogs. Still, he's old and I love him to bits. I don't want to stress him out after all he's done for me. What are your thoughts?      If you need any additional detail, lemme know. :] And thanks!

20090304205039AALWhQl	Pets;Dogs	Is There Something *I* Can Do?	Well this is an extremely out of the ordinary question. But its worth a shot.      Well i am half Caucasian, Half Filipino. I was born and raised here in the United States. Although i did go to the Philippines quite a few times to do modeling. While we went my whole family would go and we stayed with family that lived there. Well the first time i went i was around 1-2 so i cant remember anything. But i went one time i might have been 13-14 cause i modeled. So anyway when i stepped foot off the plane into the Philippines.. i remember I could smell barbecue. But its smelted odd, so I looked up and the first thing i saw was "dog on a stick" I was shocked. Well my dad had a little Jack Russel at the time that we took a long. I begged him too, but now it still eats me up inside and i really regret it- So one night my dad let T-bone (his Jack Russel) out in the yard to relive himself. T-bone wanted to stay out for awhile so my dad let him. One of my mothers brothers came over opened the gate an let T-bone out. Well long story short one of the Filipino guards at the house got a bat hit little T-bone over the head, made a fire and eat him all up. I cried so hard for months. I hated the country and the people, an just wanted to go home.       Anyway there are stray animals everywhere that are killed or tortured. One day i went over to a starving pregnant dog an started to feed her, my moms mother told me to stop an everyone was laughing, asking me why i would feed the stupid stray dogs and to let them be. Even my own grandmother paid a guy to through a cat up in the air, let it hit the ground until it died!!! She is of that country, she is filipino. An still today i do not let her near my animals.      So anyway now that i am all grown. I really want to do something for the poor animals in that county. If i am not mistaken it is 47.37$ to every 1 filipino peso. So this may sound crazy but it takes 1$ to spay/neuter a dog over there. So if i went over there drove around and picked up every stray i found an lets say i got 20 strays. Well it would cost me 20$ to spay an neuter them all. Thats nothing!! If you bring american dollars over there you can do wonders. So this is my dream. I guess it sounds a little crazy? But what do you think? I want to help the animals over there. Money is not a problem in the least bit. What should i do? I want to do something? I know my little T-bone up there in heaven would be so proud! Eh this probably sounds crazy but I guess its worth a shot.      Sorry for this being so long.      PS. I am not saying all Filipinos are bad to animals, hey i am half! I am just talking about some.

20090304190730AAY6jh7	Pets;Dogs	What is best method of flea control for a small dog?	We live in Toronto, Canada but are vacationing in Ft. Myers Florida for 6 weeks.  We do know that fleas and ticks are prevalent in the warmth of Florida.  We have two Chihuahuas and I'm always very paranoid that they will get fleas.  I wouldn't want that to happen since we rent a condo for our stay here.       I hate to use strong presticides on them though.  My husband and I favor more natural forms of flea control but I don't think there is anything that is effective.  We have used Advantage a few times in the past and it worked fine.  This time a vet down here recommended Vectra....though I think it might be stronger and more dangerous than Advantage.     Does anyone have any recommendations for us?  We'd prefer an effective nautropathic flea control method.  If there is nothing effective what's the next best that is the least toxic or injurious to the pet?       We are concerned since our chi that is 14 years old had back surgery about 5 years ago and we hate putting pesticides on his back.  Thanks for your help and recommendations.

20090304194132AAEA5YF	Pets;Fish	Is my betta fish okay? Or am I just a paranoid crazy person?-picture of betta-?	Okay, I might be seriously paranoid or something because I keep reading about betta fish and their diseases and my friend keeps telling me how to cure diseases and how her fish was constipated...anyways:    My betta fish, Toto, had been living in a 1/2 gallon tank and I thought something was going to happen. And I kept examining him everyday and my friend said he looks like something happened to his left fin like...a tiny bit was missing so I got some medicine to heal damaged fins and skin. So I recently got him a 5 gallon tank with 3 Danios and a Pleco.    Okay, so he sometimes like spazzes up and down the glass walls and I also found him resting by a plant near the bottom of the tank. AND then I read about a couple of diseases and whatnot and I don't want my fish to die cause that's what my dad keeps saying.    Toto is a dark blue betta but then when I accidently took a closeup picture on flash some red also showed up near his face. The red isn't that visible on his face, but if you look close you can see it. And I've always been able to see the red on his....fins? The ones like directly below his face.    He still eats like a pig though and swims around. Yeah...   Anyways, sorry for such a long thing. I might just be paranoid. Thanks for helping! And here's a picture of Toto:  http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y150/Ma... 
20090304194223AAkhImS	Pets;Cats	I think my cat is in labor. Is she having problems delivering?	For about the last hour she occasionally tenses up her entire body 3 or 4 times in row, back to back. Like (tense-relax-tense-relax-tense-relax) is the pattern, lasting maybe 15 seconds to complete. She's laying on her side and tries to raise her rear leg but she's too big, so I help her by just holding it about level to her shoulder. (slightly raised) She is wet under her tail and acts like she's ready to give birth. I felt the babies moving just last night but I haven't checked if they are moving tonight. I'm wondering if she is having problems getting started. She is six years old and is a very, very tiny little Scottish Fold breed. This is her third pregnancy. I wasn't her owner during the other two. Is there something I should watch for that will determine she needs medical attention? Is it possible that she may have to have them taken out of her surgically, cesarean section? How long should I wait?

20090304194856AACDa6X	Pets;Dogs	Ten Week Old English Mastiff Has A Runny Nose...?	I took him to the vet today he has already had to rounds of most of his shots. But this morning he suddenly had a runny nose and cough but it sounds like he is trying to clear his throat. The runny nose is clearish white. He eats normal plays and sleeps. No runny fecal or vomitting. The vet said he either has a respiratory infection or distemper. The whole distemper thing scares me and im trying to see what you think the likley hood of him having it is. Could it be kennel cough? He is on antibiotics now. Im just really worried. They said if he starts getting seizures they will have to put him down....

I'm really worried about him, he's 3 years old. We took him to an Animal Hospital and all they did was recommend Benedryl without sinus and recommend us to an Emergency Hospital in another town. I just wanted to know if it's allergies or something else, and what may cause it.

20090304202104AAnSeKL	Pets;Dogs	Itchy Scratchy Dog.  HELP!?	A couple months ago, my dog started scratching and scratching.  We gave her a bath, changed her food, gave her Brewer's yeast (for fleas), combed her, flea treatment, no change.  She ended up getting a nasty hot spot, so we took her in to the vet.  Prednisone, antibiotics and she was fine.  Until a few weeks later and it is back, just the same.  We made an appointment for the vet again and tonight I noticed she has another hot spot.   Help!  What can we do?!  We can't afford to keep taking her to the vet.  I need help!

20090304161403AAEPqWQ	Pets;Dogs	How did the "dangerous dogs" get such a bad reputation?	Even  though a lot of them started as guard dog breeds,they were quite popular family pets.      But,all of a sudden,most of them got bad reputations.   Even German Shepard's,which is somewhat surprising considering the fact they were such popular dog breeds during the war,and were featured respectively in multiple tv shows,during the time most other "dangerous dogs" reputations were taking a heel face turn.      What happened exactly? Someone just decided to use certain breeds in dog fights again,and guarding?    But,they were used for those before and they had great family reputations.
20090304221941AACPaIy	Pets;Fish	Pregnant Fish...help?	I have 3 pregnant fish, 1 platy, 1 mickey mouse platy and 1 blue calico platy. They are all pregnant and getting really big now. the three of them have stopped being sociable and are resting on the bottom of the community tank. They are leaning on the bottom and whenever i look to see if they are giving birth they swim away to the opposite side and do the same thing. I am just wondering when should i separate them from the others so their babies dont get eaten. i kinda think they are getting close!
20081028063142AA6liqK	Pets;Dogs	Could it be time to euthanize my dog?	My 12 year old cocker has had cataracts for quite some time and has been hard of hearing.  Yesterday, he seemed completely disoriented.  He was walking around in circles and bumping into everything.  I had to carry him up the 3 steps into the kitchen for the first time and literally direct his head to his food so he would eat.  I now have to carry him outside to go potty.  I don't mind doing these things for him, but could this sudden change in behavior mean it might be soon time to put him to sleep?
