1oxBCtmZaa	I agree with your decimal - 0.01% - but you should phrase it "atmospheric carbon dioxide" or "CO2 as a component of the atmosphere" to make it clear that you're referring to the fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere.   Then you're Ok.<br>  <br>  But clearly the 35% is misleading for the reasons you state - and deliberately so.<br>  <br>  EDIT - and don't you know they re-wrote the climate history to eliminate the MWP?    I'm waiting for the Obama tax-hikers to re-write history to exclude JFK's 1962 speech to the NY Economic Club and to re-write the history of the American Revolution so that it didn't start with a tax revolt led by small businessmen.|`|076i35yGaa	If you look at a graph of temperature compared to sunspot activity it is startlingly parellel.  If you look at a graph of temperature as compared to carbon dioxide levels over this same period it's a mess and really isn't even close.<br>  <br>  BTW, did you know that straight from the ice core data from Antarctica that the IPCC uses it shows CO2 levels from 1893 that would not be seen to be that high again, 328 PPM, until 1973?  I guess if the IPCC can miss a chunk of ice the size of California it's not surprising they would miss this as well in thier report.<br>  <br>  They are trying rewrite history trying to make people believe that the Medivial Warming Period was colder than today saying it was localized to Europe.  To believe this we must discard documented history.  We must ignore that they could farm Greenland, not possible today.  We must ignore that there were grapes growing in Maine and Nova Scotia and wild grapes can not survive there today.  We must ignore the Viking longhouse ruins found in northern Canada where ships can not travel to today because the route is blocked by sea ice.  We have to ignore the fact it wasn't isolated to just Europe.|`|wP1pgUKVaa	gee whiz, does it matter? Global Warming  is now officially dropped and will be history in 2 yrs...why do u people keep beating a dead horse? GET  OVER IT! Global warming has been disproven and will be continually disproved until u white-coated tree-hugging freaks gettoverit! It's like evolution. It's been disproved, but you scientists still keep trying to prove it...|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	To someone who doesn't have a pre-existing faith in AGW - the sun looks to be the more likely candidate, especially if the effect of CO2 is already saturated.|`|t1zlbOURaa	The sun. It is much more powerful than we could ever conceive of being.|`|AsKWImpQaa	Well, if it were a 0.01% increase in CO2 and a 0.5% variance in solar output I would think that the sun would definitely have a greater influence.<br>  <br>  But actually since it's about a 35% increase in CO2 and a 0.1% variance in the sun, that tilts the odds in the favor of CO2.<br>  <br>  Time to re-check your math again.

They're used in transformers as a dielectric and a coolant and are used in high voltage breakers to quench the electric arc caused by the natural inductance of high voltage transmission lines.   They might be used in a car's electric system but otherwise, I can't imagine why they would be in a car.|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	premenstural syndrome know more about it at this article

93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	I believe that we live in a dynamic system not a static one. In that I believe that this is a hoax.<br>  <br>  However, I still try to be green in certain areas as it is not a bad idea and helps me save quite a bit of money on home heating and electricity. I also believe that bamboo is a very good material to use as well because it grows so darn fast.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Too big and too complex for our current methods for studying. All we can do is watch the climate shifts, glaciers melt, trees die in some areas, other area that use to be dry are turning green, and a lot seems to be going on that we have never seen in recorded history.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the whole that it's a hoax, after all, you can't avoid what is happening out there. You can call it a cycle, and I believe it is, but at the same time I believe a lot of what we are seeing is pushing this cycle along faster to an extreme that will probably be a negative turn of events of many people, maybe even their demise including you and me.<br>  <br>  Do I believe we can throw money at it. Not really. We can try to slow down what we believe to be the culprit such as carbon emissions, but there is not a dynamic link. Some believe that it might take up to 100 years to see a difference of what we do to stop it today. This will not inspire many to try, and we will as a race in the future will probably suffer.<br>  <br>  But it might wind up as a positive, at least for some. Places once inhabitable could be paradises, and current nice places wastelands.|`|VSpqYAabaa	GW/CC  is a natural, cyclical event. It's happened before and it will continue ad finitum.
9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	Biospheres are moving more dramatically in altitude rather than geography.  There are certain articles which have been published that describe numerous plant and animal species observed to be moving up mountain sides due to a rise in average temperatures, with the species that already reside at the top facing an increased risk of extinction due to changing environment and increased competition for resources.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Habitats naturally migrate.  As climates change, the habitats obviously migrate in altitude and north and south.  There is a dynamic equilibrium of species as they move into areas that can support them.  They stay as long as they are the fittest and until the climate changes too much.  As a geologist, I have seen it demonstrated.  Sometimes it can be seen in subsequent layers at the same location.  You might get different fossils assemblages as it changes.|`|DIBo12zjaa	I think your referring to ecosphere's, biosphere is used in the broadest concept as a singularity or as a whole. It's not intended to be used in a plural form. It is subdivided however, and different fields of science may see it as, something else entirely. Eco and biome shifts do occur, perhaps the best example would be the Sahara desert. Lesser examples would be transitional ecosystems, such as savanna's. Another could be the wide range of variances for microbes and virus's. You will always find fringe ecosystems just about everywhere (here today gone tomorrow).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere</a>|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	We had an estimated 0.7 degrees temperature rise last century.

VLy1yqI2aa	Hopefully not in our life time|`|G3BVemgwaa	If we don't start minimizing the amount of pollution we are making on a daily basis then yes, it will probably by the end of the century. The scientists have done some studies recently that prove that if we don't change our ways now the polar bears will become extinct by 2050, that's only 41 years away! The polar bears will be extinct because the ice they live on in the colder climates on earth will have melted. This also means that there will be a huge flood all over the world. This will kill people. If you want to learn more about this crisis you should watch "An Inconvenient Truth" by Al Gore.

Also, one of the reasons that the  ice caps are melting is that we left a mini ice age around1850 AD.  What this is telling me is that "environmentalists" who are making millions of dollars off of this crises is laughing all of the way to the bank.|`|AA10815904	They can't do anything about it.
