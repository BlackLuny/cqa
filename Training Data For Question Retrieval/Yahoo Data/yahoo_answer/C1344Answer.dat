cCKASg4Waa	There is no cohesive or concerted "issue" that modern feminists are fighting for. It's mostly just male-bashing and whining.<br>  <br>  First Wave feminism's major issue was voting rights for women.<br>  <br>  Second Wave feminism's major issue was equal opportunity in the workforce and the removal of legalized sex discrimination in law.<br>  <br>  Third Wave feminists don't really have a sound purpose. This is because women do have equal opportunity and even more societal privileges than men. So now it's general whining with a very vague purpose.|`|Pnhkh7eiaa	Whoops, I didn't read the rest of the question after fighting.  Thought it was what was feminism fighting, which is equality.  Not fighting for, which would be female supremacy.|`|XKk101Kqaa	Well, Obama just repealed the global gag rule, so I think right now they want medicaid to cover abortions and birth control for lower socio-economic women..|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Who knows.

hR1wc0taaa	this sort of post makes you seem kind of crazy and angry and unmanageable, difficult, mercurial, unstable, confrontational, fun for the weekend, maybe...maybe drawing police attention or causing a fight|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I don't think I could.<br>  I'd be pissed if my husband was with another woman, and I'd be pissed if he watched me with another man and was okay with it.<br>  <br>  There would be jealousy and anger issues....but to each their own, who are we to judge?|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Believe me, if you don't like a relationship where someone else is setting limits and telling you what you can or cannot do with someone else, an open relationship is probably the farthest from what you want.  People tend to think that open relationships are somehow "deregulated", whereas in reality, you'll set out more rules and regulations about what is acceptable extra-marital/extra-relationship sex and love, and what is "cheating" (and yes, you CAN cheat in an open relationship).  You will talk and possibly argue about it for hours.  Jealousy, which is present in all relationships, will ratchet up a lot.<br>  <br>  Open relationships work for some people, but it takes a LOT of work.  Of course, so monogamous relationships.  But if you want a guy who won't set limits about your friends, you need to look for the right GUY, not try to change the relationship to fit a guy who is obviously not right for you.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	Both parties need to agree on the boundaries set, have a compatible idea of what they need, want or expect from their significant other and have a common understanding.<br>  <br>  The relationship that's best is one where both parties respect each other, regardless of whether it's an open relationship or not.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i just want to know where i can get that picture that you have in your avatar?<br>  <br>  edit: Winter Glory! you look so much cuter without your glasses.   ;-)|`|fqMWBsjGaa	You're avatar is awesome!|`|YFKxTNGeaa	I was in the middle of an open relationship between two different people. The guy and I were talking, txting all the time and he would call at like 1am and we'd talk for hours. I knew he had a girlfriend before but I assumed they had broken up. Turns out they were still "together". It bothered me a bit because I felt as though I was the "side-dish". He spent V-day with me which I thought was odd but he still considered to be just friends with me but in a relationship with the other girl. <br>  <br>  Its so confusing. I didn't understand how she could possibly be okay with this and how in the world she didn't consider it as not cheating on her. But they fought a lot because yeah, they had two different views on what was appropriate. <br>  She wanted open as in they can talk to other people but occasions like V-day and Christmas they'd spend together. He thought that it meant he could have a field day and claim her as his girlfriend and freely go around with other people without it being called "cheating". I hated the idea that I was the "girl on the side". We don't talk anymore, btw.<br>  <br>  Don't do the open relationship thing. Have an exclusive relationship but don't try and be controlling over one another. like don't say "you can't talk to her" and ya-de-da. That's ridiculous.
tyuxbdrnaa	Though no one in their right mind, is going to say they're happy about the situation...I bet, in truth...hard core man haters love that men are losing some of their work place power.<br>  <br>  It must be so sad for a man that can't find work,, because of the pressure society places on men to be the breadwinner.<br>  Many women have the option of working, their choice to stay home with the kids isn't as frowned upon.<br>  Stay at home men...there's still such a preconceived "he must be lazy" notion. That's got to be hard on his feelings of self worth.<br>  I'm not saying it isn't tough to be an out of work female, just a different kind of tough, I would imagine.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	It will probably lead to a lot of depression among men and as per usual during recessions the call for women to leave the workforce and scurry back home will be heard. <br>   Your analysis of why men and women are paid differently is simplistic. Women are still the main carers in society and carry out care duties. They are paid less in the same sectors as men and do suffer from a glass cieling and also work a lot of part time work because they take care of kids as well. This is statistically proven. Also welfare states such as in Denmark where women are given childcare and men are given paternity leave and pay is among the most eqaul. Rational choice arguments are silly because they ignore the structures of inequality.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	It's never a good thing when people lose their jobs, but those men should be very grateful right now if their wives are skilled or gainfully employeed. In the 30's when this many men lost their jobs families starved, at least now they can depend on the other half of the partnership to keep income coming in.|`|AA10527991	You can't take anyone serious who's happy about people losing their jobs.|`|Q82fSuroaa	They are beside themselves with mirth and glee but trying to keep a straight face.|`|OOVwqPd5aa	I am not happy about anyone loosing a job but I am sure those femmy bots are. I hate fems.|`|FUIBscKGaa	Why is this surprising?  Women are paid less,  and are more often part time workers.  Women also make up the vast majority of the service industry, which is the bulk of the low waged workers. It's cost effective to keep them in comparison to their male counterparts.  I know some of you like to pretend that the pay gap doesn't exist, but the Census Bureau and reality disagree.<br>  <br>  For somebody who claims to be an "equalist" you have some of the most misguided, woman hating posts on here.  You also rarely make sense. <br>  <br>  See, one of the privileges that men have enjoyed under patriarchal rule, is that you get to paint all women with one stroke, and blame them for whatever you wish.  You are also allowed to tell women what they think.  You are trying to cover your hatred of women by referring to "feminists", yet all of your posts include "women" in general, in some way or another.  You do this without even thinking about it, you feel so entitled.  At the same time, you get to claim that men are in fact the ones who are being picked on by "feminists", who work on behalf of all "women".  All of your posts slam all women, as a group, and you never, ever, prove your point.  When you are proven wrong, or called out you do that weirdo tactic  (that I've noticed a lot on here) of whining about being "shamed" by the evil feminists.  Thing is, you should be ashamed.  You're acting like a shithead.<br>  <br>  How often do you see all men on here painted with one stroke, or even blamed for anything, as the voices in your head so often tell you the big bad Feminazis do?  I've never seen it, and neither have you.  Every time you open your mouth, and let loose another of your "(all) feminists" and whining sessions about the better lives of "(all )women", you are lying.  You are telling tales contrary to reality.  Fibbing.  Attention grabbing.  You are giving every indication that you are petrified of women.  It's just sad how you think you are making any of us feel worse than you obviously do.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Probably because, even with the current economical situation being well known, women would STILL play the victim card and blame it on sexism if they think they can make a buck by suing their employer.<br>  <br>  And the legal system, with all it's bias and idiocy, would most likely pander to the women crying "victim" more often than not.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Sure!

Feminists aren't wherever they are wishing bad luck onto men.  80% of men are getting laid off, because men hold the higher paying jobs like engineering that CEO can't keep paying and women have lower paying jobs like teaching and nursing.  And there's still a demand for those jobs.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	For the last time, NO. As much as it's good for women to have the chance to prove they can be capable breadwinners, massive job losses are nothing to celebrate.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Male or Female, I feel sorry for those who have lost their jobs.

So no totally dismayed that so many people are being laid lowed by a rich elite's greed, as well as worried that intolerant right wing attitudes like yours raise their ugly head in times of recession, and flabberghasted that men still believe they can criticise feminism with brainpower the wattage of a birthday candle!<br>  Not right wing or sexist, just stupid question then?
AQkfW704aa	I can feel your hurt, some people are just miserable, if they can't be happy they do not want anyone else to be. So keep moving on girl don't let that man ruin your life. He must be really unhappy for him to do that to you. Please don't share in his sadness he is not worth it. Consider yourself the luckiest girl on earth to have him out of your life. Life is about making your own choices, don't let him decide your future from your past. Change your mobile number and don't pin for him anymore, he never cared about you he just wanted to hurt you. Good Luck.

The fact that you made friends, proves that you have an amazing personality.<br>  <br>  Taste in clothing shouldn't matter at all. If your mother doesn't like that, she'll have to suck it up and live with it. Loving Disney Princesses are fine. When she says that, she's acting childish. (I still love Disney princesses).<br>  <br>  Don't hate yourself, because if you act like yourself, then your perfect in every way.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	That's terrible, and your parents should be more supportive.

It seems you know these people are messed up or have their own issues, yet you really buy into what they say as if it is accurate about you.  Consider the source. The criticism says more about what kinds of people they are then it does about you.<br>  <br>  It's your job to be the best person you can and not try to please everyone else.  How you dress or where your hair does not say anything about your character or values.  <br>  <br>  People love to judge others to feel better about themselves.  Sometimes there is even jealousy in the criticism.  Don't let it get to you.  You're a teenager, if your mom and gramma liked those things about you, then you would really know there was something wrong.  they're old school.

You just can't listen to what people say about you-- it seems bad now, but soon you will be part of a much bigger and accepting world. For now, you just have to stick it out and know that what people say about you is cause by an insecurity in them, not a flaw in you. Just be strong, and know that you are a good person, and just because some people can't see that doesn't change the fact that you matter, and you can be strong and get through this.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	There is something wrong with you and that's the idea that something is wrong with you. Any events or feelings you align with that are just justifying it. You ARE just as horrible as you feel, BECAUSE you feel it, not because of any inherent meanings. It feels good to feel bad, it can have security in it. Personally I think that you haven't nothing to gain because you already have all the tools to feel the way you want. BUT any processes involved are after the fact and NOT the cause of a feeling.<br>  <br>  You don't need anything, you need everything (doesn't actually have meaning, just something to say to dislodge your location).|`|Vp83Fuakaa	its not you its your parents who put you through this you probably cant change that situation .i hope you make new Friends in your new school and hang in there you wont be a kid forever|`|8vfCRg7Caa	Yahoo answers is not for venting. if you have real problems go seek medical help. 15 years old is time to start realizing that you dont need to fit in, in school.

Otherwise,  this is yahoo answers not the authorities.|`|AA11616170	If anyone criticises you for the way you look, remind them that God created you that way so you must be perfect just the way you are.<br>  <br>  You had friends in the first city and the second  -  so obviously people found you likeable.  And they will, where you are now, and wherever you will be in the future.  No, there is nothing wrong with you, but you have been unfortunate in being surrounded by people who get their kicks tearing down the others around them.  <br>  <br>  Lots of famous people had shaky starts and families that did not treat them well (Oprah, for instance)  but they got beyond all that to carve out their own life.  You can too.  Be the very best you can be, learn to excel at something, and you will find the respect you long for.  It all starts with being your own best friend first.  Good luck !!!|`|AQkfW704aa	Oh dear your mind has been totally programmed the wrong way, moving places or cities should not affect who you are, you are created as a special being, unique and beautiful, there is no one who is like you in the whole wide world. There is no one who is ugly only peoples words are as they make others feel terrible about themselves.<br>  <br>   I can bet you that these people actually admire what you have and they are quite jealous and that's how they express their envy to you. I would like to think your parents love you the way you are because you inherited their looks and genes and they can not consider you ugly as they would be admitting that they are ugly too. Your outward looks will transform with growing up but it is your mindset that you have to work on.<br>   Start looking at the positive things about you and enjoy them pretty soon someone will feel your positive energy from that area and you will be making friends.<br>   There is a book I read called "As a man thinketh", it is a free book on the Internet you need to download it and read it. Your life is your responsibility, you shape it by the way you think and see yourself and not what others think or see you, or what you think others are thinking about you. Start working hard on your school and mind you will be a great person in this world.

EeabLB5eaa	First question: How are you on yahoo answers if your computers been taken away?<br>  Now advice: You need to start talking to your guidance consuler. Don't talk to your friends because they may not understand and the whole school may hear and that will make you sadder. Tell your guidance counsler everything sparing no details. She may reccomend you to a therpist, she'll notify your Mom and your Mom will realize that you do indeed have a problem. The theripist will help you out and help you sort through your issues. This will enable you to focus easier, which will help you study better, so you can get better grades. Your teachers will be nicer too, I'm pretty sure they get alearted of your problems or that your in therpy. I stress to keep this quiet so it dosen't get uglier then it needs too.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Talk to a counselor.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	We as humans are constantly testing our boundaries and when our parents (or authority figures) tell us something like "bad grades are undesirable" (a boundary) we use that boundary as a place to test ourselves. So by effect we (subconsciously for the most part) discover WHY those bad grades are undesirable, by using intimidation and disobedience. Modern parenting is a joke. <br>  <br>  As for the depression I suggest you make all the things you hate transparent (not-as-they-appear) and do things outside of your comfort zone. By going outside of your comfort zone, you are encouraging yourself to do what you are already doing.

D82wWDsGaa	Someone once said the most profound thing: "You don't know what you don't know."<br>  <br>  Before I realized its pointless to "convince" people they need to find an interest, I used to pry and pry someone to tell me what they liked to do. The reason I say it is pointless, is even if you find this magical thing this guy likes, getting him to do it is the hard part.  Its ignorance mixed with laziness, A politician's dream citizen.<br>  <br>  The problem is, he doesn't realize what he likes.  4 years ago, I didn't have much interest in planes.  I moved in with a pilot, learned how to fly, and now I always look towards the sky.  It came natural to me.  Does this mean it will for your buddy here? Who knows.<br>  <br>  Up until about a 6 months ago, I would have never thought I would be into Hypnosis, NLP and meditation. Never ever would it have crossed my mind.  I read one book, and all of a sudden I found out this was meant for me. <br>  <br>  My point is, most folks that say they have no interests, really don't know what they're missing.  How could someone say that in this world???  People that say they're all depressed, this and that, are just lazy people who expect someone to come into their life and give them excitement.  Never happens.<br>  <br>  Your guy has to get out and FIND things he likes.  And that is the hard part.  Take him to the airport, take him flying (provided he even goes).  He will most likely give objections of all kinds.  But you have to remember, you cannot make or even try to get someone interested in something.  All you can do is make it available and if they like it naturally, everything will take care of itself and manifest.<br>  <br>  Someone would never believe the things they are missing.  They just need to try stuff.<br>  Here are some hobbies I pursue:<br>  Shooting<br>  Scuba<br>  Skiing<br>  Flying (Expensive)<br>  Latin dancing (Great way to meet GORGEOUS woman, and have fun AND get to have your hands all over them)<br>  Martial arts<br>  Yoga<br>  Gym<br>  Toastmasters club (public speaking)<br>  Hypnosis<br>  Psychic influence<br>  Reading<br>  Movies<br>  breakdancing (or clubbing)<br>  <br>  There are endless things out there that people have no idea that even exist.

For them, I've always wondered if they might not be too far at the other end of the scale - so arrogant that they can see nothing beyond themselves and their issues, and so full of themselves they think they cannot be to blame for any of their life's problems and so have to point the finger at someone else, in this case feminists. (you know things like 'I can't get a job because too many women are in the work force' etc. - yes, I saw a posting like that on here).<br>  <br>  Granted, narcissism is a double-edged sword, where the person is paradoxically both super egoistic and low in self-esteem - so, perhaps we're both looking at the same coin from different sides?|`|zCxRUFRCaa	Men, like me, who strongly oppose man-haters like and respect strong women.<br>  <br>  You on the other hand want some kind of proof that you can *bring a man down* ...

No, we do not fear women.|`|hR1wc0taaa	as an abstract concept, supressing your feelings is normal and does not mean anything.<br>  <br>  I might supress my feelings for any number of reasons depending on who I was around.<br>  <br>  I don't share my feelings with those who would not be able to handle them, or would be insensitive to them, or might judge me by sharing them. <br>  <br>  that is the way civilization works.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	No, but I have noticed how feminists with superiority complexes like to try and shame men with derogatory language and imply (or boldly claim outright) they are 'scared' of women somehow and 'intimidated' - such a silly, old, predictable and pathetic effort.|`|Q82fSuroaa	Strong women are great.  Feminism makes them hard and mannish.   That's what turns us off.|`|ea49eff6b5328302dbce4a3790181947aa	We don't oppose feminism. We oppose sexism and Misandry. We all know of the paradigm shift.  Women, once upon a long time ago were treated like crap. Today, men have no rights- and that's fact. We are the ones who are treated like crap and are led to believe that our lives are purposeless. Sperm Donors- knuckle dragging apes- who are dumb. If you had these pressures against you- how would you feel? And why is it so funny or interesting to know how it would feel to be less masculine. How would a woman feel if she were asked to be more manly? Why is it so amusing to see men squirm under gender challenges?  It's not funny.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	"Do men who so strongly oppose feminism lack self confidence to feel masculine around a strong woman?"<br>  <br>  Oh, no. Not that "strong woman" syndrome again!|`|DEc1C9hkaa	No, they don't and it's not an accurate assumption that women who aren't feminists are weak.|`|OOVwqPd5aa	Stop your yapping. Dont be mad cause you cant get a good man. Men don't oppose feminism they oppose bitchism.|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	no<br>  <br>  feminists make that up|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Nope, but that's the most common shaming tactic.<br>  <br>  An attempt to belittle anyone, especially men, who would oppose the agenda.<br>  <br>  Fairly common fallacious tactic used in politics.  When your statement or motives are challenged.  Attack the challenger personally rather than defending your position or attacking their argument.  It's quite childish.  The really sad part is that there are many people who actually fall for it.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	I don't think they do. I think it is because of the radical man-haters out there. Feminism isn't really all that bad but I won't consider myself one.|`|xCd7m5dkaa	A feminist wife once said this to her husband<br>  " I am a strong, independent woman..... now help me open up this pickle jar".<br>  <br>  Men who strongly oppose feminism oppose their practices of anti-male propaganda and giving extra rights and privileges to women.<br>  <br>  Your question is based on a shaming tactic that many feminists use to make the opposition look bad.|`|cCKASg4Waa	Nope, I simply lack a reason why I should embrace misandry, along with special treatment & rights for another gender.<br>  <br>  Also, women who constantly have to announce they're "strong" and "independent" are simply annoying & unappealing -- not a "threat" to anyone's masculinity.|`|lF65kGdyaa	Does simply not having a penis, really make some women bitter and resentful?<br>  <br>  I suppose anything is possible, but not necessarily true.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Doubtful.

Staying on the low blood sugar key, it could also be diabetes.<br>  <br>  I don't think you need more rest and I don't think it's just all in your head.

Even the most minute things can change our entire attitudes for the worst. I would evaluate the situation you're in and see in something has changed. You might also want to schedule a doctors appointment and explain to the doctor what you symptoms are. You never know, you might just be sick.|`|iyRczu0eaa	it's probably just a phase. I go through stuff like that too....just see if its still going on in another week. If so just push yourself to do something that takes a lot of energy and try to get into it with all your heart. Maybe that'll snap you out of it.
AA12360662	Getting lost with friends in dream may reflect some support you are looking for.    <br>  <br>  Projecting your crush comes in cool glasses and his cool car may symbolize some desire in you. This desire about having him doing the unthinkable, driving you home may suggest that you need his support and to a football game is an agreement to his action.<br>  <br>  In other words, you are looking for support, agreement on something you feel it can be compromised.  That may point to things you want to do in reality.
ToILKl6waa	If you want peace of mind, strive for it. That dark cloud that seems to follow you everywhere can be broken up with a little effort on your part. It's called negative thinking. Whether you let the negative thinking get to you is entirely your decision. The mind tends to exaggerate at times. Ration is nonexistant within your mind in some situations. Accept this and stay in touch with reality and out of your worrysome thoughts. Just like everything else in this lifetime, happiness is a choice. Letting go of grief or holding onto it lies in your hands. Find things you are grateful for and eliminate desire - it usually just causes disapointment. Do you like writing or drawing? Be expressive in your feelings upon either of these things. Encompass some sort of exersize into your schedule. Also it helps to talk with someone you trust about the anxiety. Getting it out and in the open can help you to feel a bit better. Never lose hope in yourself - things always change.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|J3uQqHDtaa	I'm going through kinda the same thing. I've been pretty depressed for a while now and I've been talking and hanging out with my ex a lot.. My mom would kill me but she doesn't know. Anyway, the antidepressants might help but there are easier things. Things as simple as writing in a journal everyday help me a lot. Also I do yoga a few times a week and it calms me down and takes my mind off everything going on. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)
3nogJVdIaa	I hated Microeconomics and didn't really learn much. However, I remember that in a perfectly competitive industry firms are price takers and profit is maximized where marginal revenue (price) equals marginal cost. Answer is E.
05taFUWNaa	correct answer is b.<br>  <br>  in perfect competition, there are so many producers and each producer's position is like a drop in the ocean. it means that a single firm sells a very  small fraction of entire industry's output that it is not in a position to influence the price prevailing in the market.|`|d27c34d7ed33f6a638ffbe5e96eb6346aa	The answer is b. In a market with multiple sellers, the impact of an increase in output has a diminishing effect, due to a smaller market share.
BpyZUhK6aa	All i can say is that you love him or who ever alot, Lol, My advise is go up to him and talk to him and ask to hangout sometime and get to know him really well. Once that happens see  if he likes you.|`|p3szz8g2aa	it can mean soemthing between the lines like, "WATCH OUT, YOUR A** IS GONNA BE TASERED!" or something like that. Just a thought though.
DqmMW2tcaa	I totally agree with you. I wish there were more people who cared about the enviornment, but sadly there isn't. Unfortunately there's alot of selfish and uncaring people out there who can't see past their own lifetime and their own consumer driven lives with the plasma tv and large car.<br>  <br>  What I find really sad is that even if people don't want to be environemntal activists and chain themselves to a tree which is quite understandable, they label people who do care about the environment as 'greenies' as if it is something bad. What is the harm about someone trying to conserve nature? It is something that benefits everyone and the future generations to come.|`|XB8ErFGdaa	i know, i hate how people are just like doing crap to our stuff. ughh, so annoying. and then its like if sometimes we also polute the earth....<br>  idk why.. its just so ugh!!!
AA11966821	The main factor is 7 billion people!  Arable acreage is declining.  We are short of water, fertilizer is in such high demand that those prices are rising, seed is becoming more expensive, etc.  It is strictly a matter of demand.  By adding a billion more people per decade, there is no way that supply can be increased fast enough to keep up.  <br>  <br>  Overpopulation is the most politically incorrect, therefore unadmitted but absolutely factual, problem on earth today.  As long as people try to ignore the problem, the worse it gets.  Either parents limit procreation to what they can produce and provide for, or watch people starve.  There is not enough to go around, so it is totally irresponsible to produce mouths for which you cannot provide the food.<br>  <br>  Don't blame biofuels.  That accounts for less than 2% of all plant growth on the planet, and almost all of it comes from non-food sources (e.g. Brazil uses the sugar cane stuff after getting the sugar).  Only the US uses corn -- and that's the result of idiot politicians, and a long story.|`|AA10023809	b/c food prices always go up during winter. <br>  b/c you cannot grow food in the north hemisphere, and there is not enough land for it in the southern hemisphere. And western countries impose high tariffs on food trade to protect domestic farmers.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Because of bio-diesel.

It's a racket, I know!
pYimIJAWaa	I've often wondered that myself. Often, I take a break from this page as it can be filled with so much bitterness. <br>  <br>  In browsing and responding to posting on other Yahoo Q&A pages, I've discovered that people on the other pages don't tend to get so mean to each other. Even on the Religion and Spirituality page, which also has some very controversial topics + God/dess involvement, people don't seem to get as outright mean as they do on this page (admittedly, there is some name calling and self-censored Swe@#@aring, but generally, the ideas are rebutted, rather than the person doing the posting being attacked, along with his/her entire gender).<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I suspect *some* of the people here are not really looking for open discussion, but to work through some emotional issues and/or dump there problems on 'the men in the world' or 'the women in the world'. A few times, I've suggested to people that it's unhealthy to carry such negativity and suggested, gently that they might want to consider getting counselling to help resolve their underlying issues. I always take a very respectful stance, even when the person's ideology disagrees with mine. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it seems that even wishing someone well on this site is objectionable to people. I actually was reported the last time for responding to someone by reaching out to him/her and suggesting they consider working on their issues and wishing them well in life. It's just so sad that people (and I think it's at least two who have to report eh?) are so wrapped up in their bitterness that they censor even well wishes from a fellow poster. So sad.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	While you're right that it comes from both sexes, the majority of posts here are bashing women and or feminists so some rebuttals are to be expected. I think people just have these preconceived notions of what a feminist is and want to say things they'd never have the guts to say in real life.|`|FUIBscKGaa	I haven't looked over all of the posts.  If there is male bashing in a general way, as in "all men this or that", and not specifically directed towards one guy, or a specific opinion held by some men, that will be a first since I've been here.  The other way around can be reflected in hundreds of posts, day after day.  <br>  <br>  It's also common knowledge between myself and a lot of the women on here that there are men who have accounts, disguising themselves as women.  They do this in order to a) try to get us to fight with each other, and b) try to "prove" that feminism equals man bashing.  It' some pretty sick stuff around here.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	Yesterday I was watching a question and answer exchange between feminists here on GWS and they were talking about whether the male regulars were 'as organised' as the female radical feminists are.<br>  <br>  I was befuddled.<br>  <br>  And then I held back and read some more.<br>  <br>  By asking if the men here on GWS were 'organised' what the women meant was if the men 'club together' and destroy a person's account by ganging up and mass reporting him.<br>  <br>  What was funny is that a radical feminist said: "Yes the men are organised"<br>  <br>  I have never heard that term before. It shows that the term 'organised' is a term used by feminists on this board to show that they communicate with each other in order to wreck other people's accounts.<br>  <br>  It's odd.<br>  <br>  Why would a group want to do away with people who disagree with them? It's much smarter to change the other side's perception than just destroy them.<br>  <br>  I think I may have proven a point that the feminists on this board are weak and they do - in fact - want to destroy any possibility of a discourse with men<br>  <br>  'Organised'<br>  <br>  What a childish and cowardly concept.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	Honestly?  I'm not quite sure.<br>  <br>  And people still continue with their vitriol in answer to this question...such hostility!
pWlVHm6kaa	Most of what you've written is about everything that stops you. They're excuses. I can't do this, I can't do that. I can't talk to my counselor. I don't want to take four medicines. I can't drive. I can't keep a job. I can't transfer to a university. Then you say, "I'm stuck." D'oh. Sure you're stuck. You're only looking at why you can't do things instead of looking at what you can do. No one is stopping you but yourself. <br>  <br>  You list anxiety as a major issue that holds you back and yet you're not taking the Zoloft and Risperdal because you feel like four medicines is too much. Hint - it's not. Take your medicine.<br>  <br>  Then you talk about psychiatrists and hospitalization and you're not taking your medicine which may very well put you back into the hospital with the psychiatrists. You're making things happen yourself.<br>  <br>  Sure, you have baggage. Everyone does. Learn to deal with what you have realistically. Stop throwing garbage in your own path - enough people will do that for you. Stop thinking that other people have it better. They don't. We just carry our own baggage better. Stop stopping yourself from living your life. You're entitled to it.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	I feel for you but if you analyze your thinking a lot of it has not happened yet. You just think and assume it will. What would be more constructive is if you work with what you have and try to make the best of the situation. Yes you need to see a counselor because of your issues. Be totally honest with them about how you feel and ask them for coping strategies to help you.<br>  <br>  You don't have to sink to the level of drug dealers and thugs in your town. Volunteer at the library, hospital, animal shelter. There are surely opportunities for you to get out of yourself and help others who are less fortunate than you. Yes, there ARE people worse off than you. Get involved with the wrong people and you will see your mother do more than cry.|`|UIEC5lOzaa	Hmm...

If you enjoy having multiple partners, that's fine, so long as you can find people who are willing to be multiple with you.  It would only become a problem if you wanted a stable relationship with someone.  Nobody would think there was anything strange about this if you were a man, but the sexual double standard, I am afraid, seems to be alive and well these days.  There's a lot of prudishness about.<br>  <br>  However, if you want to stop wanting to have sex with people, I suggest trying to get your mind onto something else.  Take up sports or something that uses up a lot of energy.  Go for long walks or bike rides.  Or take up yoga or something, I understand that has a calming effect on people.  Or Tai chi.|`|tyuxbdrnaa	lol...many men are craving someone just like you...at least for the night.<br>  the problem is.... you're having what's known as "empty sex".<br>  Its like "empty calories"...<br>  the more you eat, the more you want, and you never did get that fulfilling satisfaction you were after.<br>  Ive known many girls in this same situation.<br>  Typically...their cravings normalized once they got into a satisfying relationship. <br>  Meanwhile be safe, and care enough about yourself to not sleep with everyone you lay eyes on.<br>  As for WHY you're like this...<br>  persoanlly, Im guessing you're trying to fill a void.<br>  Get busy...work, school, hobbies etc, take good care of you, perhaps get involved in a healthy relationship (be sure to get tested for STD's first).<br>  feel good about yourself and see how your lifestyle changes.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	You call yourself a freak and that is fine I guess.

7efc52fca43eedf86cf9eb0ca9e070a4aa	Co-morbidity is prevalent in many mental disorders. the difficult thing is to find out which people that claim to have multiple disorders actually have them and what percent actually have some sort of dissociative disorder such as somatoform disorder or somatization disorder. i would say 40%. just a guess, too many variables.
ToILKl6waa	Leading conversations with someone older than you is a start. It's difficult for some adults to see eye to eye with a teen or child, but if you have the words and maturity in you - go for it. Also, with chores comes responsibility.

Spend your time helping others, touching up on your studies, and being open to new things and you'll be more grown up than a lot of adults out there. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.

If you mean a girl that enjoyed having sex when she was single then of course you can. When she meets the dirty guy that can match her then they will have fun sex for the rest of their lives.

Atomic number 39; atomic weight 88.906; melting point 1,522°C; boiling point 3,338°C; specific gravity 4.45 (25°C); valence 3. <br>  <br>  In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius found a new mineral near Ytterby in Sweden and named it ytterbite, after the village. Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789,[2] and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide yttria. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich W?hler.[3]|`|tcZuXkVzaa	yttruim.<br>  <br>  are you sure that's even a word? Maybe you mispelled.

Sometimes, crying does help.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Trust me you will eventually. It's kinda like how you have to take a deep breath before you scream.

GR5ZUZQkaa	Completely agree.<br>  <br>  From the article:<br>  <br>  '"They really do not even veil their goal, which is to make a woman feel badly..."'<br>  <br>  Now that just doesn't make sense to me. Similar to what you said, if an ultrasound is going to make a woman feel bad about an abortion than doesn't that indicate she's not making the right choice?<br>  <br>  Abortion is a big deal, I think all the facts should be on the table. It feels like some people just want to make it into something you sweep under the carpet. I cant' agree with that.|`|1r5d87Oraa	Don't you think that you are doing quite the opposite by mandating some sort of backasswards way of some how liberating women and making sure that all women have their rights? But I'm just questioning your questions. <br>  What is wrong with mandating ultrasounds? Maybe the fact that said women just wants to get the zygote out of her uterus as quickly as possible and doesn't want to deal with the emotions that will up rise once she sees the zygote because something very bad happened to her.|`|FUIBscKGaa	It is too an evil conservative conspiracy, considering it was created and backed by evil conservatives.<br>  <br>  It's an attempt to make women feel guilty over claiming to own their own uterus.  It's no different than the weirdos throwing fits outside of womens' clinics, and it is blatant interference.  What business does a politician, joe blow, or whoever, have sticking their nose into a private medical procedure?  Why does anybody get to decide that?  Who do people think they are by even having an opinion about somebody else's private, internal organs?<br>  <br>  And if it is not an attempt to induce guilt, I'd love for somebody to tell me the "real" reason, since I'm missing it.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Well it's an odd question because I think the last thing a woman in that position wants to do is contemplate that.<br>  <br>  When the *judicial authorities* are preparing a man or woman for execution in the USA they make sure he or she is fit and well and compis mentis:  They take the pulse and make sure they are healthy enough and sane enough before they kill them.<br>  <br>  Makes no difference.<br>  <br>  If the condemned isn't well enough they cart him/her away and make her better enough and then go through the whole process again until the person is well enough to actually know what is going on: and then they kill them.|`|9fsBstvDaa	It increases the expense and for some that might be the whole reason for the abortion. It also forces one to undergo an unnecessary medical procedure and expense.Abortion is a legal medical procedure. There are many reasons a person decides this course of action. She already knows what she is doing. This is not an easy choice. And whether or not we agree it is not wise to judge others for their choices. If abortion was a procedure that is not needed by man then I do not think God would give us the ability to do so. Everything in life comes down to intentions.|`|vvgmyX04aa	Like others have said, mandating ultrasounds would be pointless and suggesting them is just another cruel and petty way to harass women who are already in a difficult and stressful time. <br>  <br>  <br>  An early stage abortion (the vast majority) looks no worse then what women normally may see every month on heavy days.|`|d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	That would be costly.  In the first six weeks of pregnancy there is little to see if anything at all.  That is why the first ultrasound is usually done later in the pregnancy.  This is more for those people who oppose abortion so maybe they could pick up the tab and adopt a few unwanted children while they are doing their Christian duty of judging others.|`|9b6acf55d27a39548c86f16f9efbd431aa	I would think that a conservative would be against mandatory anything.

She can always deny it. No harm in having the option really.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	I can't think of any moral or legal reason to oppose an ultrasound before an abortion.|`|QTclwMgXaa	It's easier to kill someone that has been dehumanized.|`|m89kGXBnaa	I think it's more unnecessary...<br>  <br>  Women must go through a processes where they are both told about abortion and the alternatives before they have one and everyone is legally assumed to have the capacity to make a decision until proven otherwise. If the woman is non verbal... then it's rather unlikely she'd be having an abortion anyway, but in that case you may have a reason to make this mandatory before the proceedure. Otherwise, you are beginning to step on certain acts put in place to ensure dignity and autonomy... basically, you are pressuring someone to change a decision they have already made in fully informed conditions (and complience studies suggest a proportion will feel pressured to change whilst not actually wanting to change their mind).<br>  <br>   This seems over the top - it's not informative, it's emotional. If a woman has, as she should have been, been told about the process of abortion and the development of the embryo, why is it necessary to also show her *except* as a form of emotional blackmail.<br>  <br>  If it is, truely, only about fully informed consent, then why arn't they showing films or pictures of brain surgery to patients undergoing brain surgery (because that's also often optional and they need informed consent). Why doesn't all surgery come with images that must be shown or described? Especially if it's the decision is being made for someone by an advocate, say (which is surely a similar situation?). After all, all surgery has risks - dire consequences. That is why I find it suspicious, the singling out of one proceedure.<br>  <br>  As it happens, a lot of women want to see the ultrasound. A woman I met who had had an abortion insisted on seeing one, so she could be sure. If I was in that position, I think I would, before making a decision. But I'm not sure it should be mandatory|`|oTwymgpIaa	Untamed Rose is right, but I do feel people should be more informed about the choices they make. They aren't being told that shortly after they leave the office or 5 years down the road they might actually become struck with a sense of conscience over what they have done and have to live with that for the rest of their lives, instead they are encouraged and told it is nothing more than a mass of tissue, but to a lot of people it is much more than that. Usually when someone loses a child they never recover entirely and enter into grief counseling for years, why people think abortion is any different is beyond me. I often cry and feel enraged when I think about how many children are lost to abortions. ;-)|`|XwqePXrOaa	Same thing that's wrong with mandatory ultrasounds before administering flu shots.<br>  <br>  It's expensive, completely unnecessary, and obviously motivated purely by a desire to make the procedure less convenient.<br>  <br>  The dollars that go into those unnecessary ultrasounds will be dollars NOT going into some medical procedure that may be useful for something.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Because someone is going to have to pay money for it.  Why should the woman have to waste money on an ultrasound if she doesn't want one?  Or, why should us taxpayers have to waste money on an ultrasound for a woman who doesn't want one and is just going to abort anyway?  Seems like a complete waste of money to everyone involved (or not involved in the tax payers' case).<br>  <br>  Not to mention most abortions are done so early that you won't be able to see anything.  In those instances forcing her to have an ultrasound would just be a moronic waste of money (as opposed to a regular waste of money).|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	I have a fundamental opposition to mandating ultrasounds for ANY reason.<br>  I had 3 pregnancies, 3 healthy live births and refused ultrasounds on all of them. <br>  <br>  Have you had an ultrasound?  Do you know how uncomfortable it is to hold a quart of water in your bladder while someone presses on it?   Such a procedure is not to be mandated....that would violate a person's right to bodily integrity.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	yea, elf is right, who the hell are you to demand an ultrasound and violate a persons right to bodily integrity right before violating a fetus' right to life?  Hang your head in shame.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	They already know. It's not that hard to find out what a fetus in utero looks like. They should have as much choice to see or not to see the ultrasound as they have to get the abortion.|`|V1MptCMiaa	It's not the doctor's job to change people's mind.  She's made her decision and it would just be a waste of money on the patient's part. There's nothing wrong with it, there's just no point.|`|un0C52G8aa	Most abortions take place during the first trimester so there wouldn't really be anything to see. Also,  unless the women have had training and experience with looking at ultrasounds, chances are they would not know what they are looking at. The images really aren't that good and they require a trained eye to understand what is going on.<br>  <br>  Another concern I have is that doing ultrasounds require a great deal of training and the clinics would likely use poorly trained technicians to perform them. That's because they either can't afford to hire competent technicians or those people wouldn't want to work in such a place anyway.|`|G50ucmllaa	So wait...you think it is okay for her to have an abortion (choice) but you want to mandate and untrisound (force)?  Why?  What is the purpose?  So she won't do it.  There is no other.<br>  <br>  People think it is a conservative conspiracy because it is.  Conservatives support it, and the reason the support it has alternative motives other than medical reasoning.  The purpose of it is not to let them know what a fetus looks like...they know what a fetus looks like or can easily find out without seeing their own.  The purpose of it is to change their mind....YOU KNOW THAT.  Which is illegal in many states.|`|lF65kGdyaa	It's really not necessary. <br>  From my experience, it's inevitable that their conscious catches up with them anyway.<br>   It's really quite unfortunate and probably very much the hardship on one's conscious.<br>  Feel bad  for  few moments beforehand, or a lifetime afterwords, but at some point, everyone feels it.<br>  Thank G-D the "choice" is in their hands.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Pro-abortion advocates know a person would be far less likely to have an abortion then, and that may very well increase opposition to abortion.

There was an increase in laborers due to illegal immigration.<br>  <br>  In what direction would the shift in labor supply and demand go? Labor supply would increase because there are now more laborers. Because there are more laborers wages would decrease and therefore demand for labor also increases.<br>  <br>  What would be its effect on the equilibrium of the labor market? In the short term it would throw off equilibrium by increasing labor supply over current labor demand, but the market equilibium would eventually return to normal, however, it would move to where wages are less and supply is higher.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...<br>  -Rhetoric
LRbm4Ef6aa	many people have different opinions on dreams.   some say they reflect the opposite of the future to come.  others say they tell the fate of a person in a cryptic way.    in either case I suggest you pick up a dream book and look at the meaning of every aspect of your dream. from the wheelchair to the dead people, look it up. it all means something. don't be afraid  to move about ur house. you said you had never been in the house u saw in your dream before. therefore, it is not your house you should/ if any fear.     Has anyone in the family died recently? have you or a family memeber looked at houses or considered moving? any wheelchair bound people in your life? Are you between jobs?    This is how I see it:    the help you offered the old man brought the dead. He may have disappeared to show how short life is and how quick it can be gone. same goes for the child u saw. The people said they were there because they care. Repaying you for your help to the old man perhaps? if you are a doctor this makes sense. even if not it is easy to see. I think good luck is on the way. you have people watching over you. who care. they are there to help. let in all good and examine and anylize the bad. a blessing in disguise is all i see this dream as.    hope it helped!|`|vDy5WxFbaa	you have things on your mind. i have dreams where i go into a panic and walk around the house thinking my life is over. just offload woever u r thinking about, and the dreams will stop.|`|AA11091233	To me this dream speaks of the possibility that you don't feel heard. That people don't understand you....and you are afraid of losing control. In most cases, dreams are just extensions of ourselves, so the dead people could be aspects of yourself that you feel are 'dead'...and it was just a very upsetting dream. You may have a lot of turmoil going on deep inside....so please don't take it literally. And people that really are crazy...don't know they are crazy..so don't worry that you are going schitzo. It's almost a feeling like maybe you feel ganged up on...or you feel disconnected to the people in your life.    But mostly...nightmares are just nightmares...they can be set off for a variety ot reasons. I know it's very scary and it probably feels very real right now...but it will pass in a few hours or days.

ToILKl6waa	Stop making yourself suffer. It was one presentation and you were caught completely off guard during class. Learn to forgive yourself and let go of the grief - it will do nothing for you. Everyone sitting in their seats was only thinking of their own presentation and didn't have the room within their minds to so much as judge you. The next time you present, just know to be 100% confident in yourself and let nothing hold you back. Do not let nervousness affect you - everyone gets nervous. Accept it and do what you have to do. Relax and realize there are always opportunities in the future. You are brave enough to actually get up there and do the presentation - I know many who didn't have the guts and merely let their grade plummet.

Good luck with your grade, and DON'T worry about it, because the first person to go is usually the one that gets more sympathy.|`|RTDNqLzGaa	think of how you can solve the problem, maybe ask your teacher for a redo and explain what happened, if not just try as best you can in the future, hope this helps|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	uughh i HATE presentations. i always freak out too.<br>  its ok though... just don't think about it... theres really nothing else u can do. there's no reason to dwell on it now.<br>  <br>  sorry, hope u feel better :)|`|85Co7zE8aa	go talk to your teach, maybe she'll let you redo it?
mCbhjcLuaa	Your on the right track.<br>  It is nice to hear a young person resist peer pressure.|`|o0U2K84oaa	Recently, I was arrested for drug related problems. I am 15 and was expelled from school and am currently waiting for my court date. So far, I don't know the reason why kids do drugs. I didn't give up into peer pressure, I just wanted to escape from the real world. But I guess all teens want to be is popular and apparently, media has influenced them to think whoever does the worst stuff is considered the coolest. I know they seem popular right now and people tell you that they're going to be bums when they grow up. But adults don't realize we have 4 years of high school and that's a long time to go through it. Just because people tell you to not do drugs, it's not going to stop anyone and teens know that better than anyone. But really, I want you to be strong and stay away from drugs. And if that's too hard, I think you should drink alcohol rather than do drugs. I regret it so much now but yet I can never escape my past and relive them each and every day.|`|rULYGvz9aa	It's because it helps you relax, be your true self, and not care what other people think. at least that's what it does for me and no, I'm not telling you to go get high :P|`|IOMiV6e3aa	It may seem like that but their friendships are very temporary. You have heard that birds of a feather flock together? Well it is something like that. They depend on each other to supply each other - get each other high, etc. They have something in common - their illegal activities. They often think they are only understood by others who "do drugs". However, the reality is their superficial friendships will end quickly because of drug busts, forced and/or voluntary rehabilitations, jail, probation, alcoholism, car accidents, dropping out, failing school....just watch from a distance and watch their lives one by one fall apart...notice how they are like dominoes. Also, recognize that if you can't remember having fun, then you can pretend anything you want, it doesn't make it reality.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	I never thought I'd say this but...they're right.<br>  <br>  I used to be pretty straight edge like you describe yourself. Never drank, never touched drugs. And this went on for a year while I was in a college with a party reputation.<br>  <br>  I didn't have many friends and had nothing to do on the weekends. I just stayed in my dorm and watched TV while everyone else was out partying. I was miserable. <br>  <br>  One thing lead to another and one weekend I ended up getting drunk. It was the most fun I had years, I'll never forget it. After that night it felt like I had suddenly received a VIP pass to the hottest club in town. I started meeting lots of cool people and I really started to enjoy my college experience.<br>  <br>  I'd hate to stand here and condone drinking/drugs, but yes, you will have a good time and most likely make a lot of friends.<br>  <br>  If you can be happy without those things, more power to you, but I'd hate to see you stuck in boredom and loneliness just because you don't mesh in with everyone else.<br>  <br>  And if you are going to experiment, know your limits and BE RESPONSIBLE. Can't stress that enough.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy hunting =)|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	Sometimes the right path is the loneliest path.  <br>  <br>  However, I drink and smoke pot, but have no problems hanging out with friends that don't do that.  You just need to find the right people.  <br>  <br>  I like pot because it's relaxing and it's a time where my mind doesn't think about all the things I really don't want to think about.  It's not a good reason to do it, just a reason.  <br>  <br>  But drugs won't bring you happiness if that's what your asking.  And it might get you some friends, but I don't think that's the kind of friends you want.|`|85Co7zE8aa	i've never tried it but some people i am close to have. and i can tell you this much: no. <br>  it's not really fulfilling after a while, but what the people i know say is that it depends on the mood you start in, like with drinking. if you start happy getting high just makes you dumb, not happier. if you start out depressed sometimes it helps you forget the pain|`|e48yQ1dKaa	Getting high, with marijuana, is safe and fun. Drinking on the other hand can be toxic and change your behavior for the worst, but in small amounts can be relaxing and a as you have witnessed, a strong social tool.
sXVkRGJIaa	Where am I ? Who are you? Are those my feet ??|`|8pQrIL90aa	good for you. I wasted alot of my life being weak to peer pressure. find new friends with new interest. Church members, various clubs and organizations as well. Find those who enjoy life and dont have to bend reality by smoking drugs just to have some fun.<br>  <br>  good for you!|`|56KYR6WAaa	Hun there are lots of people out there that don't get high. I suggest finding some friends who party for just fun. Getting buzzed up there is so much more to life then that .Im not a hypocrite i did my thing to but .Stick to your morals .The stuff they put in that crap is not worth it.Good luck|`|m89kGXBnaa	Is there a reason you can't go along and just not get high? I know a lot of people who did that happily. They actually found it amusing and got no end of blackmail stories out of it.<br>  <br>  If there is a reason, try making plans for a future weekend with your friends which do not include getting high (as it is unlikely someone will come along an organise things for your benefit - be proactive!). Try several suggestions - movie nights, cinema, meal out, etc. If they refuse, you may need to find new friends, and if this is the case, you don't seem to have a lot in common with your current ones.|`|gMYoi210aa	good for you! :) dont do drugs, well maybe you can always go walk around the city and stuff like that, or you can just do what U enjoy doing|`|BGeULTx0aa	i dont see why u cant go hang out with them and not get high, u dnt have to do what they do to be there|`|GO46i2l9aa	First of all I am so glad you are above such a dumb hobby. So this weekend I think you should do something that makes you happy. If thats getting out of the house you should go out and picnic. I cannot tell you how great it is to be able to do something on your own. I love doing things by myself because you are the only person you can really rely on. And if you are losing friends because you aren't doing drugs like them, they aren't really your friends anyways.|`|gE11CX0Saa	Invite yourself to partys =D! and if not then stick around at home, watch some DVDs jam on the internet and curl up on a sofa =]<br>  <br>  Have confidence in yourself and show it!<br>  <br>  I know I avoided that and I ended up sooooo depressed =\<br>  <br>  and don't follow them. I followed the crowd and I'm not proud of it, it took me down a baaaaad road  ._.<br>  <br>  maybe you should think about who yiour true friends are, and if they are true friends then you don't have to let them dictate what you do|`|Nig6z3Cnaa	volunteer at a hospital|`|wxJSueofaa	awwww :) good 4 u! <br>  I used to hang around with these girls for 3 years. At first, they were just normal and kind but over time, their bad habits grew progressively worse and worse. They started doing weed and all they ever talked about was pulling and how many bl0w jobs they'd given. It was horrible. So i just changed friends :) It wasn't easy and it took a long time but i did it and now i'm a lot happier. <br>  So.. that's what you need to do. Find new buds that don't get high :)    but  if all of your friends are getting high and doing stupid things it doesn't mean you have to do it. It takes a strong person to stand in a crowd of people who are all doing the one thing and you're the only person doing the right thing. But you can do it! :P <br>  And if you're not feeling like going out one day - don't ! it doesn't mean you'll lose your friends. And trust me, even though it might not seem like it, your friends will envy you doing the right thing even though they're doing wrong. <br>  Good luck xxxxxxx

Really relax and go into a void. Forget about all the problems you mentioned because they don't really exist, they only exist because you make them into problems with your mind. They are just facts and events, they are not problems. Forget about them all.<br>  <br>  Everything you have described is just life drama, meaningless circles of drama which go on and on and on and on. <br>  <br>  You on the other hand are always there, constant. The world revolves around you and the key is to just let it. Go with the flow of life instead of trying to swim against it all of the time. <br>  <br>  You can still take action of course but it will come from a place of peace, there will be no reaction to it and if it does not change things you will just accept it. <br>  <br>  Life is constantly changing. You must believe that your life can and will change. It will change for the better and it will change for the worse in cycles but one thing you can be sure of it WILL change. <br>  <br>  You are young and you will learn but remember 4 simple words which should guide you through any bad times:<br>  <br>  THIS TOO WILL PASS.|`|G4wEL4qoaa	1)  So what?  Half of the world is boys, there are bound to be thousands that would say yes.<br>  <br>  2)  Stop caring about what he does, and care about what you do.<br>  <br>  3.)  I had that too don't worry about it too much.  You can find another group of friends (hard) or try and become leader again.<br>  <br>  4.)  Nothing special lol everyones parents are.<br>  <br>  5.)  Im not sure what your saying here, but so what if he is friends with a girl you don't like.   You can't expect to like everyone he likes.<br>  <br>  6.)  Set a goal and then you will.<br>  <br>  7.)  There are things you can do - tan, whiten teeth, work out, make over, make up, new clothes, etc.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Stay optimistic.  Don't take life too seriously no one gets out alive anyway lol.|`|f391180a88508c59f24d2d8cb19fc7c7aa	1) Forget about him, if he said "no, we're better off friends" then be friends. It wasn't meant to be that way.<br>  <br>  2) Your crush will end in time. Let it run it's course and don't let it get to your head. (easier said than done, but it's possible)<br>  <br>  3) She's new, and so she's gotten more acceptance, kind of like a child with a new toy. They'll pick it up, play with it more than the other toys, but will eventually get bored with it and play with it as often as the other toys.<br>  <br>  4) Grow up, and do what they say, trust me, it'll get you out of the house early because it shows that you are mature. <br>  <br>  5) Ignore her.<br>  <br>  6) Find something to look forward to. You can only chose to look forward to something if you look for it.<br>  <br>  7) Get a better self image.<br>  <br>  8) That is a bunch of bullshit. There are a lot of people with worse lives, and you're just going through teenage drama bombs. At least you're not getting beat or abused verbally or sexually or starved to death or locked in your closet until you die. Like I said, there are more people whose lives are worse than others, and believe me, you're one of the many that's most likely more blessed than the other person down the road.|`|5pxZfnjMaa	First of all, are you hot?

kfWi9ZkEaa	Yes, fake it till you make it.  But meanwhile, understand something which you currently do not understand....<br>  <br>  When people walk away from an event, they kick themselves.  All of tehm, every one.  OMG, why did I say THAT? OMG, what did I do that for?  OMG, did I really dance on the table? etc.<br>  <br>  So don't bother doing it to yourself.  Nobody remembers what you did, they're all cringeing about what they did except for the completely emotionally insensate who you can discount because they're not even real people.  <br>  <br>  Also:  there's nothing you could do or say that hasn't been done or said before.  You'll survive.  I am criminally shy but I get out there and 'hi how are you' with the best of them and friends come in time.  Always have a smile.  NEVER assume you're the only one feeling terrible.  Why not assume that the other guy is shy?  Who's to say he isn't?  You have no idea.<br>  <br>  Look around you for the quiet people.  Practice at looking people in the eye even if only for quick glimpses but remember: everyone your age is all doing the quick glance thing too.  The kids your age who are socially fluent are usually glib and insufferable and they'll be serving you at the drive-thru in a few years: I wouldn't worry about them.  Prom Kings & Queens have a habit of ending up pumping gas.<br>  <br>  Small talk ideas: hi, how are you, did you have a good weekend?  did you see the....  learn at least one joke from some joke book once a week: then you have a joke (they then should produce their joke so you get more jokes.  Hmm It's a shy age.  <br>  <br>  Also: you're shy when you feel out of place, or like you can't compete with them.  Do they have more money etc than you?  If so, learn to see this as irrelevant.  Look around for the kids with less money who are having a good time: they're everywhere.  <br>  <br>  Interestingly: talk to your parents if you can.  They need to jack up some social events or do a bit of networking on your behalf if they can.  Otherwise, you have to network on your own behalf.  What hobbies/interests do you have? Go take a course.  When you hang out with people who are intersted in teh same stuff as you, you inevitably end up yabbering on about it.  You then can say "I'm going down the mall on Friday, wanna come?" or something.  <br>  <br>  Sorry if I'm off the mark.  Hope some of it helps.|`|LI4MEd81aa	I used to be very shy too, I hated it. But sometimes you need to build up your courage enough to say hi to people, who knows maybe they are the same way, maybe they just needed the right person to talk to.

VWAq8KDzaa	First of all, the sun won't begin its Red Giant stage for untold millions of years from now.  So there is plenty of time for the human race to react to the problem or meet its divine destiny.<br>  <br>  If you are a religious person, your assumptions regarding heaven and our after-life are in error.  Those who believe in heaven/hell do not believe that heaven is a solid "place" that requires a location in some galaxy.  The same belief applies to our human spirit/soul after we die.  Both heaven and our soul exists in the spirit that God has ordained.  The human race will have been reborn long before our sun begins its Red Giant stage.  Therefore, if you are religious, have no worry for our future generations.  God will have taken care of them.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you accept evolutionary science and are not heavy into religious beliefs, human kind will have continued to evolve for millions of years before the sun begins its growth.  I'm sure that we will be in the "Star Trek" or "Star Wars" type of time period by then.  Human kind (or whatever name we would be called by then) would have left earth and populated other galaxies by then.  What would be happening to our puny sun and solar system probably wouldn't even make YouTube.  Therefore, no need to worry for our future generations because they won't be anywhere near our galaxy when the sun destroys our solar system.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	I think you have some time to contemplate that...<br>  <br>  Right now, I live from day to day, and can not wrap my head around that idea.

erCDPtYgaa	You already got the answer. Just be comfortable with yourself. Be true to yourself.<br>  <br>  Being true to oneself means to face your weakness and strengths. And express yourself. Know what you really need, not want. Don't run from it.<br>  <br>   I am sure, if you tell your friends the truth, they will accept you.

Every night I went to bed, I wished that I wouldn't wake up the next day. But that only lasted two weeks. You actually get to think about your life when you are alone. It practically forces you to actually think about your mistakes, the past and plan out your life. I think people sometimes need to be lonely in order to get life straightened out.

You are partially correct about the idea that we think more at night, but take that one step further. All day, we are bombarded with advertisements---how  white our teeth SHOULD be, how skinny we SHOULD be, how much money we SHOULD be making at our jobs, what shoes we SHOULD where to school. <br>  We are so accustomed to the constant marketing that we are not aware of the television commercials, the billboards, the rude comments from family and friends, until we are alone with our thoughts. At this time, we replay all of the advertisements in our heads, measuring ourselves to these unrealistic models, and become depressed. We think that we should be everything besides what we actually are---unique beings. Yes many people feel alone and upset at night, but no, it is not something that we should accept. <br>  <br>  <br>  ~ Jamal and Jasmine Rose<br>  Great topic for discussion.

W1a47Etoaa	Hi, thanks for your question.     My suggestions are as follows:    1) Avoiding all responsibility is not a good state to be in. Instead you need to be selective about the responsibilities you choose to accept. Think about areas/activities in life which you feel positive about and direct your energies in these directions. It might even be something as simple as a tv show you like or volunteering or whatever appeals to you. This will help improve your mood and create new opportunities.     2) Communicating is something that gets easier with practice and you can dictate the terms. Spend more time with those who help and encourage you and make you feel good. If you don't feel like you have anybody like that at the moment, they will come into your life as you create opportunities for you and them to meet.     3) In our modern 24 hour rush culture it is easy to feel disconnected. Don't think you have to always be working and serving others and don't feel guilty about taking personal time to explore what you really want from life. Look for work/study you enjoy (or the best you can find with a long term view of getting a different better job/course), keep it varied and don't expect to much to soon - you can work (excuse the pun) your way up to bigger challenges.     Most of all though, if you really want to know what I think is wrong with you, it's a lack of self-belief and self-appreciation - You must be special to be to have written such a perceptive question and you deserve happiness. You've shown a strong will to reject paths that haven't inspired you, now turn it towards finding what you want from life. Best of luck.|`|0YpknkNsaa	Get a sketch book and some pencils and paints. It doesn't matter what you draw or paint just do it. You become absorbed in it and your mind takes over. You don't have to communicate with anyone while you're doing it. You don't have to use your brain in the same way that you do when you study. You are doing something and not just vegetating in your own thoughts. You don't have to show anyone so you don't have to put up with any unwanted criticism. You don't have to be good at it. You don't have to do what anyone tells you to do. You don't have to conform or stay within the lines.  You can just be yourself......wonderful, special, unique and your own person x|`|6GmtcZteaa	Honey me too.

Others cannot do it for you. Completely probe your daily activities. Activities means your thinking, your speech and your every action. Compare them whether they are equivalent to the noble works done by eminent or great people. If it is so, you are on right path. During comparison, if you find that your actions, speech and thinking are below average or equivalent to beasts, then try to change your attitude towards better. That is all.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	I think maybe you could be in the wrong job. Try meditation and yoga and all that good stuff to clear your head. Ask yourself, if money was no object and not important, what is it you would like to do with your days. If your answer is lie on the couch, ask another question: when I get bored with lying on the couch, what is it I would like to do. Perhaps you could try volunteering somewhere close to a field of interest. Life isn't pointless, but then again, sometimes it is!  It's up and down. I think maybe you are depressed? I urge you, start meditating! Check out this website http://cherylrichardson.com/ it's a nice look at things. Good luck.  xx|`|jNQbVDHSaa	get some motivation; seek out a counselor or motivational speaker.|`|JX4Hv9Bvaa	I agree with the others that you need to find what motivates you. It sounds like you've already tried to figure that out, so your best bet is to find a life/career coach that can help you work through figuring out what you want.    Your want to be alone could be linked to depression (i don't know i'm not a doctor, I would recommend discussing this with a professional) but it could also be that you just like solo work/activities, and that's ok. There are plenty of careers where lots of communication and large teams aren't required.    First step is to find someone you are comfortable talking to and really open up about your feelings on different activities/jobs etc.     Good luck, I hope you feel inspired soon :)
41b54654c92b228c57d74d269099fd9baa	Lots of writing for a really simple question. <br>  <br>  Yes, she has raped him. She consciously took advantage of a person who did not have the mental capacity to make such a decision. It's best not to do anything.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Nope, he shouldn't have gotten so drunk.  People do stupid things all the time, it's ridiculous to always have to point blame and punish someone for it.  Live and let live.<br>  <br>  Sure, it's a crappy situation, but nobody should be going to prison over it.<br>  <br>  Alcohol has always been a social lubricant.  Only in recent years have we been so obsessed with the blame game.  Is nobody responsible for themselves anymore?<br>  <br>  Same goes for if the genders were switched, as well.<br>  -----------<br>  Now if the drinks were drugged with something you couldn't easily smell, taste, and recognized...  then we'd have a problem.<br>  <br>  Molly B has a good point, as well.  If this person was physically forced to drink the alcohol, yeah it would be rape.  Or a gun held to their head, ect....<br>  <br>  -------------<br>  Now, of course, our messed up legal system would classify this as rape (if the perpetrator were not female).|`|7J6m0L3Haa	That's rape. Getting drunk doesn't give anyone the legal right to void your bodily sovereignty. Consent is something that is given, not assumed. Furthermore, her actions in pressing him to drink more reveal that she had the intent of sexual congress with him even though he had already specified that he was not interested. That's just about as obvious as it gets.<br>  <br>  And this comment thread made me loose hope in humanity. Good grief. Next time someone calls me paranoid I'll point to this thread for lovely evidence of how most people's idea of sex and consent is so messed up that they BLAME THE VICTIM for their own rape.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	In my opinion, it all starts with intent.  If the intent is to have sex regardless of the other persons consent or non-consent, then alcohol becomes merely a tool for achieving one's goal.  <br>  <br>  The challenge is, how do you prove intent?|`|V1MptCMiaa	Technically no, he consented.  But because he was impaired and didn't knowingly consent, yes it was rape.

Any idiot knows that alcohol takes away your inhibitions. (Legally it might be the other way around.) Here's what doesn't make sense to me: If a woman gets drunk and has sex with a man, a crime has been committed against her. If she gets drunk and drives home, she's committed a crime.|`|s6BiwoxPaa	yes, she has raped him.<br>  if a person is no condition to make a decision, then it isn't really consensual - she knew he wouldn't be thinking clearly, so she took advantage and ultimately sexually assaulted him.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	She didn't force him to drink a substance, the disinhibitive (is that a word?) qualities of which are widely known.<br>  <br>  It's a douche move, but hardly criminal.|`|QTclwMgXaa	In our society, if the victim is male it is not considered rape but if the victim is female it IS considered rape.

He had too many drinks and made two bad decisions.|`|uhchod38aa	People should not being having sex with people who are drunk. Drunk people are unable to give consent. And when alcohol is involved, people do stupid things.|`|AA12092060	Hmm, a thoughtful question, even if it's a bit gross.<br>  <br>  In the typical rape scenario it is a male who rapes a female. He uses his superior upper body strength to manipulate his victim until his results are achieved. It's usually based on anger and carried out as a triumph of power.<br>  <br>  However, you asked the question in the gender forum and switched genders for this scenario. Rather than upper body strength the female uses alcohol to manipulate her victim. Although others have already noted the physical and logistical factors that make this scenario unlikely; it's still possible.<br>  <br>  The moral answer is no, there is no significant moral difference in the wrongness of alcohol-assisted rape and non-alcohol-assisted rape. There is no moral difference between a man raping a woman or a woman raping a man--even though the woman may be affected more deeply and for a longer period of time.<br>  <br>  Was that the answer you're looking for? Rape is wrong regardless of gender, but the effects of the crime/sin may be greater for the female than the male.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	First of all, I object to notion of 'getting someone drunk'.  Unless this person is a child or has been physically forced to imbibe I believe they got themselves drunk.<br>  <br>  I suppose this person is then 'persuaded' to have sex in the same way the person was 'persuaded' to get drunk.  Being persuaded puts me under the assumption that he gave consent.<br>  <br>  It's distasteful, but shouldn't be a crime.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Of course, now I must respond to some of the other posters answer.  What is this 'common knowledge' some answerers know about erections and alcohol that I don't.  I guess this knowledge  isn't so common. <br>  Also, how is that only penis/vagina penetration is considered rape.  Has it not crossed anyone elses mind that forced anal penetration with an object should also be considered rape?<br>  <br>  Are we still stuck in the archaic days of 'only a man can rape a woman'?<br>  <br>  We've become overly sensitive and accommodating in some areas while ignoring a whole group of victims.  Talk about selective protection.|`|ea49eff6b5328302dbce4a3790181947aa	I think Rape and Seduction get often confused. I think either sex talking either sex into sex over drinks, is seduction and unfortunate as a best argument.<br>  <br>  Rape- is when you have sex with someone against their complete will. They say: "NO- please get off me" Not: "no", under their breathe- which really means they are fighting with guilt because as you get off they are grabbing your groin.<br>  <br>  Rape is forceful or involves trickery wtih drugs or along those lines, it is outright against someones will. Seducing someone (without force or drugging them into unconsciousness ) is probably every virgins first experience. Including mine- I was scared to have sex with my first girlfriend- but she made it impossible to say no. Is that rape, or life?
zym14EeJaa	I'm 17, and I know that people are always changing, sometimes people that we thought we knew all of our lives turn out to be someone we don't even know anymore. Someone who we don't want to know anymore, as we grow up, we grow apart from our old friends, we begin to move on with our lives and make new friends. Its like when a plant dies, and you plant new seeds. That is what friendship is like, but you should never leave it on a bad note. If you feel that you are beginning to dislike Kate, then instead of hurting her feelings just gradually stop hanging out with her as much, be polite and nice, but you don't have to be her best friend. Move on and you will meet new people, also I find it is good to tell the truth to a certain extent, but I think its often better to spare people's feelings, because most of the time telling somebody something negative about themselves never results particularly well! Good luck with everything. :)|`|ZdF1hx70aa	Girls will be girls. You don't have to hurt her feeling again but just stop hanging out with her. Sometimes If you are around a person for to long they begin to annoy you so just lay off the friendship in a nice way. Don't call her back and when she asks what you where doing say you where busy doing something for your family. And don't make any plans to hang out either.

4676ab82fdec587e35a8084755696854aa	For one thing, currently... electroconvulsive therapy is RARELY, if ever used (only for extremely rare cases of severe depression that responds to NOTHING else). And from the rest of your question, it seems like you are mixing up now with like.. 50 years ago. <br>  <br>  There are lots of caring therapists out there... and cognitive therapies are very popular.. (as opposed to only medication). Maybe medication is overused still, but it is very beneficial for many patients.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Yes very right. everyone needs to feel accepted, and too often that is withheld from them, for manipulative reasons. Or whatever reasons.|`|m89kGXBnaa	So, have you met many of the mentally ill? Because, not to sound confrontational, I'm confused as to why you think it is best for the very, very seriously depressed for them to be left and not given medication or in very severe cases, ECT, so that they feel better. I'm assuming, really, you've met some of the fortunately mentally ill, who are more quirky than insane. (ECT is very rarely used, as is actual placement in hospital. Only when needed, and in the case of ECT, only for very severe depression).<br>  <br>  I've met mentally ill people who are more representative of the average; and heard of many more - a woman who had been deeply paranoid and unhappy who was being rehabilitated into society after a stay in a hospital. I don't think she was happy when she believed her every thought was controlled by a chip in her head, whether people accepted this or not. It made her feel out of control, watched... paranoid. I don't think people want to suffer anxiety for their whole life, or live in a world that their schizophrenia has turned into a unfriendly and confusing place.<br>  <br>  Love is a good thing to have. But it's not an all-powerful curing force anywhere but in the products of Hollywood. And therapists and psychiatrists do, for the majority of them, care deeply. And you're loved ones can still support you when you are on drugs or in hospital (psychiatrists do not, often, prevent this. And if there isn't anyone in the first place, a psychiatrists concern is better than nothing). It's not really an either/or option, and denying treatment... that's downright cruel.

Economic slowdown have meant that less is being used thus it is less in demand so the price is lower.  Also, because finance is in such a bad shape investors are backing away from investing in commodities, resulting in a further fall in price.

But I don't think I'd freak out. Much of this new FED lending is offset by lower asset prices, look, how much money waas 'lost' in the stock market, and housing values?

This system must and will fail, I'm betting the government would something awful, Dictatorship maybe?|`|AA11988604	Raising interest rates tends to slow inflation in normal times.  If we have already hit bottom by the time inflation kicks in, then perhaps raising rates will help temper the inflation.    We got used to monitary policy being enough to manipulate the economy over the last 25 years, and the Keynesian school of economics was thrown over.  Now, with monitary policy impotent, the Keynes scenarios are relevant again.       The big problem with the Keynes methods was that politicians lacked the will and the incentive to reel in the much loved govt programs as soon as the economy rebounded.   The government must swim against the tide in the Keynes model, spending when the economy is in the tank and most prudent individuals hunker down and save.  and then taxing and saving when things are going great and everyone thinks we can afford whatever we need as a nation.   So while the keynesian models may work well in theory, they only work politically when all else has been shown to be futile, such as in the great depression, and now.    I predict the prevailing opinion when we are done with this latest mess will include this observation, and we can perhaps form a longer term understanding of taxes, monitary policy, regulation and infrastructure spending as the four prongs of prudent financial stewardship.|`|dbc721915a9ed0c15df5f8416476bce0aa	What, are you nuts?  Don't drink to Kool-Aid buddy.  Prices have been dropping on everything since this "recession" began.  That's the definition of a recession!  Prices falling and companies loosing money.  The only time I can think there has ever been hyperinflation was in Germany after WWI when, instead of working to pay off their war-debt to the other nations, they just printed a load of money and gave it out.  Prices would double every day there!  I still trust our government enough to NOT print more money that we are losing every day.  Luckily our president has absolutely no control over the Federal Reserve or Treasury.

El Síndrome de Asperger es bien conocido por ser una parte del espectro de desórdenes autísticos cuyas características han sido perfectamente descritas por Wing y Gold. En la nosología clínica se ha comenzado a hablar de un Espectro Asperger [cita requerida]. El término "síndrome de Asperger" fue utilizado por primera vez por Lorna Wing en 1981 en un periódico médico, bautizándolo en honor a Hans Asperger, un psiquiatra y pediatra austríaco cuyo trabajo no fue reconocido internacionalmente hasta la década de 1990. Fue reconocido por primera vez en el Manual Estadístico de Diagnóstico de Trastornos Mentales en su cuarta edición en 1994 (DSM-IV).<br>   Características  [editar]Las personas "normales" (no-Asperger o neurotípicas) poseen un sofisticado sentido de reconocimiento de los estados mentales ajenos. La mayoría de las personas son capaces de juntar información acerca de los estados cognitivos y emocionales de otras personas basados en pistas otorgadas por el ambiente y el lenguaje corporal de la otra persona. Las personas con Síndrome de Asperger no poseen esta habilidad y se puede decir que tienen una especie de "ceguera mental". Para las personas más severamente afectadas puede resultar imposible reconocer el significado de una sonrisa o, en el peor de los casos, fallar llanamente en ver cualquier otro gesto facial, corporal o cualquier otro matiz de comunicación indirecta. Del mismo modo, el control voluntario de la mímica facial puede estar comprometido. Es frecuente que las sonrisas "voluntarias" en las fotografías familiares sean una colección de muecas sin gracia. Por el contrario, las sonrisas espontáneas suelen ser normales. En los pacientes con SA en general son incapaces de "leer entre líneas", es decir, que se les escapan las implicaciones ocultas en lo que una persona dice de forma directa y verbal. Es importante notar, sin embargo, que debido a que es un trastorno con severidad variable algunos pacientes se aproximan a un nivel de normalidad en sus habilidades de comprensión e interpretación no-verbal. Encuentran particularmente abrumador el contacto ocular y por lo tanto con frecuencia lo evitan. La falta de contacto ocular puede llevar a mayores dificultades para interpretar emociones ajenas o en la forma como lo interpretan los demás.<br>  <br>  El síndrome de Asperger involucra un intenso nivel de concentración en temas específicos y esto es generalmente descrito como una cualidad especial. Un paciente puede por ejemplo encontrarse obsesionado por los dinosaurios, otro con los himnos nacionales de los países latinoamericanos, otro con la construcción de modelos de armar, etc. Intereses particularmente comunes entre pacientes son los medios de transporte (por ejemplo los trenes) y las computadoras. En términos generales son atraídos por cosas ordenadas. Cuando estos intereses coinciden con una tarea útil desde el ámbito material o social, el individuo con Asperger puede lograr una vida ampliamente productiva. En la carrera por dominar su interés, los individuos con Asperger a menudo manifiestan un razonamiento extremadamente sofisticado, una concentración obsesiva y una memoria casi perfecta. Hans Asperger llamó a sus peque?os pacientes "peque?os profesores", debido a que pacientes de tan solo trece a?os de edad conocían su área de interés con el profesionalismo de un profesor universitario. Es debido a esto que los individuos con Asperger son considerados superdotados intelectualmente, pero menos dotados en el ámbito social. Esta impresión es, sin embargo, falsa. Estudios epidemiológicos recientes demuestran que los individuos con síndrome de Asperger no se diferencian de los neurotípicos en lo que respecta su cociente intelectual.<br>  <br>  Estas circunstancias conllevan innumerables problemas durante la infancia y la vida adulta. Cuando una maestra pregunta a un ni?o con Asperger que ha olvidado su trabajo escolar "?Tu perro se comió tu tarea?", el ni?o con Asperger permanecerá silencioso tratando de decidir si debe explicar a su maestra que él no tiene perro y que además los perros no comen papel. El ni?o no comprende el sentido figurado de la pregunta o no puede inferir lo que la maestra quiere decir a partir de su tono de voz, postura o expresión facial. Ante tanta perplejidad el ni?o podría responder con una frase totalmente sin relación a lo que se está hablando (como por ejemplo, "?Ud. sabe que mi papá se compró un nuevo computador?". Ante esto, la maestra podría concluir que el ni?o es arrogante, insubordinado o “raro”.<br>  <br>  Del mismo modo, el síndrome de Asperger puede también causar problemas en la interacción social normal con los padres. Las dificultades para interpretar las sutiles pistas de la comunicación pueden llevar al paciente a conflictos frecuentes e inclusive a ser ignorado en sus necesidades básicas. El ni?o o adolescente con Asperger con frecuencia se siente confundido porque no es capaz de comprender en qué se equivoca. El resultado final de estas interacciones frustrantes es mayor aislamiento.|`|28Y5MVvwaa	EL SINDRME DE ASPEGER ES BIEN CONOCIDO POR SER UNA PARTE DEL ASPECTRO DE DESORDENES ASPRETICOS O TE VOY A DAR LA PAGINA DONDE SE ENCUENTRE ES TE SINDROME ES:<br>  http://es. wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%ADROME_de_ASPERG...<br>  Y TE APARECERA TODA ESE INFO OK....|`|nzokuJ37aa	?Qué es el Síndrome de Asperger?<br>  El Síndrome de Asperger fue descrito por primera vez por el Doctor Hans Asperger en un artículo publicado en Viena en 1944. La investigación del Dr. Asperger no se conoció en el mundo de habla inglesa hasta fines de los a?os 80’ y no fue clasificada oficialmente como un trastorno psiquiátrico hasta 1994. A pesar de que Asperger denominó el tema de su estudio como “autístico”, el síndrome difiere de la definición tradicional de autismo a medida que ésta se fue desarrollando en los Estados Unidos. Algunos se han referido sobre este trastorno como autismo sin el retraso mental.<br>  <br>  El Síndrome de Asperger es un trastorno neurobiológico que afecta varias áreas del desarrollo personal. En contraste con el autismo, las personas con AS (Síndrome de Asperger por sus siglas en inglés) tienden a desear la aceptación social pero pueden ser incapaces de intervenir en interacciones sociales. Sus conversaciones pueden ser unilaterales, demasiado centradas en un tema de interés limitado, caracterizado por un lenguaje pedante y monótono. Una persona con AS no podría percibir los indicadores sociales o el lenguaje corporal de otras personas y podría no notar los sentimientos de otros a su alrededor. Como resultado, una persona con AS es probablemente considerada extra?a o excéntrica lo que conduce hacia un aislamiento social.<br>  <br>  Otras características que se identifican con frecuencia en AS incluyen: Habilidad motriz reducida o torpeza; sensibilidad sensorial; la incapacidad de lidiar con ciertas sensaciones físicas como sonidos, olores o texturas particulares; dependencia a la monotonía; incapacidad de hacer frente a cambios; dificultad para realizar planes y establecer prioridades; obsesión con temas de interés específicos y limitados. Debido a los impedimentos comunes en este trastorno, los individuos con AS probablemente tengan poco éxito al tratar de mantener relaciones sociales y una considerable dificultad en varias situaciones laborales.<br>  <br>  Esto no significa que todas las personas con AS son incapaces de llevar una vida productiva; de hecho se cree que las personas con AS suelen tener un cociente intelectual (IQ por sus siglas en inglés) en un escala de nivel normal a superior (genio). Algunos han especulado que Albert Einstein, entre otros científicos, filósofos, artistas y músicos excelentes, mostraron rasgos asociados con AS.<br>  <br>  Mientras más se sabe sobre este trastorno, profesionales y médicos se han (capacitado) mejor para reconocer individuos que probablemente tengan AS y para evaluarlos desde el diagnóstico. Este es especialmente el caso entre ni?os de edad escolar que pueden ser identificados por su incapacidad de adaptación en el entorno del aula y pueden ser evaluados de acuerdo con las provisiones de la ley Federal de educación especial, el decreto para la Educación de Individuos con Discapacidadades (IDEA por su siglas en inglés) de 1997 y la ley de educación especial de Massachusetts (MGL Capítulo 71B). Las personas adultas no tienen esta clase de servicios disponibles bajo el rótulo de leyes federales y estatales actuales, lo que conduce a la carencia de diagnóstico y la falta de acceso a asistencia médica y otros profesionales porque talvez carecen de cobertura de salud debido al desempleo o subempleo. <br>  <br>  ?Cuántas personas están afectadas por el Síndrome de Asperger?<br>  <br>  Debido a que AS es bastante nuevo en el mapa de diagnóstico en los Estados Unidos, es difícil estimar el número de individuos afectados por este trastorno. Un cálculo reciente basado en encuestas del Instituto Nacional de Salud y Desarrollo Mental de los Ni?os (National Institute of Child Health and Mental Development) muestra que 1 en 500 personas (0.2% de la población general) tiene cierta forma de AS; algunos cálculos es de entre 0.36% y .71%. Parece que AS es más frecuente entre el sexo masculino a razón de 4:1. Ya que es un trastorno que afecta a individuos a lo largo de sus vidas, no puede limitarse a grupos por edades específicas, aunque se diagnostica con mayor facilidad en ni?os de edad escolar.<br>  <br>  Ficha informativa sobre el Síndrome de Asperger<br>  Es un trastorno neurológico que afecta la manera en que la información es procesada en el cerebro. <br>  El síndrome de Asperger es una incapacidad oculta. Muchos individuos parecen muy competentes pero tienen dificultades en las áreas de comunicación y la interacción social. <br>  Tiene un componente genético y hereditario y puede tener causas medioambientales adicionales o interactivas aún desconocidas. <br>  Asperger es una incapacidad del desarrollo, todos los individuos tienen retrasos sociales/emocionales pero continúan mejorando a lo largo de sus vidas. <br>  La incidencia de Asperger es desconocida pero hay un número significativo de individuos sin diagnosticar en el mundo. <br>  Hay cuatro varones con Asperger por cada mujer diagnosticada con Asperger.<br>  éste afecta a cada individuo de manera diferente aunque hay ciertas características que la mayoría de los individuos con Asperger poseen en diferentes grados:<br>  <br>  Los individuos con Asperger constan de una inteligencia de normal a alta y poseen buenas aptitudes verbales. Enfrentan desafíos al usar y entender el lenguaje en un contexto social. <br>  Tienen dificultad para comprender lo que otra persona está pensando y sintiendo (la llamada teoría de la mente (metacognición) o toma de perspectiva). <br>  Es necesaria la ense?anza del comportamiento en el entorno social, la cual es aprendida intuitivamente en otros individuos. <br>  Poseen dificultad para entender sugerencias no verbales como el movimiento de las manos, las expresiones faciales y el tono de la voz. <br>  Surgen desafíos a la hora de organizar, iniciar, priorizar, lo que se llama tareas del funcionamiento ejecutivo. <br>  Centran la atención en detalles peque?os en lugar de una perspectiva más amplia. La mayoría de los individuos con AS (Asperger) tienen áreas de interés intenso como películas, geografía, historia, matemáticas, física, automóviles, caballos, perros o réptiles. <br>  éstas áreas de interés cambian en un período de 3 meses a varios a?os. <br>  Las amistades se forman usualmente a través de actividades o áreas de interés común. <br>  La mayoría de los individuos con AS perciben el mundo en blanco y *****, con dificultades para comprometerse o para ver las áreas grises. <br>  La mayoría de los individuos con AS describen sentirse diferentes, como extraterrestres en nuestro mundo. <br>  La ansiedad y/o la depresión son los mayores componentes para muchos individuos con AS y pueden afectar sus capacidades para funcionar. <br>  Algunos individuos con AS poseen poca sensibilidad o una sensibilidad extrema y debilitante a la luz, el ruido, el tacto o el gusto. <br>  El medio ambiente puede tener un impacto profundo en sus capacidades para desempe?arse.<br>  Otros elementos y rasgos que algunos individuos con AS poseen son:<br>  <br>  Dificultad para establecer contacto visual, a veces doloroso, usualmente con distracción (o si no es ense?ado correctamente, algunos individuos pueden mirar fijamente). <br>  Algunas personas con AS son torpes, la mayoría poseen poca capacidad motriz, algunos se destacan en deportes individuales. <br>  Algunos individuos con AS tienen diagnósticos adicionales, como el transtorno por défit de atención (ADD por sus siglas en inglés), bipolar, trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (OCD por sus siglas en inglés). <br>  Ciertos tienen una habilidad superior en un área en particular como pintura, escritura, matemáticas, música, historia, electrónica o composición. <br>  Las personas con AS pueden tener dificultades para trabajar en grupo. <br>  Los ni?os/as con AS pueden experimentar crisis nerviosas que duran entre 10 minutos y varias horas cuando el ni?o/a no tiene control de su comportamiento. <br>  El autoestima puede ser un problema para los individuos con AS, especialmente durante la escuela secundaria. <br>  Muchos de ellos son extremadamente buenos para memorizar hechos e información. <br>  A algunos les gusta sistematizar el mundo como una manera de entenderlo.<br>  Un resumen de algunas de las intervenciones básicas que pueden ser de ayuda para personas con AS:<br>  <br>  Aceptar el diagnóstico y aprender cómo impacta en quién eres. <br>  Aprender cómo y cuándo hablar del tema con otras personas. <br>  Brindar apoyo para personas adultas en el área de presupuesto y la administración del hogar. <br>  Observar detenidamente al medio social y físico para asegurar que es tolerable para la persona. <br>  Aprender habilidades sociales y de comunicación. <br>  Aprender sobre el comportamiento social. <br>  Trabajar en áreas de interés y habilidades. <br>  Hacer uso de medicación. <br>  Establecer rutinas en la vida del individuo y preparar para la transición en todos los cambios. <br>  Minimizar eventos sociales y transiciones con muchas personas desconocidas. <br>  Brindar apoyo para la organización; la organización visual puede ser mejor para algunas personas.

Also, communism is associated with a loss of individual rights, which are treasured by all western societies.

TDBpYyuPaa	The reason that this happens is because our bodies can't tell the difference between different types of stress.<br>  <br>  When we encounter something that makes us stressed, our autonomic nervous system jumps into action.  The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the "fight or flight" response.<br>  <br>  When you are preparing for speaking in front of people (many people have phobias of this), the body treats it the same way as if you had just come across a mountain lion and starts up the fight or flight response.<br>  <br>  The autonomic nervous system sends your vital organs and your muscles into action.  Your heart beats faster, your breath become shallow and quick, and your palms sweat.<br>  <br>  That's why we get nervous and have sweaty palms.  Our bodies are responding to the anticipation of giving a speech as though we were about to encounter something dangerous.|`|99b5e8847127b6225db2c2933b5ee44eaa	I get nervous prior to and during the presentations because I'm being graded on my oral and communication skills so there's more pressure, and since the class is supposed to be quiet, I feel weird that everyone's listening attentively to what I have to say.

I0rOL46aaa	Longest time is just short of 3 days (67 hours) due to the stomach flu, but if I really need to stay awake for the whole night (I do this more often than I should, usually to finish up on school projects) I usually exercise when I feel sleepy to keep adrenaline pumping, eat really hot foods or suck on ice cubes, brush my teeth every hour, drink sugary soda, eat sugary foods, and sit in uncomfortable positions.  Also I keep music on or the TV on, both at very high levels, and wear thin, short clothes so I'm cold enough that it's uncomfortable but not enough to make me sick.  Sometimes I'll pop into the shower (cold water, natch) for about two to three minutes.  On an average day, though, I wake up at 6 in the morning, and I'm sleeping like the dead by 11:30 PM.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  -Alice|`|8IiygRi8aa	The longest I've ever stayed up is probably a little over 48 hours, and it sucked.  I'm not a caffeine fan but listening to loud music gets the heart pumping faster and blood moving vigorously through ur body.|`|F08qx2hgaa	On average, I can wake up at 5 a.m. and go to bed at about 11 p.m. .  My longest staying-up-adventure was from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m. the next day, falling asleep for an hour by accident (around 3 a.m.) and then getting normal sleep the next day.<br>  <br>  If I'm out for a late dinner with my friends, I feel energized. I can exercise to stay up or stay on the computer for quite a long time. Thing is, if I have no sugar in my system, my energy level starts to go down ~10 p.m. on an average day. Some activities, such as watching movies or playing video games, decrease my resistance to sleep and my energy quickly depletes.|`|JObbAxv6aa	I STAYED UP FOR 3 DAYS STRAIT

I don't want to do anything or go anywhere. If I can help it, I won't even get out of bed. That's how I feel when I am mildly depressed, and it lasts for several days to a few weeks at a time. I get depressed a lot because I am bipolar and I am not currently medicated. :/|`|wWaGn3WLaa	i feel kinda empty and emotionless. and if something reminds me of why i am depressed i get sad. i just sat in my room and listened to music. it was because i was forced to play football for about 4 years. now i dont and i am much happier. hopless is a good word|`|P9RauQ7laa	feel empty.  emotionally monotonous.|`|Zirwfsg4aa	a constant sensation of gloominess and emptiness and aloneness and not caring. Like your emotions are all grey and you can't make yourself care, even if you know you should or want to.<br>  I think to try not to think to much, I block stuff out, or I think simple things that don't need a lot of emotion.<br>  Rain will get me everytime, stress, an ongoing painful situation that I wish I didn't have to deal with, something bad happening, suppressing my unhappiness or anger about something or someone, overthinking something depressing
1d144c3a5d03c47f15784117493133c8aa	the current economic slup is causing the U.S. to buy buy less goods (foreign, and domestic) because the U.S. has had a trade deficet you can assume that we are buying decreased consumption by more foreign goods than domestic. if we buy less foreign goods then our currency starts to gain value against our trade partners currency. this is true until the fed starts increasing the money supply, which they have. the more money in circulation the less each dollar can buy.... this is the reason why the dollar is falling against the yen, and other foreign currencys.

FK9Z75Staa	You COULD just advance your reading proficiency above grade 3.
CC4fUcRsaa	I view this dream to mean one of three things: You are unconsciously thinking about the person, and the image is coming to your brain in the shape of a dream. Your mind could be interpreting a event that may occur in the future, and some of the items may just represent emotions and feelings. Waiting for the dog could be waiting for the results of how your friend is doing, and the darkness could represent your feeling towards the person, the thought towards the news you heard or the uncomfortable feeling you may have and/or if you actually here the news in reality you will react to the news. Alternatively the dream could just be a thought you had in your mind, and it took shape in a dream without being directly related to this person. I would be inclined to believe that the dream it is a precercer to an event to follow; because, the dream sounds to be in an order of event that could occur in reality.|`|we2Csi51aa	weird. but dreams are just thought in the VERYYY VERYY BACK of your mind. have you ever noticed that what you think or stress about before you go to bed is never in your dreams...only memories or things of the past. its just your imagination going wild. panic attack. hope i helped|`|x8VSJx8Daa	Hm.. look here<br>  <a href="http://myjellybean.com/astrology/dream/dream.htm" rel="nofollow">http://myjellybean.com/astrology/dream/d...</a><br>  helps a lot ^^^^^^^^^%5|`|nZmr9okpaa	whats the question?|`|YJcd8OAeaa	a loved one has a problem and you might be saying it in front of your kid
f391180a88508c59f24d2d8cb19fc7c7aa	The way I think of it:<br>  <br>  I would take the TV, return it, and say "I know who stole it" and give a total description of the man. If karma exists and the man is caught, then the store will give you the TV as a reward.<br>  <br>  ... but sadly, that only happens in a parallel universe.<br>  <br>  There are other possibilities.<br>  A) You can get in trouble for having a stolen TV in hand, and the store will think you had a trip of conscience and decide to return it, and the whole story will end in an arrest.<br>  <br>  B) You can take it home, but since it's a shelf model, I doubt it's all that good, and it'll die within a month or so.<br>  <br>  And since the man can carry the TV without problem, it must be pretty small. So just put your hands over your ears, say "LALALALA THIS ISN'T HAPPENING" And run away, pushing that memory to the back of your mind.<br>  <br>  on the second one<br>  <br>  FInders keepers. It's wrong to say, but I believe if you care about your stuff, you wouldn't lose it, and if you did, you would've found it before anyone else did, or realize that you have lost it and you can easily find it.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Years ago I would have taken the TV, but today I know Jesus and He says to not steal or be involved in it.  Both TV and wallet need to go back to the original owner.
ToILKl6waa	Stop doubting yourself. If you know you have it in you, accept that and allow yourself to move forward with confidence. If you've prepared yourself in the past, you'll be prepared for the future. Have a little faith.|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	Just try to relax! Tell yourselft you'll do fine then just take your mind off of it.
m89kGXBnaa	Hebbs law, simplified: neurons that fire together wire together. <br>  <br>  Or in full: When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased <br>  <br>  The energy is neuronal firing. When two connected neurons fire and A activates B, then a connection is formed between them, meaning when A fires in future, B is also likely to activate - or recall is prompted. The energy is spent creating a connection. This mean future energy activating a few of the connected neurons (the process of attemting to remember, or stimulis prompting recall) can reactive the same complete pattern of neurons, as they have become linked.  (Memory is formed by memory traces - patterns of neuronal activation represent our memory and knowledge and representations of the world)|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	Neural connection is strengthened through electrical stimulation. There is long term memory and short term memory. Long term memory is the when the neurons are strengthened by constant electrical stimulation. Short term memory has really weak connections.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I don't think that's what happens.  It doesn't really sound right.
l7fyLFFtaa	When I was 17 my best friend came up to me and asked me if I would be okay with him dating my ex-girlfriend. I was fine with it. We were over, had our time. I gave him my blessing and now they are married with 3 kids and are very happy, and I'm happy for them.<br>  <br>  In the back of my mind though I will always know that she went out with me first. I'm so petty.<br>  <br>  Let it go. Focus on you and the guys that are available. You're 16. Don't get hung up on one guy when there are so many others out there.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	There are two issues here, one he tried to kiss your best friend, this insinuates he did not kiss her, this proves your friend is trustworthy and he is not, the other issue is a saying a drunken mans actions are a sober mans desires, for him to act this way drunk is an explanation to his desires sober, there is no decision to make move on to better pastures this one as no future.|`|QUTI4UIzaa	You just have to go with who you trust but you are right to be a bit wary...it will all work out im sure|`|TaR6eXpcaa	You overcome it by understanding that all our life if about learning. <br>  <br>  a baby is falling 1000 times until he learns how to walk, he gets hurt time after time, but does he complain or asks "should i ever try walking again, because trying to walk hurts ?"<br>  <br>  don't be afraid of being hurt by trust issues, it will only prevent you from discovering new exiting people.
oZPLI8Y5aa	First of all there are indication of UFO sightings throughout history. <br>  It does appear that they increased a lot after the bomb tests though. <br>  <br>  THe possibilities are too many to go into as to what they are - extraterrestrial or dimensional, advanced race coexisting with us but unnoticed, etc. <br>  One thing is clear - we have more evidence on their existence than we have on many peple we have found guilty and imprisoned.|`|Ql5fgVtBaa	Some people believe that intelligence from another planet made contact with us thousands of years ago; helping out the Egyptians and the Aztecs build their pyramids. It's a possibility that some people today are still being visited by extraterrestrials, but refuse to report it because they fear that they will be mocked by the public, fired from their jobs, being sent to a mental hospital, or if they become good friends with the extraterrestrials, they wouldn't want the government getting a hold of their space buddies. (That's what I would fear anyways)

EQXARVlVaa	It is unnecessary to punish yourself since the realisation of the fact the cheating was wrong and immoral is a punishment in itself. It is pleasing to see that you know what you have done is wrong therefore I would advise to move on and prevent this happening again in the future.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can move on. Stop hanging in there, it is not something major that would affect other people's lives to tell you teacher about. Life continues.|`|baSks9O4aa	God has forgiven you, now you just have to forgive yourself. Learn from your mistake and just don't do it again.|`|xBdwuQzTaa	Sigh, the conscience can be very powerful I would suggest telling your teacher because it will eat away at your conscience. But you can make the decision for yourself.<br>  <br>  Remember find out consequences before you admit to it!!!<br>  <br>  Also what the person before me said!!!
l7fyLFFtaa	Put on your favorite music. I listen to Rihanna in the morning and it always gets me going. I hate mornings too, but this helps.|`|ToILKl6waa	The night before, make a list of everything you have to look forward to the next day. Include things even so small as greeting a neighbor or wearing your favorite shirt. Hang it right where you can see it in the morning. Also, listen to music while you get ready and throw water on your face. Think of the day as an exciting opportunity where anything is bound to happen rather than an overwhelming pile of dread.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Smile and the whole world smiles with you, grouch and you're on your own!!|`|AA10824838	It may sound strange, but it does not take to long.  First when you wake up (while you are still in bed) , make sure you stretch your arms and legs.  Then take a big deep breath.  Slowly roll out of bed and think about some of the good things that will be happening that day.  It is little, but it should help.|`|gmIlj1qzaa	Go to bed a half hour to an hour earlier.  One of the reasons you may be grouchy is not getting enough rest.  <br>  <br>  Also, even if it's on your way out, grab something to eat for breakfast...cereal, banana, etc...  That may help too.  Good luck.|`|ySu9DihZaa	ive got the same problem.<br>  <br>  **** school, sorry idk im miserable too|`|59d543ed3786a39f75cd5dae8b5dd6f2aa	Listen to some music on your way to school. I find that the music i listen to can affect my wildly. I can psyche myself up before a rugby game, get me concentrating before a test/exam or relax before i get home. It's a great way just don't listen too loudly or you may end up with ear damage.|`|ERrTaEP0aa	take a nice long shower
AcgDcQG0aa	Save as much money as you can.  <br>  <br>  If you loose your job and end up being unemployed for a long time.  Then you will need all of your savings and more.|`|P9RauQ7laa	Invest wisely.  Gold is going up, but is already expensive.  Alcohol will probably sky-rocket during the depression(sad but true), so I would buy shares in that.<br>  You seem cautious and well prepared though, so I'm sure you'll be fine.  It's the people who deny the economic status who will truly suffer.
11ll4rXPaa	Drivin" my 69 charger RT. It only gets 9 miles ta da gallon. Now it sits. DAT SUCKS CAUSE OF GAS PRICES!!!!
AcgDcQG0aa	Paper cash is only a small part of all the money in the economy.  Most of the money is in the form of numbers in computers at banks and other financial institutions.  Which means that a Joker can't burn trillions of dollars in some huge bonfire.  Because that much paper money simply doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  But it is possible to decrease the money supply in the economy through decreased lending by banks.  Decreased lending leads to deflation of prices, especially for big ticket items such as houses and cars.   Because most people need to borrow money to buy these things.  And when they can't borrow, then they can't buy.  Which leads to an oversupply of these goods in the market.

It was cinco de mayo like 5 years ago.<br>  All i can offer is......You have to monitor your alcohol intake.<br>  Its ok to get drunk, but not to the point where your oblivious to your actions.  You know i know a girl who got date raped.  She was so blasted, she had no recollection of it, save for that her vaginal area was totally bruised up and her clothes dishoveled.<br>  You have to be careful and more responsible especially being a girl.

Since then I have had to bleach & pluck my chin hair out.<br>  <br>  I am aware that I am not comfortable in my skin.  Though, because I am a caring person.  I try to not think about my facial hair problems and focus on caring about other people. <br>  <br>  One day I saw a women with a thick mustache I thought she was a man.

Don't try to bring that day forward; try to make the best of what you have now. It sounds as if you are going through a very rough time as I did when I was younger. I, too, would recommend an antidepressant. You'd be surprised how much better they can make you feel. They will not solve your problems, but they will make you see yourself and your problems in a different light so that you can take some positive steps to change things. I hope you have family and friends to whom you can turn for support as that is very important too.|`|GbRDukONaa	i know how you feel. trust me, i do.<br>  <br>  forget therapy. you need to be on an antidepressant. get to a psychiatrist at once. there is hope for you. <br>  <br>  life will not be perfect if you get on the right medicine........but it will be a hell of a lot better than it is now. <br>  <br>  go for it! you do not have to be miserable anymore. the right medicine can work wonders. |`|fL17Pme6aa	What are you good at?

I would suggest still trying therapy, but maybe getting on some medication as well.  I have found that the two work better together than they do alone.<br>  <br>  The fact that you don't want to live anymore is very sad, and I know how you're feeling.  Please don't give up...there is no use in seeking a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  It will get better and there is hope.

God really is the only answer for your sadddness and i know someone like you and God turned ther life around. but im pale too and wear like makeup, like tan stuff. bronzer. and a little pink on the cheeks helps alot. but im sure your pretty. go to a church in your area and talk to someone. it will help. God bless pretty girl!!!!|`|15ErhPmMaa	Well don't commit suicide.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  It will get better for you.  You just have to believe and pray to God that you need help and if you truly believe in him, he might help you out. |`|0EldIfVPaa	Beauty is as beauty does. Have you ever heard this saying? It means that our personal beauty depends on our behavior rather than on our physical appearance. In other words, it is how we act rather than how we appear that makes us ugly or beautiful. No matter what we look like, crude behavior can make us ugly, while gracious behavior can make us beautiful in a very special way.<br>  <br>  Stop comparing yourself to others. You shouldn't do that, because God has not given you the same gifts He gave others.  Don't try to be anyone else.  Be yourself.  Use the talents God has given you.<br>  <br>  Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others - 1 Peter 4:10<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VSK71lsyaa	Honestly, there are ups and downs in life. I know I'm no beauty either, but I know that there's more in this world than just looks. Everyone has a talent and purpose in life. You may not know it yet, but one day you'll find out that your presence helped people and that you're just as important as anyone else. Try to find something your passionate about. Say when your a pianist, dancer, poet,etc. you'll find yourself special in a way that not everyone can say so themselves.   <br>  Yeah and back to the look, I'll admit that I get jealous too. But, don't tell me you think you're the least attractive person on earth. Outer beauty is all about looking healthy. So exercise and eat right. A person who is fit and radiant can carry himself/herself best. Who has the right to say that pale skin or freckles isn't pretty anyways. Besides all of that, don't forget that your inner beauty can outshine outer beauty. |`|Z3EX11Juaa	It's sad to hear you feel like this - I think it really is sad and unfair that you should feel like this. I say that beacuse i am in what appears to be a similar situation. I won't say i know exactly how you feel because i don't, but if you are like me, although you feel desprerately down, there is the urge and desire for your life to get better and for you to be happy and enjoy life as it should be enjoyed. <br>  <br>  For me, this is because you can't escape life unless you're dead. Even shutting yourself away is only the most temporary of escapism, and for that reason it is worth taking any practical measures to improve your life. <br>  <br>  I say this from the position of someone who believes much of my horrible life and social torment i'm in stems from my PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, like you. I have sorted out my teeth expensive), but i have a very weak jaw making my face really out of proportion (it's really bad - i look ugly - im the most unphotogenic person ever) and braces have made my mouth stick out. I also have 4 big moles on my face - and this hinders social progression BIG TIME. It's been like this for about 5 years (with brief periods of relative happiness in between).<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway - i have looked into plastic surgery but i think its gunna be too much hassle - with the money - people recognising you've changed - embarrassment. But i think that's the way to go for you - TRY AND SEE IF YOU ARE / WILL BE ABLE TO SORT OUT ANY OF THE PHYSICAL PROBLEMS when ur old enough.<br>  <br>  Apologies for ranting a bit - but i'm not good at the moment. The worst of it is that i'm at uni and i'm missing out big time and it won't change but i wish i could be like the others. <br>  <br>  As a football pundit once said when referring to his turbulent emotions about hus club's relegation battle: "It's the hope that kills you". <br>  I couldn't agree more<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope you manage to deal with you problems, i really do. Good Luck<br>  <br>

As for the changing rooms, we do have doors on our changing rooms so it is not likely you or I will be seeing each other undress.  Congrats on telling your parents and good luck!  =P|`|iHKJsyfTaa	It's perfectly normal,, after all "Gender is a social construct" Right? isn't that what the say so often ?|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I do not have a problem with it so long as you are not someone who wears an ill fitting wig, and wears make up in an obviously tacky way as if you do not know how to put it on, because this gives me the idea that you would be a whack job/Serial killer and then id be afraid to go to the bathroom.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Doesnt bother me in the slightest. For all intents and purposes, you are just another woman.<br>  <br>  In my citys marks and spencer (its a department store for those of you who dont live in the UK), there is a transgender female assistant in the women's changing rooms.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	No, not at all, as I don't know what goes in the next stall.  Even if I did, I don't care.  That's your choice, I can only respect you for it.|`|cee27a373f64a299e31c2d3af3a93660aa	Very uncomfortable, but if you were friendly I would try to be your friend. That doesn't mean though I have to accept everything you believe in and same thing with my beliefs.|`|PWNHixl5aa	Not at all, I wouldn't know you are in there or not. Good luck wish you the best in your transfer.
l7fyLFFtaa	I love playing paintball, I also love first shooter video games. I have two Nerf guns and played with GI Joe action figures when I was young. I don't have a real desire to shoot an actual gun. I certainly don't ever want to shoot another person.<br>  <br>  I thinks its like alcohol. In Europe the drinking age is much younger than here. Also, parents are okay with younger kids have a little alcohol. It's not like in America. So when European kids hit that drinking age it's no big deal for them. They don't need to get hammered and stat driving around drunk. In America, because it's so taboo kids start drinking in their teens and get into all sorts of trouble.<br>  <br>  I think that if kids didn't have toy guns it would raise there curiosity to handle a real gun much more. Just a different way of looking at things I guess.|`|Rp3QC8WDaa	umm.. this is a rhetorical question however to buy a gun u need to be at least 21 years old. Don't tell me when your 21 and you kill someone you will say its because you were introduced to toy guns when you were young.

AA11966821	You can't go by companies.  They often source from many different countries.  A single product may have components from many different countries, especially things like cars.  <br>  <br>  You have to go by the label on the product itself.  Check the label on the food packaging, the box your whatever comes in, etc.  Even on a package of toilet tissue, it will say "Made in USA,"  "Made in Canada," whatever.  This will ensure that whatever you buy is made in the US, if that is your choice.|`|gzBelJM4aa	I am not sure if there are a list of companies that only distribute US products but if you want to help corporations in the US then you should purchase from US corporations regardless of were products are produced.<br>  <br>  Furthermore by buying only US products you are limiting competition and discouraging companies from producing efficiently. If a company such as China is producing pencil sharpeners for ten times less than a US producer then that producer should find a different product to produce as it is inefficient and its resources would be best spent elsewhere.
AA11951392	Nightmares are a subcategory of dreams. The distinction of a nightmare is its frightening and/or emotional content. You tend to wake up in fear in the midst of a nightmare. Because of its frightening nature, you tend to remember your nightmares and the vivid details. They have a bigger impact upon your waking mind and its images stay with you throughout the day. One reason for nightmares may be a way of our unconscious to get our attention about a situation or problem that you have been avoiding. It is time to take notice and confront a problem or situation. Nightmares serve an important purpose in showing you what is troubling you from within you deeper levels. Discussing, analyzing, and understanding your nightmares can lead to a solution for some problem, internal conflict or personal difficulty. <br>  <br>   <br>  To see a building in your dream, represents the self and the body. How high you are in the building indicates a rising level of understanding or awareness. If you are in the lower levels of the building, then it refers to more primal attitudes and/or sexuality.<br>  <br>  <br>  To see glass in your dream, symbolizes passivity or protection. You may be putting up an invisible barrier to protect yourself in a situation or relationship. If the glass is dirty, cloudy or discolored, then it suggests that you are not seeing something clearly. You need more clarity in a situation.<br>  <br>  To see a lion in your dream, symbolizes great strength, aggression and power. You will overcome your emotions and/or difficulties. As king of the jungle, the lion also represents dignity, royalty, leadership, pride and domination.You have much influence over others. You need to exercise some restraint in your own personal and social life<br>  <br>  To see a panther in your dream, signifies lurking danger and enemies working to do you harm. It represents darkness, death, and rebirth. On a more positive note, panthers signify power, beauty and/or grace. <br>  <br>  To walk along a corridor in your dream, signifies a transitional phase of self exploration It signals spiritual enlightenment, emotional growth physical prowess, new opportunities and mental passages in your life. If you are walking through a long corridor, then it represents your desperation in trying to escape a repetitive situation or some behavior patterns. You need to free yourself of this repetition. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are in the bedroom, signifies aspects of your self that you keep private. It is also indicative of your sexual nature and intimate relations. <br>  <br>  To see a pigeon in your dream, suggests that you are taking the blame for the actions of others. Pigeons also represent gossip or news. Perhaps they carry a message from your unconscious. Alternatively, the dream may be expressing a desire to return home<br>  <br>  I hope you get some insight from this information<br>  <br>  Love & Blessings <br>  Milly|`|8d8ejHPfaa	Even though it's presented differently, they both seem to be about the same thing.  In both of these dreams you are trying to escape from aggressive animals.  The one with the pigeon suggests you are being unfairly blamed for something, making you "a pigeon".   The pecking suggests people picking on you or throwing barbs at you, pointed comments, aimed at your face suggests your image. The glass doors suggest invasion of privacy, no matter how you try to shut it out, it comes through the door... Between the two dreams, it suggests that you are the subject of gossip and speculation... Thinking on it a little further, the lion may be one person in particular (a ringleader), and the panthers two followers... big cats approach their prey by "stalking" it... Another thought that occured to me about the pecking, is the phrase "pecking order"....
g7mD94cuaa	I would need to know more about her before I can give you an answer to that one. And I think you need to find out more about her too. It depends on the girl. We are all different and all have our own way of making a guy like us or notice us. It depends on who we are and our like/dislikes. Once you know this stuff about her, you can go from there. Good luck!|`|hpkOeOLyaa	Wait, so you talked AND she laughed. Man you are so in there.<br>  but no seriously, maybe she is. If she acts like like she is really interested in what you say and she smiles a lot then there's a nice chance that she could be.|`|YYx0Z6njaa	Hmm, i think you need to find out more about her<br>  make sure she is single<br>  maybe talk to her mates<br>  her ex boyfriend thing doesn't matter, unless she was like saying she was in love with him or somthing.<br>  i'm sure it will work out well in the end|`|WLMvNnKnaa	Yeah I think that she could definitely like you.  Especially if you guys started talking about family!<br>  And seriously, what are the odds that you both stay after class and leave at exactly the same time?:)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|noJmRSYGaa	i know a guy just like you and i really like him. but theres someone i like more..i think :s but yes! there is definate potential right there!! keep talkn to her :)
nulE8zdBaa	What you have experienced is called déjà vu. <br>  <br>  Déjà vu is French for 'seen before'. Seen before in a dream! Not many people have the good fortune of actually remembering the dream that went before this normally trivial but also very exciting and vexing event.<br>  <br>  The explanation our contemporary science gives is patently wrong. Science puts it down to a glitch in the brain. A complicated explanation to boot! The truth is much simpler.<br>  <br>  Science cannot accept the truth of the déjà vu because it thinks the future is in no way accessible. Yet the dream does nothing else but talk about the future. It is in fact the blueprint of waking life! <br>  <br>  This is scary for many because it means that we do not have any real control over our waking life. But there is nothing to be scared about because our life is in good hands of a superior intelligence.<br>  <br>  In some cases of déjà vu we may not remember the dream that spawned it. I call such déjà vus ‘cryptomnesic recalls’ of a dream. In plain language this means that when such a déjà vu happens we only recall the CONTENT of a forgotten dream we had the night before. The dream itself remains hidden in such cases; it is a cryptomnesic or hidden memory, it is only subconsciously remembered.<br>  <br>  All dreams go into the memory bank. So when we have a déjà vu of either kind, or indeed a PREMONITION, we recall the dream's scenario either directly or indirectly and in that way we know ahead what is going to happen even if we do not recall the actual dream. <br>  <br>  If you keep a record of your dreams and follow what happens after, you will see this more and more. Date the dreams because sometimes it takes days, weeks, month or indeed, years before a dream comes true.<br>  <br>   Unlike in the case of the déjà vu most dreams materialise figuratively and not in the way you have seen them in your dream. It is because of this that we fail to see the connection between the dream and what happened in waking life so often.<br>  <br>  But when we remember how we deal with figurative language in everyday speech we soon see the way the dream turns into waking reality. If we deal with a dream in that very way we crack its meaning eventually.<br>  <br>  So how do we deal with figurative language in everyday speech? In this way: When someone says to us: "I have fallen in love", we don't ask: "Did you hurt yourself when you fell?" We don’t ask that because we know very well that the person in love has fallen off his EMOTIONAL perch, that he has lost his grip on reality and his footing on the plane of sensibilities. <br>  <br>  And when you have a dream that you were flying on a white cloud you are not going to expect to fly on a cloud in real life. Instead you will find that you will feel really HIGH on the dream day and you may even say: “Today I am on Cloud Nine!” <br>  <br>  Congratulations are in order, for you are on the way of exploring the most open secret in life, that dreams predict the future!|`|XQGm3lfPaa	I get this sometimes too except i dont dream.  i am doing something at school or somewhere else (school mostly) and I just look at my surroundings and swear it happened before or that I have done it.  I dont know why.  I just ignore it.  If you cant talk to someone about it|`|jZJBV3spaa	COD piboler freak<br>  just kidding XD|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	To dream that you see the future, signifies your hopes or your fears of how things will turn out depending on the scenario. <br>  <br>  You may also be intuitive and have your life set ahead for you. You are going on the right path and you had this path set for you before you were born.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|6GpN0NOIaa	dasavoo or mabey ur just exited and are creating a world of what it could be in your mind

Feel soo used sometimes!|`|EeabLB5eaa	Yes we all do. It's very natural.
mSt1LGfjaa	sometimes the dreams don't always come true,,so i say follow your heart,,it will lead you the right way,,your heart knows what you want,|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Heart, if heart means you don't have to be consistent. I think that consistency is a huge problem in our society, because it puts so much energy into something impossible.|`|MX6JFpA2aa	I would have to say neither.  I am much more in tune with my intuition.  I guess you could classify that as the heart if you wanted to.  If I know something I know something and it doesn't matter what anyone says about it.  I follow that feeling which leads me to what I believe is as much as the truth that can be revealed.|`|919XflnDaa	I say dreams. The realistic ones of course. I personally don't believe in love, so why bother with the heart. I'm already a Mortician, all I need now is a top hat and a nice dress suit. That was my dream back when I was a boy. And it's all possible. I just can't find a top hat.|`|43f9Ctozaa	To me they should be the same thing, but if I had to choose I would follow my heart.|`|fF1WbPltaa	Dreams.|`|3tC37s9Haa	I don't think that following your dreams and following your heart are necessarily opposites.  In fact, I think they are very related.  If you were to say follow your head or follow your heart then I would understand the dilemma.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	Why can't we do both? I feel like I've pretty much done both-without undue conflict. I also follow my sense of intuition also. What could be better than following your heart AND your dreams? I feel blessed.
eC5QIpnbaa	most " attractive people" look healthy. We are genetically preprogrammed to mate withthe healthiest individuals to give our children a better chance at a good life.|`|Ej6pwAcKaa	Umm becuz you like them alot|`|8pQrIL90aa	I am not always attracted to "good looking people" because they are not always good looking and its just the lust that is inside me. <br>  <br>  I like finding the hidden uncommon beauty of people. I dont think that there is a such thing as an ugly person.
Jwk7Ib2vaa	Anyone in the NRA (aka Republicans)|`|ugytyh3oaa	I think someone there are two types of mentally ill. For instance one would be when they physically function like a healthy person, but have twisted thoughts. Thoughts about harming themselves or others, thoughts about deceiving innocent people, or when someone is willing do anything to anyone to benefit themselves.<br>  The second is when they do not have the cognitive ability to understand how things work around them, but do not have intentions to hurt themselves or others.|`|80Dyljhdaa	A person who's mind over time develops a mental illness that causes the mind to lose the ability to function in an normal manner.<br>  <br>  Someone born with a mental defect is not considered mentally ill.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	someone with a mental disorder|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	downs|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	being all sorts of f-u-c-k-e-d|`|b8528620a728305f71cb5c62336e1efbaa	When I think of mentally ill I think of mentally disabled, such as a person that has difficulty grasping information even in the simplest forms, or a person that has difficulties analysing information and others' reactions, such as a person that cannot tell the difference between a smile or a frown. I usually think of it as a person who was born with it or acquired it from an accident or was put into the state of mind by some force that's pushed their limits. I don't think a person simply gets a mental retardation. I believe there's always a reason behind the mental illness.<br>  <br>  I'll have a go at the definition: a mentally ill person is someone whose mental needs are unmet or distorted.|`|InslW3QMaa	well someone that cant think straight and are retarded  (not the mean way though)

m89kGXBnaa	You appear to be a dualist (brain and mind being separate). Unfortnately, all evidence suggests brain=mind.<br>  <br>  For example, Phineas Gage. He had a lead pipe blasted through his skull, and lived, but his charactor and personality changed drastically as a result of the brain damage. He was one of the earliest examples recorded properly.<br>  <br>  As for bad brain, good mind... well, the brain does not work by mass action. It has specific areas for specific tasks, so it depends where the damage is and what kind of damage it is. Dementia, for example, is a form of brain-wide dying off of cells/connections, and affects everything. A knock to the head may merely give you certain type of aphasia (unable to speak. But you can understand and make sounds still, even copy speech). And there is a certain amount of reorganisation the brain can do, or regrowth, or learning new tricks (basically, a bypass around te damaged area, where possible). So it depends on type of "bad" brain or damage, the age you recieved it (the younger the better in terms of recovery) and the location/extent.|`|7efc52fca43eedf86cf9eb0ca9e070a4aa	depends on what part is damaged. each part of the brain is there for a reason. If you damage your frontal lobe your judgment could be severely impaired and you might make inappropriate decisions and think that you are making the right ones. very common with TBI's.

69747adf3b6a9d2b152eabc1282fee2daa	It used to be that in the UK the family would eat together, certainly for the main meal of the day at least. I well remember that, when I was a child, if I were late for dinner, then I didn't get any. I went to bed hungry!<br>  <br>  But times and customs change, although not always for the better. Political parties in the UK have not, for various reasons, supported the family unit, and that unit has, almost literally, begun to fall apart. <br>  <br>  With both spouses tending to work, who is to prepare the main meal? Will the children be obliged to wait for both parents to return home before they are fed? Even at weekends, I think you will find it unusual in most households for whole families to be sitting down to eat together.<br>   <br>  The change has been slow, but very sure. I think the greater part of the blame (is that the correct word?) must lie with the people who guide social change in the UK, i.e. our governments, local and national. For my own part, I see the lack of discipline in the young as the root cause. Because of legislation, children can no longer be "forced" to follow their parents' wishes, even so far as eating together. <br>  <br>  Europe does not seem to have this problem, because it seems to me, from my travels, that discipline for the young does indeed still exist on the continent. <br>  <br>  Could it be that simple?

Maybe the family togetherness plays out in a different way. I dont know - My own children always ate with us at table and they always eat with their children at the table so I dont have personal knowledge. Children who are sent away to boarding school dont even get to eat in the same house - Is anyone to blame?<br>  <br>  Eating at table together doesn't necessarily promote family well being,<br>  as I can testify from my own dysfunctional family of origin. -|`|bYtCfdwbaa	It's hard to know why but it points to the erosion of the family unit,everyone going their own way.This in turn leads children to seek out a group that it feels part of and why the gang mentality is flourishing.<br>  When a family eats together it gives them a common bond,they discuss their day,have the craic,they're connected.<br>  Who's to blame?Parents.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	because they are not as 'family orientated' as the europeans are.

Rhn3Q9Yuaa	To dream that you are taking an exam, indicates that you are being put to the test or being scrutinized in some way.?Such dreams highlight your feelings of being anxious and agitated. You may find that you cannot answer any of the questions on the test or that the test is in some foreign language. Is time running out and you find that you can not complete the exam in the allowed time? Or are you late to the exam? Does your pencil keep breaking during the exam? Such factors contribute to you failing this test. These dreams usually have to do with your self-esteem and confidence or your lack of. You are worried that you are not making the grade and measuring up to other people's expectations of you. You may also experience the fear of not being accepted, not being prepared, or not being good enough. You feel nervous, insecure and tend to believe the worst about yourself.<br>  <br>  These dreams also suggest that you may feel unprepared for a challenge. Rarely, are these dreams about the content of the test, but rather the process and how you are feeling during the exam taking process. Generally, you feel distressed and frustrated. These feelings may parallel how you are feeling in a particular challenge or situation in your waking like.<br>  <br>  Dreams of this nature are also an indication that you are being judged and this dream is a signal for you to examine an aspect of yourself that you may have been neglecting and need to pay attention to. You may harbor some guilt because of your neglect in preparation for a school exam, meeting, business project, or some challenge. Most of the time, though, people who have such dreams are unlikely to fail a test in real life. This dream goes back to their fear and own anxiety that they may not meet other's standards of them. They are afraid to let others down.?|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Exam <br>  To dream that you are taking an exam, signifies insecurities, fear of not meeting others' expectations, and fear of failure. <br>  <br>  Well you appear to have a fear of failure.

b63737fb72700e0ab4d4ddc7174c7e45aa	Sounds like you may have depressive or anxiety disorder.  It is really easy to get in a depressive state where you don't even want to get out of bed.  Then you beat yourself up and get anxious over what you didn't accomplish.  Those are very common feelings and you are not the only one who has experienced them.  I would suggest talking with your doctor or if you don't have insurance, look for a sliding fee scale place near you.  Medication can help you get over that hump and takes some of the "freak out" feelings away.  Don't give up and know there are a lot of places that can help.  I had to try about 4 different medications after I went through a divorce and finally found the one that helps me the most.

Also I had one with me falling off of a REALLY tall floor. Also my latest nightmare was of this girl who I haven't seen in FOREVER. I saw the outside of this really scary house then inside im looking at the tv and its darkish and there are two candles on each wall. There is white fuzz on the tv. Then I hear the screech from the ring, followed by the girl dressed up as the girl from the ring. The scene flickers and the candles go out and back on. Suddenly she is in front of the tv in a old wooden chair looking at the tv which is static. Then the chair spins around while still being on the floor and I recognize her as the girl from my old school. Then lighting strikes and I see it in the window which suddenly appears and then disappears. Then she said a few things I couldn't understand and then started to say my name. It wasn't her voice though, it wasn't anyone's I know either. Then I flash to the outside of the house with lighting again. Then back in and she is standing up with no tv no chair. Only says my name, then I wake up. That was my most recent one.|`|x7duxnBLaa	When I was little, I used to have a nightmare that a skeleton was chasing me through an alley at night and I would wake up my heart pounding and sweaty.

2psc8hfhaa	At some point in their lives, I think most people go through a "dark stage" where nothing makes them happy. The best thing to do is find a reason to be happy about who you are. What are you good at? What positive traits do you have? If you feel good about who you are, it's hard to get sad. And if you're happy with yourself, other people will notice. I know it's hard because I'm going through a time in my life where everyone I care about has rejected me. It's really tough and sometimes its good to just lay down and cry. But don't do it all the time. Find a hobby to consume your time; music is one good example. Pray and just tell God that you're sick and tired of being miserable and want things to change. Trust me, it's hard but you can get through it.|`|0mXQODsIaa	hey, maybe you should see a councilor. but do not commit suicide. its not worth it. to be here is better than to not be here. you can fix this. i promise. you just need to talk to somoene caring|`|6EJcvmNNaa	Just "chill". Calm down at school, and don't be "hyper" not many people like hyper people, upbeat people, sometimes, but not overly hyper people that talk constantly. You probably need to talk to someone anyone will work, if you don't want to talk to adults, talk to your friend, and if you don't want to do that you can message me, I'm not a professional, but I might be able to help you. As for not letting them see your true side, just flip the switch. Block out your emotions until you get home if you can (Some people can, some people can't, females usually can't, but you can try.), and if you can't do that be positive, but not hyper.<br>  <br>  -Good luck

HE could take your children while having visitation,,and leave the country or state.. You said you filed for child support,,so wait till everything is in place,,and you begin receiving checks..I'm curious why you would even CARE what he tells the other woman..It doesn't effect you one way or another.. Ignore the issue totally,,unless YOU have someone else your seeing..If that's the case,,make the domestic relations courts in your area aware that the divorce was never finalized..As long as your separated,,and living apart,,you can also file for divorce yourself under ''abandonment !!" This won't effect your child support issue in the courts,,but will affirm your legal status as far as the marriage as of this time.. I do wish you well,,but DON"T under any circumstances LEAVE your children with him or his parents without the custody court order in place...   SOLOMON|`|AA10462002	Please forgive me but what does OW mean????? All I can think of is Old Woman...<br>  <br>  Ok, anyways, speaking from experience my parents have been "divorced" now for over 2 years, and like you the papers have yet to be signed.  Legally neither can re-marry until the judge signs off, but otherwise for all intents and purposes, they are divorced, and refer to themselves as divorced.  It's only a formality that they're not.<br>  <br>  Now if either were to be in another committed relationship where marriage was being considered, I'm sure by then the "divorce" would be finalized.  If not, it will be mentioned when the relationship became serious.  There is no reason to tell a random girlfriend the details, because either way the relationship is history.  If he walks around telling people he's still married, he'll never find a new girlfriend.  I don't really consider that lying.<br>  <br>  Anyways, back to your question.  Yes tell him you're coming, and maybe arrange to drop off the kids for a few hours or even overnight.  You can stay at a hotel, but allow the children to spend time with their father.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	He is lying to the other woman to get something from her or to justify their relationship. Why don't you file for divorce under abandonment? Make sure you have full custody of the children before taking them up to see grandma. He could steal them without a court order in place. Maybe he's waiting to snatch the kids and file divorce with possession so that he can raise his kids with the new woman.<br>  <br>  Just protect yourself and your kids from legal shenanigans whatever you do.|`|85Co7zE8aa	Frankly i wouldn't tell him unless you want to chew him out about the whole divorced/not divorced thing.|`|fukg7pMQaa	My guess is because he doesn't like you or he just is embarrassed by you some how, but otherwise ask him.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Assuming he is familliar with the process and so knows you're not divorced, it may be because you are as good as - in his head, emotionally, to all intent and purposes, you are divorced. He may not have completed the steps due to apathy, laziness, lack of motivation, etc. This is guesswork, ask him.<br>  <br>  I don't know enough about your relationship to advise otherwise truely, but in the absence of other information, I would say it's important to promote a good relationship between kids and their father, so let him know you're visiting, etc. But as I say, this is an aside, I truely don't know enough. So sorry if it seems rude, but you were asking.
8d8ejHPfaa	The purpose of a dream catcher is to trap the nightmares before they get to you, not to give them to you.  Your neighbor meant well to give it to you, because you are going through a stressful time right now.  Dream catcher or no, you are clearly going through a time of stress, and regardless of what the dream catcher is there for, there is something you are trying to tell yourself, those dreams will make it through the dream catcher anyway, unpleasant as the prospect may be, because these dreams are there to guide you, they need to be heard either way.<br>  It's tough to offer an interpretation on one symbol, but in one you are drowning, which suggests that you are emotionally over whelmed, in another dream, a dead baby suggests that something important to you has ended in your life.  <br>  One thing that might help you to rest more peacefully is if you take some time to clear your space, and clear your head when you get ready for bed.  There are many ways that you can do this.  One way that you can do this, is you can burn some sage in your room with the window cracked open, or even if you don't have sage, some incense will do, go around the room and see energy that doesn't belong to you leaving the room, pass the smoke of the sage or incense over the dream catcher, and ask it to only allow dreams for your highest good to get through to you.  The reason I say this is that I really don't think the dream catcher is causing you nightmares, but it might help you to feel better to make sure that it's clear of any energies that don't belong to you.  That your dreams are trying to send you guidance, and you view the guidance as a nightmare suggests that you are resistant to the message, or to how it's presented to you.  Perhaps it would help if you try praying for the message to be presented to you in a way that you can understand it better, or pray for solutions to the problems that are causing you stress.  The symbols you posted seem to indicate how you currently feel about your life, but don't offer solutions, only a mirror.  If you try praying for guidance to help you resolve your problems, perhaps you will find some.  Good luck...|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	So get rid of it, you'll sleep better.|`|na2axA4taa	they can make you have nightmares. but if there is alot going on in your life then that can cause the dreams. before you go to bed you need to really relax your MIND and body. thats half the problem with people having bad dreams they go to bed with too much on the mind<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x|`|6GpN0NOIaa	mabey your mind is clearing of all the things its feeling like u said u went through a rough patch mabey your mind is geting rid of them so the dream catcher can take all your night mares away ........but personaly i like nightmares they make me think|`|HsiDiRB5aa	maybe because u <br>  keep thinkin bout nightmares<br>  before u sleep|`|2SzLx5Knaa	heck yes!|`|ag5RiDkFaa	can i have it? haha jk<br>  <br>  they probably call them dream catchers 'cause they catch all the good dreams, leaving you the bad ones...|`|yoeoy6Kgaa	Throw away that dream catcher.

JI7NQ9TNaa	I think possibly because it sounds younger.<br>  Divorced does have a negative connotation---and widowed sounds like he might be on the edge of senility...whereas "bachelor" is a young man who still has his life in front of him.<br>  <br>  Interesting...the way we use language.|`|CT3t80suaa	It could be because they are trying to forget that they were ever married, and so using a word that should only apply to those who have never married may help them to do this.

When Bush came into office, it slipped about $10,000. After 9-11, even more. By the end of Bush's first term, I made under $30,000. For most of his 2nd term, I made under $14,000.

I'm in Minnesota and its been very difficult finding jobs to apply for let alone getting an interview since 500+ other people are applying for the same position.

Unemployment just barely covers my bills so I have to buy gas, groceries, etc. w/credit cards so I'm just digging myself into a hole where I will be in so much debt. But that's what I have to do right now to keep my home, feed my kids and survive. Hopefully things will change soon but Im doubtful.
up010iaraa	I've been where you have been. All I wanted to be was a pilot and passed all the maths/physics, hand eye exams exams got to the medical and had minor colour blindness an can never be a commercial pilot (my dream job). It took me a good long while to get over it and couldn't see the point in doing anything after that. I didn't have a girlfriend, my family understood partly, but not just how much it meant.<br>  <br>  It's not something that will go just like that. My advice would be to do as many things as possible to <br>  a) take your mind off things<br>  b) live a full life and look back and see many things you did<br>  From the outside my life seems pretty good. I'm good at sports, academic, reasonably good looking (even if i do say so myself) and live comfortably.<br>  This summer i'm cycling for charity from top to bottom of the UK. It has given me focus and something to look forward to. I still don't know what I want to do or where i'm going (in life) but have come to terms with it, and now find it exciting (the unexpectedness).<br>  I chose cycling, but maybe you could join some clubs or do some sport (it's meant to help with depression apparently).<br>  I know how you feel (everyone is different but I have a good idea).

Jesus promises never to leave us or forsake us.  He is our comforter, our hope and our blessed assurance.  He gives us peace that surpasses all understanding.  The Lord tells us to take everything to Him in prayer.  Trust the Lord and surrender your life to Him.  Ask the Lord to use you to help others.  Without Jesus people cannot see a purpose to life, but the Bible says that God created us for His pleasure.  God knows all about you and He loves you more than parents, friends or spouse.  You need to know about His love.  Buy a Bible, King James Bible, and read the Book of John which is one of the four gospels.  The gospels are the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  <br>  <br>  God's Word explains to us what is going on in the world so we have nothing to fear.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the answer.

I think of women who get killed because they are raped, they are no longer considered worthy. I think of they children who are taken advantage of. Please do not take on the mind set. There is so much suffering in the world, and while i know you are not living a perfect life (no one is) things could seriously be much worse. The world doesn't revolve around you.

8d8ejHPfaa	Well opinions are like belly buttons, everybody's got one, and I'm sure you can find plenty of those around here :)<br>  A dream is a story you tell yourself, about yourself.  The story is written in a kind of shorthand, instead of words or letters, the shorthand is written in a language composed of symbols.  The symbols are designed to convey large amounts of information in a small space of time.  <br>  Everything you do gets filed away and sorted out at night.  Sometimes you stop and think about some of the things that are filed away there, and a dream can tell you a story about your thoughts and feelings that you have stored away. :)  This is certainly a good place for you to do research, there are thousands of questions about dreams stored away here, and if you do a search for dreams you can find lots of material that people have posted on the nature of dreams and why we dream, and also on interpretations of dreams, where you can see what people think about different symbols.  You may also want to check into some websites like <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com</a> for information as well. Good luck with your project, I encourage you to browse resolved questions here, there is a lot of material you can choose from.|`|AA11951392	Our higher self is aware of and connected with the creative energy of the universe. It uses this energy to get our lives back on track by sending us messages through our dreams. It is because of this higher self that there is no one better than you for analyzing your own dreams. Only you can understand what you need? <br>  <br>  A therapist can look at your life and see from the outside what appears to be the problem, but only you can see yourself from the inside, having full knowledge of all of your personal history and all of your secrets. No therapist can help you if you leave out what could be the most important information of all when trying to deal with a symptom you may be experiencing. You are the only one who knows the full story. <br>   <br>  Our higher self can create images in our dreams in an instant. It can embed symbols inside of dramatic stories, which from beginning to end can have profound meaning for us. The best way to describe this theory is to think of the universe as a large mirror. When a mirror breaks, each piece becomes a mirror in and of itself but at the same time is a piece of the whole. Similarly a drop of water out of the ocean contains all of the same elements of the whole ocean. In other words we are all unique and yet exactly alike and by recognizing patterns in our self, we can relate the patterns to others. <br>   <br>  Dreams have also been described as prophetic or precognitive, actually depicting an event, which has not yet occurred in our time. Skeptics of prophecy have been shocked into belief when they themselves have suddenly experienced a personal precognitive dream. These types of dreams can occur to warn of impending illness or accidents. Sometimes they occur to prepare people for an inevitable death about to occur in the family<br>  <br>  So dreams can be many things for us. They are a gift from the universe. We can go through life ignoring them, or we can use them, pay attention to them, take advantage of them and learn from them. The answers are there for us; all we have to do is look. <br>  <br>  <br>  Love & Blessings <br>  Milly|`|0XcmGUjMaa	A dream is very hard to defined because they are more Kind of dreams.<br>  <br>  The most comonly dream is everyday dreams which are induced in REM activity of brain.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	Changing Your Thoughts to Shape the Life    1. Make an appointment with yourself. Take a morning or afternoon off to think about your life. If this sounds scary to you, this is one of the first places to change your thoughts. This is fun. What you can dream, you can craft a plan to achieve. Find a quiet place with no distractions such as the library, sitting in your bed, or sitting in your car.    2. Daydream. During your appointment with yourself, think about areas in your life in which you want to make a change. Areas to consider:      * Business/Career    * Relationships    * Finances    * House & Home    * Physical Health    * Spiritual    * Leisure    3. Write Your Dreams Down. Write out what you want to change. Maybe there is only one area you want to change. Don't feel like you have to change everything. But if there is something that could improve the quality of your life, write it down. Don't worry about whether it is possible. Assume that anything is possible.    4. The Action Plan. For your top changes, write out some rough plans about how you could achieve those dreams. Break down the long term goal into monthly, weekly and/or daily things you'll need to do to get there.    5. Mentors. Who else has done what you want to do? Who inspires you? What can you learn from that person or those people? How do they think? How do they handle challenges? Write it all down. Let that person serve as a guide to how you work towards your dreams. Seek out these guides even if it is simply by reading someone's book or blog. Ask for help and guidance. You'll likely be surprised to find that when you ask most people will try to find a way to help you. Lastly, remind yourself every day that if your mentor can succeed, so can you!    6. The Reminder Poster. Use your creativity here. The idea is to create a poster of which you can make several copies to hang in key places such as your bathroom, bedside table, kitchen, car and desk. On the poster (any size you want) list your Dreams, your daily action plan, and the thoughts you want to cultivate each day. You can include quotes or other inspiration from your mentors too.Of course feel free to add pictures, color, texture, whatever makes it powerful for you.    7. Gratitude. Take a bit of time each morning to really appreciate what you currently have in your life that is good. In the evening take a bit of time to review your accomplishments and learnings from the day, either in quiet meditation, in a journal, or with someone who supports you. It can be a nice ritual to create with either a spouse, your children, or other person who is important in your life.    8. Believe. Believe in the power of your thoughts. Where there's a will there is a way. To build your will, build your mind through strong empowering thoughts daily. The people who had the thoughts that sparked these achievements listed above, did not let doubt get in their way. And neither should you!    9. Take Action. Your thoughts and plans need to be combined with action to create a result. The focus on your goals and dreams will provide the energy and motivation for taking action. If motivation is lacking, don't wait for it to appear. Take action first and then watch your energy and motivation blossom! Take action on your goals everyday. Make them a priority by working on your daily goals before doing the mundane things of life.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Start with who you want to be and where you want to go and get all your goals in perspective.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	just chnge it|`|KOSuw0Bkaa	Tell your current scenario..First tell about yourself..|`|8mR3Kchnaa	Wow kiddo jeez chill out u gt so many questions ....stop stressing enjoy life as it comes and always think positive...im sure ur still young yet but if u want to change ur life then do things gradually like for example....ur daily routine....make time for new things slowly slowly...think about where u waste ur time....|`|5r3DHtsfaa	identify your mistakes and try to correct them.  be a better person !  change is the first step towards improvement !|`|2tgHzzoeaa	huh? sorry! bt pls explain ur question!!|`|4Rg887H9aa	i dont understand in what sense you want to change your life, if it means you are trying to make yourself a better person it will only start from within or if is about something else be specific as in what you want to change|`|LHMCEUOOaa	Start by explaining yourself, and see where that gets you ;)|`|27MRNeH4aa	Make different choices.|`|OXs0Iq1Aaa	Change yourself then your life will also be changed in a positive direction.
