20090220105241AA2oOta	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why do people who ask questions on Yahoo Answers frequently not bother to select a best answer?	I realize the answers given might not be what the asker was looking for.  I and others have answered many questions on this site and find that after spending a good deal of time thinking and typing about the answer there is not a response...not even "No Best Answer!"  It's as though the person asking the question just did it for fun and was not really interested in an answer.  I find this very irritating.  Sometimes I spend a good deal of time answering the question and then find it comes to a "Vote."  I will still keep answering questions but hope people start to take other's time, that we give up to help, more seriously!

My boyfriend lied to me a month ago about being at his friends' house when in fact he was at a bar. I found out when his friend told me "it was so awesome that night". He doesn't drink(or at least so i think). I was upset and broke up but gave him another chance 2days later.Now i dont trust him at all.. Last night i was home alone (im 19 live with my parents) until sunday so i asked him to stay over but he said he'd rather go home and play xbox with his twin brother and friends(though this was not planned cos his friends and twin play every night and he can join whenever).. Also when i invite him home he says he is to layzy to come over.. Is this normal?? Shouldnt he had rather wanted to spend the night at my place as it isnt always possible..?  PLEASE HELP!

20090220130944AA2wZpE	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Spam & Bulk Mail	Fraud?? Please answer this?	Ok so for quite some time my brother and I both (we're 18 and 20) have been being told my friends that our parents are irresponsible, despicable, sorry excuses for parents. That probably sounds pretty harsh but the reality of it is they're pretty bad.      When I was 18 years old they put an AT&T cell phone in my name for my birthday and made the payments. A few months later they came to me and asked if they could turn it into a family plan with four lines if they continued to pay the bill. I said okay. Well now, they ran up over $2,000 in charges, never paid them and that bill is sitting in collections in my name.      As if that wasn't bad enough, Right before I left for college in 2006 they bought a new car in my name, said it would help build my credit - blah blah blah. I believed them, and surprise surprise it has bitten me in the *** as the car has now been repossessed, making me looking really bad.      There's more... they were paying for my college at a local private university. I took the last Spring semester off to go to London England for awhile and was under the impression I'd be able to return to school when I came back to the states. Well I was wrong. My parents have an outstanding balance to the university for $2,800, which has prevented me from transferring schools, or registering for classes.      Now my mother has decided we're "too poor" and she needed food stamps to buy food. Fine and dandy she some how got approved (most likely because my dad worked for a shipping company that recently went out of business). Now she's decided she wants to convince them she needs more food stamps then she was originally awarded and she wants to tell them that I have moved out. She expects me to switch my bills over to my boyfriends house, so she can say that is where I now live, and collect more money.      Is there anything I can do about this?? I know with everything being in my name it's gonna be hard, but on all the applications my name was used with THEIR income so that has to help somehow right?      Is there anything I can do about this food stamp debacle? I don't think this family needs them at all (and it's not because I am naive and my parents are hiding money troubles from me), and now she expects me to lie about my address to get more.      Does anybody have any advice as to what I can do about all of these issues. I can't take it anymore. I'm almost 21 was in school to become a doctor, and now I can't finish school, I can't move out because my credit sucks, getting a car in my own name is gonna be really hard, I feel like they just made my life a living hell.      As for how my leaving the house will get her more money: when she first applied for food stamps my income was taken into account. So, if I leave the house, obviously I take my income with me, and because she "lost" money by me leaving, they grant her more money. Doesn't make much sense to me either.      To address financial aid: I had financial aid at my original school. What is happening now is, until I get that $2,800 paid off, I can't re-enroll at that school. That outstanding balance also gives my school the right to "hold" my official transcript, meaning I can't transfer to a new school like I wanted to because my original school won't send my grades. I wish I could just apply for more financial aid, but the minute I apply for it, my "old" financial aid report will show up, the new school will see I went to a difference school, and will need my transcript. So basically even financial aid can't help me. :-(      I honestly feel kind of stupid because I trusted my parents. I never would have expected them to pull stunts like this in my name, and if I had known they were gonna pull this crap with my school I would have paid myself. Since I was 6 all I wanted to do was be a doctor and now it's gone.      Thanks in advance, any advice is greatly appreciated!

20090220121409AAs5aTB	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	Yahoo email - sent mail shows as already when i go to sent folder - even if I haven't read it.?	In my Sent mail folder on Yahoo email, as soon as I send an email and go to my sent folder , the email is already "read".       I'm pretty sure it used to always appear unread unless I clicked on it.    In fact some of my older sent messages are still marked unread.      Does anyone know why they would appear as though they've been read if I haven't opened them ?      Is this anything to worry about, and/or is there a setting somewhere to change this so that they do not appear to have been read?

20090220132350AASAqUB	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	How do you change the sender's name in Yahoo mail?	I'm a little ocd mind you, and when I open my mail box in Yahoo mail I am presented with a list of unread messages. Now the thing is I hate to look down the list of sender's and see their email addresses. All these people are already in my contacts, and it would be so much easier if instead of listing their email it would their name.      For example instead of seeing:      1 unread message from gravybaby003@hotmail.com      I'd like to see: 1 unread message from Jules Vernon      You get me? Is there any way I can program my inbox so that it displays the user's name and not email address. It's more organized this way I think.
