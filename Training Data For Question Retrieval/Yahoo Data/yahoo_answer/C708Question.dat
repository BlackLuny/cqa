20090128132243AAsKljO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Work colleague took his own life.  Am I to blame?	To cut a long story short, a friend at work made a drunken mistake at the work xmas party.  He was the centre of gossip at work for the following weeks.        Another colleague asked me if I knew whether the gossip was correct.  I said as far as I knew it was.  She then hit the roof and drove a wedge between my friend and his girlfriend.  She tried as hard as possible to make his life a misery.  He then became so low, he decided to end his life on Monday night.  Such a tragic loss.      The thing is, I now feel as though I am to blame for his loss.  If I didnt mention to my colleague what happened, would this have happened?

20090128135036AAfX3PQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would it be worth it to damage this girl's face?	Okay, so there's this b*tch at my school who will not stop giving me dirty looks. I don't even know the girl personally. All I know is I used to not like her best friend because her best friend used to like my boyfriend at the time (but I got over that and I think she's a nice person now) so maybe that's why she won't stop giving me dirty looks? But honestly, my temper is starting to flare. But if I get suspended for fighting her my i'll get my phone taken away and the school will drop me out of Drivers ed but I already have my permit. Im just wondering if it's worth to beat the living sh*t out of her.          Take in to consideration that I have a short temper. It's taken all of me to not say anything to this girl but it happened again today and I almost knocked her out.

20090128135902AA7YIhS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have a very bad past how can i make it better?	My current girlfriend and I have been on and off for 4 years now.  When we would break up in the past it would be for a week or two but, when we did I would go out and meet a different girl.  During this time I had sex with these different girls.  It sometimes would only be one time but, then at some times it would be just casual.  When my girlfriend and I would get back together I would no longer sleep with that girl again.  (I did use protection)  Now we have been straight for the past year with no break ups no getting into fights or arguments that would cause us to break up.  The problem lies here.  The different girls from my past would see us together now and have a comment to say about what we did or they would give my girlfriend a dirty look.  Now i look like the bad guy in this situation, am I?  I mean we were broken up when this happened and it never happened again so why should she be so mad at me?  I totally understand the whole fact of me having sex with her and then with them and then her again I am putting her and myself at risk but, I stay getting tested and always use protection.  I just don't know why she gets so angry at me even though I have not seen these girls nor spoke to them in over a year.  Any advice???
20090128135327AAaFtZH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need Help with Ex-Girlfriend! Really Confused! Need Advice!?	Hi guys I know this is pretty long but please help me out if you can find it in your heart to aid a really down college student.      I will choose a best answer and dish out points whenever possible      Alright so basically, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up like 3 months ago because she said that she needed time to "grow up". Basically, we decided to still be friends because we really still like each other and get along great. However, I am still very much in love with her.      The problem is that lately I've been feeling really down around my ex and kind of jealous and I don't know why. She's basically perfect at everything. She's very attractive because a lot of guys flirt with her, wears size 00 pants, exercises constantly, her parents are wealthier than mine as she lives in a half a million dollar house and her dad retired at the age of 48, she always gets whatever she wants (material-wise), she makes friends easily, has time to join lots of clubs in college, works as a store model for Abercrombie and has a higher GPA than me while majoring in journalism, and sometimes I feel like she has all of God's blessing even though she is extremely atheist.      However, I am the complete opposite as I always work for what I get. I'm in one of the top 10 business schools in the nation but struggle to maintain a 3.0 GPA and spend most of my time studying, I haven't met very many people in college because I'm trying to save money by living at home with my parents (my ex lives in the dorms which her parents pay for), I spend all my free time at home, I don't find myself as attractive because I've only worked for American Eagle and I am Asian, my parents want me to earn things so I have to work to pay for my clothes and stuff unlike my ex, and lately I've felt like God's deserted me even though I try to follow his teachings.      I just feel crappy to the point that I've been unmotivated to study and I want to sleep all day. I've stopped going to the gym and I have been wallowing in my own self-pity, I'm always wishing that my parents were a lot richer because my ex gets to finish college at her own pace while I'm pressured to finish in 4 while her parents can also afford to let her take summer classes to make her workload easier while I don't have that luxury.      The only thing I feel like I have an advantage over her is that I know how to invest and save my money better than her because she can't save her own money at all. She doesn't even know how the basic definition of a stock or how a credit and debit card work.      Despite all this I feel like God's let me down. Why does he bless people that don't believe in him? Should I stay away from my ex even though I still love her? She is white and we've known each other for 4 years and dated each other for 2 and a half years. Can a relationship with 2 different people like this work out again? Why do I feel this way? I get really jealous because no girls flirt with me at college compared to guys hitting on her. What should I do?      -Please help torn college student
20090128135128AAqCIok	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would you tolerate it if your boyfriends ex kept contacting him?	I just don't know if i'm being too jealous or if this really is crossing the line. He was with her for like 4 years but then they broke up but still remained on good terms and friendly with one another.      I've been with my boyfriend for a year now. At first she would just message him every now and then on Myspace dumb things like "Happy New Year" or somethin. I didn't even really like that too much but I thought "Let me not be too crazy". Well then it became Myspace mail, then it became text messaging, now it's calling him and leaving him messages. She keeps texting him "Call me" , and even invited him to go somewhere with her. WTF?      I left her a message telling her to stop calling him and texting him. It says she read it, but she didn't write back.      To my knowledge he doesn't talk to her. She's the furthest thing from a threat to me in the looks department, but then again, stranger things have happened. Also, he doesn't tolerate me having any male friends either, let alone my ex! My question is if i'm right or wrong and what do I do if she continues to contact him?

20090128135407AAtXzSL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Desperately trying to leave..?	I really want to leave my husband. Everytime we fight he gets physically agressive. Does not hurt me but he pounds things, break things and so on. He does this in front of our child. Also, when he drinks, (which is pretty frequent) he gets really abnoxious. He drinks quite a bit and everytime he does it, I have to put up with his drank ***. I keep telling him that regardless how much he drinks, he still need to act normal in front of our child. But he can't. He is annoying and loud.      He is a student and I don't work. So we don't have any money. There had been so many events that I could remember that I thought of leaving--just never happens. Few times, I spent a night in hotel cause the fight was that bad. He dedicates MOST of him time in school. I feel cheated because he is hardly there for me and my child. His view is that most parenting chores and house chores should be my job 90^ of the time.      I understand that he's busy at school but I wish he can factor me and his family in his schedule. Even when he's at home, he study, study. And when he's not studying, he is either playing video game or drunk.       Today, I attempted to leave. As I was driving away, I checked my purse and my credit card and check book is gone. He took it. He said he won't give it back.      I think this situation that we get into is bad for our child and that is the main reason why I want to leave. I really think it's toxic invironment when our child sees us fighting. Plus, he is ignored by his dad almost everytime anyway.      How can I leave? I don't have any money. My family lives in another state.  I dont have any family here.       I called a cop on him before when he was drunk and cops came and he got scolded and was told to behave. Please help..

It was all over a sleepover birthday party that my friend is having next month.  My mom has never let me sleep over at anyone's house and now i am in 8th grade.

She is saying that I will have to face all the hardships of life by myself and that my dad will take care of me from now on.  IDK what to do.  I am deeply upset by this and would greatly appreciate any support.  Thanks!!!

Her feeling was stronger in the end,   but I to was not completely happy with 'us',  and I would wish for more.  We both wanted to end it, but now I regret it, and wanted to go back.  She refused and told she is happy.    I am not completely happy with myself and insecure/low self esteem about my self, and I think this is what makes me want her back, as well as simply missing her and still like her.  And yet I felt tired of the relationship,  but now I feel terrible and want her back.      Is post-breakup regret natural?

20090128134234AA6GyaZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help emotional overload?	Where to begin...I met my first true love when I was in the 9th grade..hard to believe but yeah it wasn't just a crush. We dated for over a year when suddenly he grew distant and ended the relationship. It broke my heart as I didn't know what went wrong. I heard rumors from his friends that he got scared and I was told to leave him alone. He also wasn't very faithful to me towards the end. Years passed and we did make somewhat amends and started a distant friendship. We've both gone our seperate ways during our lives. He moved out of state for some time, but everytime he would come home, he would show up at my door to see me. Everytime my heart leapt and I had butterflies in my stomache. At one point he moved back and moved in with me and the guy who is now my husband. It was gut wrenching for me living with 2 guys that I loved, but went towards the one I married. Mainly out of fear of being hurt again by the other. We've kept our friendship and see one another occasionally. He's divorced, I'm still married. I can't complain about my marriage to much. He's been great, I love him, he's a great father. I've been content until this past year and a half. I haven't been real happy and we seem to be snapping at each other more easily than we should. Sadly, I have thought about leaving a few times but stay for the sake of the kids. I just recently ran into the other guy and we talked about everything. I didn't mention my problems with hubby though. After all these years we have never spoke of what happened between us and for some reason we finally had our heart to heart discussion. he told me that yes he got scared and ran from me. He could easily see both of us married, kids, ect. but he knew he wouldn't be good for me as he wasn't ready to settle down yet andwe were young. We have both known that we still cared deeply for each other through the years, but never spoke it. Truthfully I never stopped loving him. He's apologized several times for hurting me and is kicking himself. After 2 failed marriages, he's ready to settle down and be loved by the one person he's compatible with and always there for him. He wants me back in his life and promised not to deny me anything. It's so hard as I do love my husband, but something has been missing. I hate the thought of breaking up my family, but I also hate the thought of being where I'm not totally happy. I have time to figure things out as the other would like to finish out his school first before getting too serious and I agree with him. It would of been so much easier if this happened 12 years ago, but he says he wasn't good enough for me yet. He loves me and is making promises of loyalty. I believe him. Love hurts..I'm being pulled in 2 directions and don't know what to think. So confused. Thanks for listening.

20090128140936AAoiB40	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I convince my mum to move to a city 2 hrs away?	I'm 16 years old, there is absolutely nothing for me in this town, my mum has pretty much grown up here. I have already told her how much I want to leave, however she says she doesn't want to. I know it would be hard for her, but because she doesn't want to move I cannot do anything to make my dream come true. I really want to get a job in modeling, and the modeling agency I really want to go to is 2 hrs away.   My mum thinks I should send in my photos to them, but I thought well if they accept me there's no point getting my hopes up because my mum doesn't want to move.   Btw I'm not just hoping I would get into the agency, I believe I have a really good chance because I fit the requirements.   Do you think I should send in the photos anyway?

20090128142630AA8MUBK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she too young for me or am I just making excuses again?	There is a girl I have met through friends and I really like her, the problem is she is only 20 years old. We know each other through friends and get on great, I havent found a girl who gets me like her since I had my heart broken by a friend who became a bit more(she said we were soulmates and we slept together for 2 months) when I was 21, im 28 now. The thing is I think I might be to old for her - I feel really old, like 45, like a parent to all my friends even and am losing my hair and a bit overweight. I am worried what my friends will think of the age gap and what they will say. She is gorgeous and I would never want to hurt her. I am the oldest of 5 children and feel I should be responsible and not ask her out. I have never had a girlfriend and when ive had stuff going on with a girl it has always ended and our friendship ruined. Some of my friends are going out with girls 5 years younger, the most difference is 7 years. She may not even like me, but i think she does, atleast as a friend. Maybe im just making excuses not to get hurt. What do you think I should do?

20090128142945AA9ZVyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS -- My boyfriend proposed marriage; what should I do?	My boyfriend and I have been together for one month. We've been on 14 dates and communicate daily. We've met each other's friends and family and have done lots of different things together. Lots of hugging and kissing but no sex yet.       Earlier this week, he proposed the idea of marriage to me. Not with a ring or anything, but he told me he loves me, that I'm the one he's been waiting for, and that his intention is to marry me.       Believe it or not, this did NOT freak me out. We're both 30-something professionals, previously married, with kids, so we both know what we want. I love him very much and can definitely see us married.       However, I think it's WAY TOO SOON to talk wedding plans. What should I do??

I was in the library I pasted this girl like three times and we keep on looking at each other and her eye seem to dilate. I went to go purchase a book and the female cashier would just look at me and smile. I was walking to my car and I made eye contact with this girl and she just looked at my face as I walked by. I mean I am not ulgy or anything. Its not every girl but its enough to be noticeable

20090128142839AA9lHxs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When should we have sex?	Hey, i know this question is really broad!   But i've been dating this guy for about 2 weeks now and we've both had sex before. Well, i assume he has. We're both 20.    It's just that we seem to be a little shy around each other with affection. Maybe he's worried about coming on too strong and thinks that i won't be ready or something. I'm pretty sure he knows that i've had sex before because i went out with my previous boyfriend for a year and a half. That's pretty obvious, right?   But i don't think it's going to be any different for ages if i don't do something. Should i initiate it? Or will he think i'm far too easy??      It's not that i'm really insecure about it. I'm just not sure if there really are genuinely attractive/athletic guys out there that either haven't had sex before, or who are scared that girls might not want it for a certain period of time after first dating.       Any ideas would be helpful??

20090128141248AAq2S7I	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sorry, i know i have already asked but is the rest of my husbands behaviour towards me, abusive?	I will try to keep this as short as possible, sorry to anyone who read my last question, yes it was very long and i'm sorry if this is too.   Apart from my last questions, my husband whom I love very much, i never seem to feel  good enough for him.   We have been married 16yrs and in all that time, I have never once had any regular money, not even ￡5.00 a week. If I need something I always have to ask and then I get "do you really need it" I just feel so worn down, I just don't bother asking anymore.   My husband has always had a bad temper, as those who answered my last posting will know. To the extent if I say the wrong thing or ask a question, even tried in nice ways to ask, he loses his temper and yes, has hit me sometimes. He doesn't hit me very often but then I normally try not to push him too far.Sometimes though, I don't know what I have done wrong and he will lose his temper. Not a day will go by, when he does not shout at me for something, even if i don't even know what he's going on about, he will still shout and blame me. I know I have problems understanding information sometimes, well my husband agrees too but I love him so very much but I am now to scared to talk to him for fear of setting him off.   He goes on dating sites, yet Denys it and tells me I'm paranoid. He also used his mobile phone but always said he didn't and that's why he would never answer if I tried to get hold of him, he said he didn't use it as he couldn't hear it ringing yet I have seen for myself he has used it. I even answered it once, when it rang at home, yet he does not know this.He has sent pictures of himself to others on the web and is always looking at men and woman and says he does not use MESSENGER, yet I know he does.When I have tried to speak to him about it, he will twist it and say I'm deluded and blame my medication that I have to take, as I'm ill. He will then also get violent so of course I don't bother, just to scared too now. If you read my last post you will know, he hurt me badly, last week. I have never had my own door key, he says the spare key is for me, not that I can use it now as I'm basically housebound due to being disabled. He won't buy certain items when he goes shopping, he says its a waste. Other times, he says he doesn't know what to buy anymore yet if I suggest anything its always wrong.I gave up going shopping with him as I was not allowed to put things in the trolley without his permission and even then he would start shouting at me about the cost. He has his own bank account and a joint one with me. Most of the money that goes into the joint account is mine, yet he will then put money into his personal account to buy whatever he wants. Yes, I smoke and he always says we cannot eat cigarette's. We are comfortable and I don't begrudge him buying what he wants its just all the secrecy. I look at it, as what is mine is he's and vice-versa. He always makes sure the bills are paied etc.He is so very good in many ways. He accuses me of lying all the time and being secretive when I have always been honest and for the most, i'm not even sure what he is shouting at me for .We had a business once and he even thought i stoIe from our own business! When I'm on my lap-top, I have to be very careful, he does not like me using the web.I don't even bother much with it now. I only use my mobile to txt my kids but he will accuse me of being secretive and ask if I'm having an affair. I can't go out without him anyway due to being so ill, yes he is also my carer so i understand he is under a lot of pressure, we have no other family.I know it is very hard for him caring for me 24/7. I always feel guilty for that. He is a really good husband and father and a good man in many ways and is always there for me if i need him and  I know i deserve him shouting at me and even when he has hit me, i have deserved it and i know he is old fashioned in lots of ways and even that i don't mind, in fact it was that that attracted me to him.Yet I'm now to scared to try to even talk to him about anything in case he loses his temper, he don't even seem to care if he starts shouting or threatening me if we do go out! Yet most of the time, i admit even though i try really hard to make him happy, i just don't feel like i ever will. I really love him so very much, he really is everything to me, yet even now, he has said i have accused him of seeing other woman, when i haven't.Even if i thought that, i would be too scared to ask him as i said, he would get angry. All i have ever wanted is for him to be proud of me and make him happy, even considering doing things, that he wants me too, that i hate, just to make him happy.No matter what i do or say he never believes me yet i would never do anything to hurt him, He is a good man and a wonderful father to our children but I know from what he says when he is angry with me, that he has never trusted me fully(sometimes he does praise me and say, he does trust me) and always says I'm lying w

Im 17 and i havent exactly kissed a girl before :P its pretty lame i know, my girlfriend is also kiss-less.  (its not cuz were ugly :P) we havent spent any time together, alone, and we have been together for almost 2 months.  she tells me she feels sick, and that she shouldnt see anyone that day.  (she lives RIGHT next door to me, so its definately not a location issue) she goes shopping a lot with her friends, and we all go to movies, but i want to hang out with her, just the two of us, and have some alone time.  im pretty sure she loves me, she knows i love her, but im wondering if maybe shes scared of this to happen, i have told her i wont do anything that will make her feel uncomfortable, and she said its not that.  i dont know if i believe that she doesnt feel well, she is at a sleepover, she felt fine last night, i text her to see if she wants to hang out, and she says shes feeling sick.  is this normal for teenaged girls, (age 16) or is she just afraid? somebody PLEASE respond, this has been bugging me for a while
20090128141136AACgpHi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ways to get to know him better?	There is this guy in my class, who I can't seem to understand.      He is really quiet and only talks to his guy friends.      I wouldn't say he is a loner but he is usually by himself at lunch/break. I actually prefer being on my own that way too so I don't really judge. The friends I have really aren't enough for me. I don't know anyone there that I genuinely get on with (I have started a new college so barely know anyone that well). He is a simple guy, smart, and likes to keep to himself but that his made me even more curious about him.      His demeanour has totally captivated me, I just really want to get to know him better. But this seems impossible. If I try to talk to him, he gives one word replies and doesn't even hold eye contact (he always looks away or fidgets) the only thing that seems to imply he is interested is when we are sitting at our desks.      He is two rows front of me, and his body is always edged to the right [easier to see me and this girl next to me] also when the teacher asks us a question to do with our personal lives, he always looks back directly at me for a second to see if my hand is up or not. I like to think that he wants to know more about me but is this me getting too carried away?  He laughs at my jokes [that sounds really lame when typing it up] and only interacts if there are other people around.      I really like him but have no idea why. He is the one person that I can't figure out and is a complete mystery to me. No-one has ever done this, I am usually very good at reading people.       It's not a relationship that I want to directly get into, but friendship. I want to know what he is all about before I delve into anything serious (thats if he wants to, of course) but right now this seems impossible.      Any ways that I can get to know him better? Don't want to be too full on, as he is shy and reserved.

I confronted my wife about a possible affair she was having, i was hearing rumors about her with another man at the bars. We are 27yrs old and been together for 8yrs total, married for 4. We have 2 kids, 5yrs and 1yrs and i gave her the option of sticking around and working it out. Except she doesn't communicate very well, but our home life is great.  Since i confronted her we haven't had sex, about 30 days which is off from our usual once a week, whats wrong with her or me. Plus, she refuses to wear her wedding rings because they don't fit and hurt her fingers, does this happen or is it an excuse?  What do i do?

20090128142535AASP3WC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a guy acts like this?	I like a guy from my bus stop, he didnt used to notice me, but i realised he was on my facebook since he went to my old school in the year above .. and weve been speaking quite alot.    He does seem intrested and i cant be bothered to write out cute things hes said but he told me in pretty and he likes my hair, and hes said things like 'snuggly movie nights are the best' after we was speaking about watching films. and flirts.  also he said ''hopefully il see you sooon xxxxx' and he was at the bus stop the next day and we rode the bus together and chatted.  and the next night in town we walked past each other and went to stop but we couldnt because we was with friends .. and when we got home he said 'dam i wish i stopped'  Also its very rare that i see him at the bus stop because we go to different colleges so i cant see him to get him to like me and get to know him more :(    On the other hand, i feel like he isnt intrested at times , for example i gave him my number on facebook and he didnt give me his, i had to ask after. i know that makes it seem like he doesnt like me but why he so sweet to me (and hes not a player honestly, i can remember him from my old school hes a proper nice lad).  and sometimes he doesnt speak to me that much or takes ages to reply, also normally i have to speak first.    what should i do, not speak to him?
20090128141142AA2a3vs	Family & Relationships;Family	Need advice about spouse quitting smoking?	Recently, our toddler started pretending she was smoking a cigarette (with a lollipop stick). My wife smokes, but does not do it in front of the children.       However, they're smart. They know she has a weird smell sometimes (cigarette smoke). How should I approach my wife on quitting without sounding preachy or like a jerk? She's smoked over ten years now, so I know it will be hard.      Additional information: I used to be a smoker as well, years ago before marriage and children. I quit and know how difficult it is. I also know it's something a person will only do if they want to.       Thus, maybe it's not my place to say anything. I just want to (1) make sure my wife is around for all of us, and (2) not setting a bad example for our children, even though she is being very cautious in not doing it in front of them.      Any advice?

20090128142934AA4wK5z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do when the guy I like is way out of my league?	I never get "crushes" on guys. I never say yes when someone I barely know asks me out. I have only liked one other guy my entire life. (That doesn't mean I haven't "lusted" anyone before! haha...) And it never worked out (I fell in love and got over it after two years...). I've fallen really hard for this guy I've known since elementary school (I'm now about to graduate high school) but we kind of parted ways during middle school. But now we are sort of reconnecting, getting to know each other again. But I think he still sees me as that "kid" he knew from when he was little. He's beautiful, sweet, funny, and everything else I love about a guy. And me? I'm short, clutzy, and I talk to much. I don't want to ruin our friendship but when I fall for a guy (at least from what I know), I fall hard. What do I do? It seems like I never can have what I want, that I'm not good enough. He's completely out of my league, but I'm falling for this guy. HARD. I don't WANT to get over him either. I just...don't know what to do.

20090128141539AA5Vk7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Arguing in a long term relationship?	Okay, I know arguing is normal in a relationship, and all couples do it.  But it seems like for the past month and a half, that has been like all we have done.  In some ways it has brought us closer, like we know how we argue, and we are going through the hard times together as well as the good times.  But a lot of times I end up just feeling really upset.       We both love each other very much, and this is obvious even when we  are arguing, because we will say I love you, even when we are both upset/aggrivated with each other, and we do say I'm sorry and we do mean it.  And we both know that no matter what, we love each other and want to be with each other forever.  And after the argument, we both make up and all, but its like a continual cycle of arguing/making up/discussing something/then back to arguing.      But even still, it feels like our relationship has taken a sudden sharp turn.  We used to argue, yea, but not as much as we do now, and we weren't as irritated as we are now.  Its about 7.5 months into our relationship, and the last month and a half, we all the sudden are fighting all the time.  I stop and try to figure out what changed.  We are in a long distance relationship, so is any of that finally really impacting us, where it hasn't before?  Or has it just been that the 6 months before were like the "honeymoon stage" and now that we are past that, it is a normal thing, the way we are acting now?      I know it is not because we are bored with each other, and when we do get to see each other, we rarely argue, and I know that we love each other now more than ever.  I am not afraid or having doubts about us, but I just wonder what the change is.  And also, how to handle all this arguing.

He talks to me everynight on the phone for an hour or 2, but does'nt take much time to hang out with me because he is busy with his new groupd of older senior guys. Hoping he will change when they leave for college i need to wait another couple of months, so i want to tell him im loosing intrest because we dont hang out. Do you think this will make him miss me and want me more, or make him mad, and want me less?

I'm 18 (obviously) and my boyfriend and I have been talking about getting engaged for a while.  We both know it's going to happen soon, and I'm just worried about my parents' reaction when I tell them we're engaged.  I think my mom will be especially upset because she's one of those college educated "liberated" women who didn't get married until her 30s.  I'm pretty sure she'll tell me I'm making a mistake and throwing my life away on "some guy"      How do I explain that I love my bf and he is also my best friend who I want to spend the rest of my life with?  It's not like we're getting married and making babies right away, we both know he needs to get a better job  and I need to finish at least a few years of college first.  (I'm a senior in high school).      I don't think my dad will be overly upset but my mom has been trying to make choices for me my whole life, and for the most part I've let her.  This is the one choice I really don't want her to make for me.

20090128140619AAJnTNo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can I ask for sole physical custody of my child and still keep her visitations with her father?	I need to go back to court to modify an existing order that I have in California with my child's father.  We currently have joint legal custody and joint physical (my daughter stays with me and visits her dad every other weekend).  I agreed to this hesitantly in mediation because he hadn't been around and decided to try and see her only because I filed paperwork asking for sole custody and his family pressured him.  We made the agreement that we would share legal if he showed himself responsible but he hasn't been.        I'm modifying the order to sole legal for me and was wondering if it was possible to ask for sole physical custody as well but still keep his visitation schedule the same.  Like me having custody of her and him only having visitation rights.      He hasn't had a job in a year and won't look for one, hasn't paid child support in 11 months, won't let me take my daughter out of the county even to visit my family or go on vacations and has just been a pain in my rear end.  Is that possible or are my only options sole physical only or joint physical?  A lawyer is out of the question at this point since I am having financial difficulties but I don't want to keep her from seeing her dad either since he's made an effort to try and see her on his weekends and she likes going.

I am 30 and married, I grew up in New Orleans poor but not dirt poor, I went to school and got a good education at one of the best schools! I am an RN and I married rich, but he was not rich in the beginning,so...   he got a good education and inherited 3.7 million dollars.....      because of this my family think that I should be taking care of them, I bought my mother beautiful five bedroom house, a car and I give her 3500.00 dollars a month, I pay all of her bills(all), I have two brothers in which I bought houses and cars for, for example: there houses are 3bdrms, 3baths, one cost 195k and my oldest brother house cost 235k. The cars I bought were dodge chargers because that's what they both asked for + I send both of them 500.00 per month just to help them out.       I have not bought any other family members houses and cars because there not my mother or my brothers! but they are always calling me when they get into debt and at christmas time I give everybody gifts.      anyway...

20090128142311AADCXYE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Fiance Visa Question?	So, I met a girl over seas and she's coming here here on a work and study type of visa.  Been dating for a while, and we've discussed marriage quite often and wanted to marry when she comes here.  I've sent a few emails to some other sources but wanted to see if anyone had any personal knowledge to share.  Is it possible to obtain or change her visa to a fiance visa while she is here? or just to marry and have her citizenship taken care of? Don't let me down, Yahoo-peeps.

A friend of mine is trying divorce his wife but he is worried that because of the alimony he may have top pay that he is just going to have to stay married to her. She does not work, won't get a job, doesn't have her license, and iso$900 worth of medication per day due to being morbidly obese. He was working for a company for 18 years but recently had a situation that caused him to lose his job and he is no longer employed. My question is, how is alimony going to work in a situation like this? Is he going to have to pay? How long does alimony usually last?
20090128091941AAr1hPo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you force yourself to love someone?

As I'm in the early stages of planning, I am thinking more and more about having a Hawaiian destination wedding. I'm a little sad, though, because although I know my finance and I will enjoy it very much, some people will not be able to afford to go.

Would you be upset if you couldn't attend a destination wedding and it was someone like a close cousin or a niece, for example?
20090128145358AANGGwN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what do i do now? Is this a good thing and am i right?! (GIRLS ONLY)?	Alright well, last night i went to the BB game for my school. I wasnt there to watch it but more to just be at the candy stand and make money, lol. But anyway, i mainly went to ask out this girl cause i knew shed be there and that didnt happen (dammit). So i saw the girl there that i wanted to ask out, i kept glimpsing at her every now and then and then her friends noticed i was there (double dammit). So they just came over to the table whre me and a couple of friends were at quarter break and started to randomly talk to me. They said "so what u doin here?" "i answered like i have to for w/e reason." Then they said, "So hows the love life", and i sorta locked up cause at that moment, she started to come over while they were askin me questions like that. I answered nervously cause im SHY if i have to talk with more ppl than just the gril i like. I said "pretty fine" ( icouldnt think of anything else to say). Then they were like what gum should we buy (thats the part of the table i had control over and of course the girl i like came over and couldnt pick. They said they wanted some so i went like, well i got some if you want it and they took it and switched it with the gum oack the girl i like had. They also said, "and well take this piece of gum and give it to Dominique, the girl i like. Then they gave back my gum and left. And i was left sortof, confused.       Then they came back again later playing a game and taking her shoe and they gave it to me. They made me take it so i just held it, and she walked over with a "sorta puppy dog look like can i have it back" So i i was about to hand it back but her friends took it away again and kept playing the game.       Both of these times, i couldnt stop lookin at her eyes and smiling ( alittle smirkish kindof smile) and she always was looking at me (she like never looked away, surprisingly). I liked it but it made me nervous.   P.S.- she knows how i feel about her already but i really dont know how she feels.       Is what they did a really good thing? Is it a good idea to just ask her out? And, we havent really talked much at all, im shy around her, so yeah. Im comfortable with her but am not able to talk easily. This was also like the longest convo we had almost face to face and sorta alone.      What am i suppose to think of all this? Is it a good idea to ask her out? Im guessin she likes me enough for it to be a good idea, am i wrong? IDK IM REALLY CONFUSED (havent had a gf b4 so yeah)      Im 14 btw.

20090128143347AAjij6o	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Ring Stuck!  HELP!?	The last time I got my wedding ring off I weighed the same as I do now. Since the last time I got my wedding ring off, I gained and lost 40 lbs. It has been about a year since the last time I got it off.      Now, no matter how cold or slippery I get my hand, my wedding ring won't come off. It is almost as if my finger fat has shaped itself oddly around my ring.      I'm continuing to lose weight and diet. I DO NOT! want to get ring cut off. I am wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them or knows of additional things I can try to get it off. Once it's off, I intend to give my finger a couple of weeks to adjust before deciding about getting my ring resized.

So...my 14 year old bro decided sunday @ church 2 tell Chad,a guy we're friends w/ (actually,a guy I used to like) that I like a guy from Chad's school (we shall call said guy Jake).Chad and I used 2 b pretty close friends over the summer--I'd see him 2 to 3 times a week at youth functions.Now,we don't talk much...He doesn't even say hi to me(and I don’t go out of my way to say hi to him).He called me on Xmas eve and we talked for almost 20 minutes,but since then he hasn't said much 2 me.But I catch him looking/staring at me @ church,and sometimes he will like come up to me with random stuff 2 say ("is that your little sister's full name or a nickname?", "I have 8 sets of keys to my truck",etc)    Anyways,sunday,I was embarassed after my bro told him bout Jake,but Chad just looked at me (he can be pretty stoic when he wants) and was like, "How do YOU know Jake?" I told him.After that, he walked off and I glanced at him and caught him looking at me again from across the room .Then he walked back up 2 talk 2 my bro again but he wouldn't talk 2 me at all.Like almost ignored me.SOOOOO.....DOES IT SOUND LIKE HE'S SAD I DON’T LIKE HIM ANYMORE? DOES IT SOUND LIKE HE LIKES ME AND THAT'S WHY HE ACTED WEIRD AFTER THAT?Was he jealous?Chad and I are both 17,btw.

20090128091001AAJTCgK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it all of my life, 52yrs?	people have always told me, " You'll find someone. There's someone for everyone. "  I'm not sure, but it seems more and more lately I am entertaining the thought there is just no such thing as love for some people.      So you know: to me love is a familiarity with someone of the opposite sex, so deep you not only have compatibility with that person, you easily overlook their shortcomings as they do for you. It is not only that feeling of warmth and contentedness, it is the void you feel when they aren't there.      I wish it were there but I think I am lost on the concept. Thanks for all the good answers and the smart alec answers too. The smart alec ones because it helps me in avoiding the jerks in life.
20090128143723AAjZaER	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is it that even though death is expected, it still hurts?	My grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson's & Alzheimer's about 5 years ago, and placed in a nursing home.  Toward the end, he didn't know anyone, couldn't care for himself, feed himself, and was generally miserable, and was in pain ALL the time.      When the home called today to tell us that he had passed away, at first I was grateful that his suffering was over, but then the grief kicked in.  I know in my heart of hearts it was the best thing, and that he is no longer suffering, but WHY does it still hurt?  We had accepted his eventual death a while ago, especially when he started to really go downhill.  I just don't get it.

20090128093408AAzhOm0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone pass on some advice about how to back off a bit from him?	I am 18 and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 16 months now. I need some help or some words from anybody to cheer me up.      My boyfriend and I talk on the phone 3 times a day at the most and we text one another a lot. These last couple of weeks... I've just felt like he's not interested in talking to me. And I know he's not cheating on me and he hasn't lost interest in me or anything like that. I love him more than I can say.      To sum it up, he's a complete geek but not one of those overly obsessed geeks. He loves Star Wars and Stargate SG-1. He plays Halo and COD 4 constantly. Not to mention that he's in a clan on Halo.      But he's also an amazing guy who cares really cares about me and loves me more than anyone or anything. I'm his world. Unfortunately, he brought up the fact that I call and text him too much...      I just need some good, honest advice on how I can back off a bit. I want him to have his space and over the last year, I've taken up most of his free time. It's hard for me to be away from him for even a weekend. Does anyone have some advice on how I can control my "need" to be around him and call him constantly? Thank you to everyone who answers! You'll be helping me quite a bit. =]
20090128094208AATza30	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me... confused still?	Ok so few months ago (just before christmas i think..) This guy in my science class who i sit next to i think started liking me... it was non uniform day and i wore kinda a low top, but not to revealing and my skinny jeans... anyhow he never really sat two close to me untill that point.. but then we did this test and i thought i got a B but he saw my score (he was obviously looking at me then... and my paper ) and said you got a A , and smiled really cutely! :} Was he just being nice?? So we moved science groups, like you do in year10.. but we were still sat together, (was so happy lol :) ) and ever since then he's been sitting closer to me.. and not this other girl who is alot better looking than me (she sits inbetween us) he doesn't talk to much but he's one who has quite a cute soft voice and kinda shy i think ! Lil like mee... :] Few days ago the girl was asking him questions on the subject and he looked over towards my book, moving my elbow slightly.... :}} Smiles and tells the girl the answer and the other girl goes hey that's cheating! He just looks at me.. Also!!! (there's lots, sorry!!) When we have to move closer to the front in class he always sits next to me , and even if i sit next to him he doesn't say anything, moan or any of that's what guys normal do with me.. :( )But then when we walk out the classroom, and he's with his friends its as if he doesn't even notice me... :( So does he like me?!!?!? Oh we're both 14..      But a few days ago, we had to go to a different room, and sat the row behind me (we all sat with our friends) and did this discusting thing.. he was burping and blowing the smell towards me!!! :( Why would he do that?? Am soo confused right now. He was with his friends so was he just trying to show of to them? But if he likes me then why would he do that? :(      Then last week one of the science teachers (we have two science classes, we're both in the same one, just only sit together for one class) said that instead of having her and the other teacher that we'd be having just her because they've changed the router or something, so i kinda felt upset because it ment i wouldn't be sitting next to him, i looked across the room at him and he just had his head down and looking sorta upset i think too.... but i don't know ?? I always feel safe when i'm with him... :( i really like him but i don't know if he likes me... this is what i look like if it helps? i'm not that pretty...           http://www.picoodle.com/getcode.php?url=...     http://www.picoodle.com/getcode.php?url=...     http://www.picoodle.com/getcode.php?url=...     http://www.picoodle.com/getcode.php?url=...       Yesturday me and my friends were standing near the radiators (about 6of us)and his group of friends almost opposite us, they then randomly started pinging elastic bands at us, but noone notice apart from me! I just looked over to see it was then and then caught this guy i like's eye for like less then a second. Then we walked off... today in science we had to move places for this test but the guy i like moved so he was facing me but at the side(if that makes any sence?) so he could see one side of me. And throughout this little test he was just randomly saying things not to loud but loud enough for some people to hear and i don't know if he was doing it so i'd look at him or not? Confused?! Tomorow i have double history with him but he sits other side of the room from me and i can bearly see him, but we have a break in the middle, should i try and do something or not? Help me!! does he like me or is he just being a normal guy?
20090128100021AA0mTuM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is anyone else like this too?	Theres this guy i really like at my college.

This semester i don't have any classes with him, though i still see him around all the time because we live on the floor and we say hi when we see eachother.      it seems i don't know what to do so i just ignore him other than saying hi..      and i don't want to bug him if he doesn't really like me  but i don't want to ignore him if there is a possibility of him liking me...       i feel like an idiot!... if anyone feels like their an expert and would like to chat with me let me know ... i am so confused

20090128095726AAjXzea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has anyone ever went on a lunch date and....?	brought the left overs to your significant other? I did once, a long time ago. She took me to Red Lobster, and I ordered what my girl liked to eat, and only ate a little bit. Then I brought the left over to here. She worked late so I could not take her to dinner. Has anyone else done that before?

You see my parents are wealthier than my family members and when they come over to my house they make snide remarks about my mom giving away too much!

20090128092918AAmRCK3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like her or me!? What's he thinking!? Help please!?	Ok, there is this guy I ike and everyone said he liked me back so I was pleased! BUT, when he found out other people knew, he started to blank me and was really nice to my friend. I was quite upset and so I told my friend what I was thinking - that he fancied her. She was really nice about it but also clearly fancied him (although she wouldnt admit it) and so I told another friend what I thought as well. But, the guy we like found out what I had told her and he started to blank my friend who I thought he liked and was really nice to me! Its kind of back to normal now, but he's being really nice to me and is spending quite a lot of time with me. And he seems a bit awkward around my friend still.   So:   1. Who does he like - me, her, neither, both!?   2. What should we say to him if he likes her or me?   3. Should i just carry on as normal or tell him how i feel about him?   4. Will one of us going out with him ruin our friendship?   5. Any other suggestions!?   Thanks everyone! :D.
20090128143453AAyuqIh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Feeling like...well a loser?	I have a good number of friends, but not that many. I only have 3 best friends, but im happy with that. The popular girls in my school are really nice, but they still dont talk to me.   So anyways, today, this popular guy goes HEY!! (to me) NO ONE LIKES YOU!    And he was serious.   So it made me wonder, what if no one REALLY does like me??? So my question is, how can i make myself seem more friendly, and friendable?? What would describe as the perfect personality for a 14 year old girl to make girls and guys alike want to be my friend?

20090128143348AAhMEwd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about my ex gf intentions/word (WARNING REALLY LONG xD)?	so my girlfriend broke up with me on saturday night her reason was because she didn't have enough time because of swimming(she really doesn't have enough time) because of not having enough time she wasn't treating me right.  i cant say that it didn't bother me not having enough time to talk to her and hang out but i was content with it especially since she only has a month left.  her last reason was just that she doesn't want a boyfriend right now and she's pretty much sticking to that now.  she still wants to be friends which im cool with because we really do enjoy talking to each other.  anyways sunday we talked a lil and i was maybe suspecting that she was just lieing about the whole situation so i wouldn't feel as bad and the break up would go smoother so we could still be friends. so i asked her.  btw she said in no way is it my fault and she promissed that. which idk for sure if she is lieing i dont think she is but not 100% sure  n so i texted her "is their any other reasons your broke up with me and don't want to go out right now? if you dont tell me and i find out their is im going to be really dissapointed. p.s im really not trying to be mean i just need be sure"  and her response was.  " its not that i dont like you i really really do like you alot. its just i dont want a boy friend right now :/"   this ******* confused me but i told her  "okay thats all i needed to know im content as long as your not lieing which i dont think you are"  her response  "its a good thing i dont lie about these sort of things"  im still ******* confused like no other.  we texted monday she messaged me a ":)" after she got out of swimming so she either just did it because she is used to texting me right after swimming or because she was still thinking about me. idk  but today she didn't text me at all so idk hmm  i cant remember when exactly but it might have been a lil after the break up i texted her "if you ever change your mind let me know" she said she'd see what her schedule looked like after swimming.     im planning on asking her sometime idk when maybe a week or 2 but i was going to say something like" so is their any chance that we'll be going out again if not tell me now so i can just get the thought out of my head. ill still be cool with being friends no matter what your answer is"    im pretty sure this is probably longer then some of the english essays i've written so thanks for taking the time to read it.    what im asking is basicly your comments on this and if you have ever had someone lie so the break up would be smoother.  if your wondering i really did like her a lot i still do but its getting less and less the more i think about us not actually being together. at first it drove me crazy thinking that we wouldn't be considered bf/gf anymore. but now its like i can move on and its only been like 3 days i just wanna know what her final answer really is.  so like i said i just kinda feel like having peoples comments i really like coming on yahoo answers to just kinda talk it helps me think and express my feelings =D  btw i did ask her some things like if i was interesting she said yea and how much she was into me she said 8/10 and if she really was still into me and she said yes. idk though i dont think she is leing i really hope she isn't . i know for sure i'd be really mad if she was. especially if she started going out with another guy. not that fact that she's dating someone else it would be the fact that she didn't tell me thats why she broke up with me  again comments thanks for reading my book xD    btw we're 16 im really down about the break up anymore honestly im fine with it now im just ******* confused. haha
20090128144844AAojEt6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if this girl likes me?	I'm not trying to be big-headed. just thought i'd get that out      What sucks is i'm a guy with a really good friend. This friend has a sort of girlfriend. The problem is i think she might like me, and i admit i might have a crush on her. Am i in the wrong here?   Out of the corner of my eye I notice she often glances at me. She greets me warmly, and we're actually close enough that some assume we are a couple.   We are sometimes shy around each other, but i really don't know.   How can i know?   and what about my friend?

20090128144316AAlRLry	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was My Ex-Bf's Message Directed Toward Me or Not??? ADVICE?	My ex-boyfriend of 4 years said all these sweet things to me. During the summer time we agreed to be in an open relationship because I'd be in Germany the whole time.      He meets this player girl. They never had sex, but fooled around. His friends have made comments about how she was never dedicated as much as I was.      We broke up because I kissed another guy while drunk at a party. I apologized but still isn't talking to me. He got into a second relationship, not w/ the player girl, and they broke up because he wanted to be with the player girl. They're still not together.      He isn't talking to the player girl at the moment because his friends say he feels she is rejecting him. On my aim status I have: "I am sorry." His aim status reads: "I will never forget you, I can't."      I don't know if this message is directed towards me or the player girl?      He is still chasing her btw.      I am so hurt, my heart hurts so much.      ADVICE?

20090406102852AAAtWeQ	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I confront this empty-headed idiot?	My adult niece is my heart.  She is married to an alcoholic, controlling idiot.  I support her and their 3 children however I can emotionally.  I go to all  the children's events, tutor one of them, etc., etc., just trying to work around the abusive jerk of a dad they have and be there for them.        I realize there is nothing I can do to convince my niece to leave the abusive relationship.  They've been together for 12 years. I just try to be there. I'm civil with this jerk as much as I can be and I avoid confrontation for my niece and the children's sakes.      Anyway, this past week my niece has been sick.  When her symptoms persisted from Tuesday through Saturday I offered to send her some Immodium.  My son went to the drugstore and purchased it and took it over.  He also drove his cousin to an event just to make things easier for the family.  Yesterday, when I called to check on my niece again and she was no better I insisted that she go to the ER.  My son and I drove her so her hasbeen could stay with the kids.  We sat in ER over 6 hours before they admitted her for severe dehydration and to find out the cause of the gasteroenteritis she has been suffering.     This morning the azz called and said the doctor told them the Immodium was the cause of her needing to go to the hospital.        I don't believe that for a minute.  I did look up the side effects and it does say that the product can cause nausea and stomach pain, but that is rare.  Perhaps the doctor told her it had been ineffective or that it may have increased her discomfort, but I really doubt he said it caused the gastroenteritis she's had for almost a week now with stomach pain, vomiting and diarreah.        I'm just fuming right now.  I love my niece and would never intentionally harm her.  The azz knows that, but can't help himself when he has any opportunity to administer a dig of some sort.      I'm thinking I need to call him back and let him know how hurt I feel.  I won't tell my niece because she is so tenderhearted and wouldn't say anything to hurt anyone.  This would just distress her while she is sick.        What do you advise?

20090406093457AA5iepZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why are people so concerned with having the "big" wedding?	I have read so many questions on here about people who want to go to the courthouse and get married, then at some later time have the big wedding ceremony with the reception, etc.  Everyone has their reasons for wanting to do it this way, whether it's financial, insurance, pregnancy, they got married in a hurry due to a deployment, whatever.  But I don't understand this need to have the big wedding with the friends present after they are already married and have been for at least a year.  If you want to have a party to celebrate your marriage, then have a party/reception, but don't decide one, two, three years after you actually got married to wear the princess wedding dress and have your father give you away.  To my way of thinking, once you're married, you're married.  And it's not about that one day, it's about the rest of your lives.  I'm not trying to be mean or make people angry, I just don't understand this.  Can someone please explain why people think they need to do this?

20090128092137AADPJ59	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Older man has taken possession of me?	At New Year my parents had a big party and invited a lot of people over. I am 19, so had had a few drinks which made me feel sexy and flirty. I had noticed a friend of my fathers who is 45 checking me out, he is not very handsome so I thought I would give him a thrill and decided to tease him with my body by sitting on his lap and showing him little flashes of my body. I was enjoying the effect I was having on him when he suddenly turned the tables on me. He started whispering really filthy things in my ears and began touching my p*ssy, and to my shame he had very quickly fondled me to orgasm. Since that night I have been meeting him secretly for sex several times a week and I worry that I have become addicted to him. He is very rough and dominating with me but I find myself doing whatever he asks with pleasure. I don't understand what is happening to me or between us but I am totally in his thrall and the sex we share is all consuming for me. Outside the bedroom he is very sweet to me but still very much in control.       What happening to me and what should I do?

I want to make love with her but I'm afraid of the law seeing me as statutory rape. I think she want to make love with me too. My girlfriend is getting really depressed that I didn't make love with her. I want to show how special she is to me.

20090128094007AAMZ2QR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why would my friend say she wants to get married?	One of my friends constantly talks about wanting to marry her boyfriend, whom she's been in a relationship with for about 2 years. Problem is that I have long suspected that she cheats on him. These suspicions were confirmed recently, after finding out about her being intimate with one of our groomsman from our wedding (she was a bridesmaid), as well as a night before that she was intimate with another guy who was there for the wedding. *We were all in Las Vegas for 4 days for my destination wedding on the 17th of this month.* After I got home from my honeymoon in Aruba, I spoke with her on the phone. I didn't bring the cheating info up with her, but she yapped on and on about how our wedding made her picture what her's will be like with her boyfriend. Apparently, he even moved in with her the day she got back from Las Vegas! I don't think it's my place to tell him what I know (as well as a lot of us know), but I just can't believe she talks about wanting him to propose to her!! We are all in our 30's, so it's not like we're teenagers, but she's taking the beauty of marriage and spitting all over it, I feel. What should I do? If you were me, would you say something to her...like let her know of her bad behavior? Would you let her boyfriend know what's going on?  *Her bf didn't come to Las Vegas, because he had to work. She kept saying that b/c he wasn't going to be there that "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".

20090128093640AApUGec	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about a girl?	Okay, I've sort of been seeing this girl for a little over a month now. She's been really hot and cold, she seemed very into me the first night we met. Then sometimes when we hang out she seems way more reserved and distanced.      I saw her last Saturday and she was basically all over me, then we didn't talk for a few days and the next time I saw her we didn't even touch at all, and she seemed stand offish. It's since been a few days since we've talked and I dont know if I should call her or text her or something. Or should I just wait to hear from her? I don't like to throw myself at people.      Plus I don't know if it makes a difference but she as a 2 year old daughter. Her daughter is really sweet and seems to like me a lot. I'm just not sure if she's hesitant to get involved because she has a kid?
20090128093205AARiO4W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing guy...help!?	Last year, there was this guy and he knew me, but we had never talked. I would always see him staring at me and smiling, and sometimes he would even fix his hair. But I never talked to him, and I really liked him. This year he just stares at me with a blank face. And I talked to him once and he was a complete jerk. Everyone says he's like the nicest kid ever and never says stuff like that. But why is he doing this? I still really like him.
20090128091851AADaHIv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What makes a good wife?	Alright, so this can be controversial, simply because it implies in order to be a 'good wife' you have to be lacking in independents or individuality.       Before I go further, this question has a bit of a story to it, so please read it if you feel like it, or move on if you don't.      I recently married my husband after a 3 year courtship and I feel as though my judgments as a woman and as a wife are impaired due to the complete lack of a feminine wisdom in today's generic western culture.       Mother's hardly ever speak to their daughters about being a good wife; friends fear speaking to their friends about their marriage and how live their lives in love; the age of shame on identifying yourself as a good wife is upon us.       I feel as though women have lost their tenancy to stick together, to breed positive feelings about the many roles of a woman, to come together in a community and support one another. Not only do women suffer because of this, but so do the divorce rates, so do children, and so do men.       I've always known in my heart that my life's goal is to be the hearth tender of my family. To be a strong, loving and supporting woman who defends, upholds, protects and forgives.       However, I find I'm the abnormality. When I married my husband, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life building a legacy of love around us. Strangely, this came about because of a funeral. My husband's grandmother passed away. Her and her husband came from a remote northern village where women were still the backbone of their families and weren't afraid to be both strong, and a nurturer. At her service, I didn't  only cry for the loss, but cried because I wish I had a chance to learn more from her. The wisdom of a woman who didn't fall to the times had gone with her.      My question to you is: What really makes a good wife? How is a woman to know how to lead her family when such examples are rare and inconsistent?      Please, pass on the knowledge of what you find to be an integral part of a wife. I'm truly interested in what is out there.

20090128143457AABSqK0	Family & Relationships;Weddings	He asked me to marry him but at that very moment I thought of my high school sweetheart?	I was married for twenty years. through out that miserable marriage I often wondered how my highschool sweetheart did in life. After I separated from my spouse I found him but he had just began a relationship with someone he really liked. I moved on. I met someone. We have now dated for three years. He loves me and treats me better than the relationship I had with my ex. He does have his neg. traits though...like not paying attention when I am talking. His life seems to always be more important than mine and when I am sick he seems to always be sicker. He is a big baby basically. Plus his mother hates me and refuses to allow him to marry me or if he does then she will never speak to him again.       So, the day he asked me to marry him...instead of thinking yes or no immediatly...I thought about David. I ended up saying yes but still, I think of David all the time.       last night I wrote David and told him I was getting married but was unsure of whether or not it was the right thing to do. I didn't tell him I was interested in him though. He gave me great advice...doing the pro and con thing and then said that him loving me was not good enough that I had to love him just as much or I was making a mistake for both of us.   He also let me know that he was going through some decision making himself with the woman he was with. Not that he was eluding to anything but still I heard the click.      Anyway, should I break off the engagement and should I tell my high school sweetheart how I feel?...which really is nothing except that I think of him.

I've been single for 18 months now - to tell the truth i've never actually had a proper relationship more than 8 weeks on only been with 2 guys so kinda lost al confidence when it come to men!      There's this 1 guy that i used to text loads etc, now he's got a serious gf but everytime we see each other (usually drunk) it's extremelly awkward cos he says stuff like "If i wasn't with ********* i'd be wit you" and always jokes with his botheres (who i'm also friends with) about how he fancies me.  I also make a habit of falling for guys out of my league!      So generally with all that put together i'm totally fed up with men but then at the same time want a boyfiend.  any tips!!

20090128144635AAUfg7J	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I say sorry to a good friend who absolutely hates me?	Ok here's how the story goes...Me and this boy were talking and he asked for another girls number and I gave it to him. And a couple minutes later he asked me out and I said yes. Well today he broke up with me and he just asked me out yesterday. The reason is because his parents are getting divorced and doesn't want a girlfriend. And I said ok I hope everything works out and some other things. And so we were still talking and stuff and I meant to text my friend to tell her the news and I said.. ha ha me and ___ went out for a total of 23 hours ha ha. I'm happy we broke up. He was kind of rude. and we were like best friends and it was kind of awkward... well I accidentally sent it to HIM!!!!! and I said sorry like 5 time and then he text back and said I don't care and I asked him your mad at me aren't you and he said Now I know why you can never get a boyfriend loser... (that was only my 2nd BF) I was so mad and I text back and said ok? I know that wasn't a good comeback but I was so shocked I couldn't believe it. and that girl whose number he asked for wasn't a friend on his myspace and today and I think she had something to do with us breaking up because he told me he liked her too.      Well the reason I'm writing this is because I need to know what to do at school if someone comes up to me and says something about it. Just incase my moms ideas don't work. which they might.      I know it's the most awfullest thing that I could of done I feel terrible about it.. If someone sould help me that would be great. Oh yeah I sit next to him in science.       Thanks!

I can't dance! my friends and i, whenever we are at dances, are the group that stands on the far side of the room in a circle jumping up and down all night. his group is the kids that are right in the middle of the floor dancing away. and i don't believe in grinding. so what can i do?!      3. i don't think he likes me very much, and i think one of my friends put him up to asking me. should i confront him about this if he asks me or should i just let it go?

20090128145519AAPrJXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GF has packed on 50 pounds since we met?	she was in great shape for her last BF, but since she's known me (4+ years) she has steadily put on at leasst 50 pounds of fat. And thats just what the scale can pick up, god knows how much of her "used to be" muscle has just turned INTO fat.      Before you all turn on me for being a shallow jerk, let me add that we have talked about this numerous times, and she hasn't made even an ATTEMPT to get into shape. I told her it's as easy as lifting some weights once in awhile, at least TRY to show like you care, and, shocker, it's been 3 weeks and not even a faster pace to the fridge.       I feel like she's spitting in my face, caring so little about her appearance to herself or to me, like she doesn't feel she needs to be in shape for me becuz I dont deserve it. Ive ruled out that she's just comfortable around me, and thats why shes gotten so laxed on her appearance, because after the numerous talks weve had, she knows something needs to be done, and yet still shows no signs of giving 2 sh*ts.       So is there any hope or does she just not care anymore? Because I am starting not to care anymore either.
20090128090702AAsUBcV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies what would you do?	Ok, Me and my first love have been together for six years on/ off we're 18. we have tried to make it work, well I HAVE for the new year but the first month is just not working, he doesnt call me like he should and when he does he doesnt really say anything. He says that he loves me with all his heart and that he wants to be with me we have never had sex because we dont live really close but we are planning to really soon, and on top of that he's on house arrest, he can never stay out of trouble which is one of the reasons that we are always OFF. Im trying to get him to undertand me and how I feel he had the nerve to say that I had low self esteem, just because I dont want him to hurt me anymore. He doesn't even tell me that im beautiful he tells me that im cute, and I know im beautiful I just want him to tell me, he just seems so damn careless. My question is should I leave him since I'm not happy but I knw he loves me. What should I do??? And how do I get him to listen?

But when were hanging out or with eachother i dont feel like were dating i feel like were friends with benifits and it makes me so mad because the only time he's "lovey dovey" is after we get into a fight.   I've already told him that i wish we had more of that but after i told him he did it alot for like 3 days and now it's all back to normal. It makes me so mad because i feel like when i talk to him it goes in one ear and out the other?

Ok so hes my ex, we were together for around 3 years, he was my first love etc, and in the 3 years hes hurt me by cheating twice(getting a random girl pregnant) and other little things but i took him back because i loved him(stupid i no).   Anyways, its been around 4 months since we broke up, and were going to get back together when he had sorted out the custody thing out for his son. But iv changed my mind now as i sat down and really thought about it and he doesnt deserve me. I love his son to bits, thats not a issue. Should i tell him nicely? Or to the point....?
20090128150201AAKwc40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i ask this guy to Swirl [sadie hawkins] ?	Here is the story,      Me and this guy were dating like a year or two ago, and we broke up. but then we were still really good friends and stuff afterwards, but then me and this other guy started dating and the other guy felt uncomfortable with me hanging out with my exboyfriend. but now me and that other guy broke up [wow i can really go through the guys ;)] anyways, me and the guy i was talking about in the begining are still friends, but not as close as we used to be.      So i was thinking the other day, hmm...why not ask him to swirl?

20090128092305AAusmYz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused about women?	OK, I'm 21 and an introvert. People have been telling me I need to 'put myself out there' and talk to females I don't know and smile at strangers. But when I tried doing that people didn't seem interested and people just looked away even after brief eye contact. Therefore I've become gruff and cold towards people and I try to shut people out of my life except for people who I already consider friends, yet it doesn't seem fulfilling. What am I doing wrong? People tell me me to do one thing, that I'm good looking and have a great personality, but then when I act on their advice, it doesn't work.

I do red cross meetings and go kick boxing and I also work on weekends and go uni. I consider myself to be pretty out there, so where do I have to go to be "out there" to find girls?

20090406102340AAJUR4q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I over reacting; would love men and womans point of view?	Last week we found out the little boy that my son has been playing with has a major issue. He was raped when he was younger, due to this he (he is 12 years old now) was trying to convience my 8 year old and his 6 year old cousin to drop their pants and was talking to them about sex.      This was discovered when my husband went over to see what they were doing behind the trees. My husband being the coward he is didn't do anything but came in and told me. I was naturally ticked he left the kids out there and did not make his presence known.      I decied it was better if the 12 year old didn't come over anymore. NOW my husband keeps talking to the kid and trying to convince me to allow the child to come over to play and I just went outside and he is allowing the child to help him in the garden.      Now I understand the child doesn't really have any parents and is hurting a great deal. It is not that I don't feel bad for him and it does break my heart for the child. BUT it is my job to protect my son not to try to fix another child!      And my husband seems to have no smpathy or even care about what the child did just that he is hurt! He hasn't even said one word to OUR son about it. That has had no interest in him.       My son told me he felt better knowing the 12 year old wasn't coming over anymore and that this incident wasn't the first time!      Can anyone understand why I'm so hurt and angry with my coward of a husband?      Am I overreacting?

This is the part where I get pissed off at ,she says "it makes me look bad" don't you think that's a bit selfish and I guess maybe she doesn't understand the look because she grew up with a family with sticks up their asses but Im not here to bash on how she was raised and her views.

20090128092240AAqgS5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to handle?  Dating a girl who is very nice, but I can't stand her sister and don't really like her family.?	My girlfriend is nice, spiritual, tries to do the right thing, tries to go back and correct mistakes.  However, her sister (younger than her) is an absolutely insolent self-righteous, non-apologetic brat.  Evidently parents were much stricter with good manners with my girlfirend, but totally spoiled her sister, and became completely derelict as far as correcting her sister's bad behavior.  Instead they blame my girlfriend for creating strife whenever she stands up to the bratty sister.  She often feels like her sister's bad behavior is favored, and she feels unappreciated.  I love my girlfriend, but I'm concerned about marrying into her loopy family.  I wouldn't want to cut her off from her family, but I can't stand her sister and frankly her parents are irresponsible apostates.  But I also don't want to let this be a reason to break it off with my girlfriend, because she can't change this.

20090128145319AA3gsYR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My bf's parents are horrible!!?	okay so my bf's parents tend to blame all of my bf's problems on me. when we first started going out my bf (his name is casey) was too scared to even tell his dad he had a gf thinking that his dad would make us break up without a question. eventually he told his dad and his dad took it as a joke. we're 13 & 14. he needs to grow up. so my bf's grades were doing really bad and so he'd get grounded from me (i was a thing i guess to them). his dad would call my dad to complain and blame everything on me. his dad blamed his C in P.E. on me. so my bf hated not talking to me so he made an email and an aim when his parents told him not to. his parents found out and i got an email FROM them TO me. it was again stating that i did everything to disobey his parents wishes. i know most of you are thinking that i should just dump my bf and find another one with less assholeish parents but its not that easy. i love my boyfriend to death and he cares about me. he's my first serious boyfriend and i dont want to give him up. he's my best friend and i tell him everything. what should i do? cause the next thing his parents would probably do is pull my bf out of my school so we never see eachother.
20090128092806AA3DvJE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl Question, kinda confused!?	Ok so, this might sound lame but it made my day. I was on my way to class/lunch at college and I notice this girl I have seen times before that I always thought was very cute and wouldnt mind meeting. We were walking separate ways towards each other, and she had coffee in her hand (not relevant). Of course I looked at her, she looked at me, took a sip of coffee and smiled at me and I smiled back(I didnt even know I smiled until after she walked passed me). Now I dont know why she  smiled at me. I think she has seen me before but never smiled. Thoughts? Thanks

We were at a play rehearsal and during a break we were talking, and when I was complaining jokingly about something, I crossed my arms and pouted a little, then laughed.        he laughed too and said "Look at that mini-tantrum.  It's absolutely adorable."        I laughed and said, "yeah, i guess it was two-year-oldish."      He said, "no, it's kind of awesome."

So how long do I wait? I'm not really into him, I barely know him, except for having some classes together last year.

20090128091956AAEDa3X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I crazy for not wanting LOVE?	Ok, so throughout my life i've only had two kisses from two guys, never been on a date, went out with one guy less than a day (forced to by a friend.I felt bad and cursed myself for doing it) , never had a boyfriend, and had three chrusses. I'm sixteen, and right now i am neutral.   The thing is, i don't feel like i want love in my life. I know what you might say, 'You're to young, of course you don't want love,' but i really DON'T WANT IT. All i want to do is pass on love and do what i want without having to worry about a boyfriend. No kids, no marriage.   My parents don't believe me, neither do my frineds (I really wish they shut up about that) and say that i will fall in love.   But i don't want it, and don't needed. I would become a nun, except that i want to travel and live out my life and i'm not that religious.   I'd wish someone would tell me that i am not crazy for not wanting what i don't need in my life.

I just recently started living with my real dad, afterliving with a relative of my moms that had lost their baby soon after i was born.

He is actually married now, and his wife is expecting a child here. Thing is, me being there reminds him of my mom alot. We have alot in common and all of that, but he dosent like to look at me too much because i look so much like her. I though that i could deal with this, but it is hard. It is even damageing his relationship with my stepmom, which i blame myself for. How can i help him realize that, my mom is gone and that its ME here now?

Many people argue that  any time a younger women (19-27) is dating a man old enough to be her father (40-50), she interested in him just for money. I believe that money is not the main reason for such behavior. Maybe some women are just infatuated with older men. After all, there are younger guys out there that have money too.

She told me I can be doing something more "productive"... but don't i work 5-6 days a week and am I not allowed a few hours of fun for me?   Then 2 weeks ago I was being productive on a Saturday by working at her house and she complained that i was working to much. She also has said that she cant just work work work, she has to take a break so why is my break so wrong?      She would rather me do anything else besides race the little cars, but I think no matter what I was doing she would have a problem with it.      why is she acting this way?

20090128145327AA7bM0e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MY EX-BOYFRIEND AND WHAT HE HAD TO SAY?	I had known this guy for 4 years. I do admit we did have sex without a relationship.       He meets this player girl. They never had sex, but fooled around. She wanted a relationship and that's not what he wanted at the moment, that is when we became closer and he made me his official girl.        His friends have made comments about how she was never dedicated as much as I was.      We broke up because I kissed another guy while drunk at a party. I apologized but still isn't talking to me. He got into a second relationship, not w/ the player girl, and they broke up because he wanted to be with the player girl. They're still not together.      He isn't talking to the player girl at the moment because his friends say he feels she is rejecting him. On my aim status I have: "I am sorry." His aim status reads: "I will never forget you, I can't."      I don't know if this message is directed towards me or the player girl?      He is still chasing her btw.      I am so hurt, my heart hurts so much.      ADVICE

20090128150222AAdK3Eg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why? we used to flirt from time to another when we meet, for he lives next to me. ?	He gave me his e-mail and asked me to e-mail him, (he doesn't know mine) but I told him I like to see him and not mailing. Recently I felt he was becoming distant although he told me in a kind of joking manner  to call him if I wanted to go out. I don't trust him so I decided to send him an e-mail wishes for christmas. He didn't reply. I feel like humiliated, I don't know why...why didn't he say even thanks.  I usually need time to become close to someone and I thought he was a friend.

20090128150329AA9LIwe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if this is going to become something more?	Me and this guy are trying to hang out. (BTW I'm 16 and he's 17) But every-time I try and go somewhere my mom won't let me @ first I didn't tell her about him. Than I asked could I go to the movies and she said she didn't have any extra money for me to go and I told her  her about him. She said I still couldn't go because of the fact that I was trying to sneak around and didn't want her to meet him. I mean we haven't hung out and we've been trying to for a couple of months. I think he's going to get tired of me standing him up. What do I do? Do you think he's into me? I mean we've been talking and all and he calls me baby and stuff but nowadays you never know. Most of the guys at my school are only trying to do one thing, even though he knows I not like that. I don't know. Could someone help me?
20090405215255AARsZ0S	Family & Relationships;Family	My daughter's obscene, foul mouth injuring our marriage?	She's 13, and doesn't speak to us with much respect when she's expressing her anger,  whenever we won't let her do or have what she wants.  I don't mind her foul mouth too much, as at times, as long as she complies with my requests.  Admittedly, when I'm frustrated, my language isn't something I'm proud of either. But I direct my anger at inanimate objects, not at people, so it doesn't affect my family members as much, relatively speaking, as the face to face rudeness and disrespectful language from my daughter. Still,  I admit I'm not a good roll model for my daughter.   But my wife flips out over my daughter's disrespectful language to either of us, then flips out at me for not taking it more seriously and punishing her  My wife is super sensitive to perceptions of being disrespected, to the point of paranoia, and my daughter, I suspect, takes full advantage of my wife's old fashioned sensibilities.    Are there any suggestions as to motivate my daughter take better control what comes out of her mouth while she's at home with her parents, and especially when she isn't getting our compliance?  She seems to be able to control her choice of words fine outside the house, like at her school.

20090128090118AAicLmP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I scared my date away?	Ok so I went out on a date with this really nice guy. We went to dinner then had a couple of drinks. We then watched a movie and drink a little bit more. Then we started hooking up. I was blacking in and out so I really don't remember what happen. I do remember that we started to have sex and then he stopped it and said this isn't right. I told him I was sorry and this wasn't like me. He told me not to worry about it. And said he would call me when he got home. He ended up calling me when he got home. and said he would call me the next day. He didn't end up texting until Sunday. And I haven't heard from him since. Did I scared him away or what???
20090128090122AAR9Kzg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with him?	I have been dating this guy for almost 3 months. The first week we were dating, he cheated on me with hig ex. He told me he made out with her, and she said she wouldnt do that to me. His mom said when he cam back that night, he had sracthes and bite marks all over his back. Then a couple days later he had emailed my mom (my mom told him to stay away from me) and he IN A WAY threatened her. So she told me that I had to stay away from him, but of course, being 16, I dont listen to my mom. Everything was good and all that for awhile, but then my friend Becky started to get a crush on him. He was going over to her house to hang out with her and one of my other friends. My other friend Carrie told me that he was holding her hand while they were watching a movie, but him and Becky both denied it. Then we had said i love you to each other, and I found out a week later that he didnt mean it when he said it, he even told me that. So that really hurt me. Lastly, last week, his brother brought up him cheating on me the first time and he got in a fist fight with his brother, and he hit his mom and almost broke her nose. He told me it was an accident. He has a very high IQ, 161, and his mom said he has been in psychiactric care several times, and he has talked about hurting people, but to me it sounds like he is just joking. I really care about this guy and I trust he will never hurt me, but others want me to break up with him. I dont know what to do.

When I asked him what his was his response was "Well...it's..something I still have to make up my mind about..You'll find out eventually, later on in life." So my response was "Please just tell me, I won't judge you, and you know that." He laughed and said "You couldn't judge me on it. It's about you.." he paused for a second and said "I think I'm unconditionally in love with you." My response:"You're in love with me?" He seemed panicked and quickly responded "No. Well..it's ...you're the only one I want to talk to anymore. You can cheer me up no matter what.." Then he kind of changed topic. Opinions on what he's trying to get across? Thanksss!

20090128093933AAXzQ4G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Trust him or not?	Hi..     Im new to this but i have read a lot of good advice from everyone..   I need your advice .. all I need is for you to be honest.. no matter what   you have to say.. Thanks for your time..      I lived with a guy for 11yrs we have 2 girls.. he always accused me of cheating   on him which i never did. He was my first and my only (sexually). About five years   ago I had our second baby I dont know but I got depressed. I know I pushed him   away. Well he cheated on me with my sister, supposely nothing happen. Only    letters I found, the letters did not say anything of they being together so in a way   I do believe nothing happened. But there is always the doubt. We got back together    after that, I forgave him but i never forgot. I did wrong and I cheated on him. I did it    worse cause I made everyone know, I dont have an excuse for doing such thing,    I didnt love that person, I love my daughter's dad. When he knew about it he left the house..   That destroyed me. I do not know what I was expecting. Now a year later we decided   to try once again to save our relationship.. I have a myspace and facebook which as soon   as he came around I posted I was married, put pics of us together etc. well he did not..   Im very clumsy and sometimes I text the wrong person. Well I have a bestlfriend which    is lesbian, and I texted her "who are you flirting with? u have a gf now?" .. well    i didnt send it to her i sent it to him..  I get home the first thing he says is.. oh you going   through my cell.. That killed me.. cause i was going to tell him about the text I sent    him by mistake and he basically confessed to flirting.. I just said thank you and walked away..   he said that he thought i saw a text from a guy friend of his asking for a girls number..    it doesnt make sense .. how can i get jealous and say u r flirting cuz of that? well    i left the situation there.. he has a PS3.. so my internet was down i decided to    use the internet on the PS3.. when i go to myspace I see he has another myspace account   which is not the one he has me on.. and the history showed he was messaging ..    so i decided to look into it.. I found pics of women.. I found him asking for pics..    I saw profiles he went to.. etc.. I called him and told him.. his excuse is that happen   b4 he decided he really wants to do things the right way with me..which supposely he    just decided about a week ago..  he said we should   get help so we can save this.. but i cant trust him.. what if its just another lie..    what if its not.. how will i ever know if he makes another account.. or calls girls..    I do not want to become a stalker .. I want us to respect our privacy but be able    to trust each other.. I dont think I can.. after all this .. I have no trust... am I right or    wrong? can you please help me out..       Thanks..

At the end of the night, I met this really cool guy. We talked for awhile, we laughed alot and he was really nice. We texted off and on for an entire day 2 days after I met him.

20090128094531AAmTuYU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is overly sensitive...?	On the outside hes a tall strong jock of a guy that openly wrestles with any guy that asks and scares almost everyone but with me if i say i hate him in a joking way he gets really upset and crys. He hates it when i get mad at him and punchs in walls when we argue. Im not sure why hes like this, i mean hes a sweetheart to me all the time and goes out of his way to make me happy in any way possible, but then he says that hed rather die than loose me and wants to be with me forever and it kinda scares me. I mean i love him but i dont want to say anything like maybe we shouldnt say forever b.c he is so sensitive i dont want him doing anything stupid like hurting himself or someone else. what should i do?    were both 17, weve been together a bit over 9 months
20090128094642AAFOrIz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does a kiss on the forehead mean?	The other night I went to a party that some of my co workers were having & my crush was there. Well.. this was my first time ever getting drunk. We all played the game, "Kings" and one of the rules he made was when I drink, you have to drink. The rules he made were all picking on me. Then later in the night, I went to find something & he was asking everyone where I was. At the end of the night, I passed out & I guess before he left.. he grabbed my face & gave me a kiss on the forehead. He also asked me if I wanted to go home with he & his brother so I could go to bed since I live farther than they do.       What does his kiss mean? Do you think he likes me?

20090128095418AAutGme	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband cheated on me while we were engaged and I just found out...?	And very happy, or so I thought. We did live almost 3 hours apart at the time. We've been married almost 2 years. I loved him so much and never thought he would have done this.       I found out bc he left his email open on the computer and saw where he had messaged the girl on facebook telling her he missed her and their msgs back and forth talked about their "fling." I'll admit we are having a rough patch in our marriage right now. I'm just sick at the sight of him and want him to leave. All I felt for him just feels gone now and he just disgusts me.      I don't think he has cheated on me since we've been married. And I had absolutely no idea this was going on at the time, I thought we were so so happy.       What do I do???

20090128101130AANbJUQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are all girls like this or what? read the story pls, this is kinda weird for me.?	Ok, there is a discussion session for my anthropology class with like 20 students in a classroom where we discuss different issues with each other. Last week, which was the tthirdweek of class, and everyone pretty much knew each other, I sneezed like three times in that session, and NONE of the girls said a single "bless you". at the end of the last week though, I became friends with this girl who is like the hottest girl in that class. So today which was the fourth session, Me and that hot girl were flirting so bad at the bbeginningof the session in front of all other girls, and I was making her laugh so bad, and she was joking around with me as well, and oobviouslyall the other chicks were watching. Now, here is the deal, today I sneezed in that class and almost all of those girls (there are 7 other) said "bless you", and I was like "WTF? Last week nno onegave a damn when I sneezed three times in an hour".    Can anyone tell me what is going on here?      Thanks for all inputs

20090225082630AA651xi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you believe a "marriage before God" is valid?	My hubby and I want to get married but he's had some serious money problems in the past that he's still trying to clean up. If we get married, I will loose my tax return (or it will be significantly less if we file separate) and my credit will be ruined (forget about owning a home for a long, long time). He has become very responsible with his money since then but I'd basically be screwed over if we are "legally" married. My parents are very supportive of a "marriage before God" only but I've been hearing from many people that they do not believe this is a good idea because people take advantage of it simple to cohabitate. My pastor will not even do our marriage ceremony.  What are your opinions on this? I am a born again Christian and want to do the right thing.

20090128105232AAJHyPl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men, You are always asking what we want right? Well I want...?	To see a man prepare a home cooked meal. I think it is so sexy when a man cooks. How he prepares a dish is an indication of what he can do sexually. Does he take his time to put the dinner together so it will melt in my mouth. Or does he rushes through the act and not worry about me or the outcome of the dish. I'm not gonna lie. Dessert is truly the icing on the cake. If a man prepares a good dessert to serve, I feel like I am obligated to show him my appreciation. So men can you cook?

20090225135549AAcpmEr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does my boyfriend mean?	Me and my Bf had a serious discussion last night about where we were heading in our relationship. He says he doesn't want to commit(Marriage&Kids) well sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't. He wants me to stay,but it isn't fair to me because that he isn't sure he is able to support a family right now or even in the next five years. I am confused because sometimes he makes comments about having a family and that he is the last one to continue the bloodline. We are both almost 30 and because of medical reasons I only have a few years left to have my own. I Love him very much and stated that If I run out of time with having children that would be ok(even though that is so important to me) As long as I have him. Give me your honest opinion please.Should I stay or should I go? Thank u in advance

As soon as I started flirting he backed off. Then I heard how he thinks I like him and he thinks I'm a stalker to him and how he hates me, all of it behind my back. I've been ignoring it for two months and he still talks crap about me. So, I deleted him from my facebook friends. 10 days later, he noticed and sent me a fb message "?", then later on my cell phone. So then I asked him why he hates me and he told me that he obviously doesn't because then he wouldn't give a crap if I deleted him from my facebook friends. Does he really care ?

20090128104626AAZJyf7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Must I save this relationship or let it go downhill?	I'm sick of his attitude towards me and his self-pitiness.   I love him, but I can't take this anymore. I'm no longer happy with him.    He is a mental abuser and an accuser.    He's always thinking I'm cheating on him and that I do not want him because he says he is too ugly for me. I've tried several times to save him from this pit he is burying himself in but he isn't letting me anymore. And he even dares to question the number of boyfriends I've had in the past, because he thinks I am "too pretty". Damn it, he doesn't even believe I am a virgin, because according to him, "I seem to have experience" whenever we were intimate.    So, what do you think I must do? Work this out with him like I've tried a million times in the past? Or let this go?

So far, we've discussed catching a late show/dinner and just meeting up for drinks beforehand.  Anything else we can do that's super fun, but no strip clubs?  I don't mean spa activities, just something to do at night besides drinking, eating, and watching a show.

20090128103007AAf4L2f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does love mean to you?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship. Part of me doesn't believe in love..that it's just a silly human emotion designed by nature to get us to pro-create. I've never had a desire to have sex..again I think I'm kind of too good/intelligent in the sense that it's just carnal pleasure. Are these feelings normal?   I think society puts too much emphasis on relationships..what's wrong with staying single?   Granted, I am depressed, but I don't think this depression has anything to do with not being in a relationship. I'm in college and just stressed out about not knowing what I want to do with my life. I have an overbearing mother who is constantly telling me how I should have a good career.      I only really have one or two good friends. I have a hard time becoming close to people.   Growing up my parents always fight, so I don't really have a good relationship model to go by.

20090128100529AAGQM1C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if this guy likes me? Preferably GUYS help!!!!!?	How can I tell if this guy likes me? Preferably GUYS help!!!!!?   I really like this guy! He is handsome, sweet, quiet, and shy. I am a sophomore and he is a freshman. We don't go to the same high school, but we go to the same church. The only time we ever talk at all is when we are shooting hoops. We will say hi to each other and I will say nice shot. Recently, he said that he wasn't very good at basketball, but I told him he was good. Sum times I just wanna stare at him, but if he so much as looks near me, I turn my head quickly. Can you tell if he likes me or not? If so, please don't say ask him out cause neither of us can drive yet. By the way, I am kinda shy 2. What should I do? Also, please be nice, like don't tell me I am stupid for thinking he might like me. Thanks!

There are girls in my grade (sophomore) that are dating guys that are seniors in high school. I have wanted to tell some of the sophomore girls that are dating senior guys when i live that once their senior boyfriend graduates from high school, they will never see that guy again. That is why I want the sophomore girls to date guys their age so they can see more of them.

We have people that say we get common sense from our parents or from the evolution of our spiecies, or so many different areas that it makes no sense at all to try and figure where it comes from.  Many different people have a different answer.  How in the heck do we get to an area of common ground when it comes to common sense?  If I don't agree with you, and you don't agree with me, who's the sheriff?  How much simpiler can I get in asking the original question. I had to give the last one a "No best answer."

If you were involved in a  casual relationship with someone and things have cooled off, mainly due to difficulties at work and in personal life (difficulties with ex spouse) and you haven't talked in about a week, would you send a text on their birthday to say hi (you could be facing a situation where the cool off is intentional), or would you let it go by and let the silence continue and just see if things pick up again once the drama is over?

Like, because like, he seemed to be having like fun with my best friend. He was making all these noises. The same noises that my parents like make in their bedroom at night.   So like, yeah.

We had a thing in the summer, I guess you could call it romance, but now she is back in her country, and I am back in the New York City, in college. Since there is no chance in hell of us ever being together again, I tried driving her away gradually by being a miserable twat, saying how much my life sucks,having fits online, the usual stuff... Despite all that crap she insists she will get her visa after the summer and visit. Should I start to get worried?
20090128100555AAzBc4i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a girl do this?	I'm seventeen, and I'm attending a college for my Bachelors. There's a girl whom I like a lot, and I know she likes me too. It's pretty obvious.    She goes out of her way to be nice to me, and you know...all the signs. She has a beautiful smile, and she's hotter than hell on a Friday night, lol.    Problem: Last week of last semester, she just suddenly stopped talking to me. Just like that. I'm a very polite, nice guy in real life, and all my friends know it, and al that, and I'm realli kind and I don't diss people or anything. And I'm EXTRA nice to her. So...I was confused.    On the third-to-last day of the last week of last semester, I tried to walk up to her while she was talking in a group, and she actually turned her back to me and continued like I wasn't there. This was...hurtful, to say the least.    She didn't come to school for the rest fot eh semester. This semester, On the first day of school, she was being really extra nice all of a sudden, and she smiled and waved and said "Hi", and was being really nice.    I'm confused. What is she doing? Is this what girls call "Playing hard to get?" And if it is, then advice to you girls who see this story: Don't do it. IT's confusing like hell. Any help please?

20090128101634AAakuLo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Do you deny this? ?	How is it that women deny being attracted to an attractive guy (or stranger) outside of their current relationship? I hear women say that they do not emotionally/physically fantasize about the attractive stranger but ONLY their s/o.      Can someone tell me if the women are completely lying and hiding their own desires? What are your thoughts about women not admitting to these things but often denying it without reasons?       Anyone?
20090128105839AAomErc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: What are you attracted to in a man? ?	There's a study done at the University of Texas that men are highly (and physically) attracted to a woman with a 0.07% WHR (waist hip ratio). What they mean by this is that women who have curvy hips and a slim waist are what a lot of men desire. Interesting but also silly.       Now, I want to reverse this question and ask the women: Tell me something (similar to what i said above) that you know about men. IN other words, what physically attracts you to them? Is it the shoulder waist ratio? Broad shoulders? Slim waist?       Is it his symmetrical and facial appearance (handsome or downright ugly)? Thoughts, ladies?
20090225083105AAK1S8q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WOW - what happened and what do you think?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Okay then! Um I told him I do stick up for myself but that he doesn’t listen and you can’t force someone to be something they are not. Well we talked a bit more and he seemed fine however, the next day he totally ignored me I text him and he never responded and I haven’t heard from him since only briefly but he was short and only cause he kind of had to contact me. What do you make of what happened I mean is he so frustrated with me that he doesn’t want to talk anymore? I don’t think my relationship is as bad as he makes it out to be and don’t understand what happened and why his sudden hostility.    What do you make of this?
20090225083105AAJESvJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend passed away last December, do you think she knows how sorry I am for the way I've treated her?	A friend called me up to say hello and we got into talking about the past. She told me that our other friend was in a car accident and that she passed away about 6 months back. I was devastated when I heard the news. She was my best friend. I hadn't spoken to her in over a year and when we were together I always pushed her aside. I was a horrible friend to her at times. I wish I would have spent more time with her and I miss her so very much. Do you think she forgives me for how i've treated her in the past? I don't know how many times i've apologized. I went to visit her a few burial site a few months ago and I will go again soon.
20090225082757AATAclD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My girlfriend on the side is getting serious?	She's starting to get frustrated with the situation because she keeps talking about leaving me alone. She know I have a gf but I told her even though I live with someone I'm still single. My gf calls alot when we are together and it ruins our time.       My gf on the side is saying that she needs to get a man of her own, that she's tired of the booty call thing and she's tired of living alone. I've told her that I was going to leave my gf soon and move in with a friend. I told her it was ok if she decided to have a dip if she wants to feel the time that I can't be there, she no that's not what she wants. I'm afraid I'm going to call her one day and she's going to tell me I can't come over anymore because she's moved someone else in. Is she crazy? Or is she trying to send me hints about something? Is she thinking that maybe I'll dump my gf to be with her or something? But she seems unhappy and claims that she cries herself to sleep at night because she's tired of being alone.

We're close and he's the first guy I am ever and was ever sexually attracted to.  Well I told him that I am physically attracted to him(and he knows I didn't reach puberty until age 23 because of a disease and October was the first time I became sexualy attracted to men).      We're both Christians that's why I feel bad.      A few days after telling him that in text I could see he was struggling and I could see obviously it caused a physical reaction(erection).      Anyway I want to apologize saying "I'm sorry that whatever I said may have caused a physical reaction in you.  I didn't realize that what I say can affect a guy physically.  Hope you can forgive me"      My question is would he know what I mean by me saying "caused a physical reaction in you"?      What does it mean to you?      PLEASE BE NICE! I'M SENSITIVE!

20090128102456AAgOqyk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you handle this situation?	Okay, I've sort of been seeing this girl for a little over a month now. She's been really hot and cold, she seemed very into me the first night we met. Then sometimes when we hang out she seems way more reserved and distanced.      I saw her last Saturday and she was basically all over me, then we didn't talk for a few days and the next time I saw her we didn't even touch at all, and she seemed stand offish. It's since been a few days since we've talked and I dont know if I should call her or text her or something. Or should I just wait to hear from her? I don't like to throw myself at people.      Plus I don't know if it makes a difference but she as a 2 year old daughter. Her daughter is really sweet and seems to like me a lot. I'm just not sure if she's hesitant to get involved because she has a kid?      I have no problem taking things slow, and I told her that. It's just sometimes the signals I get from her are so far apart as in like "really like" and "doesn't like"! Its really confusing...      Thanks for any comments.

20090128101617AAVzfG1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Of these three guys --- which one would you pick to date based on their job and personality?	Ok, assume you are around 28-30 and looking for a date.      1.  He's 32 and lives with his parents.  He has only been living with them for 5 months.  Before that he always had his own place and has lived in other states and abroad as well.  He was laid off his job and is now working part-time as an office clerk a nearby college.  He has a good education and is a very intelligent person.  His parents are wealthy.  He has his own car and is applying for better jobs and considering going back to do a MBA.  He doesn't get out much and spends his free time on the computer, although he likes to travel and enjoys sports too.  He is fairly handsome and has a friendly personality, but he's a bit shy too sometimes and this holds him back at times.      2.  This guy is 30 and is a high school gym and languages teacher.  He rents an apartment and has a dog.  His family aren't wealthy and he doesn't see them too much.  He enjoys playing sports like lacrosse and football in his spare time.  He owns a car and enjoys travelling and going to football games.  He is a bit of jock and is outgoing and friendly.  He likes to wear a pair of Oakleys perched up on his head all the time.       3.  This guy is a bit of a nerd and he likes that too.  He's 28 and a law student.  Before that he did a Master's degree in anthropology.  He lives in a rented apartment and is very careful with money.  His parents are rich and they all were educated at Ivy League schools.  He isn't that handome, but he is the tallest of the three guys and can dress up well when he has to.  He is a bit socially awkward, but can be loyal friend and has a quirky sense of humor.

20090128105351AALFwvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should she dump him yes or no?	Well I have two friends and they have been my friends for over 15 years. Well my girl friend is really doing her thing and she is always mad at her BF. Nothing he does is right, from the way he talks to what he eats, his living situation exc. Well I am married and of course every marriage and relationship has its ups and downs but I love my husband and I am happy but more so I love so many things about him, from his touch exc. But she doesn't like too much of anything about him. I try to analyze things for her on why she may be feeling these things and she still stays. Could it be that she comfortable what do I do to help her because if someone simply isn't doing it for you shouldn't you leave? I mean he does have his flaws but she feels he doesn't romance her, he doesn't get excited the way she think he should, he always has his kid, he stays with mom(they split the rent), he works but he doesn't make enough money for her b/c she's in school. Which very well may be valid complaints but should she stay or go and what do I tell her.   she breaks up with him almost every month

20090225135937AA2B6sI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can u help me....pleasseeee?	OK so there's this guy...i flirted w/him like crazy and he wasn't as intrigued as i was, meaning he wasnt into me like the way i was into him. He told my friend to tell me that he has a GF, but that we can still be friends.       So i stop talking to him. cold turkey. Long story short, i let him borrow my muffler(scarf) and he wore it and everything. It's been months and he still hasn't given it back. I told my friend to ask him to give it back and he told her that he wants me to ask him.....what does that mean? why is he making things so hard when i just got over him.         i know it was long, but thanks for reading(:
20090128110243AAqN3ye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for those who've been together 5 years or more?	If you've been in a long-term relationship (5 or more years) and the other person is not ready to get marry, should you stay in the relationship till the other person decides he/she wants to get married or should you end the relationship although you've been together for a while?      I've been with my boyfriend for over 4 years (5 years in July) and he told me he is not ready right now to get married. He said he doesn't know when he'll be ready. Should I stick around? I really love him, and I'm willing to give him space. He just bought a house and I was upset because he did it without giving me consideration, I just thought we would buy a house together and get married. Plus he moved away kinda far from where I live. I still live with my parents and he was living with his mother before he bought the house. So I only get to see him on the weekend and even then I don't spend that much time with him. I don't make that much money so I can't right now move out. What do you think I should do?

Let's assume you don't know me and I come up behind you while you are in line at the local coffee shop and whisper something sweet in your ear like "You have the sexiest elbows ever" and then run to the bathroom clutching my pants, only to come out when you leave and follow you home, dig through your trash, and leave little notes on your doors/windows/car saying such sweet nothings as "I love the smell of your discarded pantyhose" and "Baby, I can't get enough of watching you in the shower, through your window", would you be ecstatically infatuated with me or just highly flattered?      What if I was also willing to call you multiple times a day at your work and just breathe heavily into the phone when you answered?  Would that improve the quality of our relationship?

20090225134255AAuFBd4	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my best mates is insensitive to me?	sorry its an essay but please read i dont know what to do!   im fifteen in year 11. me and one of my best mates have been mates since about year 9, but in year 9 we didnt get along well because she was bitchy to me. after i told her a few times and stated to gob off back to her she stopped. now we're more mature we haven't argued in ages and we spend loads of time with eachother outside school and she sleeps up my house every weekend. but, lately she has said little things which have upset me. like when i said i wanted a boys army tag engraved from my nan for my birthday (i wanted it to be a special present off her) she just turned her nose up and went 'err, why d'you want that or they're hanging, they're boys!' and i was trying to say 'no but its off my nan as a special gift' but she just ignored me as she started to talk to someone else. also, when i told her about an occasion i thought i had the facts right but she was insistent she was right and i was like nooo im sure it was like this and she started getting all annoyed and frustrated i was like :S? calm down i just got it wrong s'all. and when i realised she was right i was like ohhh yeah i remember now and tuned away i looked and she was still looking at me funny with a dirty look i wa like okay dont get on your high horse now. i do tell her all the time about her bitchyness just she will say sorry and it'll happen again a few months later. i want to say 'i don't need a person like her anyways' but its not that simple beause we hag round in a group together ad things will be too awkward. my mum and sister say to just have a full on go at her and be all funny about it but i know she will just be all 'youre being pathetic' and arguing never gets you anywhere but to me she always puts me down and gives me her opinion when i dont want it which knocks my confidence. its like she knocks my confidence so that im down and shes up. how can i talk to her in a decent way without a big thing flying out of hand?

20090225140727AAvQF0T	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If you have a night wedding, do you miss out on the nice colorful pictures?	I have always wondered, if you have your wedding in the evening, are you not able to take pictures in the day?   For example, you book a venue with a beautiful garden, but your wedding is at night, and you don't want the groom to see you before the ceremony.      How did you do it, did you take "day" pictures if you had a night wedding? and how did you work it out?   If you had a night wedding, and didn't take pictures during the day, did they look nice or were they all dark?      I think I will be having an evening wedding (venue availability) but I wanted to take the pictures during the day with flowers, etc, and I also didn't want my HTB to see me before the ceremony. I am feeling this is one of those cases where I can't have my cake and eat it too lol.      Thanks!

20090128103232AAXZDPK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you get a guy to be aggressive?	My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now, and he is so soft.   Dont get me wrong I love him and how he is, I just want him to be more aggressive, more dominate.        I kinda look for the * daddy* figure in men,   and that is normal because of my childhood.       How could i make him be more like that with out actually asking him?   I have told him b4 and we have played a bit,   and I love it.    Like i was watching tv and he turned my head away from it and just simple simple simple things that i really really want.   Like.... an easy example.   Say he asked me if i took my meds over a text and i said no but i will, and when he got home he asked me and i still said no, I would want him to get more upset about it, say something. do something   dont just get me my meds and a glass of water.   that is only an example though.    So what could i do.   I dont want to pin him against the wall and tell him to hit me    but i think i know that if he did it once he would like it.    I fell for him because i thought he was. When we first met, he looked like he would be, and through our first conversation i thought he was ... little did i know!   any tips????

Ok...PLEASE I am not here to hear about how a webcam relationship is crazy,dangerous, or just garbage. We clearly like each other ALOT. He just started his world tour as a skateboarder (lol I KNOW) but we were actually really sad to say goodbye. It was a very weird and sad webcam session. Both of our faces and voices were sad. He was willing to buy my plane ticket to see him in VA (I'm in MA) before he left but i was nervous and didn't want him to pay. He said he wants to settle down (just in general not like, with me, its been weeks since we started) when he gets back in August. He refrained from kissing or sleepin with anyone since he met me even when I told him he didn't have to. Ok, so...i am christian and he's not at ALL. I'm worried that we are from two diff. worlds and when we meet in August I know we'll fall in love. Should I  just end this now? But I want to see him...he's always in my mind. He said he was going to write a song while on tour about the long wait for August. :(

20090128110358AAjRM2V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Read the issue: Is this considered discrimination/ignorance when it comes to dating?	I'm an asian american and sometimes when I pursue some non-asian women for dating, I would either have women that would say yes but sometimes I would have women tell me that I'm good looking but they're not into asian men.      I ask myself isn't that an ignorant statement or racial discrimination in attraction?  Chalk it up to preferences but isn't the preference discrimination in itself?  How can you say you don't like something if you've never tried it?  It's like saying you don't like apples but you've never tasted an apple.  It's kind of like saying you only hire whites and not blacks and it's just a preference.  But if that was to happen it would be racial discrimination.  People would make the example of people prefer not to date obese people but obesity and weight is something you can control...race you cannot.        So here's what I'm wondering, do you agree that the preference in itself is discrimination and ignorance?  Unless you've tried it and you didn't like it than I understand, but how can you not like something without having tried it and still consider yourself not ignorant?

20090128110834AAWVS9K	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why is everything seemingly about the bottom line?	It seems many people here are looking for the "cheapest", "least expensive" or "lowest cost" way to do things. What happened to hosting an event based on the comfort of the guests?! Has quality gone down the drain? Doesn't anyone look for really delicious meals, good chefs, excellent photographers and fabulous venues anymore? It seems many people have lost the art of hosting an event. Hostesses should be concerned with giving their guests the *best* of everything, not the *cheapest* of everything. Although more expensive is not always better, often the "cheapest" or "least expensive" is not enjoyable or of good quality. Why not search for the best quality you can afford? Or cut the guest list? You should stay within your means while providing a quality event, otherwise you are simply wasting your money. Is there anyone out there planning a wedding without a bottom line, who is actually concerned with the flavor and preparation of the meals and the comfort of the guests and the abundance of everything and creating an elegant atmosphere? Or are we all so engrossed in throwing a large showy party that we put things like quality aside for the sake of saving a few pennies?     Not judging or trying to start conflict, just wondering where and when this shift from quality to quantity took place.

20090128111147AABpWis	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get him out of my mind? i desperately need to. please help?	last year i met a kid named "brent". i became really good friends with him. i knew that he smoked weed but i didn't see him much outside of school so i knew i'd never be pressured into it. i began to like him and i didn't tell him because we were such good friends. also, i didn't want to like him because of the whole weed thing. now he's gone to another school. the last time i saw him was october and when i did see him, we were inseparable. we even held hands though i knew i shouldn't have. since october, i haven't been able to stop having dreams about him and i think about him daily. i've tried to move on. a guy that i'm kind of interested in asked me to homecoming next week (we have homecoming in february.) i still miss brent though. is it weird that i think about him so much? how can i stop? it makes me depressed that i barely see him and even more depressed that i can never be with him because of the weed. please help. thanks.
20090128101121AAJ2U7s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I right? right ? right? ?	Problem   well there was this guy i had a crush on for a long time.. he finally asked me out. The way he asked me out was very very awkward,, before hand we were talking about friends with benefits.. then he's like "99% if i asked you to be that you would say no." and to prove him wrong i said no .. i rather be friends. then see if we like each other.. then he started to worry about the future.. "will you ever kiss me then?" and i was like "wtf i don't know.." he was kinda asking for action more then a relationship. then i asked him to get a slut, and hes like "no i want you."      Question:   > wtf is his deal.. should i date him. He asked me out then asked me to play strip poker with him.. i do like him.. tho i don't feel very valued.       Background info   He's a shy guy, i'm a shy gril. We met at camp . now he's 18 and i'm 17.. he just wants action but a deep relationship with me.. and i was like that's normal.. when people date they kiss .. and he was worried about comment .. and i was like WTF Maybe it was the topic we were having before hand.. rubbed it the wrong way...       advice?

20090225085658AAtsWDE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, dating question - should you call if he hasn't called you?	Hi there,       I met a guy about a month ago on a blind date. He's asked me out and we've gone out about once a week.  He's always called me.        Last Sunday we had our third date. I really like him and want to see more of him. He has been a lot of fun, considerate, cute.       But, here it is Wednesday and I was hoping he would have called by now to make a date for this weekend. He hasn't.      So my question is...      Do you think he just really isn't into me?    Don't guys who are head over heels for a girl text and call immediately?      I've never dated a guy who didn't call/text right away and it's thrown me for a loop.       I want to make plans for the weekend and am wondering if this guy is going too slow or if I'm in too much of a hurry. :)       Really appreciate any input, thanks!

20090128100231AAdnyro	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did I fall out of love with my first love?	I was with my first love for three years and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that I loved him. We went through some tough times & faced them together,growing continually stronger.But things changed drastically last year & im not sure why...first of all i lost someone v. close to me & found it very hard to cope,& he was there for me.but i always felt some resentment because he couldnt understand what i was going through-which seemed ridiculous i know. a few months later,we went on holiday with his family & he constantly left me to go out with his buddies for hours at the pool etc. I was surrounded by loved up couples but half the time my boyfriend wasnt even there.He never seemed to notice when i was upset & i found myself going into another room to cry sometimes,as i still hadnt recovered from losing someone close to me.he wasnt a bad person though,he just didnt realise & was supportive if i told him something was going on.But I felt like a different person,like i had changed in some way.then a week later at his dad's wedding,he left me for an hour to sit on my own,although he was so apolegetic later on.And as we said how much we loved eachother,i really did feel it in my heart.But weeks later,i got talking to my best guy friend,who noticed straight away i wasnt coping & ended up having real feelings for him-& so decided to end the relationship as i was screwed up.but why did my feelings change so quickly?There was a time when i would have wanted nothing more than to share my life with him.could it all stem from the fact i was grieving or depressed?
20090225140745AA5XXhp	Family & Relationships;Friends	For my sweet sixteenth parttyy :)?	I haven't ever had a proper party before but i've been to friends' parties :]   The problem is, i just don't know where to host it.      A couple of friends have had house parties, and their houses got completely trashed and everything got wrecked. And I have a really good relationship with my mum and I don't want to upset her by ruining her home!      A few other friends have had parties in like village halls or buildings, but they had to be chaperoned and my parents would go insane with all the drink and drugs they might see. :S Plus everyone spends the whole time outside, not even in the hall, so it's expensive to rent a hall that nobody is inside!!      I live in the countryside so I was thinking about maybe just finding a field where we can party and camp out :D but i want a sound system and everything so i don't think that would work.         Any other ideas?!   Sorry for writing so much. :D

20090225135954AAQEDM7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a guy kisses you like this?	we were walking and holding hands then he stopped & looked at me and like grabbed me (gently) and starting kissing me. then after awhile he stopped and just staired at me in the eyes and slowly starting kissing me again then it turned into really passonite kissing he was running his fingers thru my hair, and rubbing my back. then when we finished we stood there for awhile and just like holding each other...like a really long hug.      but then when we were walking back he just slapped my *** and said "your sexy." it ruined the whole thing.      but then we were sitting on these stairs and we just started like playing around kind of and like "pecking" and he would kiss my neck and ears and stuff. and we were like lauging and he was flirting around and like biting me then i was lie hahaha your bitingg mee. then he was like i knoww and we both were going to bite each others lip and it was really funny because we tired to do it at the same time.   but anyway.... after the really romantic kissing...then slapping my *** and calling me sexy..      what does all this meannnnnnn

20090225085252AAYeslE	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does maybe mean?	Yesterday, I asked one of my friends to prom. We were hanging out, and when were talking about prom I said "I would love to take you to prom, if you wanted to go with me." She looked a little surprised and said "Maybe... I know that's really mean and that definitely doesn't mean no... but we'll see." On the bright side, she emphasized 'definitely'.        I talked to here afterward, and again today, but our conversations were normal because others were around.      I think the 'maybe' was from a couple reasons:   The first is that she is just a sophomore and has very protective parents. She might need to get permission. At least her dad knows me and likes me.   Secondly, she knows how to say no to a guy. So if she didn't want to go with me she would have just said no.      So, in this situation, what does maybe mean, and what are my odds? And how long would she make me wait to give me an answer, or should I bring it up again?

20090225081355AAs3ijc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's all moving so fast?	I met a man in December. We instantly clicked, I instantly knew he was the one. This has never happened to me before, I've had a couple of long-term relationships and even after a couple of years have not felt the feelings I feel for this man after only 3 months.       He lives a 2-hour drive away, and we are already discussing getting a place together because we cannot stand to be so far apart. Usually, the fact that we are moving so quickly would scare me and I would back off, but this time it just feels right. And he feels the same. We are both 25 and at the stage in life where we feel ready to settle down a little.       My questions is... anyone who has been in this situation, when it feels so right like this, is it really wrong to rush? I've been waiting all my life for this man, and life is short, why waste time? My friends and family like him but are a little wary of how quickly things are moving. But when it feels so right, how can it be wrong?

Her last text to me was 'thanking' me for a great time on our last date.  Her last verbally spoken words to me were, "See you soon." followed by a fantastic kiss.     I have laid it on too thick in my opinion over the past month of our dating by getting her stuff :( so I do NOT want to appear needy or too pathetic by calling her.  That which you chase, runs!  I've sent her 2 low key texts in 4 days since her last text to me without a response.  It's completely unlike her.  Do I call and risk looking needy and weak, or do I just wait?

Iv had a couple hours to think, and it hit me that I am losing intrest in my Ex boyfriend who I am currently seeing and talking to. I feel in love with him, we dated for 10 months, and have been broken up for 3, it was so hard for me when i was without him, which is what worries me to break things off. I feel like when I'm without him ill miss his presence. He is someone I would hate to loose because through all and all he is a great guy, but he isnt the same person i fell in love with. He barely makes time for me, and makes excuses when he can't. My questions are : how do i tell him in a nice way, because he is the type to turn it around on me, and say i never make time to hang out. I want him to realize he changed, how do i do this? One day i hope to see myself with him ( i dont want to let him go, but he is different, he used to always ask to see me, now he barely can since he has found a group of older guys friends to hang out with ) so how do i make him see what he is losing. I know for a FACT he cares and had feelings for me, I do not know wheather they have changed as far as Love goes, but even after we broke up he continuely told me he loves me, and he still tells me everything. The only time we talk is on the phone at night for a hour or 2, and text messages. And maybe once or 2 times within 2 weeks- either hanging at our houses or just him stopping by or at a party. Keep in mind i love him, and went through mayn fight ( which i do not wish to repeat ) We are both 17
20090128102426AAcaF1O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do when I think my boyfriend's family hates me right now?	Okay, this might start off stupid, but just bare with me here.   Well, a couple weeks ago my boyfriends sister was talking to him and I about having a moving party for their mom because she got a new place.  There were no dates planned or anything.  Trust me, if there was I would've written it down right away (I never miss an event or appointment).  I figured my boyfriend or his sister would tell me when it was and went about my business.   So today I was supposed to go over to my boyfriends place (he lives with his sister & her boyfriend) to make breakfast with him and study while he looked for a job (he just got laid off :[).  Also, I have an interview @ 4PM, so I was going to leave then.  I was planning on it being a chill day and at 7:30AM this morning I got a call from my boyfriend saying..."Omg babe apparently the moving day thing is today and my mom is going to be here to pick us up in an 20 minutes".  Of course I was like "WTF?" and he said "my sister came in screaming at me this morning about it and all angry because i wasn't up and ready to go!", well of course I said I couldn't get ready in 20 min to help them move for the entire and I had already made plans to study all (I have a test tomorrow) and to get ready for my interview.  I told him I couldn't go, it was just too much short notice and I had to get a lot of things done today.  He said it was okay and that it wasn't fair that no one informed me or him about the plans.   About 2 hours ago I got the ANGRIEST phone call from his sister saying how I was a horrible girlfriend for not helping out and how selfish I was.  It's not my responsibility to ask about someone else's moving day.  Then his mom got on the phone and said that she thought I was a good person and how I'm not.  I was so upset.  I have done so much for him and his family.  My boyfriend is so angry at them for doing that to me and is trying to calm them down.   Am I really that selfish?  What should I do?

20090128105143AACyCpa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I keep or leave him?	I've been with my boyfriend for 4 months now, but I'm still not in love with him.   Although the last few months have been a hard time for me since I'm unemployed, and maybe that doesn't help my feelings, but I keep having doubts about the relationship because we can't do much together, other than stay at home and watch movies due to the current financial aspect. I feel like it could be affecting our relationship, but at the sametime I love having him as my boyfriend because of his great personality.   When I'm with him though, I don't fall, not one bit and it is making me wonder if I ever will.   He's great as a boyfriend, however the romance isn't too great either. We never just stare fondly into each others eyes so I would like to know how else to share attraction. He does not relish the time spent with me as much as I would like, for example at night I could spend lots of time kissing him tenderly etc but he doesn't seem to encourage it or again, relish the moment.       Should I still stay with him or tell him how I feel? What do you think I could/should do with him?

There is this really hot girl I know and talk to that I've had a crush on for a long time. Problem is even though I'm not with my baby's mama we still act like we are together, so I can't get with the other girl without risking me losing my son for a while.

20090128101935AAWM4VD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could it be that he may have a...? ?	Sorry for reposting this question but I posted it in the wrong section and left out one important thing...   I dont plan on starting or doing anything with this man... with that said...here is my question...again...      Here's the deal, I work in a career that is mostly male dominated. I am the only female in this certain area at work(I do not work in an office... thank God heh heh!). All day, I work with men including my boss.   Here is the problem... I dont want to admit it but I think I am starting to have feelings for him, He's at least 20 years older than me and married... No kids.   while I am working, I dont think about him much but while I am at home or anywhere else, he's always in the back of my mind.   My boss is really easy going...he's the strong silent type. Very caring and kind (at least with me). I am wondering if he might have a little fling or crush on me too. Here is why I am wondering that...   First of all the first 2 months of my working there, he could have fired me easily because I kept messing up( Now I am doing excellent). He's fired plenty of his men the first time they mess up, he's yelled at them but never did any of that to me. When he talks to me sometimes he blushes. of course I blush back. He sends me texts on my cell phone throughout the day just joking with me. Every time he sees me walking to a direction near him, he follows me with his eyes and I pretend not to notice. I noticed he stare's at me a lot when I guess he thinks i am not noticing (I can see him staring from the corner of my eye). He'll send his guys home but never me. I leave early if I want but he will not send me home. Every morning it's us two that open the business and we are alone for a couple of hours until everyone else starts to arrive. During those two hours it feels so awkward because we are just silent. but when we talk, we are joking around or he's picking on me jokingly. Anything I say, he twists it and says it back to me in a sexual way and just starts laughing. To me, it's hilarious but I dont know what others would think. He's also shown that he's curious about my sex life. He's told me that I obviously dont have sex or am not having sex because of such and such thing...then this led to an evening of me after work texting back and forth with him about sex and how it affects men and women differently. Anyway it seems like he wants to know everything about me. I dont mind sharing my info but I wont tell him EVERYTHING. So wut do you gals/ guys think? HOW DO I STOP CRUSHING ON HIM? I already know I MIGHT have a little crush on him but what about him on me? COULD HE HAVE A THING FOR ME TOO? or am I just imagining it? Sorry for the super long post. THANX EVERYBODY!!

I continued talking to him without knowing he had done that till few months later i found out  from a relative that he was married with a child on the way! I was devastated I thought we were going to work things out it was not going to happened! So disappointed i confronted him I TOLD HIM WHY COULD HE HAVE CONTINUED TO SPEAK TO ME WITHOUT TELLING ME WHAT HE HE HAD DONE!So we stopped talking for about 1 year he called me once again and I missed him so much I saw him and well where there was fire ashes remained.The only problem was I was now involved with a new guy. I felt awful I loved my new guy but I still had feelings for my ex the only thing is I knew it in possible because he was married! So I ENDED OUR LOVE TRIANGLE FOR ONCE IN FOR ALL! Few days ago I was headed for work in the entrance of my street there he was my ex waiting for me! I panicked I just continued driving he got in the opposite lane and began honking telling me to give him my # I REFUSED AND CONTINUED DRIVING! So I thought oh no he is going to know where I work so I did a u turn and went back home. I was waiting for about 30minutes he was passing by my house patrolling my street waiting for me to come out.Till it was about 1 hour I went out my house to work he wasn't there no more he had given up thank goodness! I just wonder why would he want to speak to me again if I MADE THINGS CLEAR IT WAS SO OVER? Do you think he still have feelings for me or was he looking for another fun time with his  ex?

One day he calls me up and says "Dude I have a friend that you would have so much in common with" Then I say ok and he gives me her number. I call/text her everyday. And she's into me because my friend texted me that she will go out on a date with me and other things. So, my family and I are planning to go to Illinois this Spring or Summer. I want to go just to see my friend and her.      If I do go on a date with her what would I say? We talk so much and laugh so much together and I just like her to much and don't want to screw up.      Thanks,      Robert
20090128105856AA21xd7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing girl situation that happened yesterday?	Ok so, this might sound lame but it made my day. I was on my way to class/lunch at college and I notice this girl I have seen times before that I always thought was very cute and wouldnt mind meeting. We were walking separate ways towards each other, and she had coffee in her hand (not relevant). Of course I looked at her, she looked at me, took a sip of coffee and smiled at me and I smiled back(I didnt even know I smiled until after she walked passed me). Now I dont know why she smiled at me. I think she has seen me before but never smiled. I dont know what to think. I keep thinking that she looked at me and smiled cause she is interested but then I think she just liked the coffee or saw someone else (though there was no one there) I would feel stupid to try to talk to her if it didnt mean anything. Thoughts? Thank

20090225133158AAcgsFx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Dealing with affair and marraige and children?	i have been married for 11 years, to a wonderfully supportive man.   He always asks how i am and he goes by the motto "talk about the problem before it becomes a problem" but i just cant talk to him.   We have 2 young boys, we both work but i have another part time job where my current boyfriend used to work. I have known my current boy friedn for over 18 years he is a bit older, but we communicate all the time and the 3ex is amazing, there is passion (I just dont want a physical relationship with my husband he is not unatractive) I am about to go overseas with my boy friend for 2 and a half weeks again (in the last 12 months I have gone away with him for 8 weeks). My husband knows about us, I try to tell my husband that this is all his fault as he neglected our relationship, he replies, whenever he tried to make time for us I always had work to do, or the kids would need tending to.   Admittedly he looks after the boys more than me as I am seem to be looking for other things to do, I stay out at least 1-2 times per week and get home early next morning, I am out with my boy friend (my husband thinks I am working - I hope)   My husband is loosing his job soon and he wants to look for a school hours job so he can look after the boys, but there is no way im supporting him. He goes on about when the boys are sick, I go out to dinner or lunch and he is left to look after them. Even when my husband does the clothes washing, he puts my clothes on a different line to be separate form his clothes and the boys clothes.   My husband said that he wants the boys, but I am not letting him have them, I at least want them 50-50.   My husband knows about my health issues herpies, Hepatitus C (through drug use 20 years ago) and I have to go for a hystroscopy and a D&C in early April.my husband and i have not had 3ex for over 1 year and he thinks that what i have done shows a lack of respect on him and the kids, him yes but i dont think i showed a lack of respect for the kids.my husband does not want to split the kids, he wants them

20090225085359AA2G78X	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with a toxic friend?	I think that one of my close friends is a toxic friend. I have noticed things in my friendship with her that proves this point. I am always having to take care of her and do stuff for her and she is a little bit on the bossy side too. I have been friends with this girl for almost a year now and I really don't want to loose her. She really is a good friend and I do like hanging around with her because she has a good sense of humor and my girls adore her and also we seem to have so much in common too. Sometimes I even feel invisible around her and not appreciated for the stuff that I do for her. My friend has alot of anxiety and is not all there. However she is also a christian as well too and goes to my church. I don't want to hurt her feelings. I am afraid to tell her how I have been feeling. We are the best of friends and I would hate to loose the friendship I have with her. She has done alot for our family as well too like she always invites us over to her house when my husband is working and she lets me borrow her stuff and clothes that don;t fit her anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
20090225085617AAo4E78	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need serious relationship advice...?	Ok, so I have been engaged since late Decemeber to the guy that I truly thought I was going to marry.    This past saturday he told me that he had a work meeting at 4pm and that he would be back at my place by 7pm to hang out... well at around 8 I still hadn't heard from him so I called his cell and got no answer. At about 9 I called his work and talked to a co-worker only to find out that there never was a meeting. So I continued to call his cell phone and he accidentally answered and I heard a girl talking... she said "just answer it then", and he said "no, it's my exgf... she won't leave me alone... i don't want to talk to her"... and that was it. So I got REALLY upset and text him and said that's it... I heard everything. Well, he called me around 10 telling me that he was out with some work friends, but didn't want me to know because he knew I would be upset. He said the girl was some girl that he met that night (which I think is weird because why would she be in his business about who he is talking to?)... and he also said they were at a restaurant just drinking and talking... a resaurant for 4 hrs?? And if that's where he was then why didn't I hear any background noise when he accidentally answered?      I was so upset... we talked about things and he said that he just needed time to himself to "think"... to decide if this is really what he wants because "forever is a long time"...   For whatever reason... I'm still sitting around waiting for an answer from him... everytime we talk he tells me that he DOES want to be with me, but he's not sure if it will lead to marriage... he says he just needs time to himself to "think"... I don't understand! If you love someone... you will be with them! I am so frusterated with myself... I just want answers! He told me he loved me last night, but just to give him time...       What does that mean??? What should I do???

20090225132528AANb2gO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me (Lot of text)?	Well theres this girl I work with sometimes and I get the vibe she likes me but I want to ask other people. When we work she always finds a way to poke me, put something on my head, she comments on my hair and eyes a lot. I always wore three black bands around my right wrist and she mimicked me by wearing three yellow bands on hers. She always ask me for my chapstick. One day when everyone at work was going to the movies she stole my phone and put her number in it. Then one day I was feeling sick she texted me after work making sure I was okay, and then we had a text conversation for like week and at the end of week she just called me out of the blue, saying she was just wondering what I was up to and she was just driving somewhere with her friends *really stupid conversation but she laughed a lot* She plays around a lot (poking and kicking) but she does it with the other guys too, but one day when we were both behind the counter side-by-side, she kind of "petted"/brushed my hair and I turned and looked at her, laughed a little and asked "What was that for?"(pretty stupid, i know...), she just said "I don't know" then she smiled and it quiet but not awkward and the manager came like 5 seconds after so we went back to work. Basically I just want to know if it sounds like shes just being a friend or what? either way I'm at least happy to know her!      Thanks,   Johnny T
20090225085729AAvRJli	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Advice please. Don't feel comfortable at Church. Different spiritual level than husband, what to do?	Hello! Any advice would be appreciated, I am feeling very distraught about this. I will give a little background info but try not to make it too long.   Husband and I have been married 5 years & have 3 kids. Over last few years my husband has been very deep into his spirituality and has had a calling to get into ministry work. Recently he was given an opportunity at a local church to become the Youth Director and while doing this he would be able to obtain his credentials to become ordained, this is a dream come true to him.   I feel so very uncomfortable at this church. They scream and shout and jump up and down and fall on the floor when the pastor prays over them and the thing that I have the hardest time dealing with is that they speak in tongues, this is so very foreign to me. I have expressed this concern to my husband and he says he is fine with me not gong to church however I feel that I am not being very supportive of him if I don't go. He is very supportive of me in all that I do. Do I put my "uncomfortableness" aside and go to church? What should i do?   My husband is black and I am white, the congregation is very diverse. I grew up in a small country town and not in the church. Although I have come a long way in my spirituality I don't think I will ever be on the level my husband is. I don't know how to balance this. Any suggestions?   Thanks so much!
20090225081359AA7LAwc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should a woman/child relive the past?	Should I forgive my father just to satisfy my mother?   If my biological father wants closer then he’s obviously not close to God right?    How do I justify that what I’m doing is wrong IF I’m okay with it?   My mother has raised us and remarried to give us a normal/peaceful up bringing just after she left my father many years ago. I have two brothers (late-20’s) and our biological father is trying to get to know us, now that his health is in jeopardy...so he says! I saw the horrible beatings/abuse my mother went through when I was six but even after all that, my mother feels compassion for our father. My brothers and our mother know exactly how I feel about our father. Our father is attempting to speak to our mother through my brothers and I have NOT allowed it, because it’s hurt my mother (emotionally) each time. My mother tells me that disrespecting my father over the phone is making matters worst but I tell her, if so then he hasn't’t changed like he claims! In many ways I’ve sheltered and protected my mother from her pain as I grew older. My STEP-DAD is the entire father I need and I’m happy.

So it has been about 5 years since the last time i saw him, he had just moved back home from florida. so we have been hanging out for the last few weeks, we had sex twice now. So i decided to ask him what his intentions were. He said that he wants a relationsship but he wants to hang out a little while longer but it will be really soon. So i said ok i feel the same. So everything was great we would text like all day long, hung out almost everyday. Then i went out of town with him for 2 days to see his brother, we had a great time like a little getaway. Then we cam back and everything went bad. Like instead of him texting me first thing, i wont hear from him until like 7 at night. He hasnt asked me to hang out, so i asked him to. He said yeah and i was with him for like 3 hours and then he was like ok well im gunna go to my friends house now.. So yesterday i did not text him at all, he finally text me around 7 and then i told him to call me a little later and he said he would and never did. So im not sure if he is trying to slow things down cuz he is getting caught up or if he is testing me to see how i will react if he cant always hang out with me or if hes just not intersted. Can someone help me with this one? Please and thank you.
20090128102710AAA5Y0w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do his friends look at me? ?	( yes, i like him a bit... )    i'm in highschool:    i've seen this one guy a lot at school for the past few years. he's kind of a loner & the type who doesn't have a  ton of girls after him.    it just so happens that i see this kid EVERYWHERE. we must live near each other because we see each other driving/ etc.    anyways, since i've seen him so regularly (he was in my class one semester too) i always tried to catch his eye just to be like 'hey, i know you'   & i feel kind of creepy that i see him everywhere (neither of us are "stalkers" or whatever.. it's just a weird coincidence )      but he always avoids eye contact and looks through me. (he's quiet/shy type)     anyways,  i've noticed that his friend seem to take notice of me. a couple of them always walk by me and try to say something. if i walk past a group of this guy's friends (he's never with them usually) they always stare at me and try to get my attention.     what does this mean?   people have said i would come across as "out of his league" ( i'm not at all like that... i'm just normal/pretty-ish and NICE : )    are his friends making fun of me for some reason? are these things related?

Well, the other night I was looking at my husbands phone, and I found messages of him calling another girl sexy, and asking her sexual questions! I just don't know what to do! And you know what the worst part is? He is about to deploy to Iraq in 4 days, FOR 18 MONTHS, with only 1 R&R of 2 weeks! They usually only go for 12, but they are making him go for an extra 6 months! I told him that I will forgive him, and I will give him another chance, but if it happens again I can't stay with him! I don't want him to leave while we are on bad terms, but I don't think I can get over it completely in 4 days! What is the best way to get over someone cheating? I have seen a change in him since it happened, and I know he feels bad, but I just can't bring myself to get over it. Any suggestions on how to put this behind us so that when he leaves we aren't on bad terms? Any answers would be greatly appreciated!

My youngest brother is getting married to a great girl who has been like part of the family already, my brothers and I are the majority of the wedding party and we think it would be nice to combine the bachelor and bacherlorette party and do something different. Our brother is just not the get him out to a strip club kind of guy. Just wanted to get some opinions on this idea   We are considering having a pot luck (campy I know but quite common in our group) and just having a nice meal together followed by a drinks and a roasting of the bride and groom. (As in poking fun of mildly) which a few people would get up and give little speeches and maybe even sing a couple of parodys tailored to the bride and groom.    An example would be saying like how she finally got him out of skinny jeans because she looks way better in them. A lot of friends in their circle have a good sense of humor and a knack for entertaining.    Then heading out to a bar for a bit of dancing for whoever is up for it.      Would like to here opinions and if you have organized one/or are in the middle of organizing, what did you do/are you doing?

20090225081745AAmpQBe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHAT SHOULD I DO? SHOULD I JUST LET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE WALK AWAY!!?	The love of my life sent me this email a month ago and I still think of him every day!!! I miss him like never I've missed anybody!!! I dont want to do anything and this is killing me... I've sent a couple of email during this month but he doesnt care!!!! Im not sure how can this happens.... ????  IM THAT STUPID THAT I STILL THINK HE IS MAKING A MISTAKE!!! OUR LOVE FELT SO REAL ???       Because you have the right to know:    Dropping things and moving on is, as somebody told me, a privilege that I have (or can I? ). At least I have come to realize that, in a not so usual way, but I would be lying if I said that I don't stop to think about you some times. I think because after all the connection was tangible between us. So that comes back to the point: how could I just start walking in the opposite direction? Just like that. I miss you because we spoke so much to each other, knew each others likes and dislikes, experienced things together that others can only dream of, were intimate like others can only envy us.        This is by far one of the strangest things that has happened to me. And yet it is so simple.        Simple in that person A meets person B they know each other and hang out and have galactic times together, but person B knew a person C a long time before knowing person A. In fact, person C was to person B a passion that never materialized, a person for whom he would walk to the end of the earth for them, a person that, in his adolescent days of drugs and rebellion, was an unreachable oasis in the center of his chaos (or the chaos of his oasis, the important thing was the magnetized attraction). One day they lose touch and person B goes on his way because the currents don't stop just because we are not feeling right. So person B and person A go out, they too have their ups and down, a rough time comes between them because this person B was not ready to give himself entirely. Person A lives and meets wonderful people, and she too discovers other parts to her being. And then like that, snap, person B and person A meet at a juncture in their lives where they might just make things work. They start to realize each other, much of what they have lived has made them stronger, more lucid, they understand little by little what they are being made of. Times flourish and everything is on a steady course, but (and this manifestation can be noticed in all things that we do in life --harmony must be made of discord, just like the arrow needs the bow) the tempest starts, and that tempest is no other than person B running into person C. And why? And who ordered things to be this way? It is not clear but the fact remains they have seen each other and the spark is genuine. Person B is confused because not to long ago he was living a fantastic time, he had the world by the balls, and person A was there to enjoy that with him. The house he was resting in was swept by the hurricane, the nuclear explosion goes off in his heart, an explosion of everything that he knew being meticulously divided into infinite pieces, all the certainty, all the basis of his living, he comes face to face with that which he understands: that perhaps we are not rulers of the heart. He struggles with this, he does not want to end what has taken effort to create. There is a heavy stone sinking everyday into the bottomless heart, he sees the stone collide with his inside, he hears it make waves and sink mercilessly to a dark water, the stone is none other then the feeling that the wings of his heart are stretching, that it is time to seize the skies once more, to face the hail and fly over the nameless nights. While the stone turns, his life turns, his head spins, person B is truly in a paradox, a contradiction that suffocates him: his emotions kick him in the face and say "hey ************, get up, pick your **** up, this is not going anywhere from here, the road is coming to a bend and this is not your stop" there would be no arguing, not when you have your *** kicked by your emotions. So person B has to stand up and go, move and be honest, move and be transparent, move and rise once more, and if he is prepared to meet a misfortune, he is prepared to pay the price of having walked away from person A, but he will handle it, he goes because he is not up to living a lie, he goes because he is beating to another tune, and if person B realizes in the end that he has lost, that he has left behind someone truly great, he will understand the episodes, the rage, the lunacy and violence, he will understand that this too was all part of living, the living that he must do and nobody else can do it for him.

20090225081814AARJ0jB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Like this guy and i dont know if he's interested on me or if he ever was!!?	Ok so i know this question has been asked so many times but here goes my question.   The guy that i like is in 10th grade and im a senior.. He's so cute, and he got really nice eyes.. The 1st time that i saw him i was like damn he's hot.and then as time went on i started thinkin of him more and more , so everytime that i would see him i would stare at him. I knew i didnt have a chance cauz it happens to me all the time and its not because if i am good looking or not its because im kinda shy and im not out yet, and im not feminist..and im scared to be rejected by him so i was like i know this is not gonna work out so i got over him, and i was never really deep in love with him as other guys.. and he'd be looking at me like mad everytyme i would see him on the hallways.. But now everything's so different cauz now when i see  he stares at me idk if he wonders if still like him. I see him when he's near he's locker and he turns his head to look at me when i pass by.. and when im walking to my class and he's ahead of me he turns to see me but im wondering if he ever liked me because he seems sad when he looks at me now..  the other day in lunch period i was waiting on the line with my friend and one of his friends was there next to me and he cut so we were like next to each other and we touched each other arm to arm and kinda hand to hand and he just looked at me quickly but he didnt move..our hands were touching so then he went ahed of me and i was behing him, and we were really close and i kinda touched him with my tummy and i felt him lol... and he was looking at his phone a lot times and everytime he did that he was touching my tummy with his elbow and arm at the same time.. It felt so good like i dint wanna it to end anyway when he got his food he kinda turned his head   and then i looked at him back. it was real cute the situation .. I dont think i got feelings for him now but i really like him and would like to go out with him.

I tried to explain myself as best as i could... Hope to hear some answers soon =)
20090225082327AANq2WQ	Family & Relationships;Family	How to cope with news that my father is terminally ill?	Last summer I found out that my dad was sick and had cancer of the liver  (he did a lot of smoking and drinking over the years). Thing is he was on the list for a liver and I thought things were going well until a few weeks ago when I spoke to my stepmother and she told me she thought the doctors were going to take him off the list.  Well, he just confirmed it yesterday and said that there is nothing more that Mt. Sinai can do for him.  He said he's accepted it and is just hoping to make it to the summer so he can sit on in the sun a few times.     I just don't know what to do, I sat there on the phone and couldn't speak.  He said he is going to a different doctor on Friday and maybe they can give him something to help him last a few months.  I know he didn't want to tell me because I am getting married in a few weeks but I needed to know, and now I can't help but be sad and I feel like the feeling of losing my father for good is taking over.  I wasn't able to talk to him for years over a huge family misunderstanding and we just started talking again right as I found out he was sick.   What I'd like to know is: Is it possible that he will have a few months left? How do I cope? And how do I tell my children that their grandfather is dying?

20090225082611AA3RKUF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Nanny dilemma please help!?	I have been asked to go for a one week trial with a family. I am confidant to get the position, and have spoken to the family regularly.       They have invited me to come meet everyone for a week, paid trial. Which is great only it is in a different country within the UK.       They are going on holiday for a week after my trial and i will be starting the day they return (a sunday) hopfully.       I was wondering if it would be okay to ask them, if im successful whether i could look after the house while they are gone so i can save money and not have to travel back home and then back again and i can move in and sort my stuff out as they will only be away for like 5 days.       Thanks in advance

20090225083206AA9I3Vd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in my case?	Ok i'm a 25 yr old guy who's never been on date, had a girlfriend, or has done anything with a girl. I'd like to actually go on a date to see if it's just not as big a deal as i've heard or am I really missing out? As far as looks go i'm told i'm not a bad looking guy i'm just shy and my dress attire is between preppy and casual (depending on my mood) but also i'm a bit of a nerd and I think the ladies can easily see that... I collect comics, action figures, i'm a gamer, listen to video game music and am obsessed with anything having to do with Star Wars and DC Comics (can't wait for the Watchmen movie!!!) I have a few friends who pretty much grill me about it but it's cool my ideal friday night's include me and World of Warcraft. And last but not least another part of me feels like I should remain 'single' for the rest of my life! what should I do???
20090225083255AAaFt84	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help, my wedding guest list is getting out of control!?	I never thought this would be an issue because I've always been a person with the "i'm going to do what I want and don't care what people think" attitude.  However, I feel like our wedding has quickly gone from the small, intimate wedding I want, to an outrageous guest list because we "have to" invite certain people and because my parents feel the need to invite all these extra people.  My parents are footing most of the bill, and just say they it doesn't bother them to pay extra in order to invite extra people.  But for me it's not so much about money as our space at the venue is limited and I don't want our guests to feel like packed sardines.  Not to mention I don't want to spend my entire night feeling obligated to socialize with people instead of having fun dancing.  I started out wanting just immediate family and close friends, and then decided all our aunts, uncles, and cousins should be invited because that is the 'proper' thing to do (note, we have A LOT of them too!).  Now my parents want all my great aunts and uncles to be invited, as well a several of their friends, who I don't really consider their friends because they don't hang out with these people anymore.  They say they don't want to hurt people's feelings by not inviting them.  Are people who haven't seen me in over 5 years really going to care that much if they are invited to my wedding or not?  Help!  How do i make this about our day again, and not everyone else's???     *Note, right now our list is at about 180 (I originally wanted to keep it under 100), and adding the great aunts and uncles and more of my parents' friends will bring it close to 200.

20090225085052AAIodta	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can we Change Save the Date Info?	We had originally booked a church for our ceremony that was a little out of the way, so decided to bus our guests to and from a hotel near the church. When we sent out the Save the Dates, we included the hotel information and block of rooms at the pick-up hotel.       Now, the bus has fallen through (they won't deliver to our outdoor reception site, which they failed to tell us until it was contract negotiation time). We are considering changing churches to one that has a more direct route to our reception site so guests can drive themselves, but we're concerned that some guests may have already booked at the "out of the way" hotel.       Is there any way to re-send Save the Dates or communicate the new hotel/church information? We're worried about inconvenience of re-booking and confusion for our guests.

20090225131518AAKDOqH	Family & Relationships;Family	Hatred from family & boyfriend - should I leave or stay with my infant's son's father?	I have a four month old son with my boyfriend of 14 months (stop counting on your fingers :0), we've known each other as friends for the past 6 years).  He is 7 years younger than me.        My mother hates his family, feelings left over from her youth & relationship with his mother.  His mother couldn't care less, has no clue my mom doesn't like her, and says she loves me.        BF hates my mother and is slowly coming to hate the rest of my family.  He says they treat me like a child and him like idiot trash.      We live together.  BF does not help with my son at all (and I'm very tired - obviously) besides the occasional tickling, making faces, and handing me things (bottles, diapers, etc), sometimes with an irritated comment that he says is a joke.  He admits he can be an butt.  He also promises that he is scared of small babies and will be more involved when the baby is bigger.      My mother hates him for that and that he likes to spend money too much (he hasn't matured yet on financial matters), and has a short temper.  She wants me to kick him out, sell my house, and move myself and my son in with her or my son.  She even told me today that she found his dog a home.      I've promised to think about it but I'm pulled in both directions.  I never met my father and I always wanted my children to know theirs.  BF is very good with his toddler nieces & nephews but he stays away from the newborns.        Should I wait and see what happens when my son is a toddler?  Tell my mother what?  What to do?  Any suggestions?
20090225131539AArJAfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a good way to ask out a girl?	Ok, so there is this girl that I've been liking for a while.      I just came up with this idea in school.      Maybe, I can write her a series of 3 letters. Given throughout 1 every 3 days?      The first one, being about the meaning of her name.      The second, being one about her physique, and her smartness, that could only be read backwards.      Third, tell her to be ready to recieve a rose from her admirer, but only if she could be kind enough to phone him with a number given included on the letter.      I know her pretty well, we talk a bit, it's not like she's a complete stranger.      Do you think she would enjoy this?      Do, you think that it's a good, unique, creative way to ask her out?

20090225133040AA2DuLC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you ever see you old love - and your heart still melts?	After my divorce 3 years ago.  I dated a man for nearly 1 year.   He broke up with me about 10 months ago.  The first time I met him, my heart skipped a beat.   I was sooo in love with him.  We dated for nearly a year and he was having financial troubles and said he and his kids and me and my kids would be better off breaking up  and maybe when we are both at better times in our lives things will work out.  Well I was heart broken, because I thought the reason wasn't good.   In either case, after almost 10 months I hear from him.  Asking me to lunch.   I met him at the restaurant and my heart skpped a beat once again.     He said we should go out again, but it has been a week and other than a thanks for lunch - you look great and we should see each other again.  I haven't heard a word from him.       My guess is he still isn't that interested.    But I can't believe how my heart just melted seeing him again.    What do you think of this?

He told me that he wants to have feelings for me, but can't. Well ever since then we have been hanging out pretty much every weekend. Heck, I even go to church with him and his family. People think we are a couple, but I have to make it clear that we are just friends because that's what he wants. I'm so just confused on what his true feelings are. We talk about everything with each other. So what do I do? He already knows my feelings and I truly think that he is just confused by his feelings for me. Even the other night he asked me if I was going to spend the night at his place and I do, but nothing happened.

20090225135951AAidO2y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i save this relationship?	alright ive asked questions before about how to stop being controlling. im gonna add a little more detail to try and get better answers. here are the major points.   1.) its a long distance relationship, so til i can be home permanently, counseling is out of the question.   2.) when we first started dating, i was not like this. it started about a year ago when she knew i was going to propose to her soon but she still became attracted to another guy and pursued talking to him.      i typically control things that better her appearance and i believe its because im not there all the time to see her and what she does. i dont believe i have trust issues with her because i dont think shes going to cheat on me if i were to stop being controlling about these things. i think its more jealousy than anything because other guys can see her every day and i cant. i also thought i wasnt exactly controlling because i dont think she needs to better her appearance when im not there since she shouldnt have anyone to impress. basically this relationship is on the line because of this. its either i stop being controlling and we stay together, or she leaves me for good. i dont want that at all because i love her more than anything but at the same time she made me this way and its extremely hard to change for that reason. is there a happy medium we can reach? i really need any help that can be provided to me for this.

20090128100134AA3T9fK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Seems hopeless and impossible to get out of?	I will be 21 next month and feel very lonely because i do not have any friends (Which dont really bother me as much as every person ive come across is either a user or a lier) and have never had a girlfriend. I know its still young and theres plenty of time but hearing "wait and she will magicly appear" gets old fast.      Through reading up on this i have discoverd you need the following things:      Confidence - The most important one, however i do not have a scrap of this. The only way to get confidence is to do it and suceed, but without any confidence attempting in the first place is impossible. So im trapped.      Humor/Interesting - I cant do this, i have the personality of a plank of wood im afraid.      Desireable - Women want men that other women want. Ever noticed that one guy that isnt really doing anyhing but has women competing over him? I dont have this either.      Looks - Not extremely important but to some degree they are needed. I never used to consider myself as ugly but being out in public and noticing guys alot worse off looks wise get all the smiles and winks from women walking by while ive never even had that i must be horrid.      So without all these things and unable to get these traits you are basicly .....stuffed.

20090128100855AA4NQ1m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I selfish? Birthday....?	Hi everyone!      I am really struggling with extreme guilt as of recently and I was wondering if anyone can understand where I am coming from or am I being completely and utterly selfish.       My 25th birthday is in a few days and I have been really, REALLY excited about celebrating this profound date with all my friends. Well, my boyfriend kept saying we had to celebrate my birthday on a Thrusday "because he had something special for me" Well, of course i was a little upset b/c I want to spend this birthday with everyone that i love! (quick backstory: my family is not a healthy one. My whole life i have had to supplement friends for family. I don't expect even a call from them during this time.)  So I tell my friends that my party is canceled and moved to thrusday. Well, most of them can't make it due to work, school etc. OK. so my bf tells me he is taking us to Florida. AMAZING RIGHT?!? Well, 1. I have a fear of flying. 2. we are staying at my grandma's condo. (No she will not be there, ha!)   So heere I am feeling gulity b/c I don't really want to go. I really wanted to celebrate with my loved ones and friends on that 1 day out of 365 that it's all about me :)   Instead i feel like this trip is for my boyfriend, a free condo, score! and not really for me. I have to take 2 days off of work and it's a new job since i was laid off before the new year. I am just really torn. Help! After I told him how i felt understandbly he got upset and sees me as ungrateful. That's the last thing I want him to feel.       Help!!

Ive previously gotten out of a horrible relationship where the guy was on drugs and treated my so badly. And recently I met a guy that I wasn't going to give the time of day because of he's a lot older- but after I got to know him I've really started to like him. I've been being careful- haven't slept with him- we just seem to have clicked really well from the start he doesn't look or seem his age in his personality and he's still in school too. I'll be 20 in 2 months so it might not sound as bad then- but I need some advice- is this too big an age difference??

20090128101051AA93Vuv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The guy who always makes me blush,noticed my embarrassment today and gave me a little smile.What does it mean?	I work in a cafe and this guy comes in regularly,and we had some awkward moments a few months ago,mainly cause i got a bit nervous and red while serving him (he reminds me of an ex-crush of mine who broke my heart hehe),and i guess he could see that and got embarrassed a bit,so i have been trying to kind of avoid eye contact since in order to avoid any awkwardness and stuff lol.   But the last time i was in a weak moment i guess, as i blushed again big time,but i still managed to look at him and saw a little smile on his face (for the first time ever),and it was obvious that he saw my reaction,and it was obvious that his smile was a reaction to that...   I just cant decide if his smile means that he was "laughing at me" or feeling pity for my beetroot face:),or if he kind of likes me but is shy and embarrassed too..He smiled at me once again before leaving the shop,and i smiled back a little although i was still embarrassed.   I have this feeling that maybe i should do something to change the situation,because clearly its gonna happen again.Should i just make a joke about it?Or tell him the truth that he reminds me of someone so much?Or continue pretending that its normal behaviour????:))

20090128101828AALMTD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	About a six year age difference....?	I'm 17 and a senior. Only have four months until I graduate.    My ex and I recently broke up after just four months. We went through so much in such a short amount of time and I was never happy. To me, when your 17, it's the time in your life where you can live and experience new things.    Well, please don't judge me, I just would like to know others opinion. My exes brothers best friend texted me one night. I didn't think anything of it because I was with my ex and am sometimes am oblivious to when people flirt.    I realized he was because I was talking to him about me and my ex. I told him that I just want to be with someone that I can be happy with. I'm tired of being with people that care nothing except for sex.    (My ex had no car, no job, and lived at home. He has been out of school for two years. He's 19. He just had nothing going for himself and didn't seem to want to try.)   So anyways, this new guy, Kevin, has a job, has his own place, has a vehicle, seems nice, etc.    Me and my ex ended up ending it mutually and Kevin took me out. I had such a good time and my stress is completely gone.      Ok, the bad thing, he is 24. In Texas, it is legal at 17. Plus my parents approve because he is such a good guy. He lives in the apartment below us so they have gotten to know him before we began talking.    I just don't really know what to think. I'm not completely naive, i realize that sex is a big thing with him. I have told him that I have rushed into previous relationships and that I didn't want to with him. So far, things are good but I still wonder about what to think about it all. I guess I don't know if things will be ok.

20090128110858AA5UUOb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are men so uncommitted ?	I have been in an on-off again uncommitted "relationship" with a guy for a long time now. He's had sex with others, but I haven't had sex with other men, I haven't even talked to other guys. I feel lost now because he says he doesn't want to be in a committed serious relationship with me. He says he still loves me, that he cares about me. We're still young, hes 18. He says if he gets in a serious relationship, he might cheat on me because hes an unsettled person and that I don't deserve that. But if you love someone, shouldn't you take a chance? I'm just confused. So my question is, what's the real reason he doesn't want to settle down?
20090128110915AAR56my	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need Men's Opinions: Why is my Boyfriend doing this?	I am in quite a predicament. I just don't understand what my boyfriend is doing. We've been together for a year and a half, and 90% of the time we are awesome. He is attentive, caring, charming, the whole she-bang. The problem is that every few months he freaks out and says that "something's not right" and initiates "The Talk." Then (usually the next day,) he is back to being the amazing boyfriend.  He's 30, and this is his first serious, stable relationship. Typically his freakouts occur around big milestones. His other relationships were all less than six month affairs ending in huge trainwrecks. I think this has led me to accepting some behaviour I normally wouldn't have.     We were doing fabulously up until Christmas, but then after New Year's he started to get distant. He said that he needed to catch up on work he'd been putting off during the holidays, so I gave him his space and let him know that when he had time to go out to let me know. The only problem was that he kept making himself busy with work, his friends, etc. At one point I had seen him once in a three week span. Obviously the bedroom was not such a great situation, and neither was anything else. He was distant, noncommunicative, etc. I tried to be understanding and cut him the slack/distance to deal with whatever he was obviously struggling with.     Last week I emailed him inviting him out for dinner Saturday to one of his favorite restaurants. He was flirty back but said he wasn't sure what he was doing, he might be working. I said that was fine, I would call him after my hair appointment. He beat me to the punch on Saturday, texting to ask if he could come over in a couple hours. I was suspicious, since the restaurant was closer to his place, but said sure. So he showed up, and I had just finished baking him cookies because I could tell he'd had a rough couple weeks. He looked upset and kept hugging me tightly. He sat on the couch, pretty much avoiding looking at me, and continued his weird distance. I asked if he was okay, and he said "yeah." I asked if he was sure, and he said "yep." So then I asked "Are we okay?"  He looked even more upset, shook his head, and said "I don't think this is working out." I was shocked, and blurted out "What part of this isn't working?" and he said he didn't know, but feels like something's missing, and not right. It led to a three hour discussion, both of us crying our way through it.      He said a lot of things, here's a quick summary of what I got:   -He doesn't feel like he treats me the way he should. Then he feels like crap about it.  -Something is missing. It just doesn't feel right.  -He loves me. (I asked him if he was sure about that, but was informed that I was being mean and of course he was sure.)  -This is the best relationship he's ever had, but he feels like he's confused and needs to sort his sh!t out.      After the talk, the pressure was relieved and we actually had a good night. I thought he would leave, but he ended up staying with me. We did the horizontal uh-oh twice that night, and it was everything it hasn't been for months. It was close, connected, it moved the bed four feet across the floor without either of us noticing...  So then I woke up Sunday and figured he would leave when he got up. But no, he stayed for a repeat performance and then hung out watching tv with me. He mentioned that he had to leave in about an hour to go do a job, so I said fine. But then he canceled the job and spent the rest of the day with me. He invited me to go visit the puppy at his parent's house, so we went to do that and I figured he'd drop me home after. But then he asked if I wanted to spend the night at his place and he'd take me to work Monday. So I said alright, sure.  It was great, but then Monday I got to thinking about how nothing was actually resolved in the talk. And I wrote him a huge email. I told him that I can't sit around waiting for him to decide that he wants to be with me. I told him if he wants to take a break then we can do that, but that we need to have an end date on the break going in where we'll decide which way we're going. I said that relationships need time put into them so they have something in the tank when the going gets rough - and disappearing for three weeks is an easy way to make things fall apart. I also told him that I need to be able to trust that when things come up for us, we can talk about them without it automatically meaning that we're breaking up. I made sure to tell him that I do love him, but I can't live my life in limbo like this.      I sent that Monday morning. It's now Wednesday, and I haven't had a peep back. So what's the dealio? Should I just give up on all of this and walk away from someone that I love but obviously isn't handling things well, or do you have an explanation for all this crazy behaviour that he is somehow unable to articulate?

I know the economy is bad, and I guess I should be grateful to have a job paying $22 an hour, but I don't like my manager...really dislike him.   I don't like my co-worker, and the environment depresses me.   I'm not sure I could leave and make as much, or get a job at all in this economy.      Some say...stick it out, most people don't like their jobs. Others say go find something else or go back to school.      *sighs*

20090128135943AAQA65F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey, guys why is he doing this after all the hints he's given me?	Well, for about 5 months now, i've noticed that a guy in my class, which i know quite well, has been quite "attached" with me, and he is always in my group and every time i text someone, e.g. maybe a boy;usually it is, he always go up to me and push my phone down [my phone is a slide-up] to prevent me from texting the person i want to text to and then say "Don't waste your credit over someone who's not worth it." and i'm like not worth it??? :S   Then he'll give me a smile usually or talks to me.       But today at IT he had to be with someone [a girl] and they both look good each other...i looked at them both again and they were laughing and all that, talking to each other in a lovey-dovey way and he saw me looking at them both, but he carried on talking to her.    Did i miss my chance? or what was he thinking?      I know im quite slow at things like these.. =]      thanks.   ~x~

20090128115009AAmivX3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, can you do that too?	There's something i just can't figure out, though my gf says most girls are just like this. She says girls reflexes are faster than guys are. I used to tell her no way, now i just don't say anything. But i want to know from you if you've ever been able to do this like she easily does. We would play around to see who does have the quicker reflexes, her or me. So we would each try to slap the others face, just once, and not hard, just fast. Turns out we're both right handed. She has got me on the cheek EVERY SINGLE TIME, but she has been able to block my right hand out several times. And i don't know how she does it. She says she can just tell when i'm going to do it. She says girls can. She also says guys are too slow. Is this true? I mean, can you block it? I thought we could! But i haven't yet.

20090128113110AAtX2vd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when your girlfriend is too short for breeding?	My girlfriend Miep and I have been together for two years.       She is wonderful in many ways. Very intelligent, witty, attractive, funny, etc. She is also a pure European.      She is short though. We are talking 5'1 here. I mean, Jesus Christ, I'm surprised we can eat out at any bar or restaurant other than Chuck E Cheese.      It's like having a living Willy Wonka performance right in front of my eyes every day.       Being that she is short, and I am actually smarter than her, I think it's time that I move on and find someone better to breed with.       It's just that it's very difficult in the United States to find a quality woman. Most are so loose, and not educated.       I'm torn.

20090128150550AAS3iPB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why are bridesmaids expected to pay for their dresses?	I know that this is customary, but I've always wondered why it is so.  Any answers?      I just can't ever imagine asking anyone to pay THAT much money to be in MY wedding.  I have my own envision of how my wedding will go down and because all I expect of my bridesmaids is their presence up on the altar with me, this request will not be made.        How did this custom arise and what is a tactful way to decline a bridesmaid invitation if you can't afford to be one? (I'm fairly young and none of my friends are married, so this is not an issue, but I'm just curious).

I can't remember the name of the subject but in the book it showed two people that looked almost exactly alike. I have a friend named Megan. When I went to TGI Fridays I saw a waitress that I thought was her. She had about the same height, hair color, hair style, body and everything looked about the same. It wasn't her but it looked a lot like her. Then I have a friend named Amber who says she get's told a lot she looks like Vanessa Hudgens. I noticed she also looks like Selena Gomez.

20090128140557AAxBMpj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I stop thinking about her?	Over two years ago, I kinda fell for a girl I met in the dorms at college. We slept together after knowing each other for only a week or so- we were drunk, just ya know kind of that crazy freshmen thing. Anyways, we've hooked up only twice since. She had a serious boyfriend at the first time, who was her fiance the second time, and her husband the third time. I know, I know.. bad.      I was very honest with my boyfriend about the two times I "hooked up" with her while we were dating, and he is okay with it because he knows that nothing is going to come of it and he doesn't think its "cheating."      ANYWAYS- This amazing girl and I no longer speak. Its been months. But I can't stop thinking of her! Just randomly, here and there- something will remind me of her and my heart will ache, because I remember how things were. Her boyfriend-fiance-husband treated her badly, emotionally abusing her constantly and it breaks my heart to think of him hurting her still.       I truly think that she is with him because it is what all of her hometown friends and family expected, and its sort of her way of following what seems to be "the good thing" to do.       I don't know what to do, because there are so many details to this situation that I don't even want to go into, because its almost pointless. I just don't know why I keep thinking of her lately. I don't know what to do. I mean, I live with my boyfriend, we're so close. I shouldn't be having these thoughts! Help? :(

20090128150537AAEP65l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My friend left her husband of 18 yrs, making some crazy decisions.  How can I help her get her head straight?	She married him when she was 16 & pregnant.  Made it through 18 years of marriage.  She left her husband over suspicions of his sexuality, long story but basically he's Bi and after she left him found out he had been cheating on her throughout their entire marriage.  I don't blame her but here's what's bothering me.        She had gastric bypass, got thin and then left him. I guess one could say she didnt have enought self-esteem to leave him before. She was a stay at home wife and had never worked in her life.   So she gets a job, gets her drivers license, gets in shape and leaves her husband.  Immediately (like two weeks later) she has a "friend" that's she's been friends with for a long time. Her "friend" turns into her boyfriend.  She gets a boob job and is out on weekend get-a-ways spending money she does not have.  She lives paycheck to paycheck (barely) and now is determined to have a baby.  She has her tubes tied so she has to have invitro  ($10,000 mind you) and it seems to me like her boys, age 17 and 13, have taken the back burner.  She claims they dont want to live with her and that she has to force them to even have lunch with her.  She says it's a teenage thing.  Anyway, I'm very concerned about her.  Yes, she's going to school and is taking a step in the right direction but I have a feeling this guy she's totally in love with is only her rebound guy. I think she's only experienced that negative relationship so she thinks this mediocre one is the best thing that's ever happened to her.     She's never dated anyone else other than her husband and I dont know how to get her head out of the clouds before she does something really damaging.      I'd like to know what people think.  Am I worrying for nothing? What can I say? Do I just let her fall on her face and let her learn from her mistakes?
20090128141337AAhgslW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend always flirts with my ex-boyfriends?	ok, i have this best friend i'm starting to get fed up with! The minute I break up with a boy or he breaks up with me my best friend will latch herself to the person and flirt shamelessly (i.e. tickle, grope, hold hands,call,hug) right in front of me! She's done this with every boyfriend I've ever had! If i confront her about it she'll call me jealous and ignore me for days. Whenever i see her she brags about the wonderful relationship she has with all of them and complain about how much they hit on her. It's very hard to watch her doing this and it drives me insane how nobody can see through her!! What can I possibly do about this situation??

20090128121318AA1XAv4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bad boyfriend? PLEASE HELP, MATURE ANSWERS!?	-i know i posted this a while ago but my computer wouldnt let me read the replies-      I was in a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend until he got arrested 5 years ago. Im 25 & he is 27. He was my first love & when he got locked up i couldn't stop crying. He in a dangerous gang, We have some mutual friends(not the gang ones) and whenever some of my friends go for a night out and he's there with friends i try keep my distance from him but i keep getting the feelings i had for him come back to me. When i leave he follows me out to talk. although i still love him i think i did the right thing. Anyway whenever im dancing he never takes his eyes off me,He gets into my face a lot if i dance with other guys, he grabs my arm if i walk away, he has never once hit me though. My friends are under the impression he knows he screwed up badly and he doesn't want anyone else to have me, that he is obsessed with me and that can be a major problem when i am dancing or with other guys would that be true?. He keeps telling me he wants me back and will never let me go again. If im at a bar or something he will sometimes come over a put his arms around me & try kiss me or whisper in my ear, but i walk away then he will try to make me look him in the eyes and tell him i dont love him, which i cant do.He even now has my name tattooed on the side of his neck. I think im attracted to these kind of men because my father is in jail & he is one of the head men in a Latino Blood Gang. Im starting counseling soon so maybe that will help?!   Please give me some advice if you can, thank you so much      -i know a lot of you are going to attack me but all im looking for is some advice-

I got this disease just at 27 and things are getting worse day by day (although continuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering). From my experience, I believe, family life will import bads rather than goods. I agree; even finding someone will be difficult (although came acrooss 1/2 recently, showing casual interest without knowing much about me). I have no regrets and seek no sympathy, I am just trying to be pragmatic and fair with me and others.

20090128125936AANaHzr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS only!!!! What exactly does he want?	few weeks ago my school club went to a college. I danced with "A" at the dance for our club. After his friend remarked how me and A flirted the whole weekend. Fri I was txting "A" and then he said that his friend said we (as in me and A) were going to make out that night at the dance. And then he wrote "Just out of curiosity, would u have?". I didn't know to say so I was like yeah maybe, would you? He wrote he would have hooked up with me.I said I would have too but not in front of all those people. He said we could have went somewhere else to get away from them. Then he asked do you think maybe it could happen again in the future?I said it maybe definitely could.      He kinda ignored me after that then yesterday on fb someone wrote in my honesty box and said I was cute. I said thanks and they asked if I would rather like hook up with someone or date them. Then today they said this: "If u were at a party or something and u saw a guy u wanted to hook up with. would you go ahead an do it or would u have to be dating to kiss him." I responded to that and then they said "yah i get it. u know ur a really sweet person xD".      Do you think it was A?I got my braces off and I saw him looking at me for like 5 min while I was talking to a friend and smiling. Does he want to kiss or date? I'd rather date. We're 15.

20090128120810AAd5lEs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my ex do this for me?	For my 21st birthday i invited my ex to a party i had at my cousins house, we've been broken up for more than 2 years and he has a gf. He brought his gf with him to my birthday but later dropped her off and came back. I got drunk and the whole night i was really really mean to him. I told him "i dont even like you" "your not a friend" "go away!" i kept asking "what are you doing here". Basically I was MEAN, but yet he stayed and took care of me even though i had other people already taking care of me. He cleaned up after the party, he made sure i drank water, took me out to get some air, he held me in an intimate way as others described and helped me walk and basically took the initiative to take care of me. He even came to my house after to take care of me still until i unknowingly kicked him out because i started crying and told him that he hurt me. Why did he do this? He really could have just left. How much can an ex still care for you and just because he cares does that mean there's feelings involved to? That night/morning he kept texting my friend who was also watching me to make sure i was ok over and over again      2 days later he IMed me and told me everything that happened and i apologized for everything and he kept saying that i shouldnt be sorry. And then he said that I put a smile on his face that day. He admitted that he was scared to come because he was afraid my cousins would hurt him, but regardless he still came through.      thanks in advance

20090128123743AArLkOe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Young Love! But is it unrequited? (with pic) pleas answer!?	Dose this guy like me? We talk on the bus joke around and stuff. There are 4 girls my age on our bus we all sit together and the guys our age sit behind us. When the guys talk to the girls he ignores any comments he gets from the others and just starts a conversation with me. It's not me that says this my friends complain that he gives all his attention to me. But He recently said I was scary. When I said I was nice he said . 'Next time your nice call me. Prove it.' was he trying to give me his number.      Would there be anything about my looks that would make a guy not want to date me?       http://www.interpals.net/photo.php?pid=6...

20090128131124AAQ6mEz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does THIS make me shallow?	I had answered a question here recently that asked if you would date someone who is overweight. I said no. And my reason was because I have to have a physical attraction to someone I date, yes personality is the most important thing, but a physical attraction is important also. So how does that make me shallow?       It's not like I belittled an overweight person. Being shallow is wanting to be with someone or be friends with them based purely on their looks.
20090128125851AA3yxOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you consider yourself shallow or honest?	Here's a scenario. My friend Chase wanted me to get with his friend James. I'm a VERY picky person. Yes, personality is the bigges thing to me, but I HAVE to have a physical attraction to someone if I date them. Well, this James guy is pretty big. He has a kinda cute face, but he's overweight, and I'm sorry, but I'm not attracted to that! So, Chase got mad at me because I said "Well, he's just really not my type." So Chase called me shallow! I had the belief that being shallow was dating people PURELY on their looks. I think I was just being honest...            So, what would you consider yourself? What are your thoughts on it?

20090128134556AAtc40e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Ex-Boyfriend Broke My Heart??? Advice?	-In an open relationship with him for four years due to my frequent abroad studies. Whenever I was around him he'd make me feel special, as if I was the only girl he loved.      -Yes, sex was involved.      -Before we got into an official relationship, mutual friends were telling me that he was also seeing another girl. They never had sex, I know this for a fact.      -This girl wanted a serious relationship with him. He told her didn't want that at the moment, two months later he gets with me--officially.      -He'd tell me his feelings toward me and stayed faithful through it all. One night I get drunk and kiss another guy, I felt so ashamed and spilled everything to him. Of course he breaks up with me and puts on his Facebook status: "The Sex was great."       -A month later he gets another girl friend, not the girl whom wanted a commitment. They break up six days later and everyone said it was because of the girl who wanted a commitment, he tried kissing her.      -Now he puts on his Aim Status: "I will never forget you." Everyone says it's toward the girl who doesn't want a commitment, 'cause she has been ignoring him lately.      Everything he said to me, did it mean anything at all? All the sweet candy coated words? PLEASE?       I am so hurt because I love and miss him so much. Advice? He hasn't been talking to me at all even though I've apologized more than 3 times.

I love my boyfriend to death, but ever since we've been dating I feel like I've really changed myself for him and I'm just not as happy as I used to be because of it. I stopped wearing certain clothes he didnt like (I like really outrageous and provacative stuff and he likes calmer, classier clothes) and I dyed my hair brown for him and I used to be blonde and I loved being blonde and having colored streaks. He didnt exactly tell me to do this stuff but he hinted at it "I"ve always liked brunettes better than blondes" "I hate when girls wear clothes that looks too goth" and stuff like that. I mean I'm not asking what you think of my style, maybe you hate it as he does, but i dont know what to do. I really want to wear the outrageous stuff and have wild hair again.      Thoughts?

20090128115355AAkupEv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong for doing this?	I was sort of dating this guy who is only 21. A week or 2 into us knowing each other he told me he had a kid who when he was right out of high school with this girl, but things happened and she didnt want the kid seeing him (he hadnt seen the kid for like 2.5 years) So things didnt work out with me and this guy for other reasons and the night I told him I no longer wanted to date him he ends up telling me he married the girl he had a baby with and is still married to her. AND she had another kid which is most likely his. Now if thats not enough drama, he has just got back in touch with his wife and kids and he now helps her take care of them. Now heres my question...is it wrong for me to always break plans with him when he ends up telling me he wants to hang out but is watching the kids? Mind you I have no kids and am not the type to want to hang out with kids and their parents.

He shows up with a friend, and when we got close enough, he starts talking to me. I found him really friendly and we became friends instantly. After that, we walked together heading towards my house. he said "want a ride?" i looked at him surprised "umm, okay." so we kept talking i hadnt noticed his shiny red porcshe, which i didnt believe was his at first, it was so freaken nice!!! anyways, we decided to hang out a little longer and then he introduced me to skateboarding.        the end.      now tell me your story!!

I have liked this guy for ages, and the other weekend he came back to mine after a night out (I'm 23 he's 25)      Trouble is, I was really drunk, and I was in a silly-drunk mood. We did some sexual things, but I was soooo lazy and he did most of the work, then I just got really tired and I asked him to pass me my make-up remover and pyjamas so I didn' t have to get out of bed for them :( and the worst thing is, I actually put my pyjamas on (they weren't exactly sexy!).      I am kind of embarrassed about it, and still really like him. We've been talking since it happened, but do you think I've blown it by acting like I did?      Thanks :)

She laughs at all my jokes, and she really seams to listen when I'm talking.       She also is very funny, like really, really funny! She's awesome! And I would really love to go out with her.       Is there any ways I can tell if she would go out with me?      Btw, I don't think I'm ugly, lol. and I play Football, basketball, baseball. So, I'm not lazy.       Thanks for your help guys! one last thing, I respect women, I'm not going to be like a perv if I go on a date. Thanks!

For example:      This girl went on and on about how her and the guy she was dating kept doing things at the same time and how they were like...mentally connected or something. My answer to her question was the word for word definition of "coincidence". But then she went and deleted it.      Doesnt that just burn your biscuits??

20090128150100AABd6nS	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my family want me to fail?	because im a slow worker, it takes time for me to grasp motivation and ability to do my work faster. so i might seem like a lazy person but im not. i do good on all my assignments that I work on. i dont even have to show my parents to make them belive me, they seen them before and dont care. they only care about my bad marks, but i have really good marks too. my bad marks are my weeknesses, which are like math. and my good marks are other stuff like history. sure math is more important, but im trying. so thats not the point, ever since i was really little, my family never enoucrgaed me to make me dreams come true, my mom trashed me dreams as an actress when i was 12, saying i cant act, and im too shy, when in reality im not as shy as before. i wanted to be a voice actress, my mom said i have no talent, but yet she never heard me voice act. she said icant sing, but she never heard me sing. my mom wanted to be a singer she couldnt acheive it, because they country she grew up in was very poor. so know i want to go to university, my family say i will never make it, and didnt let me apply where i wanted. they say i wont be anything when i grow up, so i dont want to waste my money paying for ur programs, which are like 30 dollars to apply too. they think im going to work at tim hortans all my life. and i dont even know where this came from. I NEVER failed my courses in high school before. i passed every course, obviously math and sciences i was weak in, but still passed them. and i never plan to fail a course, and they tell me we';ll see if u even pass high school first, wtf.? i mean my average like last year was maybe around 74? like in te 70's. i mean its not high but i have a chance to bring it up. sure i suck at certain things, but i still manage to survive. my whole family always discouraged me, never encouraged me, my family is a drama family, so i grew up in an extremely negative enviornment. know i really losr hopr of my future, i have dreams, but am too tired from all this madness to make it true. im yelled at by my mom when i kinda ask her lets sit down and let me tell you m y feelings, or tell me what do u not like, when i ask her she gets angry, she doesnt sit down. i feel hated, i get so angry know because i feel so alone. dont suggest moving where i live paying rent is extremely expensive, im not even done high school yet. i dont knowwhat to do anymore. im so alone. i only have one friend on msn who i can talk to, but i cant live like this forever. my mom had a bad relationship with my dad, so shes thinks all men are assholes and i will suffer too just because im a girl. she steroptyped girls as house servants which hurts me. i even got abused before, rare, but im sure it was abuse and not spanking when i see it. both parents ganged up on me last year 2008 like in november or something, i tried running away, but didnt work.  i turned 18 last month, and my dad looked at me like he wanted to hurt me, but i told im not to touch me im 18 know so ya.

20090128120033AAAb2lD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my girlfriend/ex?	I reached my limit today for answers so I figured I'd ask one. Logically I know the answer to this but I'm a chump so here goes... (it's a long one)      I met my last girlfriend about 9 months ago. I'm 22. She's 19. We hit it off extremely fast. She's bipolar. When she drank (including the first night we started dating, one week after we met) she became a nightmare. She began calling me different guys names, yada yada, and I became upset. I wasn't angry at all I just told her that I was upset and told her that the more she spoke the more she was hurting my feelings and asked her not to speak to me. She got angry that my feelings were hurt and decided to punish me by trying to make me jealous... it made me sick. At that point I could put her into a category of woment that disgust me. But I decide she was drunk, people make mistakes, it happens. She seems really open and fun in general... I'll work through this. This one scenario pretty much defined our relationship from there on. She was horrible when she drank (although she stopped coming on to people and remembered my name...) and I would be punished if she did something and I got upset. And I do me upset. Not angry... feelings hurt, saddened, upset.       I gave her the speach that I know give all my close friend. Honesty is everything. I told her that without trust there was no relationship and if we had that everything would be fine. I didn't think it was a problem because she was so open. It seemed she always said what was on her mind. As it turns out... it was a problem. She'd lie about anything. Even the smallest things like "have you seen this movie?". This is yet another trait that I absolutely can't stand. I couldn't care less that you haven't seen the movie... you're not a better more attractive person in my eyes if you have... stop trying to impress me and be honest. But it never happend. After several months of begging and going over the same speach I told her that I gave up.       What this meant was... I was done trying. I was done being the sweet and honest person that I am when I'm with someone that I care about and trust. When I'm with someone that treats me like dirt even... but in time if the trust is gone there is no more actual relationship. She told me she'd change. And I told her I'd wait for it. But I warned her... without trust I'm basically a jealous, angry, jerk. I cared about her but I wasn't going to let her walk all over me. I wouldn't be happy, I would be miserable until you change like you say you will. And she agreed.       Now it's been months later. We can go a while and be fine but the second she lies to me or intentionally tries to make me jealous (fortunately it's only verbally now...) and I get upset. She flips. She proves when she's angry that she hasn't changed and she proves by saying things that go totally against what I've told her about me that she doesn't trust me.       The only reason I've given for her not to trust me is to give her too many chances. I'd say that I wouldn't deal with something and then she'd do it... and I'd deal with it. I feel like I'm being punished for sticking around. Because I lost credibility when I said I couldn't take something and I took it.       Can this be repaird? I was warned several times about dating this person before we started. And I've been told I was a moron several times for sticking with it. I know that I'm worth more but I unfortunately care and stay when I shouldn't. Should I cut my losses? Or should I believe that people can change... and that since I think I'm worth changing for she would.       I've answered questions just like this myself... I don't think it's really right to ask people to change... but what if you're asking them to be an honest trusting person? I guess I can't follow my own advice. Any other words of wisdom? I'm leaving the state in a few months. I've decided I'm leaving without her. Wow... sorry for the lenght. :P

What exactly makes a friendship between a guy and a girl any different from a relationship, as in actual boyfriend/girlfriend?

Would that be just a friendship and how do I let her know I want just that? She has a boyfriend now and I'm afraid if I try to ask her to hang out  that she will be freak and wont be my friend anymore. Please help.

20090128114003AAh8oWC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it to late, to have a chance with him?	So the guy i like, is like in love with this one girl and she really likes him back, so it will only be a matter of time before they start going out(i just his Ms. to see something and his staus said in love). So yesterday i ran into him alot and he kept saying hi to me. About at the end of the day when i was in the same class as him he kept waving to me then once wrote "Hi" on his hand and held it up to me. Then at the last period of the school day i was walking to class and i heard him say my name so i turned around and he was like hi. So i said, hey we should hang out sometime. He said where and i told him he should come to the movies with me and a bunch of other people i know and we talk about it for awhile untill i got the my class room then i said " I dont know, call me sometime and we will figure it out. But then at the end of that class i walked right into him and he was just looking at me but didnt say anything. Then my friend turned around to tell me he turned the lights off, well she was in front of him and he didnt even look back at me. Then he was out of school today when i know he is not sick because he just got over the flu. So do i still have a chance with him? If i do what do i need to do? and was saying we should hang out a good move?

20090128122519AATI0gw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Signs That He Knows I Like Him? ?	Okay, so my friend's boyfriend has been 'kindly' threatening me that he'll tell the guy I like that I like him. I've been nervous of his reaction more than him actually knowing that I like him. For reason that are:    He might have a girlfriend.    He might not like me since the last time we talked he was dating my cousin's friend and that we didn't get a long that well - I've changed a hell of a lot, sex was on my mind like 24/7. Still is, but I'm much more mature about it.    He could go "Err, She's fugly." Which is what I'm worried the most about.       What are the signs that he knows? I haven't asked my friend's boyfriend has he told him.
20090128122040AAL4yta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he cheating on me?	Ok, after sex my bf got up to take a shower. When he was in the shower I just laid in bed. I looked over a say what I though were his boxers between the head board and the mattress. It was a sock, not his or mine. When he got out of the shower I asked, "who's sock is that", he it must belong to some girl I slept with, WTF. Then he laughed and said he didn't know. I said it's a girls sock, he said is it a girls sock or a little kids sock, he has an 11yo boy. It was a girls sock and then he said that it must belong to his roomate and he likes to throw his stuff in the wash with my bfs. There have been other things that make me think he is cheating. He has several girl friends that I have never met. I want so badly to trust him, but its like the excuses are becoming more and more not to.

20090128120010AAsmGB5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think that he likes me?	I'm thirteen years old in the seventh grade, and there's this guy in my class that I've liked since last year, sort of fifth grade too. The only thing is, I can't tell if he likes me too.      Our lockers are right next to each other, and a lot of time he'll start talking to me during locker times, and we're in a lot of the same classes too. And in gym class, a lot of the guys are jerks if a girl can't do something right, but when I missed the serve in badminton, he told the  guy who was trying to take it so he could serve to stop, and thenhe suggested another way to try serving (it worked). When I go on AIM, if he's on he starts IMing me right away. And he always ends conversations saying he'll see me later or something along those lines. He said hi when he walked past me in the hall. There's other girls who like him, but he doesn't pay much attention to them and doesn't seem to like them. He doesn't know that I like him. Do you think he likes me?
20090128133148AANbyCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(guys ages 13-18) how do you flirt?	Okay.. so everyone pretty much knows how a girl flirts.

But she broke up with me for some reason.    But now that im in the  9th grade,and she is to.   I still have a BIG Crush on her. And I heard she thinks im Cute   and stuff. I want to ask her out on Valentines Day. Is that a good idea to go out with a girl who broke up with you?
20090128115626AAoiFc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, whats a compliment that you'd love to hear your girlfriend to say to you?	what could your girlfriend say to you that would be the best compliment ever?

20090128120135AAPL3jF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he jealous??????????????	im 19 and i will downgrade any comments that are disrespectful.    anyways, ive been seeing this guy (call him D) but i also like his best friend.    D's best friend was over last time i went to his house, and we were flirting a little. Then me and D went up stairs so his best friend thought we were "doin somethin".    So last night I call D's best friend up and I start talkin **** to him so get him agravated. And then he says "well ill just let u and D have ur alone time... whatever u guys be doin"   So my question.. do u think D's best friend is jealous?   Obviously u dont kno, but what is ur input?
20090128134245AArIHuP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Nice compliments to give to guys?!?	I want to let this guy i've been 'seeing' in group situations know that i like him. We're dating - but in a platonic sense because we're both a little shy and awkward alone together. We like each other, but we're trying to get past the small-talk and first date thing.   He's really nice and always happy and always smiling. But I don't really want to just say "i like you because you're always happy and friendly".       I'm kind of hoping for some non-awkward compliments that don't leave us smiling in silence because we're so happy that we like each other.   Sounds weird, i know.    We need to move on from this shy friend thing because we both want to date each other. Any casual compliment suggestions??   Thanks,      Sarah. ^_____^
20090128134730AAQemF9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys - when you look at a girl...?	when you walk down the hall guys, what is the first thing you look at when a girl walks past you??????    guys ages 14-16
20090128135650AArpXDt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are guys turned off because im Christian?	Not to sound show-offy or anything, but im fairly attractive. And whenever i start to talk to guys and get to know them, as soon as they find out im Christian, they just leave. And i was wondering if you thought it was because they know i wont do anything sexual with them or is it just me. o and the guys i talk to arent jerks or anything, they seem pretty normal.
20090128130953AAIS8p1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me, i need opinions and do you think he is worth it?	i know i asked this last night but i found out some things that makes it complicated.     so he is my guy friend. we talk about nearly everything.  these are some of the things that make me think he may like me as more then a friend:      -he opens doors for me/lets me go before he does    -when i ask him what he got for a question in chemistry he'll get really close (like we're touching close) and then look me in the eyes when he explains it too me.    -whenever i hug another one of my guy friends (who is gay) he'll get kind of jealous looking and come over to stand by me.    -when we walk outside to get to class and it's cold, he'll get closer to me (but only if i mention how cold it is)    -and after 2nd period he walks me to my next class.        okay, but i found out he likes this girl (who used to be my friend, but choose to be immature and hate me for no reason...literally). but i could never picture her dating him b/c she's a total ****** to everyone, and he has facial paralysis. (she's really into looks instead of personality).   plus her best friend just broke up with him a few weeks ago. and she would not do that to her friend, (i hope she still has morals like that)      is he worth it?

20090128143631AAVg4ZF	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I allow alcohol in my home when my alcoholic father is coming for a visit?	I've always had a rule when my dad comes he can't drink in my home or be there drunk. Usually he visits sober or after his rehab, but this time he wants to come and he's not doing well. While expressing this to friends and family they think i'm ridiculous for this rule, but I feel like if I allow him to drink I would only be an enabler. What are your thoughts and why? : )

20090128121107AAq1S82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with having a crush?	Okay, so I have had this huge crush on this one guy for about two years now. I know that he doesn't like me like that, because whenever he talks to me, it is just on a "friendly-level". Anyways, I love writing poetry, and I wrote a poem about this situation. I'm not going to give it to him, but I just wanted to see how others think that I should fix it. (Remember, this is a work in progress, but I just want opinions now). Thanks for the help, and enjoy!          Love Never Fails      I remember those mornings,   Gazing into the mirror –   Wondering if I was beautiful enough,   To steal your attention away for a moment.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Love never fails in the end.      I remember those afternoons,   Peering at you from a distance –   Hoping that you would notice me,   And strike your flawless smile my way.       I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Love never fails in the end.      I remember those evenings,   Looking upon my bedroom ceiling –   Wishing that I was in your thoughts,   And you would stay in my mind forever.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Love never fails in the end.         All comments and suggestions are welcomed, and thanks again! <3

20090128133658AACrc3D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok so, I met this girl about a year ago while I was in 7th grade and she was in 8th. I talked to her on the bus and around the school but that was about it because we didn't have any class together. Over the summer I asked her out and she said no. Now I got rid of my glasses, got a better hairstyle, and dress a lot better. Now she's 15 and I'm 14. Occasionally we see a movie together and on Sunday she asked me if I wanted to see one and I said yes. She changed her mind and said if I wanted to come to her house and hang out and watch a movie and I said yes. While we were watching the movie, we sat on a couch and over time just got closer and closer until her head was on my shoulders and my elbow was touching her breast and she didn't do anything about it. So after I had dinner with her parents and hung out for a little bit more I left. Also during the movie, she got a text from a guy saying 'I luv ya'. I'm also wondering if she has a boyfriend or if he's just a friend. Does she like me?

20090128131244AAWD9cF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What if i like a girl but i'm ugly?	I know that looks should not matter. But hey, who could deny that it all started with physical attraction first right? so i kinda like this girl, she's outgoing, cheerful, talkative and just have positive aura around people. i'm somewhat the opposite, i'm quite, shy and introverted but i think i'm nice, open doors to people and somewhat humorous (not very). problem is i think my face is ugly, or maybe unattractive. no i'm not hideous like having having crooked teeth and badly scarred face, but features of my face make it unattractive. I just don't know if i have a chance with this girl, she is kind enough to laugh at my jokes and smile at me at times. but i couldn't imagine her liking my physique, yes i know that would be shallow, but i'd also like to be physically attractive to her, should she become my girlfriend in the future and any of my guy friend can beats me easily in this department. i feel like i'm not good enough and i can't offer anything to her (i'm not talented in music/sport either). please help! i need an honest answer, not an answer that will make me feel good?

Usually after a fight, or during our previous breakups, I am the one to run back to him and call him asking for forgiveness.      This time though I did not call. I figured he would call me, but he hasn't yet. We did work with eachother last week Friday and Saturday, but we did not talk to one another or even look at eachother.      I work again with him this Saturday, and I want to say something to him. I still have feelings for him and I want us to try again.      Would it be a good idea to confront him, or should I call, or should I just let it be?

Hey, i havent spent much time with my girlfriend within the month and a half that we have been together, it seems that her excuse it that she "isnt feeling well".  when shes not feeling well, its enough for her not to want to hang out with just -me-.  but when her friends want to go shopping, or when shes invited to movies, shes fine.  im invited to the movies as well, with her, but i want to have some alone time with her, because we literally havent had any alone time.  i know she wants me to kiss her, (i havent kissed her yet it would be both of our first kiss ever).  i dont know if i believe her when she says shes not feeling well, since it always seems to happen when i want to hang out with just her. somebody please tell me if this is normal,( the feeling crappy) or do you think shes just scared to have her first kiss? idk, i have told her that i have tried to kiss her, but i dont want my/her first kiss to be in front of 6 people. what should i doooooo?  :(
20090128120309AApjfQb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stay or should I go?	Ive been with my baby daddy for 3 or 4 years and things were great until he convinced me to move back to my home town which is NY and we lived in NC. So me and my 1 year old son packed up and left and we've been here for a year now and my son has gotten use to the place. Problem is my baby daddy wants to get married and wants me to move back but I already met someone new and he makes me feel good about myself( something my baby daddy never did).He always tell me how pretty I am and how much he likes being around me and that he loves my curves and etc. And when im with my baby daddy all he says is how much he wants me to lose weight for HIM! Granted I was a whole lot smaller when we met (140 lbs) but he doesnt realize I had HIS baby so theres no way im going to just go back to a size 5 after giving birth and now I am a lil bit thick(160lbs) but he should see past that and love me for me instead of always telling me to lose weight. He's not a 10 himself I wouldnt even give him a 6 but I dont go around telling him to get plastic surgery to fix his ugliness. Anyway my main concern is my son and whats best for him. See I grew up with my dad and my baby daddy didnt grow up with his so I would think that would mean something to him but IDK. I just dont want my son to hate me later for the decisions I make. As of right now I want to be with the guy I met in NY and not my babys dad. But like I said IDK , im scared of making a mistake, if I didnt have my son I would deffinielty be with this guy but I want my son to at least experience life with his mom and dad in the same household. Im sooo confused, im falling in love again and out of love for my BD. What should I do? My new guy says all the right things but is it real?And honestly I dont even have ANY feelings for him anymore.He use to be my world and now I dont even care about him in my heart.I love him because he gave me my son but thats it. I already no if I never got pregnant we would have broken up a long time ago.What do you guys think is best for my baby?

The song is called "Red Rose Romance" or just "Romantic" (i havent decided which one yet.      here are the lyrics, and i copyright these lyrics as mine, so please do not take, (just something i gotta say, not trying to be all up tight)      She's such a romantic,   always looking for a happy ending   lost in translation   i cannot escape what i dont run from   she's something to admire   dont you dare try to put out her fire      Chorus: (hold each word for a bit while singing)   Moonlight kisses, rooftop dances   take her breath away      She loves my cliche's, bed of roses   takes her breath away       (while she loves my cliche's... portion plays i have in the background singing this:)      Say you want yours, but you cant start over   so everyone hand in their four leaf clovers   i'll never be one to be superstitious but   this is getting a little out of hand,    when everyone gets there happy, but her      ( i would like words to go hear after "takes her breath away", like a catchy chorus ending.. please any ideas romantic girls???)      next portion:      her library of movies, everything from "you had me at hello"   she's the first shine of light, when the sun begins to rise   she wears her colors oh so well   Nobody, wears blue quite like you do...      (should i say right here... "you know its true"? or is that too plain?)      then goes back to the chorus again...   so any tips, ideas or just ideas of what you consider romance... i am not yet satisfied with what i have made, i need more words to point out how "fairy tale", peaceable, romantic this girl is, although not un realistic, naieve, or gullable ya know.. please girls give me what your thoughts on romance is.. i hope i am not being too confusing with my question here.       also if you want to hear a sample of the song im making i can send a sample in a email if you want, but thats your choice, i know how some people are a little paranoid and safe, so i dont want to pry its only if you would like... thanks again all.

20090128112647AAnBwdK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My experiment continues. Read on to help!!!?	So to give you some background here…I propositioned this older girl at work (in her early 40’s and I’m mid twenties) It didn’t go so well, as I got shot down. Anyway, we both still work together and have never mentioned nor acted like I ever made an *** of myself. (She is pretty cool btw! Not to mention REALLY HOT) We always got a long as friends and kept on doing fine for a while until I decided that I need to take another crack at this BUT I have an uphill battle to climb in order to do it right. My game plan has consisted of the following   - Cutting back on time I spend with her (I am very busy at work now so that’s not hard)   - Not coming out as much to work things (she always asked me if I’m going to these things and again I say no most of the time but work/other commitments is also a reason for it)   - Still being pleasant but keeping conversations short      This has been going on for over a month now and the results so far have been this.   - She NEVER calls me to go for coffees anymore. The last few times she did ask she also seemed more timid when coming over to my office to see if I wanted to go   - She is becoming very short with me when we catch each other (almost seems as if she’s angry with me now but that could be my imagination)   - She has however brought me cookies from lunch meetings every now and again but hasn’t for the last little while         What I need to know is this…   From anyone’s honest opinion is this working or am I just pissing her off? Maybe something else that I’m missing here? Keep in mind I’m not giving her attitude at all. I’m just not as chummy and available as I was before. Can this work? Where should I go from here? Any ideas would be appreciated! I would love to see the male and female perspective on this one!      P.S. I know relations with people you work with is a bad idea but please for the sake of this question throw that out the window. She knows me well enough to know that if anything ever happened I would never say anything and I know that she wouldn’t.

20090128134419AAqbHmR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is sex supposed to hurt after the first few times?	I've had sex 4 times before i met my boyfriend, last time i did was about 4 months ago. Then today me and my boyfriend decided we should take our relationship to the next level. Unfortunately as soon as we started I was in so much pain i had to push him off me. We tried 3 times and i was still in massive amounts of pain, I actually started crying after the 3rd time. Then we changed our position and I just held on to him tight and breathed through the first couple of seconds, then the pain started to go away and eventually it was bareable although still uncomfortable.      I would say he's above average size but he's not huge, and I wasn't exactly dry although there wasn't much foreplay.      I'm worried, I hope it's not always going to be like this? It was almost unbareable but I love him so much and didn't want to disappoint him so I just made myself get through the first part. I don't know if it's because I've hardly done anything with anyone for the past few months or what?      Anyway, I was just wondering incase there's something wrong with me. Thanks x

They are both working on fixing their relashionship (My mother DOES know about the cheating) But they don't know that I know. My mother isn't herself though, always in bed and sometimes e-mails my dad saying that she shouldn't have had kids, though she loves us more than anything she just isn't stable right now. I can't talk to my sister, because she is only nine, and if they break-up I am going to be moving.          So what do I do if I have to leave my town, friends, and my family will be split up? Then what will I have left ?

20090128132601AAq0gLI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to date your good friend's ex girlfriend?	I'd appreciate your opinion on this situation:      One of my closest friend's (who happened to be my roommate for the last year and a half of college) just told me that he went on a few dates over winter break with my ex girlfriend. She broke up with me about a year and a half ago and I was pretty upset at the time as we'd been together for like 8 months. Anyway just two months later I started another relationship with a girl I'm still with and love very much.      About two months ago my friend (roommate) asked me what I thought if he dated my ex. I was kind of vague as it bothered me but I didn't want to let him know. Finally I let him know that it did bother me, that most importantly he'd risk our friendship for a girl he didn't even know that well at the time. I just feel strange about the whole situation. I don't really have feelings for my ex anymore, but the thought of my friend making out or sleeping with her just makes me pretty upset. Also the thought of them talking about me isn't something that I like to think about.      Am I wrong to feel this way? Is my friend wrong to do what he did? I really wish I didn't feel this way and that this didn't bother me, but it does and that's why I told him it did. Him not really considering my feelings hurts the most. Thanks for the input!

20090128114626AAf5lCs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I wouldn't even call this a story, but it's about love and it's short...please read and enjoy:):)?	She always dreamt of a handsome, presentable, respectable, sweet, loyal and amiable man to come, perfect as a prince charming, to whisk her away to the life of no troubles. He had to be perfect, in order for her to fall in love with him...perfect. And then, a transition, a change happened in her deepest thoughts and she ended up falling in love with a man, who was flawed even more than a regular human; she never realized how...        Her whole life she hated men like him, egoistic, selfish, cynical, proud and rude. But he had a certain edge to him, a certain craziness that attracted her; something she’d never experienced before. Though rebellious, he was outstandingly intelligent, and goal-oriented. Most important of all though, he was mysterious, with a sarcastic smile frozen on his face as if to hide his real feelings, his real self.               Real feelings...ah, yes! That’s what intrigued her the most. With her wild imagination, she always knew what his real thoughts were. She always believed that his heart was good, that his soul was pure, as that of a child’s...yet he had to mask it all because of his fear of life and his fear of love. At least that’s what she thought, until he did...fall in love.                   He fell in love reasonably, though not with her; reasonably meaning, with a girl that was of good looks, fortune and intelligence and. However, she played him like a fool, took his heart and butchered it...it was the first time anyone ever saw him cry. He never realized the one who really loved him, was right in front of him; the girl who was ready to take his flaws and make them her epitome of perfection; the girl for whom he meant the world. He pushed her away, thus making himself even more perfect than before...staying mysterious, unattainable and wild.          what do you think??

There's this guy in my school that i really like. he knows i like him too, and than over the x-mas holidays, i sort of got over him. and than this love thing comes and than goes. so the thing is; one my friend who is his close friend told me that he likes me. and it made me feel all good inside. the guy i liked told me that he was going to go to the close friend's house. so this was on a sunday, i was on msn in the night around 7:00 and the close friend said that the guy i liked is still there. and than i said ok. so than the guy i liked started talking to me, and said that he likes me but he cant date, and than he said that he wants to be friends. so i said ok. and than the next day in school, it felt all awkward. i went up to him and asked him abt the convo on sunday, at first he said he didnt know what was going on and than after he was like ; ohh .. and he and i had to go. now for the past couple of days, when he's around me he talks louder and wants me to notice him. the thing is he doesnt talk to me, but he talks louder when around me. and sometimes i walk past him and he would just look at me, and than if he sees me glance at him, he would pretend like he never looked at me. before he wasnt so loud around me and he wouldnt care if i saw him or not, but now he does. so what does this mean? should i talk to him? is there anything i have to talk to him abt? im really confused :(

Well it didn't. But then a few weeks later I thought I started feeling something for him, so we started going out again and then things were good...Until about two days ago, when my best-friends boyfriend questioned if me and Charlie were really going out since it didn't seem like I liked him at all. This was a shock to me, and then I started thinking if I really  did like Charlie at all. I talked to my bff about it and she even agrees that it didn't seem like it, and I know I don't. I was just confusing a family sorta love for him with the real thing or w/e. So now I hurt him twice...and he really really liked me, and i feel completely horrible. I decided to never see him again, cause after all I did it would be better just to stay away, so i can't hurt him anymore.  I know what it's like to have someone you like but doens't share the same feelings still be your friend and bring their gf around, and i dont really want Charlie to feel that same horrible bad feeling i had felt for so long, so I thought leaving would be best. But...now im starting to think...Would leaving and not speaking to him ever again really be the right thing to do, even if he still wants to stay and be friends?
20090128112328AAZVDg5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it every time I think of him I get really nervous.?	It's like every time I think of him no matter what I get really bad butterflies in my stomach. Even if he's there or not. I think of him often, and if he's there with me I can't talk because of nervousness!    And every time I listen to George Strait or any love song I get SUPER nervous.   Is it love or just a crush? my bff is his sister and she told me he's making me brownies for Valentines Day because I gave him a box of brownie mix.      I really like him and my bff told me he talks about me alot so I think he likes me too, but I don't want to show I like him because I don't want us to break up for the dumbest reason the my bff gets mad at me and we never talk anymore.       What do you think?   Should I?   Is it love?

20090128151201AAwIzvh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I feel guilty; is this wrong?	Ok- I recently started viewing porn with my husband, and it's something we both enjoy. I'm very much in love with my husband, and over the months we've shared many fantasies with each other. My fantasies have never involved other men; however, lately, due to viewing the porn, I seem to get aroused by the very well endowed men. My husband is by no means small (he's just fine, but he's not huge), and I'm very satisfied with our sex life, but I still get turned on by seeing a big member when we watch porn. Should I divulge this turn-on to my husband? I have no desire or intention of having sex with another man, or having a threesome, but I do like to see such large male genitals. Should I feel guilty? Do you think most men could handle hearing this from their wife without feeling emasculated? Are their any other women who have the same turn-on, or is it just me? I'd love to be able to discuss it with my hubby and would love for both of us to look at BIG men on the internet. What do u think?
20090128132334AAgNGlv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Anybody like to help me with this situation?	I like this guy in my Music Technology class, and I spoke to him by mistake today (thought my friend was in the recording room not him). he's a seemingly quiet metalhead type person (talks to friends not other people really) =s  but a nice looking one... i mean I was listening to Slayer - Raining Blood and he went "who's listening to Raining Blood" and there were three people in the room:  me, him and his mate who had just walked in and I felt like saying "Duh the person with headphones in" but I noticed when I first joined that class (I switched) that the day after I was walking with my friend Sarah past him (I did it on purpose but subtley making it look like I needed something from Music) and his friends looked at me and then he did. It was weird.    And I must seem really violent, because everytime I walk past him, I threaten my friend Jamie... jokingly but even so I don't mean to but it happens.     today when I said about 26 words to him, he didn't look too interested, but that could be me misinterpreting...  but he didn't sound off with me.      Also I can never make eye contact because if he even looks at me I look away, I think I made eye contact for... 6 milliseconds then looked away... I'm not too good at this thing, am I?      I do try to smile and say hi but it's difficult....      And I always seem to screw up when he walks past... like I'll drop my folder, or walk into something, or swear.. and I've heard nobody likes a violent boyish girl (and I am kinda boyish... like one of the guys)      Any advice that could help me at all?

20090128125053AA5ecXx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I could use a little help here, please?	Okay, so my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost four months now. Everything is going great, or so I think. I have this feeling that she's cheating on me. Now, it might be me just being paranoid, but I can't shake this feeling! For starters, the sex. We don't have sex that often (about twice a month). A couple of months ago she got this series of text from her friend from home. He's always wanted to get into her pants (and maybe already has), and always sending her dirty texts. Last night, after we had sex, we were messing around on YouTube. I picked up her phone to take a picture, and a text from her friend popped up while I was about to take a picture. The text said "I wanna hard **** you tonight". She knew I saw it and I just shook it off. This isn't the first time this has happened. He texted her a month ago, going off on how I could never fill her sexual appetite. (This was out of sheer jealousy). I don't think she's told him to stop these texts. And what's more, I don't think she's told her ex that we're dating. He still has feelings for her. Am I going paranoid?

I'm not getting all emo and manic depressive but things are really **** atm and I feeling really down about things.  I'm 17yrs old, never had a real girlfriend, very short for my age, over weight (but not obese), unfit, unhealthy (on going medical condition that makes it very hard to get fit), acne, have massive self esteem and confidence issues.  All I want is to meet a girl that I can spend time with, to love and care for but every girl I meet that I like is either taken, extremely shallow or just plain messing with for their own amusement.  And if I do meet a girl who is nice enough to treat me nicely I end up coming on way to strong or not strong enough and i have a habit of saying the wrong things at the wrong time.      How am I suppose to meet a girl when I can't even flirt, have the confidence to even approach a girl and all my mates are all tall, tanned, extremely fit, pretty much all round great guys and on top of that most of them are really smart and going to Uni next year or joining the army

20090128135501AAVyJlh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am unexpectedly pregnant.  My boyfriend does not want children.  How do I tell him?!?	My boyfriend adamently does not want children but I have recently become unexpectedly pregnant.  I was on the pill but became sick (stomach flu) and the doctor said it likely didn't stay in my system long enough those days and threw off the whole month.  We used other protection but apparently not for long enough.      I was in shock the first couple days (I've always been on the fence about having kids) but I am sure and certain that I want this baby and will do my best to be a good mother.        HOW do I tell this man I am pregnant?  He is going to be so upset.  He is a good man and I am sure he will try to be a good father but I know this isn't what he planned for his life.  I'm terrified he will resent me for it.  I don't want that because I really love him.      Feeling scared.  How do I break it to him?

20090128121436AAcYvuJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys and girls, honestly...?	Do u stay friends with your bf/gf once u break up? I just cant seem to do it. Mostly because it hurts so much to just chill with them knowing we are not together anymore. I mean if u went out for a couple weeks and u never really connected with each other then ya because ive done that before. What if was a long lasting relationship where u were just so close to them. Am I wrong to feel this way or maybe being friends with them will get us back together one day?

20090128133217AArQNZ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	*Ladies, if one of your good guy friends liked you and you didn't feel the same way, would you still kiss him?	I told one of my good friends (a girl) I had feelings for her. She just broke up with her boyfriend 4 days before. She said she night have had feelings for me before, but didn't anymore. Then she said she still wanted to hookup. We locked lips and she pulled me closer by my ***** and kissed my neck. Then she said she wasnt sure about hooking up because she wasn't sure the things I was saying were true. She wasn't sure that I actually liked her. She was a little tipsy and I was pretty drunk. Would you even start to hook up with a guy that liked you even if you didn't? If a guy friend had feelings for you, and you didn't, would you do that?

Mind that, these men, have spectacular careers.... but no loves in their lives. Is it because they feel like they need to be settled? or start settling?

20090128115908AAamh8c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best way to break up with her?	Ok so me and my gf live together and we have been together for about 2 years and I thought we were going to spend our entire future together but that changed. Now that she is going to college she never makes time for me anymore and she's always flipping out about little things. Also what is really bumming me out is that we used to have passionate activities together i.e oral and manual(never had sex though). Now all of a sudden she is telling me that even though she liked me giving her oral and manual she said she doesn't want that to be part of our relationship anymore and she also said that the only time we will have sex is when we are married and decide to have a kid and what sucks about that is she said she doesn't want to get married until we are like 30. Also she said that she wants separate rooms even when we are married. This is just to much for me and I want out, I still want to be friends but I can't be in a committed  relationship with her any longer. How can I tell her this with out mentioning the sex and all her flaw's(cause I have no other place to live; her father pays rent).

I was on my way to class/lunch at college and I notice this girl I have seen times before that I always thought was very cute and wouldnt mind meeting. We were walking separate ways towards each other, and she had coffee in her hand (not relevant). Of course I looked at her, she looked at me, took a sip of coffee and smiled at me and I smiled back(I didnt even know I smiled until after she walked passed me). Now I dont know why she smiled at me. I think she has seen me before but never smiled. I dont know what to think. I keep thinking that she looked at me and smiled cause she is interested but then I think she just liked the coffee or saw someone else (though there was no one there) I would feel stupid to try to talk to her if it didnt mean anything. Thoughts? Thanks

20090128142544AARM3Cs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In love with a classmate...Help!?	Last year, a girl came to my class. I always liked her as a person and looks, but I never saw her differently...Until now!    So here it goes: 3 days ago I had a random dream, which included her in a very random way too. The same day, we had a Religion class, and our topic was love... The teacher said at a certain point that it's bad when someone is very sensitive...And that quiet girl started a very nice conversation, defending sensitive people! I just had felt something more about her... The next 2 days until today, as I was more interested in her, I noticed that we had much things in common...We are also both very shy and calm people.  She and other some other students were to leave for a trip to Switzerland (in CERN) yesterday... I was a bit of miserable that I wouldn't see her...And the flight was cancelled... So I saw her again! But today they really left, and for some reason, I was too uneasy... I know, too much drama, but I had to say these, because I think I'm in love for the first time!    So, I want so much to approach her. I have strong feelings for her, and I want to make her feel special. We don't talk much, but I know she likes me (at least as a character, I don't know about appearance, but I think I'm good :D)... Everytime I ask her something unimportant and obvious like what's our next class she starts talking to me a little more... I'm not sure though this means she likes me.    Now there are some problems though. First of all, how do you approach a girl that is different than the others? I always liked girls just not suitable for me, that I did have nothing in common with. She is not antisocial or anything, but she is shy, like me, so I'm afraid to "just ask her out". Secondly, she is on the girls basketball team, and that makes me afraid of other guys doing the first step, because she is very cute. And lastly, as I said before, we don't speak much, so asking her out would be something she wouldn't expect... How can I approach her more?    Thank you very much... I need and appreciate any kind of help from anyone... This girl seems to be my first real love, so I need your help!

20090128140715AAuN4G1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I ask a gal if she likes me?	Okay. So here is my question. A gal I know lets call her Tina.. haha, cause that is her name... Well ive been friends with her for like 8 months. Like really good friends. Were both pretty outgoing but when we talk on the phone its so hard to get a conversation going. which is wierd because nomally we both talk alot. which has lead me to believe she also likes me back. Now when we get a common friend (Jessica) to 3-way with me and her then we can talk for hours. She lives around 2 hours away from we but we talk at least 5 hours a day on MSN.. Now Im at a point in my life where I am willing to move out to her little town to date. Shes 2 years younger than me but still.. shes very cute and funny. So im just wondering. Is there any way to ask a girl if she likes you without really asking? Get what I mean? I dont want to ask her just to find out she doesnt like me back. But im sure theres a way to sorta "trick" her into asking me if I like her. Any suggestions? Im really desperate here...

20090128135639AA6njQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this situation hopeless? Should I move on?	Okay so last summer I met a guy that was my first true love. But we had a two year age difference. So when school came along we split. He has other girlfriends now (I know from my neighbor who is the one that introduced me to him) and I really don't know if he remembers me. I have been having dreams and I've been crying because each dream of him brings back a memory. I know I sound pathetic, but I've never had any trouble moving on in the past, until now.     I can't be with any other guy without thinking of him. If I do ever see him again I'm more then sure he will have moved on completely. I'm afraid I won't have a chance. I have no contact with him because I erased his email, myspace, phone number, all when we split because it hurt me so bad. What should I do, wait it out? Or move on? If move on, what is the BEST way? Thank you.

20090128142039AA84kGq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think that my boyfriend wants an asian woman instead of me?	Ok where to begin....My boyfriend is white - i'm hispanic and we've been together for over a year now. We were talking the other day and I forgot what started this conversation but he said something like "Alot of men have a thing for asian women" (and i said jokingly) "Oh like you?" To which he looked away and said "I only love you" which really made me paranoid, the fact that he looked away and said that. Also, I was on his myspace page recently (I hardly ever go on myspace) and there were all these good looking asian women on his friend list (and no they were not porn bots they looked like real people) sending him flirty comments. I'm really upset about this. I'm not gorgeous or anything and I feel like he's just staying with me for the time being until someone better comes along (I've felt this way for awhile now, seeing his myspace page only confirms my suspicions). I've been crying nonstop for a whole day now & I'm thinking about breaking up with him...I'd like to know everyone's opinion on this. Thanks
20090128135834AANP3Fw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OMG!! Does he like me?!?	There's this guy and I know he thinks I'm hot because a lot of people come up and tell me he's told them that. He's told people he's going to marry me and he'll make comments like "you'll look amazing in that picture" he also thinks I'm perfect. But he's never asked me out, although at the end of last year he said we should hang out over the summer but I never gave him my number or anything.    Last year a kid on my friends bus who was on the soccer team with this kid asked her if she knew me because he kept talking about me.    I'm just really confused cause he hasn't made a move, he's a pretty popular guy but he comments on other girls being hot.       I thought just because a guy thinks you're hot it doesn't mean he likes you. So, I'm just really confused...

20090128143456AAgsJzD	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I got to my mother in laws 80th birthday party?	I haven't seen her for a few years. Everytime we get together, I feel so uncomfortable around her. My brother in laws get together and talk among themselves. The women help out in the kitchen, including myself. Sometimes it can get boring.      You're allowed only two drinks, but thats not the problem at all.My mother in law always mentions that she has stayed sober for several years. Brag brag brag. Who cares? Good for her and to each his own. But that doesn't mean everybody else should be like her....like she thinks and says they should be.      My husband also borrowed money, a couple thousand from two of his brothers, to make mortgage payments and still hasn't paid them back. Its kind of awkward being around them because of this.      I usually end up sitting by myself anyway, mostly because I have a hearing loss. I really like my brother and sister in laws. They are like family and we share many good memories. My mother in law, just makes me feel uncomfortable. She always has.   What should I do. The party is this weekend. I'd rather stay home and have my husband and kids go together.

20090128141401AABx1Xx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go for a "different type" of guy?	You could say I love being outside, and thrills. I love roller-coasters, bungee jumping, ab sailing, horse riding, camping etc. etc... My dream holiday is literally some sort of outdoor experience, I love heights and the great outdoors. My idea of a great date is a mountain hike. The guys I generally go for are generally similar, overconfident beings like myself. However, recently I have been dating a guy who seems to be the complete opposite. I took him on my favorite walk, and a few hours later, when we reach the top, he collapsed, inanimate, at my feet. He is easily scared and quite a nervous guy in general. If you had to compare him to an animal I would say rabbit. Should I stick around, and see what happens? Or cut it off. Are we too different?

We have talked about having kids and the fact that he wants a few in the very near future. Can I stay with this man? Do I have the baby and say *&%$ him and get the $10,000 plus a month in child support I just calculated? I am in complete shock and can't tell anyone! I don't want him to know that I know what he was planning until I know what I want to do.

He then proceeded to beg me to reenact the movie with one of my girlfriends, not to mention film it. I am always open to trying new things and making my boyfriend happy and he does the same for me, but I am quite uneasy about this. Should I just go for it or be offended that my boyfriend would even ask for me to do this?
20090128144530AAkrJmT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please give me a different viewpoint on this situation with my husband and I?	My husband joined the Army a year ago. Before then he did not work. He is not much help around the house. I believe he has a computer addiction. Last night he played for over six hours straight. He prefers his computer and video games over anything else. He doesn't pay a lot of attention to our daughter (2 years old). If I don't initiate even getting her dressed or taking her outside to play, he will leave her in a diaper all day and stick her in front of the tv. When he joined the army I didn't want it and I only agreed under the premise that I could go to school while he was in. He claimed he wanted to stay in and retire. Now he is already pushing me to go in after his contract is up. He says he wants to stay at home and take care of the kids (we found out a few days ago I was pregnant). He does nothing now so why would that change? I really think that he just wants to sit on his *** and play video games all day. I imagine him not changing diapers and ignoring the babies while he sits on the computer, which is what he does now. I love working, and I would love some adult companionship--I've been a stay at home mom for about six months and it's already driving me crazy. But I am terrified that my children will be raised in front of the tv and after my husband sits there without working for 3 years he will be useless. Just like before he joined, the longer I worked and let him stay at home, the less he did, and the lazier he got day by day. Am I completely wrong for thinking like this? I said this to him and he told me that if 'cleaning and kids were his job,' he would do it. Why don't I believe him?

I met this guy twice & on the second meeting we hooked up (no sex, just kissing and making out). Now I don't in anyway want a relationship just a friend with benefits. The reasoning for that is because awhile back my fiance of 9yrs committied suicide and I am still so much in love with him. I just have needs I want taking care of without the strings. So, my question is should I just come out and tell this guy how I am feeling or just wait to see if we see eachother again and see what happens?

I told her about it tiring to be honest and she said I "kissing another female is just as bad as having sex"     Are both acts the same? I didn't go all the way because I know once you go down that road there is no coming back, so at least I had the decency to think about our future.

[cause i was reall upset when he dumped me.]   i said yeah. and i already know.   then she carried on telling me about her, so naturally i thought it was the truth. so i text her back that i still loved my ex and that i really missed him and didnt want him to have a new girlfriend.   then when i went into school today (2 days of being off and getting the info), my Bestf. came and said it was all a joke and that he said he just wanted to see how i reacted. so    i said why didnt she tell me when she was textin me    and she said, oh he was using my phone.   i said: did he see that text from me blurting out i still loved him??   nd she said yeah. then my ex came and said sorry for 'pranking' me. and i said did you read the message from my phone that said i still loved you and stuff?   he said : yeah, it was sweet.   and i said. humph. who else saw?   he said : jhon and fred.   apparently he showed them and they lectured him about how nasty it was that he was 'pranking me'  and stuff. the he said awww and sorry to me.    does that meen he is just sorry for it or he is sorry for 'not loving me' anymore(thats the reason he dumped me)   and doescare about me still? he kept asking me if i was ok?? he does all the time and stuff.      he also dumped me cause apparently he was getting hints that i didnt like him anymore,         no nasty/offensive answeres please ;)

I'm 14...and I met this girl at a camp about 6 months ago...I really like her...she's beautiful...I never thought I had a chance with her...but she actually asked me to be her date for date night! we talk every now and then by text messages...      we havn't talked in a while...I'm thinking about sending a message that says "when i count my blessings, I count you twice"      what do you think?
20090128142030AAqob61	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to not like most girls?	I'm 16 & I'm definently straight.      Whilst other people my age are like 'oooh' when they see somebody reasonably pretty/nice, I don't. In fact, I have liked 3 people since I was 12. I don't think much of moth girls... some are nice & some are pretty but I really couldn't be fussed.      I could *probably* have been out more if I could care. But I don't, and even if I met a girl, I move away a little to make sure theres no chance of me having to say no, because tbh I'm not interested.      It's a problem because I want to go out with somebody, but I won't be happy unless I find somebody I actually want to go out with....      What do you people think, and why do I feel like this?

20090128132230AA30mY0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell if a Non-Flirty Guy Likes You?	Okay, so I like this guy, and I've had a huge crush on him since last year (we're in eighth grade). My problem is that I just can't tell if he likes me, or who he likes at all, for that matter! Because he never flirts--he's just not a flirty guy. I mean, he's friendly to girls, but a bunch of his friends happen to be girls (I'm one of those friends), and he just isn't a teasing flirt! And I don't think I could really flirt with him myself, because really, I'm a fairly good friend of his and we're all in the same group (yay ^^ I make him laugh a lot), and most girls don't flirt with him either. He just isn't that type of guy.      Thing is, I've looked up plenty of guy advice, but it all happens to be for guys that flirt a lot! But I don't think I could get this guy by flirting! :( And I'm beginning to think that it hurts my chances of us ever getting together that we're friends.... :(      What should I do?

20090128115906AAwAqWT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My parents believe i had sex?	me and my boy friend have been dating for four months. i just turned 16 and he'll be turning 16 next month. i love him unconditionally and he loves me the same way. things are really strict at my house. my siblings always run around and follow me and my boy friend. and my parents never allow us to be alone. so we usually go to his house because its less strict.   the other day my boy friend came off the school bus with me to my house while no one was home so we could get that alone time. we weren't planning on having sex, and of course; my parents and his parents found out. they are all convinced we had sex. my phone got taken away and i can't see my boy friend for a week. above all that, my parents are devastated. they refuse to look at me and don't want to talk about it. i really hate being home because i see my younger siblings and how innocent they are. and the fact that my parents think i've done something sinful like that really upsets me. my virginity is sacred to me and i don't want to give it up.   what i'm asking is, how can i convince my parents that i've never had sex? how can i get them to trust me? how can i gain the trust of my boy friend's parents? should i break up with my boy friend? there are so many other questions running through my head.      thank you for reading and thanks for the help.

20090128142550AA9KGiO	Family & Relationships;Family	Sticky situation...any advise?	So I live in the dorms and Im on academic suspension and my parents pay for housing, food plan, and my tuition and I haven't told them I'm on suspension yet. Its already the second week of school and they think I've already registered and am attending classes. They keep calling asking me when I'm getting my books because they need to pay for them and I've just been ignoring their calls, trying to get up the courage to tell them I'm not even in school. I know this is unbelievably low, and I don't know why I can't just bring myself to tell them. i think its because I've gotten myself in so deep already. But every time I get the nerve up to call them and tell them, I start crying and hyperventilating and don't even know what I'm going to say to them because who lies to their parents like this? How do I get the nerve up to just tell them, no matter how much trouble I'm going to be in?

20090128114848AABx4py	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There is a guy that I really like!?	There is a guy that I really like. We were in the same class last year and we went out and him and my ex boyfriend got into a fight over me and they have not been good friends since. I just got a new phone two weeks ago and my dad would be really mad if I got any scratches on it. The guy I went out with before I went out with the guy that I still like took my phone and dropped it and got two scratches on it and the guy I like took my phone away from him and told him to not do anything to me like that again. Later on that night about twelve guys came up to me telling me that my crush wanted to ask me out but he couldn't until next year because his mom won't let him. His mom made us break up in the first place. The guys said the same thing about him wanting to ask me out last summer. I think he might be able to go out now but I did not think of that then. So should I ask him out , wait for him to ask me out in person , or when his friends say he wants to go out with me say yes? Please tell me what you think.                                                                   Thanks,                                                                              bcsgirl101:-)

20090128112634AAiv4pQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or not?	There's this guy that I've known for about 3 years. I'm a Capricorn and he's a Taurus, so it's no surprise that we click so well together. Although I've known  him for quite some time, we've never really hung out or got to know each other. Recently, I went to visit my best friend, who happens to be his next door neighbor, and when I looked in his eyes, something just clicked. We started talking and I noticed that, I've never felt this way before. It was crazy because he said the same thing. He said that he knew it sounded crazy, but he thought that he might be in love with me. Even crazier, I felt/feel the same way. He lives 50 minutes away, though, and I have some serious trust issues, so I told him to move on. But I keep coming back. And we talk periodically, and he says he still has feeling for me. But for the past 3 days, he hasn't texted me back...except for today when around noon I got a picture message showing something I would've rather seen NOT over the phone.    I just don't get it.  I mean, does he like me, or not?  I texted him back after he sent that, and he never texted back.

20090128111956AAHCRp1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies what you think of this.?	Ok I met a girl last weekend at a local bar and we danced and that was about it. This weekend Fri and Sat night we danced again and talked a little. The thing is I have been trying to figure out if she is giving me signals that she wants me to go after her. For example, when the bar was closing Fri night I was standing outside on my cell phone and she comes up behind me and just rubs her hand across my back in a gesture like saying good bye, she not say anything. Then Sat night after the bar closed I at a diner eating with my friends and she comes in and ends up sitting behind me, even though we not say anything when I got up and went and paid my bill and I come back to my table she puts her hand out to kinda touch me. I know I should have at least got her number at some point, however she was with friends both nights and I never really got her alone. However, are these hints that she is throwing out to get my attention

I never used to even think twice about it but ever since ive been with my current boyfriend it seems to be drilled into my head and a huge issue with me. Once because I couldnt please him he got up when I fell asleep and did the deed. He wants anal, and things like fisting and others i just wont enjoy and cant uphold. According to him i dont have big enough boobs, im not tan enough, and of coarse not skinny enough.  Im not fat or ugly, i used to think I was pretty hot. Apparently though not as hot as a porn star , he has broken his promise about looking at porn at least 4 times, I got to the point that I just let him do it without an argument, it still hurts though. Friends tell me every guy does it , is that true , will every guy i have in the future look at porn and break promises???

20090128115202AAAWCha	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Relationship Advice! Any help appreciated!?	So this is the jist of my situation:      My ex-boyfriend of nine months and i broke up in the beginning of january because he's studying abroad, we planned on this way back in september. There were other problems in the relationship (which were sprung from the abroad sitch) that played into it but we really didn't get a chance to work it out because of this. And he's an extremely closed person.      He left a couple of days ago, and we're trying to remain in contact and remain friends during this time, but I can't help but think about him coming home and us getting back together.      Basically I'm just asking for any advice on how to handle this. I loved him and he had feelings for me, but he knew he was leaving and it caused trouble. I want to know if I should completely get over him, cut off contact, and move on. Or get along with out him, but be into getting back together when he returns. I'm just wondering what you guys would do in this situation. Any help would be great, I'm kinda lost here, lol.

20090128115900AAEqWXv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is There Something I Am Doing Wrong Sexually?	My guy and I have only had sex 2 times in the last month or so. It is amazing to me. He pays so much attention to my needs and he knows exactly what to do without me telling him; however there is a problem. He does not ejaculate when we have sex. He cums from masterbating but not from oral or physical sex. I dont know what to do. This is frustrating me because I want to equally satisfy my man. We have sex for hours and I *** many times. I want him to feel twice as good as he makes me. When I talk dirty to him when we have sex, I get a lot of heavy moans but never the result I am looking for. We have even eliminated the condom for added friction. What can I do to fix this? Does anyone have any other ideas?

20090128120025AABZIjh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have some guy problems. ADVICE PLEASE?	I'm a freshman in high school and I kinda like this senior. We flirt and talk during school whenever we see each other. But he doesn't try to talk to me after school like on myspace or facebook. Still whenever he sees me around he tries to talk to me. So I don't know if he's just being a flirt because I think he is one.      There's this other guy in my year who I think likes me because we were flirting at the basketball games, and we even kissed but he hasn't asked me out because he says he's not sure if I like him or not. I found out from a friend. And I'm not sure if I do, so I don't know if I wanna go out with him.      I like the senior more, but I feel kinda stupid for liking him because I don't know if he likes me. I mean he's a senior. What should I do? If a guy's interested in you, he'd try to talk to you after school too, right?

20090128121115AA1c5jf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are young Sikh couples relationships kept secret from their parents?	I'm a white guy who's recently started seeing a Sikh girl; obviously her parents don't know, I'm not allowed round the house etc.      Is it usual for young Sikh couples to not see much of each other, and maybe even have to keep their relationships a secret?      We see each other outside of work maybe once or twice a week (she does stop at mine once a week, but not every week) and text and speak on the phone a lot (phone bill sucks..) - I'm not used to this sort of thing, and (with respect) find it somewhat childish!??      Apparently, her sister has been seeing a white guy for a few years (although they live away), so I don't think race is a massive issue, but more a "relationship" would be the problem..      Any ideas / experiences?
20090128121131AAgv2mi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend's secret!! please i need advice!?	My boyfriend (bob) is 23. We've been going out for about 3 months now. I swear we are soul mates. I am best friends with his sister also. I thought we had a perfect relationship. I knew he had problems with pills before (oxycontin) but he got help and swore to me he hasnt been on anything since we've been dating. He swore so many times. I believed him with all my heart. Recently him and his best friend (joe) got in a fight and he ratted him out that he still does drugs. ( joe told his girl, who told me) I told her i KNEW bob wasn't on drugs and she told me just be careful. I questioned him numerous times, and it wasnt until his sister informed me she thought he was that i actually dragged it out of him. We both cryed and i felt so betrayed. He tells me he's never been high around me, and he only does it maybe once a week. He promises he's stopping now that he knows how much it hurt me, but still i can't trust him anymore. I don't think i should end the relationship (i love him way to much and me leaving would make things worse for him) Does oxy have bad long term affects? (like will he die early from it?) Should i end the relationship? Any advice will be awesome. i'm just so heartbroken i need some help. THANKS!

20090128123557AA21D67	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do u think? Does he like me?	Okay, well theres this guy, he is not really cute, but he is HILARIOUS and really nice (no he's not like a nerd lol) which is my type. So i'm basically looking at his personality. Well my friend asked me if i liked him so i asked her if she meant as a friend and then someone else started talking to her and ignored me. I tried to bring it up again but she would always change the subject, so i tried to let it go but i couldnt. Anyway i was thinking that he asked my friend to ask me that, cuz a lot of the time he seems like he likes me, but then after i thought about, I was thinking. Maybe they thought i like him so they asked me just to see cuz he doesnt like me?? IDK! im confused and dont know what to think! haha do YOU think he likes me??      When i say he acts like he likes me i mean like he does stare at me at times and he would like talk to me when there are others to talk to. Like one time i asked if he lost something and he was like yea can someone help me find it (but he was looking at me when he said it) also since im on the hip hop team we were watching the boys dance and at the end they do a kick and he like pretended to kick me. Stuff like that...

20090128124206AAPa5mg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i just a booty call?	I had a crush on a guy that I work with. I never thought we would end up seeing eachother because he is the security guard, and so if anyone at work found out, he could lose his job. Well, i guess he didnt really care about that, because he ended up asking me out and i was so excited i couldnt contain myself, but i made sure not to let anyone at work know. it was going to be our secret. on our first date we hit it off very well. I loved his personality and his affection. I made sure to let him know that i wanted to take things slow. After about a week of getting to know him, we ended up having sex. Yes, i know it takes two people..and so i was kind of mad because i felt as though he didnt really respect me. After that, i was feeling the waters just to see if i was being used. Some days, he would take me out to the park, or to dinner, and other nights...he would try and get me in bed. Actually it seemed as though MOST of the time we would hang out, he was trying to get in my pants. So honestly i dont know. Theres nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with someone you are attracted to, but theres a difference between love and lust. There was even a time, when i would come see him when he wanted to see me, but yet when i wanted to see him...he was busy. Even yesterday, he told me he would be able to spend the entire day with me, then didnt call me until 4 in the afternoon. Now, im starting to think he's talking about our sex life to his co-worker because my friend overheard him talking...and i confronted him about it and he reassured me that they were just talking about something else. Last night, he took me to the beach, and i spent the night. Again, he tried to get in my pants and i told him i wasnt able to because it was that time of the month for me. Then he started saying things like "well, i guess i will just have to wait around for a week." Then when i left his place this morning he said, "see you in a week." and he laughed, but he never said he was kidding, so again..i dont know lol.       So the point of this is, is for me to find out if this is going to turn into a real relationship, or does he just care about sex and sex only? blahhhhhhh.
20090128124222AAw78Yv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many dates until you try to step it up too "relationship" status?	I'm 18. She's 17. It's not that i'm inexperienced, but she is very shy and all the girls I have been with before are pretty bubbly. Is the fourth date an ok time to ask her if she would like to start a relationship? All of the previous dates went very well, and I think we have a connection. I just don't want to move too fast.      Also, we havn't kissed yet. I am planning on kissing her next time we get together, probably this weekend, but would it be better to kiss her before and then ask her how she feels, or to wait and ask about the relationship first?
20090128124424AA9P2nE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested, love to hear ur dating advice!?	Hi, I have recently started dating again and would love an outsiders viewpoint on a current situation. As a woman I dont really believe in pursuing a man, I think that if they are interested they show it, now I recently kissed a friend of a friend, since then my friend and him have became super close, I know its platonic, no man stealing here, she is dating his roomate, the thing is, he calls her all the time, meets up with us when were out, and when he asks her to do stuff most of the time he asks if im around. now we have kissed a few times since the first, always when were out at a pub with a few too drink, when we are out he seems interested, but then he doesn't call.. he has texted a dew times but nothing like how he calls my girlfriend.. do  u think he is into me? and i should try to maybe call or show him im interested, I thought the random make outs showed him enough but I'd love your input.. thanks!

20090128125108AAzcpU0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Uh...juggling two guys? help? [:?	Okay. So...   I've liked this guy (I'm in 8th grade) since the beginning of the year - so it's been, basically, half a year. He's like...hyperactively shy (like...know what I mean? he's really energetic and happy, but he can be shy too), but I know (and I've heard from other people, including his friends, my friends, our friends, etc.) that he likes me as well. We're good friends, too, and he usually walks me down to my bus after school.       About a week ago, I went to a party, where I spent time with one of my friends (who I didn't know that well before but we were acquaintances). I hung around with him, basically alone, -flirting a bit -, for about 7 hours. We were texting and talking on the phone for a few days after that, and yesterday, he asked me out.   I kept thinking about the guy I liked already (let's call him Jack), and I talked to my friends about it. I kind of weighed my options - just liking Jack and never doing anything about it, or saying yes to (let's call him Sam) Sam.      This morning, I called Sam and I told him yes. But then afterwards I started to regret it. I realized that I still liked Jack, but I'd already called Sam and told him yes. I didn't want to break up with Sam so soon, but I know it's not fair to him if I keep our relationship and still like Jack.       So any advice? (and i'm sorry this is so long)      Jack: nice, sensitive, energetic (really), optimistic, a tiny bit shy at times      Sam: outgoing, athletic, not that nice, flirtatious

He's been cheated on before and i know he's worried i'll cheat on him, which i'd never do. he also says that all my guy friends want to do is get with me, and thats not true at all. i'm getting sick of this and i don't know how to make him calm down. any suggestions? i really don't want to break up with him, but i want to see my guy friends, without him being upset.

20090128130832AAC6J0C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me or am I just an Idiot?	I'm 15 and a couple a month ago. I met this girl on the bus who is two years younger than me. Anyway about three weeks ago she was with her friend on the bus and she randomly asked my name and lots of other questions. Since then she always smiles at me in the corridor and talks to me on the bus. When she is with other friends they usually tend to giggle when they see me. Also last week I passed by at break time and I notice that she blushed when she saw me. Do you think she actually likes me? or is she and her friends just laughing at me?
20090128131732AANUTEp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this situation with my guy friend?	My guy friend and I have gone through so much in the last four months, its almost ridiculous.     Last week he asked me if I honestly liked him and I said I didnt know and asked him if he honestly liked me and he said he didnt know. He then asked me what I would want to do if we hung out and he really wanted to know the answer to it.    I started to like him but I was hesitant because last time we started to like each other he wanted to be just friends.   This time it seemed like he felt different, because he was acting like he did when he liked me, when we were talking.    Well me and him are honest with each other, a little too much at times, but I told him how I felt and that I liked him. He said he didnt know what to say.   That was three days ago and we havent really talked since.    I miss him, I really do, its fun talking to him.  But I dont know what to do. Im so confused.    What should I do?

We talked a lot about things and at one point I started"heading down the wrong path" and she allways tried to help and such. Well a few years after I got out of high school I needed to go back to get some paperwork. Well I left my number for her and we started hanging out. The more we hang out, the more I wonder if she likes me more than just a friend.  We go out and eat a couple times a month, but the more we go out the more she wants to go.  She wants me to go with her to some art thing, wants to go to a baseball game with me, wants me to come to her house so she can cook me dinner.

20090128134841AAeNmEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When women stare what does it mean?	Some women give me that look that ends up being somewhat awkward because it is a long gaze and they do not look away. I look away when the gaze passes 2-3 seconds and even after that, they are still staring and this is mostly accompanied by a smile. The typical thing that happens: they stare and as soon as I catch them, they look away with a smirk. I do not read clues well. Guys would you just go up to them and start a conversation…this normally happens when they are with their friends and I figure going up to them would be a bit odd. What do you think and what is going on?

20090128134846AAUus0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Girlfriend Doesn't Want Sex Anymore?	Hi, I have been dating my girlfriend for about 4 months now. We are both 17. Yesterday we had a bit of a falling out and she says she no longer wants to have sex. We have had sex about 25-30 times now and she just suddenly decided she is no longer comfortable with it. She says she cares about me a lot and I believe it. She also felt that I was pushing her too much to have sex, and I guess one could argue that. However, I never have begged her to do it or anything. We also only would have sex about twice a week or so. So, I'm trying to figure this out. Is it that she is no longer attracted to me enough to have sex, or have I just pushed her much? I want to have her to be happy, but I know you can't just "stop" having sex.

20090128141404AAWmebG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I let my boyfriend hang out with another girl?	The first time I heard of this girl was when I saw that my boyfriend had commented on a bulletin she wrote.  The comment was supposed to be flirting with her, and when I asked my boyfriend about it he denied it at first then when I told him I saw it he said he didn't think it mattered since she didn't comment back.  Then I progressed to get jealous but only because he lied to me about it first.   After he persuaded me I didn't care about her anymore and I forgot about her.   Then randomly my boyfriend told me that he talked to her alone when they were at a school function.  He apparently told her that I was really jealous of her and that I thought he liked her.  I got very angry because I felt like he went behind my back and wanted to talk to another girl about his problems.  I had already told him I wasn't jealous anymore BEFORE he went and did this.  I asked him why and he said he was trying to make a point that she didn't like me so I shouldn't be worried.  I told him that it was stupid because I had already gotten over it and that it didn't make sense to me why he would go and talk to the girl in order to convince me he didn't like her.  I didn't care if she liked him, only vice versa.   So then this made me very hurt and jealous again.  I knew I was probably only pushing him away with my jealousy but I could not control it.  What he did just did not make sense to me and only made me think he liked her again.   A few weeks later he told me he has been in groups in class with her because he felt bad about kicking her out.  I understand that and I didn't care.  I told him I wasn't jealous.  I thought it was nice of him to be so nice to other people.   Then he told his friend he could be in the movie his friend was making then asked who else was going to be in it.  The girl was going to be in it and he knew I'd probably get upset but still agreed to do it.  I didn't find out that she was going to be in it a week later,a and I had to find out in a comment from the friend who asked him.  When I asked my boyfriend about it he told me he knew she was going to be in it and still said yes but thought it was okay because I told him I didn't care about her anymore.  I told him I would have liked to hear about it from you and he said he was afraid I'd get upset so he didn't tell me.  Of course this made me feel like he was hiding things and hurt me.  I asked him not to be in it because it would make me nervous and uncomfortable for him to be hanging out with another girl we have had previous fights about, even if it is with other people there.  He said he wouldn't at first, then told me I could come, or it could be at my house so I could "supervise" him.  I told him no thanks because she has a reputation for flirting a lot.   I told him very clearly it would make me uncomfortable but he keeps asking me if there is any way he can convince me to let him do it.  I even told him he can do what he wants, he doesn't need permission from me and he doesn't even have to listen to me.   I told him if it would make him happy then he could do it, but that he should just know it would hurt me a lot if he decided to and I wouldn't approve.  He said he wanted my permission and I told him there was no way I was going to agree to it.  I brought up the example that if I was to go hang out with other guys that he didn't know, and he said it would make him angry and he wouldn't let me do it.   He keeps asking me if he can, and it is annoying because it makes me feel like his mother.  It also makes me feel like he cares more about this movie thing than he does about how I would feel if he did it.      I know I'm being insecure, but I'm also about to leave for college this year and this is not helping me have 100% confidence in him.  I know he's not immortal or like Edward and I love him more than words describe, and he just says things the wrong way a lot.        Should I tell him I'm okay with it?

20090128141634AAztdIi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it bad that my girlfriend talks a lot about other guys?	So my girlfriend has a ton of guy friends. Its very intimidating when most of them are very attractive guys that a lot of girls i know want. so my problem is that she is always comparing me to them. ill tell her that i think its funny that she laughs a certian way and she will come see me the next day and tell me she was hanging out with one of them and they have the same laugh. or she will tell me that i remind her of them that we have the same personality. i cant do anything without her comparing me. the other problem is she brings up other guys she has been with that broke her heart. ill do something or say something and she will start talking about them. for example we were at the theater and a kid was feeling up this girl and i made a joke saying i should do that too. than she started to tell me how one of the guys she used to be with always did that. than she gets mad about it and calls them dumb. she always brings them up and claims she used them and she is over them but she doesnt seem to be over them at all. im scared she is only with me because im not the type of guy to use a girl and leave and she is just channeling all her feelings to them through me since im a safe place for feelings. idk what do you think should i walk away from this because she told me she loves me and every time i ask her about all this and if she really does she gets sad and mad at me. so idk what do you think about all this.
20090128141722AATqbEP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stay with him?	This is pretty long, but I really need some opinions.   I've been dating this boy for a while, about 4 months now. Well, during the beginning of 2008 I also dated him then, he's very religious and tries to convert me all the time because I am not. Also, sometimes I will spill out a cuss word if I'm quoting a movie or song or just pops out, and he lectures me why I CANNOT cuss. Also, he tries to control the way I think. I said once "I would really like to go to Europe sometime in my life." He says "No, you don't. Once you go to Europe your whole outlook on life changes and the value of life goes down."   He makes me so mad. He's overcontrolling and I hate it. Also, I'm only 17 and am not looking for a spouse yet. I want the dating experience of high school, but if I stay with him I will never get it. If I stay with him then I will never know what it's like to actually "date" someone, I have crushes on other guys but can't pursue them. I would break up with him, but I'm scared he won't find anyone else. He says I am the only one for him, the only one he will ever love, but he's not the one for me. I have told him I love him. Ever since we got back together he has been great, but maybe it's just because he was trying to keep me from leaving. But after a bit he went into his old habits. We've talked about his control issues and he says that only does it so I can live a better life. How does he know what's best for me? So, should I stay with him, or should I move on?

20090128141953AAazuMG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is his problem?? Serious Only...?	My ex (we only broke up a week and a half ago) have been dating for three months but everything moved really well and really fast. Last Thursday (he brought the subject up) we were discussing wedding stuff and getting married. Friday night he told me he thought we moved too fast and he was not ready to be in a relationship right now. It broke my heart. He asked me to give him a little time to figure out what it was he wanted...either to let go or hang on...that he didn't want to mess up and let his future wife walk out of his life. Well, 3 days after we broke up I found out I am one and a half months pregnant. I told him, and said for him to take some time to figure out what he wants because I dont want him with me out of pity for the baby. He told me last night that he can't be in a relationship with me but he wants to be there for our baby. I do not want him to because it hurts me so badly seeing him, yet not knowing what I did so wrong. He tells me he just isn't ready to deal with a relationship right now. How can I either A. get him back or B get over him. Oh..and he has issues at work that are stressing him out really bad too (he is a narcotics detective.) Advice anyone??

Today i was in class and i sat on the row next to her one chair behind her.  All throughout class she kept looking at me, and i would look back, she smiled at me.  I'm guessing she is interested which is good because i think she is fine as hell. Now i want to try to talk to her but not sure how to go about it, i don't want to seem awkward i want it to go smoothly.  I thought about not showing up to class one time and then asking her for notes the next class (she has excellent notes, highlighted and all), is that a good approach? do you suggest a better one?      Thanks in advance   G
20090128144205AARqMwx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does This Make Me The Slag?	Simply?   I was in love with him, we were together a while but he cheated and left me for someone else. i was upset and angry but i let lie.   every now and then he'd ask me if i still thought about sex with him   (while he was still with this girl he said he loved) ... i kept on refusing to talk to him about it thinking it very wrong how he could be insensitive.   6 months later they split up, he started to talk to me about sex again... this time i did talk to him about it... knowing he wouldnt hurt anyone, but also because i knew i still missed him.   over the past week we went off in his car and we talked about everything, and we ended up doing a few things sexually but never all the way.   i realised he was probably using me to get over this girl, which wasnt fair on me or him because i had done exactly the same when he left me.   i told him what i thought, and he was very angry with me, and i told him that the only reason i had agreed was because i missed him...   he hasnt spoken to me since.      i'm feeling guilty, but i couldnt not be honest with him?   how bad is the thing i have done?

20090128144752AATcJHO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boys when drunk? can they be genuine?	*********So sorry about the lenght********   I quite like this guy he happens to be my close friends brother.   When at my friend’s birthday last year we cuddled a little, like with my head in his lap and him stroking my arm playing with my hair.   Ever since iv liked him but didn’t think much of it as he is my friends brother and i don’t realy see him often or at all.   Last weekend my friend invited to me a family party we went to hers first and her brother and his friend came over and we just had a laugh and talked, this is the second time id met her brother but it felt like we had known each other for ages. I didn't even entertain the thought of anything happening between us, it wasnt somethig that occured to me as i didnt think he would be in to me anyways.   We all went to the party and it was so much fun and we all had fun and me and her brother took lots of pics of us together, a nice one with his hand on my face.   We went back to my friends brothers as it was closest and we were all pretty drunk.   My friend and his friend went to bed and we stayed up on the couch in his living room listening to music and talking, somehow we ended up lying on the sofa together cuddling and talking. It was really nice. Then we kissed a lot. I asked him if he was just kissing me or did he actually like me and he said he did like me.   I also gave him options to leave by saying that he could join his friend if he wanted that he didn’t have to stay with me and he declined i asked again later on and he laughed saying he was fine where he was.   We fell asleep together occasionally waking up to kiss.   He was so affectionate, cuddling me and stroking my arm and back and pulling the blanket over me if he thought i was cold.   Then later on he couldnt sleep and then i started to shiver, so he got up and said i should slip in to bed with his sister as i was cold. ( was that him getting rid of me? he did it in a nice way and we were both super sleepy)   And that was it.      In the morning his sister wanted to leave and the boys hadn’t got up yet so i didn’t get to speak to him.   I told his sister that we kissed and she wasn’t too impressed at first which i understand but by the end of the day she seemed ok, it was awkward when it was mentioned but she didn’t seem annoyed at me instead making jokes about it. I do understand that its her brother but i let her know that i do actually quite like him.   So now its been a couple of days, i didn’t get her brothers number as we left in the morning but im assuming if her brother does actually like me then he would have asked his sister for my number..   I haven’t heard anything from him so is it safe to assume that he isn’t in fact into me then?   Im not sure what his etiquette towards girls is so i don’t know how to take the lack of contact...   I don’t want to ask his sister as i don’t want things to be awkward between us as i love her to bits..      Is there anything i can do?      He is the first guy iv liked in a long time and i realy liked that night it felt great. He seemed to like me but then again we were drunk and he is a boy so perhaps im mistaken..      Do u think he likes me or am i just being stupid?      Anyone have any good insight...im aware this is boring but i cant be subjective which is why im here.   Thanks in advance...

20090128145718AACMWQB	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my step mom mentally abusing me?	Okay, Well Im 13. My parents got divorced and now my dads married to another women.I hate this women hes been with for 4 years now.   I've liked her the first year. But the past 3 years, She's been doing stuff . Like telling my dad i go and do drugs, And how im not normal ,And how no one likes me . Shes told me i laugh like a cow. And That i look like a ugly tomato when i cry.A couple of months ago she pushed me into the shower while i was doing my hair in the bathroom. Everything fell on top of me, Which really hurt. She immediately took the thing that fell on me and put them where they were.She didn't care that i was hurt. But then i got up and fell down crying, She got scared that something really bad happened to me , so she called my dad and told him i fell and hurt myself. I yelled really loudly shes lying! But she told him that she didn't do anything, and she also told him i was the one treating her like a slave. So then an hour later my dad called me and started yelling telling me i need to stop acting like a little kid,And he told me how i was not going to get anything unless i stop being a bad person towards her. I didn't know what to do 'cause i didn't do anything to her.Then months passed by and she was still telling people things about me. Right now i haven't talked to for 2 months. But yesterday... Yesterday everything changed.   I feel like a total different person now, Shes pregnet by my dad... He lied to me that she went to a dentist appoitment but she really went to see if she was pregnet.About 15 minutes ago , Her daughted( my step sister who is 7.) hit herself, and blamed it on me. My step mom came in and started yelling at my sister saying stuff like " I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT IF SHE TRIES TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU , I TOLD SHES NOT NORMAL SHE CAN GO F*** HER MOTHER CAUSE SHE ISNT TOUCHING YOU" I ended up pulling out about 10 pieces of my hair, at once cause of how stressed i got. Im tired of this going on. And i think i need help.   What should i do?   Call the police?   Talk to a therapist?   Or move to live with my real mom ?

The marriage failed, but I am getting ready for round 2. I still have my old dress.  If I were to alter it, take the sleeves off, shorten it, dye it, change it overall... would that be bad luck or bad taste or bad karma.. or anything like that? Let's hear those opinions!

20090128150936AA2f7WC	Family & Relationships;Friends	My crush rejected my friend request on myspace, should I ask a friend to investigate why?	OK: read before answering. I'll try to make it as simple and short as I can.      Kay. About 4 weeks ago. I send a friend request to my crush, and he doesn't accept. Not rejects it. Still, everytime I checked for about 4 weeks, "Currently Awaiting Approval." He didn't really know me sooo well, but he did know my name and knew who I was at school.      2 days ago, I check, and still, "Currently Awaiting Approval." Yesterday I didn't check, neither earlier today. But today, the teacher called on him to do an errand and pick a friend to do it with him. He jokingly called my name, and saw that I blushed. He apologized, and the bell rang and I left a little flustered, cuz that's really pretty much the first time he really even talked to me, so I felt a bit happy. Even if he was just being sarcastic.      Checked today on myspace. Rejection.   No "Currently Awaiting Approval."   Nothing.       He didn't sign in yet today, so I take it he rejected it yesterday, before that thing in class even happened.       My best friend has him in 8th block today. Should I ask her to ask him why he rejected it? She would willingly, she loves being nosy. Like, have her go "Bethany saw that you rejected her friend request, and she told me this morning, sounded like she didn't care, but she's my friend, so I want to know why."       What should I do?   Thank you SOSOSOSO much<3       Also important to add: I know for 110% fact that he knows I like him. That's another long story, but point is he definently knows.

20090128152400AAg9oGC	Family & Relationships;Friends	My roommate lost her job?	My roommate of 3 months lost her job and her last day is Friday. She is freaking out (as would I be!), especially since we basically live paycheck to paycheck. She'll be able to pay rent on the 1st, but after that... it's going to be really tough for her. We are really young and this is our first apartment and first jobs. She's on the phone crying, asking her mom for money, but I doubt it will work. I feel awful, but at the same time, I'm worried about rent and other bills we pay together.      What can I do to help her through this time, and what can I say to motivate her to get a new job, fast?

20090128151513AAEbpVh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?	We talk on aim everyday, we met each other with a mutual friend, but neither of us talk to the mutual friend anymore and we've gotten close.   He tells me to visit him and we can share his bed, jokingly. He says I'm a great person and that he respects me and he tells me that the things I do are cool and that I'm smart.    I told him that I love talking to him and he said hearing that made him excited.   But sometimes, I'm unsure of where we stand because he rarely asks me about my life, things just come up in conversation, but he hardly ever asks me about this or that. He does ask me how my day was all the time, but I figure that's just standard.   Also, sometimes he won't respond to my IM for 15 minutes and other times he just replies with "lol" and that's it.      Does he like me?

20090128152523AA77ZWw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My fiance wants me to sign a prenup. agreeing to leave with nothing, what would be a more fair compromise?...?	Although we would both like to believe that our marriage will last forever, sometimes things do happen. In our situation, we BOTH agree that my time is better spent at home, which I have already been in the house wife role for quite some time now.  The reason being that we travel alot through out Alberta and British Columbia due to his job.  If I am on the road with him, then we aren't apart for months at a time, we can continue to enjoy each other like we have been for several years, I can have our dinner ready for when he comes in from work, and take care of him and myself on the road just as I do now and also when we are at home.  We do not know if children will be in our future or not, although it may be a possibility at some point.  Of course if we do have a child, I wont be traveling with him but instead be at home taking care of him or her as well as taking care of everything else on the home front.  I would be not be working, because we will live in a small town (Sparwood, BC) with a population of under 3,600 people in Canada, which is almost 2 hours from the next town. Employment opportunities will be very limited. That does mean, I will be solely responsible for all of the indoor and outdoor chores if we choose to buy a house.  At this point we are both leaning towards a modest condo, so that there wont be outdoor maintenance to worry about.  Now,  whether we have children together or not, I am concerned what would happen to me if our marriage fails. If I agree to leave with nothing, then I will have absolutely no security.  I would be leaving behind the home and life we built TOGETHER, whether it was bought with money he earned or not.  What would be a good compromise, that would entitle me to some sort of short term security if our marriage were to end?  I would not want to be supported forever, by a man that was no longer in my life, but I also do not want to find myself in a homeless and penniless situation either.  So what would be a fair compromise?

20090128152305AAEDuYF	Family & Relationships;Family	Me+Cousin Equals??? PLEASE HELP!?	Ok, I have this cousin named Jason. He's actually my third cousin. He's just turned 16 and i'm about to turn 14. We grew up together, so we're really close.       I'm kinda weirded out at myself (and him) cause whenever I'm with him, everything is so great, and i know it's sick, but sometimes I feel like I like him, and the weird thing is, sometimes I think he feels the same way? Although part of me just thinks i'm paranoid, or imagining things.      See, read the reason before you freak out... we've kissed, not like made out just-kissed. But what happened was I was spending the night at his house (not like that, cause i was visiting) and we stay up really late whenever i spend the night. So we started talking, and he's like "we should practice kissing so that we can have experience for our bf and gfs, so i said sure, and we kissed, and i think i felt a little something (but we don't do that anymore, it was a couple years ago) Then one night we were watching tv, and i was laying on the floor, and he was on the couch, then out of no where he got off the couch and laid down behind me and tucked his head like, on my neck, and put his arm around my waist, and we watched tv like that for like, 1 1/2 hours! Then, the next morning, we didn't wake up til like noon, so we got up and we were gonna go to Taco Bell on his electric scooter to go get "breakfast" so he sat on it, and i stood up in front of him, and he had his arm around me the whole time so "i didn't fall off". And he's really nice and stuff, he doesn't harrass me (gross)       And then, we'll talk on aim and he'll tell me about this girl that he LOVES, and said if they get together, he can see them getting married and spending the rest of his life with her. he has her pic on his profile!      So, I think it's just me who wonders now...      What do you guys think???   (i'm being serious so please don't be mean!)

My husband has put me through hell because of his inability to be satisfied with one woman. He has a problem of looking at other women, online, in person, everything. They are always the exact opposite of what I am too. My best friend, I have had feelings for for a long time. However, I always put them on the back burner because I love my husband. Well, it all came out the other night. I told my friend how I felt after he almost tried to kiss me. He was just in the moment and got himself together and didn't, but I felt it was time to just tell him, as I no longer love my husband the way I used to. I have no clue what to do. I want to stay with my husband because I see things possibly getting better, but I love my friend. I am so torn!

20090128152112AALmXTN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can my fiance get his mother to stop being his power of attorney?	Okay, here is the situation.  My now fiance, Jay, has his mother as his power of attorney.  How you ask...okay, I will tell you.  So, back when we first started dating, Jay, had a nervous break down.  He was at a job that was stressing him out to no end and his boss was a straight asshole and was down on him day to day.  Along with that he was dealing with an abusive father and mother, he's an only child and he lives with his mother and his father lives in another state and is just in and out of his life.  They are not physically abusive but they are emotionally and mentally abusive.  Neglect is an abuse and his father neglects and ignores him all the time and his mother yells at him like he's a child sometimes until hes whimpering and shaking like a leaf.  So, he tried to kill himself and told the doctors at the institute that he was thinking about hurting others before taking his own life.  And he was locked up in that place for a while and then they let him go.  When he was released they put him on disability because he couldn't handle working and dealing with life all at the same time.  Jay, already has a list of medical complications and his disability was approved right away.  But when his disability went through his mother was placed as his power of attorney because he lives with her and I was just a girlfriend at the time.  I didn't think anything of it for a while.  But, let me back up for a second and give you the history of the relationship between his mother and I.  Yep...you guessed it, not good.  From the beginning she has been calling me a gold digger and a user because her son buys me whatever I want and he gives me money whenever I ask for it.  If I were a gold digger then why aren't I driving a Mercedes Benz and living in a mansion somewhere because he can surely afford it.  His family is very wealthy...they have houses and cars and boats and land and...well you know what I mean.  So...here I come "miss struggling to make it through school on my own" and she thinks I just want her son for his money.  I don't know any of you reading this and you don't know me so I have no reason to tell a lie...I didn't know his family was rich until well after we started dating.  That being said here is the problem...we are supposed to be getting married in October of this year and his mother is his power of attorney and she controls his money too...whenever he goes to the bank she has to be called so they will release his money (not joking) and if she doesn't approve the amount he can't have it.  I am truly in love with this man and this situation is breaking my heart.  I can not live like this with his mother controlling our lives through her wallet and now his.  She has total control over him now, when she calls he's breaking his neck to get to her and it's mostly out of fear.  I have my own career and I have my own everything without his help.  But what is to happen to us after we get married.  We can't have a joint checking account, I want those pretty little checks with the roses and pretty flowers and our last names match.  My heart hurts every time I think that there is a possibility that he will never be my husband.  I don't know which way to turn and I need help.  Can someone please tell me how to get his mother to stop being his power of attorney?  Even better without pissing her off because Jay is worried about being cut out of the will?  I don't really care if she's mad or not I just want her off.  I can't wait around for his mother to die of natural causes, we are all still young.  I am asking for myself because when I try to talk to him about it he says he needs to talk to an attorney and some other stuff but I feel like he's moving too slow.

She knows that I love her and she said she's too confused to know if she feels the same way back. I know we'd be great for each other. And I know the most I can do now is hope that she'll see me the way I see her. But is there anything I can say/do to help my case?
